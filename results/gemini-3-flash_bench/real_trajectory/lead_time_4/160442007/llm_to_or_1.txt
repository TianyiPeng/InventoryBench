Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 160442007 (3p Sneaker Socks). On-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. The historical demand data (last 5 weeks) shows a mean of 114 units per week with a standard deviation of approximately 14.3. The latest sample (Feb 4th) shows 95 units, which is slightly lower than the average. Given it's mid-February, we are approaching spring, where sneaker socks typically see increased seasonal demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no specific evidence of a regime shift or lead time deviation yet, I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline order that covers the lead time (4) plus the current review period (1). The OR backend will compute the base stock using the provided history and promised lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 139 units with a promised lead time (L) of 4. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (they should arrive in Period 5). Starting inventory was 0, and Period 1 demand was 114, which was lost as stockout. The historical demand samples (123, 105, 114, 133, 95) and the Period 1 demand (114) suggest a stable mean around 114. Applying a standard (1+L) logic, the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (5 periods) is approximately 570. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (including the latest demand point) to capture the base stock level, relying on the default OR logic for safety stock and lead time unless delays are observed. The product (Womens Sneaker Socks) doesn't show an immediate seasonal spike in mid-February, though spring demand usually rises later.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 with 0 on-hand inventory and 275 units in transit (ordered in Periods 1 and 2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have not yet reached the promised delivery date for Period 1's order (expected arrival in Period 5 conclude), the zero inventory is expected. Demand in Period 2 spiked significantly to 231 compared to the historical average (approx. 114). This likely reflects a seasonal shift as we move into late February/early March (spring accessories). I will use recent_N=5 for demand estimation to capture this recent increase while acknowledging historical context. The lead time (L) remains at default as there are no completed delivery cycles to suggest a change from the promised 4 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product (Sneaker Socks) is moving into the spring season, and demand has shown a significant upward shift from the initial pre-game samples (avg ~114) to the observed game demand (avg ~182 over 3 periods). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 502 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, P3). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, the P1 order (139 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. The current demand is much higher than the historical samples provided (114, 231, 203 vs. previous ~114). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volume and volatility. L is set to default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead time deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is Women's Sneaker Socks, which typically sees increased demand as weather warms up in the spring. Looking at the history, demand was relatively stable (avg ~118) in the first weeks, but spiked significantly in Periods 2 and 3 (231 and 203), settling at 138 in Period 4. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (139 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (this period). This will be confirmed in the Period 5 conclude message seen at the start of Period 6. Currently, pipeline inventory is 786 units. Given the recent demand volatility and the spring seasonality, I will use a recent window (N=4) to capture the trend while staying responsive. For L, I will stick to the promised 'default' of 4 until we have actual arrival confirmation.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which typically sees a demand increase as spring approaches and people transition away from winter boots. The historical demand shows a significant jump from early samples (avg ~114) to the last 5 periods (avg ~166). Specifically, demand peaks were observed at 231 and 203 in Periods 2 and 3, followed by a stabilization around 140. We have successfully confirmed a lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (147) exceeded the first arriving shipment (139). To address this, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher recent mean of 166.6 units/period, providing a buffer for the seasonal uptick. I will use 'default' lead time as the promised 4 periods match the observed 4. For sigma_hat, N=5 captures the recent volatility (standard deviation ~44.5) which is higher than the initial samples, ensuring sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts while inventory is built back up through the pipeline (909 units in-transit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 1 onwards: average demand increased from ~114 to ~167 (+46%) as spring season approaches for footwear accessories; Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25), entering the spring season for footwear accessories (3p Sneaker Socks). Demand has shifted significantly since Period 1. The average demand across Periods 2-6 is ~187 units, compared to the pre-game/P1 average of ~114. Recent demand (P6) was 214 units, confirming a sustained upward trend as the weather warms. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has exceeded arriving stock (stockouts in P5 and P6). I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher spring demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock using L=4 (promised) and demand stats for (L+1)=5 periods. Since 876 units are in-transit (P3: 227, P4: 284, P5: 262, P6: 103), the OR backend will order enough to bring total inventory to the required service level, adjusting for the recent high demand but capped by the logic to prevent over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 2-6 average demand is 186.6, up 63% from pre-game/P1 levels due to spring seasonality for sneaker socks.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (Sneaker Socks) is entering its peak spring season. Demand is consistently increasing as seen in the last three periods (214, 285). The current inventory position is precarious: on-hand is 0, and sold units have been capped by supply in P5, P6, and P7. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P3 order arrived in P7). Demand analysis: The average of the last 4 periods is approximately 196, while the last 2 periods averaged 250. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand seasonal window, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the upward trend without overreacting to the P7 spike, while keeping a conservative stance on sigma. The current 'In-transit' of 859 includes orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7, which are expected to arrive in P8, P9, P10, and P11 respectively.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase confirmed: P6-P7 average demand (249.5) is significantly higher than P1-P5 average (166.6), reflecting peak spring seasonality for sneaker socks.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which shows strong spring seasonality. Historical demand has surged: P1-P4 averaged ~171, while the most recent 4 periods (P5-P8) averaged ~241.5, with Period 8 hitting a peak of 320. On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite the arrival of 284 units in Period 8, because demand (320) exceeded supply. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 884 units (orders from P5: 262, P6: 103, P7: 210, P8: 309). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (P5, P6, P7, and P8 concludes). To avoid stockouts during this high-demand spring phase, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current upward trend and volatility, while setting L to 'calculate' based on the stable historical lead time performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Periods 5-8 average demand is 241.5 units, an increase of 41% compared to the P1-P4 average (~171.5), driven by seasonal demand for sneaker socks in April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (2019/4/15), at the height of spring demand for '3p Sneaker Socks'. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: P6-P8 demand averaged ~273 units, though P9 saw a dip to 180. The overall trend for this seasonal item in April suggests demand will remain high (avg of last 4 periods \u2248 225). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P1-P5 exactly 4 periods later. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 990) plus On-hand (82) totals 1072 units, which covers nearly 5 periods of forecasted demand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend aims for a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 6-9) while smoothing out the P9 dip, ensuring the safety stock accounts for this higher spring volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in April: Period 9 demand (180) dropped relative to P8 (320), but the 4-period moving average (P6-P9) remains elevated at 224.75 units compared to the start of the game.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/22. The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which is in peak demand during spring as weather warms up. Historically, lead time has been consistent at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10). Demand in Period 10 was 209, and the 5-period average (P6-P10) is approximately 242 units. However, we are currently facing stockouts (on-hand is 0) because recent arrivals (103 units from P6) were significantly smaller than the current demand level. The pipeline contains 1243 units (orders from P7-P10), but we must ensure the OR backend accounts for the current demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated spring demand (approx. 242 units/period) while maintaining the lead time 'L' at the promised/verified 4 periods. This helps the OR engine set a base stock that covers (4+1)=5 periods of demand (~1210 units), which aligns with current pipeline levels.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is '3p Sneaker Socks', a seasonal item that peaks in late spring/early summer. Current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend from P1 (~114) to P11 (avg ~216). Despite higher demand, on-hand inventory has been consistently 0 or near 0, indicating lost sales (stockouts). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P7 order arrived P11).mu_hat must account for the current demand regime; the last 5 periods (P7-P11) have a mean demand of 245.4 (285, 320, 180, 209, 233). To recover from stockouts and prepare for peak May/June sneaker-sock season, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 and keeping sigma_hat at default to account for April's volatility (range 180-320). pipeline_inventory (1213) is high due to recent large orders (P8: 309, P9: 368, P10: 356, P11: 180), which should alleviate stockouts in the coming periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand confirmed: Periods 7-11 average demand is 245.4 units, maintaining the spring seasonal level established in mid-March. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, 2019. The SKU '3p Sneaker Socks' is in peak spring/early summer seasonality. Observed demand over the last 6 periods (P7-P12) has been consistent with a mean of 252.1 units, exhibiting high levels compared to the start of the year as the weather warms and customers shift to low-profile footwear. Period 12 demand was high at 293 units. Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods since P5. With on-hand inventory nearly exhausted (16 units) and recent demand spikes causing stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods, I will use a recent 6-period window (P7-P12) to capture the current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock that covers the elevated seasonal demand and the volatility observed during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high seasonal levels: P7-P12 average demand is 252.1 units, up from P1-P6 average of 174.5 (+44%). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 13, 2019. The product is sneaker socks, which are in peak demand during spring/early summer. Looking at recent history, demand from Period 7 to Period 13 (late March to early May) has averaged approximately 250 units (285, 320, 180, 209, 233, 293, 227). Looking at the specific last 4 periods (P10-P13), demand has been 209, 233, 293, 227, averaging 240.5. Although the Carry-over Insight for P13 suggested an average of 252.1 for P7-P12, the most recent week had 227, indicating a slight plateau or minor easing of the early spring peak, but still significantly higher than initial levels. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the 'Peak Spring' regime starting around P7. The lead time is consistently 4 periods per history (P9 order arrived in P13). In-transit inventory (1083) is high, representing orders from P10-P13. The current on-hand of 157 is healthy. My choice of N=7 for demand will help the OR engine maintain high service levels during this seasonal high while accommodating recent volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/05/20), we are entering late spring. The product (3p Sneaker Socks) has shown a high seasonal demand regime since mid-March. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P7-P14) is 244.75 units, significantly higher than the initial game phases but stable. Recent periods show demand levels of 227 (P13) and 212 (P14), indicating we are likely at the plateau of the spring peak. Lead time is consistently behaving at 4 periods (P10 arrived at P14). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 301 units, which covers more than one period of demand. Pipeline inventory is 922 units. To maintain service levels across the lead time (L=4) plus current review period (Total 5 periods), I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the noise from the very early season. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 8 periods to account for the current volatility observed during this peak season. Lead time remains at the default (promised) value of 4 as actual arrivals perfectly match this.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Periods 7-14 average demand is 244.8 units, showing stability in the high-demand spring regime for sneaker socks. Lead time remains 100% consistent at 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442007' (Sneaker Socks) is currently in its peak spring/early summer seasonal regime. Period 15 demand was high (301 units), which aligns with the trend observed from Period 7 onwards. The average demand for the last 9 periods (P7-P15) is 251.4 units, confirming a stable but high-demand plateau for late May. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods since the first arrival in Period 5. With current on-hand inventory at 180 and demand trending around 250-300, maintaining a stock level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) is critical. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture this seasonal average, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=9 to account for the variation seen in this high-demand period (range 180 to 320). Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' given its high consistency at 4.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product (3p Sneaker Socks) has been in a high-demand spring regime since mid-March. The last 10 periods (P7-P16) show a stable average demand of 245.3 units, maintaining the seasonal plateau. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 153 and 993 units in-transit (covering orders from periods 13, 14, 15, and 16), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable high-demand regime of the current season while smoothing out weekly volatility. L is set to calculated as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 10, 2019. The product is 3p Sneaker Socks, which usually experience peak demand during spring as users transition to low-cut footwear. However, Period 17 saw a significant drop in demand to 98 units, down from the previous 5-period average (P12-P16) of 264.6 units. This drop likely signals the end of the peak spring surge and a transition into a summer regime or a temporary correction. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P13 order arrived in P17). I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P13-P17) to capture this downward shift while still respecting the previous high-demand weeks to avoid under-ordering if Period 17 was an outlier. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) will account for the recent increase in volatility caused by this drop. L remains at the promised/calculated 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift at Period 17: Demand dropped to 98 units from a steady spring average of ~250 units, suggesting the end of the peak sneaker sock season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $826.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a new lower-regime as we move into mid-June (Period 17: 98, Period 18: 68), following a high-demand spring period (~250 units). This likely reflects a seasonal drop after the peak spring purchasing period. With on-hand inventory at 466 units and in-transit inventory at 893 units (from orders placed when demand was much higher), we are significantly over-inventoried relative to the current sales rate. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to the 'recent_N' method using N=3 to capture this sharp downturn and reduce the 'base_stock' target, which will trigger the OR backend's capped policy to minimize further purchasing while we burn through existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 17/18: Demand dropped significantly from a spring average of ~250 to a June average of 83 units (based on P17-P18), indicating the end of the peak sneaker sock season.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 20 (late June). The historical data and carry-over insights confirm that demand for '3p Sneaker Socks' has shifted from a high spring peak (~250 units/period) to a significantly lower summer regime. Demand for the last three periods (P17-P19) was 98, 68, and 91, resulting in an average of 85.7 units. This represents a ~65% drop from the spring regime. With On-hand inventory at 556 and In-transit inventory at 712 (total inventory 1268), we are significantly overstocked relative to the new demand level (1268 / 85.7 \u2248 14.8 periods of coverage). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs while still maintaining a reasonable service level for this lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the current summer regime, and keep L at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 confirmed: Demand dropped from a spring average of ~250 to a late June average of 85.7 units (P17-P19), a 65%+ decrease as peak season ends.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 21 (2019/07/01). As identified in previous carry-over insights, the product (sneaker socks) experienced a significant demand regime shift starting around Period 17 (early June), transitioning from a high-demand spring peak (~250 units/period) to a summer trough. The demand for the last four periods (P17-P20) has been 98, 68, 91, and 139, resulting in an average of 99 units. Current on-hand inventory is 750 units, which at the current demand rate, covers roughly 7.5 periods. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 379 units (orders from P17-P20), which will arrive over the next four periods. Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 1,129 units, far exceeding the requirements for the current demand regime (~500 units for L+1 coverage at the 100-unit mean). The objective now is to minimize holding costs by allowing inventory to bleed down. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the new, lower demand regime, and maintain L at default as lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (2019/7/8), we are managing '3p Sneaker Socks'. Analysis of recent periods (P17-P21) confirms a significant demand regime shift. The high spring demand (avg ~250) has ended, with recent demand averaging 111.2 units (P17: 98, P18: 68, P19: 91, P20: 139, P21: 160). Although there is a slight upward trend in the last two weeks, current on-hand inventory (896) and in-transit (73) totals 969 units. Given the new low-demand regime, we have approximately 8-9 weeks of coverage, which is significantly more than the (L+1) required (around 550-600 units). The Backend OR logic will correctly place zero orders because (Base Stock - Pipeline) will be negative. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the post-peak demand levels, and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at post-peak summer levels: Periods 17-21 average demand is 111.2 units, a 55% decrease from the spring peak (~250).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the post-peak summer season for sneaker socks. Current on-hand inventory is 751 units, with 0 units in-transit. Demand since the end of the spring peak (Period 17 onwards) has averaged 129 units per period (98, 68, 91, 139, 160, 218). While demand showed a slight uptick in the last two periods (160, 218), the current inventory of 751 units is significantly more than enough to cover the expected demand for the next lead time (L=4) plus current period (total 5 periods). At an average of ~130-150 units per period, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 650-750 units. Therefore, the goal is to stop ordering to allow the existing stock to deplete, avoiding excessive holding costs. For the parameters, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the post-peak demand level, and keep L at default as it remains stable at 4.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. We are in the post-peak summer regime for '3p Sneaker Socks'. Although demand spiked to 218 in Period 22, it dropped significantly to 80 in Period 23, conforming more closely to the lower summer average established since Period 17. The on-hand inventory (671) is very high, significantly exceeding the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). No orders were placed in Periods 19-22, and the order from Period 23 (97 units) is currently the only item in-transit. Given the high inventory and lower demand (P17-P23 average is 107.7), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this lower regime (Periods 17-23). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late July summer season (Period 25, 2019/07/29). For '3p Sneaker Socks', there has been a significant and sustained demand drop following the spring peak. The 'post-peak' regime identified in Period 22 (~111.2 units) appears to be softening further, with the last two periods (P23-24) averaging only 60 units. Current on-hand inventory is 631 units with 136 in-transit (ordered in P23 and P24). Total pipeline/on-hand is 767 units. This volume is sufficient to cover approximately 7-10 weeks of current demand levels. To prevent excessive holding costs while the stock naturally depletes, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 (covering the recent drop to ensure the forecast captures the current lower demand trend). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Demand has dropped further from the early summer average (~111) to a late July average of 60 units (P23-P24), likely as back-to-school or late-summer lull begins.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 160442007 (Sneaker Socks) is in a post-peak summer regime. Period 26 corresponds to early August, which often sees a 'Back to School' uptick in basic apparel demand, reflected in the Period 25 demand jump to 135 units. The average demand for the last three periods (P23-P25) is 85 units. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods. With 496 units on-hand and 286 in-transit, there is currently significant stock to cover the immediate 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). However, volatility is increasing. I will use a recent_N (N=4) to capture the stabilizing transition from the late-July low to the early-August recovery. Lead time is set to calculate as it is confirmed and stable. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 4 periods to balance the low 40-80 range with the recent 135 spike.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand uptick suspected: Period 25 demand (135) is significantly higher than the P23-P24 average (60), reversing the July downward trend.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are observing a significant demand uptick corresponding to the 'Back-to-School' season for sneaker socks. Demand has increased from a late-July low of ~60 units to 135 (P25) and now 196 (P26). This confirms a new demand regime following the summer lull. The average demand for the last two periods is 165.5 units. Given this clear upward trend, I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture this shift for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the game history, so I will maintain the default (promised) lead time setting. On-hand inventory is 300, with 379 in-transit. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a base stock level that covers this renewed demand while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand recovery confirmed: Demand increased from July average of ~60 to 165.5 (P25-P26 average), representing a significant seasonal pivot.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 28 (Aug 19, 2019). The demand for sneaker socks has entered a 'Back-to-School' recovery phase following the late-July lull. Demand in the most recent three periods (P25-P27) was 135, 196, and 197 respectively, averaging ~176. This is a significant jump from the July average of ~60. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the P23 order arriving in P27. Given this recovery, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current upward trend (avg 176 * 5 = 880). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility associated with this seasonal transition. I will keep L at 'calculate' to continue using the consistent 4-period historical average.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand recovery sustained: Periods 25-27 average demand is 176 units, confirming a shift from the July lull (~60 units) to a late-summer growth phase.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has transitioned from a July low (avg ~60) into a sustained late-summer/back-to-school recovery. The average demand over the last four periods (P25-P28) is 175.25 units. Current on-hand inventory is 66, with a large pipeline of 715 units scheduled to arrive. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the recovery to ~175 units per period, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new demand regime. This avoids over-ordering based on spring peak levels (~250) or under-ordering based on July lulls, while the pipeline matures.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 160442007 (Sneaker Socks) is currently in a 'back-to-school' demand recovery phase. Demand has shifted from a July lull (~60 units) to a sustained higher level in August (P25-P29 average is 170.2 units). The current period (Sept 2nd) marks the traditional start of the school year, where demand typically plateaus or slightly increases from the pre-season peak. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers the recovery regime from P25 onwards) will capture this current mean of ~170 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is low (66 units), but the in-transit pipeline (768 units) is robust. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers approximately 5 periods of demand (~850 units total), which aligns with current pipeline plus on-hand totals.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime stabilized: Periods 25-29 average demand is 170.2 units, a significant recovery from the July average of ~60 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/9/9. Based on the product description (sneaker socks) and historical data, the business is currently in the 'Back-to-School' demand regime, which stabilized around Period 25. The demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) has been [196, 197, 173, 150, 172], yielding an average of 177.6 units. This is a significant recovery from the July lull. Period 30 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and some lost sales (demand 172 vs 159 sold) because arrivals are just barely keeping up with the demand uptick. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to 'conclude' messages. To prevent stockouts during this sustained growth phase, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the back-to-school regime (P25-P30). Lead time (L) is set to calculate as it has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime stable: P25-P30 average demand is 170.5 units, up from the July average of ~60 units.

Specifically, the last three periods show a slight upward trend (150, 172, 231), but given the historical peaks around 250 in spring, I will use a recent window that captures this recovery without over-reacting to the single highest point in Period 31. Setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat covers the entire post-July recovery period. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P27 order arrived in P31). Inventory is very low (6 units on hand), so the 'recent_N' approach will trigger the OR backend to place an order that maintains the pipeline to support the current 179-unit weekly demand across the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime (P25-P31) average stabilized at 179.1 units, significantly higher than the July lull (~60 units) and consistent with early-autumn seasonality.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The demand for '3p Sneaker Socks' has stabilized into a 'back-to-school/early autumn' regime which began around Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 32 (N=8 periods), the average demand is approximately 183.4 units per period (135, 196, 197, 173, 150, 172, 231, 210). This represents a significant and sustained increase from the July lull. The lead time (L) has remained perfectly consistent at 4 periods since the start of the game (observed in 25 out of 25 completed cycles). Therefore, I will set L to 'default' (promised 4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this specific post-July regime while ignoring the previous low-demand summer valley. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the current ~183 units/period demand over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for back-to-school/autumn: Period 25-32 average demand is 183.4 units, confirming a sustained shift from the July average of ~60 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 369 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 'back-to-school' regime average of ~180 units. This suggests a potential transition into a higher autumn demand regime or a late-season peak for sneaker socks as weather starts to turn colder but shoes requiring low-cut socks are still worn. I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the back-to-school period from P25 onwards) to capture this upward shift while balancing the volatile high of P33. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P23-P29. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 737 units; with on-hand at 0, the total coverage must account for high potential demand over the next 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Demand increased to 369 units, a 100%+ increase over the previous stable regime of ~180 (P25-P32), signaling either a high-volatility event or a new autumn peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 160442007 (Sneaker Socks) is experiencing a significant demand surge in late September/early October, likely related to autumn seasonality or a specific promotional event. Demand in Period 33 reached 369 and Period 34 was 249, both well above the previous 'back-to-school' stability of ~180 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and shipments from Periods 31 and 32 are expected to arrive in the next two periods. Given the high stockout risk seen in the last two periods (sold < demand), I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this upward shift (average demand P32-P34 is 276.0). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to service this new demand level while considering the 4-period pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33 confirmed: Autumn demand surge observed with P33-P34 average demand at 309 units, compared to the P25-P32 average of 183 units (+68%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2850.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a new high-volatility autumn regime starting at Period 33. Demand in the last three periods (P33-P35) has been 369, 249, and 185 respectively. While Period 35 shows a downward trend from the P33 spike, it remains above the previous stable baseline of ~180. The average demand for the last 3 periods is 267.7 units. We are currently experiencing stockouts due to this sudden surge, meaning demand is likely higher than what sales reflect. To capture this shift and ensure sufficient base stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to prioritize the recent autumn surge. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of the transition from the back-to-school regime to the autumn regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime shift at Period 33: Demand increased significantly (P33-P35 average ~268 vs P25-P32 average ~183), resulting in stockouts. Volatility has increased as the season transitions.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442007' (Sneaker Socks) is currently in an autumn transition phase (late October). After a sharp spike to 369 units in Period 33, demand has softened over the last three periods (249, 185, 145), though it remains significantly higher than the summer low of ~60 units. This pattern suggests that while the initial autumn surge has peaked, there is still sustained demand compared to the off-season. Lead time continues to be highly stable at 4 periods. With only 87 units on hand and having experienced several stockouts in recent periods, maintaining a sufficient pipeline is critical. I will use recent_N with N=4 (covering the period from the autumn spike to now) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, high-demand autumn regime, as the older 'back-to-school' data (P25-P32) no longer reflects current market intensity.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak passed; demand correcting from spike of 369 (P33) to average of 193 (P34-P36), but remains above early autumn levels (~180).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3497.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has stabilized following a significant spike in Period 33 (369 units). Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has averaged 192.5 units (249, 185, 145, 191), which is consistent with the 'back-to-school/autumn' regime of ~180-190 units observed prior to the spike. The spike is now treated as a transient volatility event rather than a sustained regime shift. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 132 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 1222 units. With high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture the recent stabilized behavior while including the tail of the autumn surge, ensuring sufficient stock for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-October spike: P34-P37 average demand is 192.5 units, returning to the autumn baseline established in September.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4), the demand for sneaker socks has stabilized following a temporary spike in late September/early October (Period 33). The recent demand (P34-P38) averages 190.2 units per period, which is consistent with the autumn profile established after the summer lull. Lead time remains highly reliable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (268) and high in-transit pipeline (1011) are sufficient to cover expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this stable autumn regime (approx 190 units/period * 5 periods = 950). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same recent period to capture current volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock that accounts for the stabilized demand without over-ordering based on the older Period 33 surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-October spike: P34-P38 average demand is 190.2 units, confirming the return to the autumn baseline (approx 180-190 units).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for '3p Sneaker Socks' has dropped significantly over the last three periods (145, 191, 181, 104) compared to the mid-October peak. Period 39 demand of 104 units aligns with the historical late-autumn/winter pattern where demand for low-cut 'sneaker socks' typically declines as weather cools. On-hand inventory is currently high at 577 units, and 598 units are in-transit (reaching approximately 1175 units of total coverage). Given the current demand average (P36-P39) is approximately 155 units, the inventory position is already quite high (covering ~7.5 periods of demand). To avoid excessive holding costs during this cooling phase, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the cooling trend, and use default settings for lead time (which has remained stable at 4 periods) and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Period 39 demand (104) and the P36-P39 average (~155) indicate a seasonal cooling from the October peak (~190-200 units).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks is entering a cooling-off phase as we move deeper into November. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) has dropped to approximately 129 units, compared to the October average of ~190 units. Current on-hand inventory (826) plus in-transit (229) is extremely high, totaling 1,055 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we are currently covered for over 8 periods of demand at the current consumption rate without placing new orders. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the cooling phase) to align the OR backend's forecast with the downward seasonal trend. This will prevent over-ordering during the off-season and allow on-hand inventory to drawdown, minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed: Mid-November demand (P39-P40 average) is 112 units, down ~40% from the October baseline (190 units), indicating the conclusion of the autumn peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1191.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a late-autumn/pre-winter cooling phase. Period 41 demand was 107, following 120 (P40) and 104 (P39), confirming a stable lower regime compared to the October peak (approx 190 units). The current on-hand inventory (842) plus in-transit (106) totals 948 units, which is approximately 8.8 periods of supply at the current average demand of ~110 units. With only 6 periods remaining in the game and a 4-period lead time, the current inventory levels are more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Therefore, I will maintain an order of 0 by setting L to default and using a conservative recent_N for mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (P39-P41), letting the OR backend realize the surplus and minimize further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at low-late-autumn levels: P39-P41 average demand is 110.3 units, a ~42% reduction from the October baseline (~190 units).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/2 (Period 43). In Period 42, demand spiked unexpectedly to 311 units, which is significantly higher than the mid-November average of ~110 units. Given the date (early December), this is likely the start of the holiday/Christmas shopping season for sneaker socks. However, our on-hand inventory is currently high (637 units) due to the large autumn arrivals (P35-P36 orders). With 637 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we are well-covered for several periods of even high seasonal demand. Promised lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (P38 arrived in P42). I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent historical volatility and the current spike (average demand P39-P42 is ~160). I will use sigma_hat 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for the wider fluctuations seen throughout autumn and into the current spike. No order is likely to be triggered given the high stock level, which aligns with the need to avoid excess holding costs as the game nears its end (Period 47).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike observed at Period 42: Demand increased from late-autumn average of ~110 to 311 units (+180%), signaling the start of the December seasonal peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the December holiday season (Dec 9). Period 42 showed a massive spike in demand (311 units), signaling the start of the holiday peak, followed by a drop in Period 43 (107 units). This volatility is typical for early December as demand fluctuates between shopping peaks. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the priority is ensuring enough stock to meet further spikes throughout December. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I will base the demand forecast (mu_hat) on a mix of the holiday spike and the subsequent correction to capture the elevated but volatile seasonal level. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3: P40-42) to capture the pre-holiday baseline and the spike, and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high seasonal variance (std of ~110 over the last 3 periods gives a (1+L) adjusted sigma of ~245). On-hand inventory (530) plus in-transit (307) equals 837 units, which is healthy, but we must protect against another P42-style spike before the game ends in Period 47.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday season (Period 45, 2019/12/16). Demand for sneaker socks has shown extreme volatility: a massive spike to 311 in Period 42 followed by lower demand (107, 88) in Periods 43-44. This reflects typical holiday 'peak and valley' patterns where demand surges during specific gift-purchasing weeks followed by temporary lulls. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (45, 46, 47), orders placed now will arrive in Period 49 (4-period lead time), which is AFTER the game ends. Therefore, placing new orders is counter-productive as they will only increase 'in-transit' costs and may never arrive within the game window to satisfy demand. Current on-hand inventory (442) and the 'in-transit' units from Period 43 (307) and Period 44 (359) are more than sufficient to cover the remaining demand for Periods 45, 46, and 47 even if another spike occurs. I will set the parameters to a conservative baseline to stop further ordering while the system works through existing stock and pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility confirmed: Period 42 saw a 180% spike (311 units), followed by a return to lower levels (avg ~97 units) in Periods 43-44.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1618.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46 (Dec 23), we are in the peak holiday/Christmas week. Historically, Period 42 showed a significant holiday spike (311 units), while recent weeks (P43-P45) averaged ~100 units. Given '3p Sneaker Socks' are common stocking fillers/gifts, I expect a potential surge in Period 46 demand similar to Period 42. Since we are at the end of the year, I must ensure we don't over-order into the January lull, but under-stocking now would result in high lost profit ($19/unit). On-hand is 339, which covers approx. 3 periods of normal demand but might be tight if a 300+ unit spike occurs this week. However, since arrivals are currently at zero (due to zero orders in P39-P42), the pipeline consists of orders from P43 onwards which won't arrive until P47+. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P42-P45) mean to capture the increased volatility and the recent spike, providing a weighted average that accounts for both the outlier and the baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30, 2019). Analyzing recent demand history (P43-P46), demand has settled into a lower post-holiday regime, averaging approximately 109 units (107, 88, 103, 139). While P42 (Nov 25) saw a significant spike of 311 units, subsequent periods haven't sustained that peak, suggesting it was a specific holiday-related event. Pipeline inventory is currently 857 units, which is quite high compared to the current demand rate (~110 units/period). Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods based on all history. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current post-holiday baseline, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent demand variability. The backend will naturally restrict ordering given the high pipeline (857) relative to the base stock calculation, which is appropriate as we enter the low-season of early January.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand regime shift: Periods 43-46 average demand has decreased to 109.3 units from the erratic holiday spikes, indicating a return to low-season baseline for early January.
