Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is 'Ellen Thong (Malva) L 3pk', a women's lingerie item. Looking at the demand history provided (5 samples), the average demand is 58.6 units per week with a standard deviation of approximately 15.9. The demand appears relatively stable, though there's a slight upward trend from the first observation (31) to more recent levels (mid-60s). Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is the first period, the goal is to establish a baseline. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the current demand level. For lead time, I will use the 'default' method (promised L=4) as we have no historical arrival data to suggest a deviation yet. The backend will calculate base_stock = (1+L)*E[D] + z*sqrt(1+L)*std[D]. With Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the backend will target the mean demand over the protection interval to minimize total cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). Examining the historical demand data: Jan weeks (31, 60, 70, 64) and Feb weeks (68, P1:48). The mean demand over 6 samples is approximately 56.8. In Period 1, we ordered 85 units with a promised lead time (L) of 4. Since L=4, that order is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are experiencing lost sales (48 units in Period 1). The target base stock should cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the current mean of ~57, the expected demand over 5 periods is 285. The OR backend calculates order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap). With 85 already in transit, we need to signal for additional stock to cover the expected total demand of ~285. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the current demand level, which averages 56.8 per week. This results in a mu_hat of approx 284 (5 * 56.8).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-02-25. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 167 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 - Feb 4) average 58.6 units/week. Observed demand in the last two periods (Period 1 & 2) was 48 and 69, averaging 58.5. This indicates a stable demand regime. Since lead time is 4, we don't expect the Period 1 order (85 units) until Period 5 (concluded in Period 6). I will use the default lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (5 historical + 2 game periods) which show no significant trend shift yet. Setting N=7 for recent_N to include the full available history for a stable estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Ellen Thong' (Women's Lingerie) shows stable historical demand with a mean of ~60.6 units per week from 5 available samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04). In the last three periods (P1, P2, P3), demand was 48, 69, and 64 respectively (avg ~60.3). The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 250 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since P1's order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5, we do not expect to see arrivals in the 'conclude' messages until P5 conclude (read at the start of P6). Thus, the current 'arrived=0' is expected. I will set parameters based on the full sample mean (~60) and standard deviation (~14.4). mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 5 * 60 = 300. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * std = sqrt(5) * 14.4 \u2248 32.2. These parameters will help the OR backend maintain a base stock level to cover the lead time pipeline plus a buffer for volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is Women's Underwear (3pk). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (85 units), Period 2 (82 units), Period 3 (83 units), and Period 4 (47 units). According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (which happens after this decision phase). I should see its confirmation in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet, and all demand has been lost. Historical demand samples (including the 5 pre-game samples) show a mean of 59.67 units per period. Recent demand (last 4 periods: 48, 69, 64, 63) averages 61 units. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Total in-transit is 297, while expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 300. I will maintain the default lead time and use recent_N for mu and sigma to capture the slightly higher recent demand trend.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Womens Lingerie'. Looking at historical demand (including the provided seeds), the values are: 31, 60, 70, 64, 68, 48, 69, 64, 63, 67. The mean demand across all 10 samples is 58.4, and the standard deviation is 11.23. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5). Our on-hand inventory is currently 18, with 227 units in-transit. The OR backend uses an (L+1) period horizon; with L=4, this is 5 periods. Total demand for 5 periods based on the mean (58.4) is 292.0. Our current pipeline inventory (On-hand 18 + In-transit 227) is 245. The OR backend will calculate a base stock and order the difference. Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock will effectively be the mean demand over the protection interval. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand statistics to capture all available data points and provide a stable forecast.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product is a women's lingerie pack. Statistical analysis of the demand shows a stable pattern: historical samples (31, 60, 70, 64, 68) followed by recorded demand in periods 1-6 (48, 69, 64, 63, 67, 60). The mean for the last 6 observed periods is 61.8, while the mean of all 11 samples is 61.3. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (Period 1 arrived at P5, Period 2 arrived at P6). I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation to stay responsive to the most recent stable consumption levels. With L=4, the base stock targets (1+L=5) periods of demand. On-hand (40) plus in-transit (202) equals 242 units, which is approximately four weeks of demand, indicating the pipeline is moderately healthy but requires consistent replenishment to avoid stockouts given the high holding cost relative to profit (Profit $1, Holding $1, which results in a low target service level z* = 0.5/50%). However, the OR backend's default logic handles the specific z-score; my role is to provide stable mu and sigma estimates.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1 arrival at P5 and P2 arrival at P6). Demand remains stable around a mean of 61 units/week.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). Historical demand samples and recent concluding periods (P5-P7) show a stable demand pattern for this lingerie item, with an average demand of approximately 61 units per week across the last 10 samples (5 historical + 7 game periods). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on arrivals in P5, P6, and P7. Currently, on-hand inventory is 71 units, and in-transit is 190 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). With L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using the recent_N method with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat best captures the current stable regime while filtering out the early noise. The OR engine will target a base stock of roughly 5 * 61 = 305 units. Since 71 (on-hand) + 190 (in-transit) = 261, the system will likely order around 44 units, maintaining a healthy buffer against a lead time of 4.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, 2019. Historical demand for the last 8 weeks shows a consistent and stable pattern with a mean of approximately 60.1 units and a standard deviation of 7.2. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (as seen in arrival messages for orders from Periods 1 through 4). Total pipeline inventory is 195 units (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8), and we have 65 units on hand. Given the stability of the demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the full recent history after the initial samples. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/04/15), we observe a significant drop in demand for Period 9 (28 units vs. the previous average of approx. 62). However, looking at the historical samples (31, 60, 70, 64, 68), the demand is generally volatile around a mean of 60. The drop to 28 in Period 9 might be idiosyncratic or a seasonal dip post-Easter (April 21 was Easter in 2019, but demand often fluctuations around spring school holidays). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P9). On-hand inventory is 52 and in-transit is 218 (covering orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Given Profit=HoldingCost=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning base stock level should be the median demand over the (L+1) period. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to cautiously weigh the recent lower demand while still accounting for the historical mean. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

However, there is a visible downward trend in the last two periods (28 and 40). Since the product is 'Womens Lingerie' underwear, there isn't a significant seasonal event immediately visible in mid-April. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable demand period while acknowledging the recent dip. Setting L to default (promised 4) as it aligns with observations. The profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a 50% service level target (z=0), which the OR backend will use to minimize costs while meeting expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand shows a cooling trend starting Period 9 (dropped from mid-60s to average of 34 in last 2 weeks). Will monitor if this persists or reverts.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (April 29, 2019). Analyzing the history, demand appears to have shifted. Periods 1-8 had a mean of ~59 units. Starting Period 9, demand dropped significantly (28, 40, 54), though Period 11 saw a recovery toward the historical mean. The 'cooling trend' noted in Period 11's carry-over (avg 34 over 2 weeks) was partially offset by a jump to 54 in Period 11. Given this variance and the date (post-Easter), demand is likely stabilizing around a lower mean than the initial launch phase but higher than the mid-April dip. Lead time is reliably 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 86 and in-transit at 127 (total pipeline 213), and lead time L=4, we need to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (Periods 7-11 mean = 45.4) balances the older high-demand periods with the recent dip. For sigma_hat, recent_N=5 captures the increased volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand has transitioned from ~60 (P1-8) to ~45 (P7-11). Shift is significant enough to move away from all-time averages.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-06. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (Periods 5 through 12 all show lead_time=4). Historical demand began at ~61 (P1-P8), dipped in Period 9 (28), and has since stabilized in a range between 40 and 57 (Periods 10-12). The last three weeks average 50.3 units. Given the transition, I'm using N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the recent lower-volume regime (averaging 47.4 units/period) while moving away from the earlier high-volume samples (mid-60s). On-hand inventory is 81 and in-transit is 89, totaling 170 units. With an expected demand of ~50/week and a pipeline covering (L+1)=5 weeks, 170 units provide a safety cushion of roughly 3.4 weeks beyond the next 5 weeks (Total ~8.4 weeks of cover), which is appropriate given the holding cost equals profit ($1). No missing shipments detected.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 (Women's Lingerie 3pk) is currently in Period 14. Demand history shows a recent rebound: after a drop in Periods 9-10 (28, 40), the last three periods have seen demand rise back to 54, 57, and 65, which aligns with the pre-shift mean of ~60. The 'cooling trend' noted in previous insights appears to have reversed or was a short-term fluctuation. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 9-13: 28, 40, 54, 57, 65) which yields a mean of 48.8; with L=4, mu_hat becomes (1+4)*48.8 = 244. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by every arrival from Period 1 through Period 9. Pipeline inventory (Units ordered P10-P13) is 113, and on-hand is 54. Note that Profit ($1) vs Holding ($1) implies a 50% service level target (z*=0), where the backend tries to keep stock around the mean demand over the lead time. Given the recent upward trend, using the last 5 samples captures the recovery better than the longer-term average while still accounting for the low points in April.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovered in Periods 11-13 (avg 58.7) following a mid-April dip, suggesting the 'cooling trend' was temporary. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20th. At the end of Period 14, we ran out of stock (Ending Inventory = 0) because the order from Period 10 (ordered 0 units) resulted in no arrivals during Period 14 resolution. Since the promised lead time is 4, we expect reinforcements to arrive in Period 15 (ordered 37 in P11), Period 16 (ordered 14 in P12), Period 17 (ordered 62 in P13), and Period 18 (ordered 74 in P14). Demand in Period 14 spiked to 83, the highest yet, suggesting that the earlier cooling trend has fully reversed into a potential summer increase for womens lingerie. Given L=4, we need mu_hat to cover 5 periods (L+1). Recent demand (P11-14) averages 64.75 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this upward shift and ensure the base stock is high enough to recover from the current stockout and meet potential growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend reversal confirmed: Mid-April dip was temporary; demand in P14 hit a series high of 83. Moving target mean from ~45-50 back to ~65+.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507883014' (Women's Underwear) is experiencing a massive demand spike. Demand in Period 15 reached 140 units, following 83 in Period 14, representing a significant upward shift from the historical mean of ~60. Currently, On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 237, belonging to orders from Period 12 (14), 13 (62), 14 (74), and 15 (87). Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, Period 12's order of 14 units is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 16, but this is far below the current demand levels (140), leading to likely stockouts. I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_3' to capture the last three periods (65, 83, 140) where demand accelerated, resulting in a forecast of (1+4) * 96 = 480. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting sigma_hat to explicit values to account for high volatility seen in the last 2 weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Extreme spike confirmed (Period 15 demand = 140). 3-period rolling average has climbed from ~50 to 96. Stockout risk is high until Period 14/15 orders arrive.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant demand surge, with demand in the last three periods hitting 83, 140, and 112 (average ~111.7), compared to its historical mean of ~60. This surge has depleted all on-hand inventory, resulting in stockouts for three consecutive periods. The current date (June 3) suggests this might be related to a summer/early June demand peak for women's lingerie/underwear. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a high in-transit pipeline (384 units), I must set parameters to ensure upcoming arrivals (ordered in P13-P16) satisfy this new high-demand regime. Specifically, the OR backend requires mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods. Using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the current peak (avg ~112 * 5 periods = 560), while keeping L at the promised value of 4 correctly accounts for the pipeline against this requirement.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 14-16 average demand is 111.7 units/period, a 100%+ increase from the previous baseline. Stockout condition persist as of Period 17.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing a high-demand regime, with demand in the last four periods (P14-P17) averaging 99 units per period (83, 140, 112, 62), though P17 showed a significant drop to 62. The system has been in a persistent stockout state due to this spike. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The arrivals expected in Period 18 correspond to the P14 order (74 units), which is insufficient to cover the current demand regime. We are forecasting for (L+1) = 5 periods. Given the volatility (the spike to 140 followed by a drop back to 62), I will use a mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P13-P17) to capture both the peak and the potential stabilization, averaging ~76.4 units/period, or 382 for the 5-period window. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to address the high variance observed during this regime shift.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime for the Ellen Thong 3pk. While demand peaked around Period 15-16 (>110), the last two periods (P17-P18) have shown demand returning to the 60-80 range (P17: 62, P18: 81). This suggests a stabilization higher than the early 2019 baseline (~60) but lower than the mid-May spike. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since P14, we have experienced near-total stockouts due to the demand surge; however, a large pipeline (407 units) is now starting to arrive. Specifically, the P15 order (87 units) is due in P19, followed by P16 (161 units) in P20, which should alleviate the stockout. Given the recent variability and the need to protect against further surges while the OR backend's cap prevents over-ordering, I will use a 5-period window (P14-P18) to calculate demand. This captures the peak and the recent stabilization (Avg: ~88). L is set to 'calculate' as it consistently reflects the 4-period reality.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (May-June) is stabilizing. Demand in P17-P18 (Avg 71.5) is lower than P15-P16 (Avg 126), but remains above the Q1 baseline of 60. Pipeline pressure is expected to ease starting P20.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we are managing a high-demand regime that peaked in May. Recent demand (P17-P19) has averaged 75.7 units/period, significantly higher than the initial baseline (60) but lower than the May peak (110+). The stockout situation is finally resolving (ending on-hand: 3) as the heavy orders from Periods 14-15 started arriving. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (391 units) is very high due to large orders placed in P16-P17 to combat stockouts; however, demand is stabilizing. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this post-peak stabilization (Avg P15-P19 is ~96), allowing the OR backend to reconcile this against the large pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the high volatility seen during the peak and subsequent decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization: Post-May peak demand has settled at approximately 75-80 units/period (P17-P19 avg: 75.7), higher than the Q1 baseline but significantly lower than the P15-P16 spike.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering July (Period 21). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by multiple observations, most recently P16 arriving in P20). Demand has transitioned from the extreme May/June spike (where weekly demand reached 140) to a more stable but elevated regime compared to Q1. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P18-P20) is 83.7 units. On-hand inventory has finally recovered to 78 units after a series of stockouts, with a large pipeline of 315 units. Given that Profit equals Holding Cost ($1.00), the OR backend's target service level (q) will be 0.50 (the median). To maintain the current stabilized demand forecast, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the post-spike stabilization (P17-P20 avg = 78.25), which aligns well with recent performance. Sigma will also be set based on the last 4 periods to account for the reduction in volatility after the May peak.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 22 (July 8, 2019). The demand for 507883014 (Womens Underwear) has stabilized following a significant spike in May. Observations from Periods 17-21 show demand values of 62, 81, 84, 86, and 101. This suggests a new robust baseline around ~83 units/period, roughly 30% higher than the Q1 average of ~60. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 136 units on-hand and 156 in-transit (total 292), we are currently well-covered against this new demand level. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this established higher floor, while keeping sigma_hat reflective of recent volatility to maintain target service levels without excessive holding costs, as profit and holding cost are equal (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in July: Post-spike demand has settled at a mean of ~83 units/period (P17-P21), which is a sustained increase from the initial Q1 baseline of 60.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear shift from the initial Q1 average (~60) to a higher sustained level in Q2/Q3. Following a significant spike in May (Periods 15-16), demand has stabilized at a higher baseline. The last 6 periods (P17-P22) have an average demand of 84.5 units per period. In-transit arrivals have been consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods (P21 saw the arrival of the P17 order). Although Period 22's 'conclude' message shows 0 arrivals, this is expected as the P18 order was for 0 units. We expect the P19 order (71 units) to arrive in the Period 23 arrival phase. To maintain stock against this new baseline of ~85 units/period while accounting for the historical volatility seen in May, I am selecting recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized regime (P17-P22).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift confirmed for Q3: Mean demand has increased from ~60 (Q1) to ~85 (P17-P22). Lead time remains reliably at 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear) continues to exhibit a sustained demand regime shift that began in mid-May (Q2). While we saw a significant peak in Period 15-16, demand has now settled into a stable Q3 baseline. In the last seven periods (P17-P23), demand has averaged 83.3 units, significantly higher than the initial Q1 average of approximately 60. The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 19 order in Period 23). Current inventory levels are recovering from the stockouts seen in May/June, with on-hand units at 38 and a robust pipeline of 298 units. Given the transition to this higher plateau, I will use a N=7 window (the length of the current stable regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that reflects the current mean of ~83 rather than the all-time average (which is pulled down by lower Q1 data). This supports a higher service level to capture the increased demand while managing holding costs as inventory replenishes.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's underwear (3pk), which typically exhibits stable demand with seasonal peaks. We are currently in late July (Period 25). Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting around Period 15, moving from a Q1/Q2 early mean of ~60 to a sustained Q3 level of ~83 units/week. Recent periods (P21-P24) show demand of 101, 93, 76, and 73, averaging 85.75, confirming this higher baseline remains intact. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (294) plus on-hand (50) equals 344 units. At the current demand rate, required inventory for (L+1) = 5 periods is approximately 425 units (85 * 5). The OR backend's inventory balancing will trigger an order to cover this gap. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime since P17 while filtering the extreme spike in P15-16.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Historical demand shows a stabilization in the range of 70-100 units/period since Period 20 (late June/July). The recent demand samples are: P21=101, P22=93, P23=76, P24=73, P25=67. In Period 25, we stocked out with 0 ending inventory because the arrival from Period 21 (ordered Period 17) was missing/lost. Looking at the 'conclude' messages, Period 21's order was meant to arrive in Period 25 (L=4) but didn't. However, according to the mechanism, we observe arrivals in the message following the period they arrive. Period 25 conclude shows 'arrived=0', which suggests the order placed in Period 21 (if any) didn't land yet. Wait, checking history: Period 21 ordered 0. Period 22 ordered 106. We are currently at Period 26 decision. Arrivals for P26 are from P22 (ordered 106, arrived in P26). Since we started on-hand at 0, and the demand at P25 was 67 while we had 50, we lost some sales. For parameters: Lead time L=4 is consistent. Demand regime: the average of the last 9 samples (P17-P25) is approximately 80.2. Using N=9 for mu_hat captures this sustained post-peak level. Sigma_hat is also set to N=9 to account for recent volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 is a 'Womens Lingerie' (Underwear 3pk) product. As of Period 27 (mid-August), the high-demand regime observed from May to July appears to be cooling. Recent demand samples show a decline: Period 24 (73), Period 25 (67), and Period 26 (68), compared to the previous June/July average of ~85. The mean of the last 5 demand samples (Periods 22-26) is 75.4 units, which is more representative than the all-time mean or the previous peak. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 22 order in Period 26). I have set L=4 and will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this downward normalization while maintaining a sensible safety stock. The on-hand inventory is 38, but the pipeline (296 units) is healthy, so the backend OR logic will naturally moderate ordering to prevent overstocking as we move past the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: August demand (average 67.5) is lower than the Q3 plateau (average 85). Transitioning mean forecast down from 85 to ~75.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 23 (mid-July), we have observed a softening in demand. Demand in the most recent four periods (P24-P27) has been 73, 67, 68, and 64, averaging 68 units/period. This is significantly lower than the July average of ~85 but slightly higher than the Q1 baseline of ~60. I am adjusting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this recent plateau and prevent over-ordering as we move through August. sigma_hat will also be calculated based on this recent regime to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the May/June peaks. The backend calculation will target a base stock sufficient for the current period plus the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed: August demand (P24-P27) has stabilized at an average of 68 units, down from the Q3 peak of 85. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 has clearly softened in August. After a summer peak where demand averaged around 85 units per period (P17-P23), the last five periods (P24-P28) have shown a lower and stable average of 65.8 units (73, 67, 68, 64, 57). This justifies shifting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect this new regime. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stability while moving away from the higher July peaks. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on regular arrivals from P26-P28, following the promised lead time exactly. Current on-hand inventory is 105 with a substantial pipeline of 186, so the OR backend should naturally moderate ordering as we align to the lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level for August: P24-P28 average demand is 65.8, compared to the P17-P23 average of ~85.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 (underwear 3-pack) has transitioned from a high-demand Q3 plateau (~85 units/period) to a lower, stable regime in August/September. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P24-P29) is 64.7 units, showing a distinct cooling from the July peak. September historically sees stable demand for basics like underwear, though we must prepare for potential late-September shifts. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P25 order arrived in P29). Inventory is healthy (On-hand: 112, In-transit: 158), covering approximately 4 periods of forecasted demand. Given the current stability, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this August/September softening, and set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been reliably 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level for late Q3: P24-P29 average is 64.7, confirming a move away from the 85+ units peak seen in July.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 has definitely stabilized into a lower regime following the July peak. Over the last seven periods (P24-P30), the average demand is 66.5, which is significantly lower than the ~85 units seen previously. The current on-hand inventory is 76 units, and there are 170 units in-transit. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50% (base_stock \u2248 median demand over lead time + review period), but the OR engine's capped policy will also reference recent volatility. I will use recent_N=7 to capture this lower late-Q3 demand regime while ignoring the hyper-volatile May-July spike. This will prevent over-ordering as we move into September.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for late Q3 (P24-P30): Mean demand is 66.5, representing a significant drop from the July peak of 85+ and returning toward the Q1 baseline of ~60.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 (underwear 3pk) has stabilized after a summer peak (July avg ~85) to a lower late-Q3 level. Over the last 8 periods (P24-P31), demand has averaged 64.4 units, very close to the Q1 baseline of ~60. The most recent demand (P31) was 49, following a 78 in P30. I will prioritize the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this stabilized 'post-peak' regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P26 arriving in P30, P27 arriving in P31). Inventory levels are healthy with 70 on-hand and 206 in-transit, which covers more than 3 weeks of the current mean demand. By using recent_N for mu_hat with N=8, I allow the model to adjust to the lower demand level while maintaining enough safety stock (sigma_hat) to handle the volatility seen in P30.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for the Period 24-31 window: Mean demand is 64.4 units/period, confirming a full regression from the June/July peak (~85) back to the Q1 baseline (~60). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 has clearly stabilized at a lower level following the June/July peak. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P24-P32) is approximately 63 units/period, which aligns closely with the original Q1 baseline (approx. 60). Recent data from P30-P32 (78, 49, 40) shows some volatility but confirms the shift away from the 80+ range. I am using recent_N (N=9) to capture this stabilized 'post-peak' regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This period (Sept 23) does not show immediate major seasonal triggers in the historical data for this product category. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P30, P31, P32 arrivals all showed L=4).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 has clearly shifted from the high-demand regime of June/July (avg ~85) back to a lower level aligned with the initial Q1 baseline. For the period window P24-P33, the mean demand is approximately 61.1 units, which is remarkably close to the earliest observed demand (approx 60). Recent data shows a slight cooling toward late September (P31nd P32 showed 49 and 40 units respectively), though P33 ticked back up to 56. Given the date is Sept 30, we are entering the Fall season where demand for basic 3-pack underwear traditionally remains stable or sees moderate lifts. I will set the mu_hat using a recent window that captures this stabilized 'new normal' (N=10 covering P24-P33). Lead time remains reliably consistent at 4 periods based on numerous arrivals (P1 through P29 orders all followed the 4-period pattern). On-hand is 47 with 206 seats in-transit (P30-P33 orders), which is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for the late Q3 window (P24-P33): Mean demand is 61.1 units/period, effectively returning to the Q1 baseline of ~60 units and ending the summer peak period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 has clearly stabilized after the summer peak. Analyzing the most recent period (P24-P34), the average weekly demand is approximately 61 units, which closely aligns with the Q1 baseline. The standard deviation over this period is roughly 12.5. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P30 order arriving in P34). Given the current inventory state (on-hand: 64, in-transit: 205), we are well-covered for the near term. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture this post-peak stabilization while ignoring the June/July volatility. The lead time L is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods remains accurate.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October. Since Period 32, demand has dipped further, with the average demand for the last 4 weeks (P32-P35) being 40.75 units, significantly lower than the P24-P31 average of ~64. October demand is showing a cooling trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently high (113), and with 152 in-transit, there is a total pipeline of 265 units. Given the low recent demand, this pipeline already covers more than 6 periods of supply (265 / 40.75 \u2248 6.5). I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this cooling trend (mean ~42) while maintaining lead time at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening in October: Average demand has dropped to 40.75 units (P32-P35) from the previous baseline of ~61-64. This indicates a potential seasonal low for Q4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-89.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Womens Underwear) has entered a significant downward trend in October, likely indicating a seasonal low. Demand in the last 4 periods (P32-P35) averaged 35.5 units, which is a sharp drop from the summer plateau of 85 and the Q1/Q3 baseline of ~61. With on-hand inventory at 124 units and another 106 in-transit (total 230), the current stock covers more than 6 units of the current demand rate, even without accounting for incoming orders. I will set the lead time to its observed stable value of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the cooling demand regime (approx 40 units/period) while ignoring the higher historical summer peaks. This will lead the OR engine to reduce ordering to prevent excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening in Q4 confirmed: Average demand has dropped to 35.5 units (P32-P35) from the previous baseline of ~61. On-hand + Pipeline is currently high relative to this new demand level.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 has clearly entered a Q4 softening phase. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P32-P37) is 39.5 units, significantly lower than the previous Q1 and late Q3 baseline of ~61 units. Currently, the on-hand inventory (115) plus in-transit units (79) totals 194 units. At the current demand rate of ~40 units/period, this inventory covers nearly 5 periods of demand, which aligns with the lead time plus review period (L+1). Given that the backend base stock calculation will target (1+L) * mean, and we have enough pipeline to cover this at the new lower demand level, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this lower regime (N=6 corresponding to the start of the drop in P32). This will prevent excessive ordering and minimize holding costs during this seasonal low. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Q4 seasonal low confirmed: Demand from P32-P37 has stabilized at a mean of 39.5 units, a ~35% drop from the previous baseline of 61.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for the product (Women's underwear) has entered a stable Q4 seasonal low. Over the last 7 periods (P32-P38), the average demand is 38.7 units per period, which is a significant drop from the Q3 average (~65) and the summer peak (~85). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (131 units) and pipeline inventory is 27 units, totaling 158 units. At the current demand levels (~40 units/period), this covers approximately 4 periods of demand. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level quantile is 0.5, meaning we should target the median demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). With a mean of ~40, the target base stock is approximately 200. However, the OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent excessive ordering. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the Q4 regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect the current lower volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (4 periods).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 has entered a sustained Q4 seasonal low. Over the last 8 periods (P32-P39), demand has averaged 38.8 units, significantly lower than the previous baseline of ~61. Current on-hand inventory (121) plus in-transit stock (37) totals 158 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and a review period of 1, the system should cover demand for 5 periods (1+L). At a mean of ~39 units per period, the required pipeline is approximately 195 units. Current inventory (158) is slightly below this target. However, since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 50%, meaning we should target the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture this lower Q4 regime and recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Q4 seasonal demand level stabilized (P32-P39): mean demand is 38.8 units/period, down from the previous baseline of 61. Inventory levels are currently sufficient to cover this lower demand rate.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the Q4 period for SKU 507883014 (Womens Underwear). While preceding periods (P32-P39) showed a significant seasonal low (average ~39), Period 40 unexpectedly jumped to 56 units. This might be an early signal of Black Friday/Holiday demand ramp-up. Historically, demand was ~60 in Q1 and peaked at ~85 in summer. Currently, on-hand inventory is 65 with 71 in-transit (Total pipeline = 136). Using a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). If demand is reverting toward the ~60 baseline or higher for the holidays, current stock reaching 136 is lean but safe. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P32-P40) to capture the Q4 mean but allow the Period 40 spike to pull the forecast slightly upward toward 40.7 units/period to hedge against holiday growth.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Potential onset of holiday demand ramp noted in Period 40 (demand increased to 56 from a Q4 average of 39). Will monitor if this persists as a new seasonal regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, entering the peak holiday shopping season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Demand in Period 40 (56 units) suggested a ramp-up, though Period 41 dipped slightly to 34. However, historical data and product category (Womens Lingerie/Underwear) strongly suggest a significant demand increase in late November and December. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on history. My goal is to ensure base stock covers the lead time (4) + review period (1) = 5 periods. While current on-hand is low (31), the 'In-transit' quantity of 127 includes orders from P38 (1), P39 (36), P40 (34), and P41 (56). The P38 order is expected to arrive in Period 42. Given the expected seasonal surge, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the most recent volatility, and sigma_hat using recent_N to allow the OR backend more headroom for the holiday spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand ramp suspected: Late November (P40-P41) shows increased volatility preceding Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Expected regime shift for Q4 peak.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), which is the peak holiday shopping season following Black Friday/Cyber Monday. In Period 42, we experienced a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0) as demand hit 66, significantly above the Q4 low average of ~39. This confirms the holiday ramp suspected in previous periods. Since L=4, orders placed today arrive in Period 47. Demand history shows a massive spike in May (P15-16), and we must anticipate a similarly aggressive or greater spike for the December holiday peak to avoid further lost sales. I am transitioning the mu_hat forecast from the Q4 baseline (~40) up toward a 'holiday peak' level. Analysis of the late-May peak showed demand reaching ~140; for the December peak, I will set mu_hat using a more reactive approach to capture this seasonality. I'm choosing recent_N (N=3) to focus on the immediate upward trend (Periods 40-42 avg = 52) and increasing the base stock target via an explicit mu_hat to ensure we cover the probable December surge.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand ramp confirmed: Period 42 demand (66) and Period 40 demand (56) are significantly higher than the Q4 average of 39. Stockout occurred in Period 42.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday shopping season (Period 44, Dec 9). Demand in Period 42 was 66 units, followed by a slight dip to 38 in Period 43 (likely influenced by stockout/supply timing). Carry-over insights confirm a holiday ramp-up compared to the Q4 baseline. I am forecasting a high mean demand of 75 units/period to account for the remaining holiday weeks and potential post-holiday sales. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and 253 units in-transit, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the (L+1) window, which is 5 weeks. Total demand over 5 weeks at a mean of 75 is 375 units. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to capture this seasonal peak and 'calculate' for lead time since historical performance is consistent.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday shopping window. Historical demand for this SKU showed a peak in early summer (~85 units) and a Q4 low (~39 units), but recent periods show a ramp-up again. Specifically, demand spiked to 56 (P40) and 66 (P42) before dipping slightly in the last two weeks (38 and 32). However, given the Dec 16th date, we must maintain a buffer for late-season holiday demand and the start of the new year. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline is currently very full (318 units in-transit) following large orders in P43 (111 units) and P44 (99 units), which are expected to arrive in P47 and P48 respectively. With on-hand inventory nearly depleted (2 units) and the next significant arrivals still 2-3 periods away, there is a short-term stockout risk. I will setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5, including the holiday ramp-up and recent dip) to balance the current volatility, yielding an average demand of ~45.2. Multiplying by (1+L) = 5, mu_hat is approximately 226. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture historical volatility during regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Holiday demand ramp (P40-P42) followed by a short-term dip (P43-P44); overall late Q4 volatility is high but mean demand appears to be settling around 45 units/period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is just before Christmas. Historically, demand for this SKU (Womens Lingerie) peaked in June/July (~85 units) and hit a seasonal low in October/November (~39 units). We saw a brief holiday ramp in late November (P40-P42), but demand in the last three periods (P43-P45) has returned to a lower average of approximately 34.3 units/period. The on-hand inventory is 25, but there is a massive pipeline of 262 units (largely from orders in P43 and P44 totaling 210 units). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high pipeline relative to the normalized late-season demand of ~35-40 units, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent stable demand (last 4 periods, avg ~34) to avoid unnecessary over-ordering. sigma_hat will use a slightly longer window (N=8) to capture the recent holiday volatility (P40-P45) to maintain a safety buffer without inflating the base stock excessively given the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization: Demand has returned to a low baseline (P44-P45 average 32.5) after the brief Nov/Dec peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-45.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the SKUs demand has entered a post-holiday trough. The last observed demand (Period 46) was 16 units, continuing a decline from the brief holiday peaks. In the four-period window following the peak (Periods 43-46), demand has averaged 29.75 units, significantly lower than the Q1/Q3 baseline of ~60 and the holiday volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 61 units, and there is a significant pipeline of 210 units (from orders in Periods 43 and 44 totaling 210). Given the low seasonal demand in late December/early January for this category (Womens Underwear), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 4 to reflect this immediate low-demand regime and prevent over-ordering while the large pipeline arrives. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand trough confirmed: Average demand for late December (P44-P46) has dropped to 27 units, reflecting a seasonal slowdown after the Nov/Dec volatility.
