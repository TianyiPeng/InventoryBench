The product is a 'Tilly' women's basic jersey t-shirt, an everyday item. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a significant upward trend from 0 to 84 units per week, suggesting the product was recently launched or is scaling for the Spring season. Calculating the pipeline requirement: I need to cover Period 1 (current), plus the lead time of 4 periods, for a total of 5 periods of demand. Using the most recent demand of 84 as a baseline, and anticipating a continued slight increase or stabilization as Spring approaches (mid-February), I forecast an average demand of 90-100 units. Pipeline target = 5 periods * 100 units/period = 500 units. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order 500 units to establish the pipeline and meet upcoming demand.",

Demand has been around 250 units/period (except for P13 which dropped to 147, likely a fluctuation or stockout-related reporting noise, though the system says demand was 147). To cover the lead time (L=4) plus current period (L+1=5), I need enough inventory/pipeline to cover demand from P14 to P18. Estimated demand for 5 periods @ 250/unit = 1250 units. Pipeline is 1450 units (P10: 250, P11: 450, P12: 425, P13: 325). The pipeline already covers the next 5 periods with a buffer of 200 units, which is appropriate given the potential for summer demand spikes. Because Holding Cost is high, I will order a small amount (150) to maintain a steady flow for P18 and beyond without excessively bloating the pipeline.",

With 196 units currently on hand and a demand rate of ~30-40 units, there is approximately 5-6 weeks of stock available. Given the game ends in Period 47 (5 periods from now) and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 47, which is the final period. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.0), carrying excess inventory into the final periods is risky. The current on-hand inventory (196) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining demand for Periods 43-47 (estimated at 5 * 35 = 175 units). Therefore, no further orders are required to maximize profit and minimize holding costs before the game ends.",

Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (P44) will arrive in the arrival resolution phase of Period 48, which is after the game ends. Therefore, no further units can physically arrive to satisfy demand within the game timeline. Furthermore, current on-hand inventory is 133 units. Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) is in a low-volume winter regime, averaging ~32 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P39-P43: 26, 25, 12, 64, 63). Even if demand spikes slightly due to holiday shopping, 133 units is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods (P44-P47). Holding costs are high ($1.0), equal to the profit ($1.0), so maintaining excess inventory is detrimental to the total reward. No new orders should be placed.",
