Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is 'Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p' (Womens Lingerie). Initial demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) show a mean of 120.4 and a standard deviation of 76.7. There is a potential upward trend with the most recent sample being 216, possibly due to proximity to Valentine's Day. Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, we need to establish a base stock levels immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current demand distribution, which results in mu_hat \u2248 (1+4) * 120.4 = 602 and sigma_hat \u2248 sqrt(5) * 76.7 \u2248 171.5. This setting should trigger a sufficient initial order to cover the pipeline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory, ordered 250 units, and faced a demand of 41 units which resulted in 41 units of lost sales. The 250 units ordered in Period 1 are currently 'In-transit'. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, these units are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (L+1 from order date) and will be visible at the start of Period 6. The historical demand samples (175, 46, 37, 127, 216) show significant volatility. The most recent sample from the prompt's history (Period 1 actual demand) was 41, which is low compared to the pre-game samples. Since we have no inventory and a 4-period lead time, we must maintain a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). Based on all available samples (including the pre-game 5 and P1's 41), the mean demand is roughly 107. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the backend will target the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to include the recent low demand point while accounting for previous higher spikes to ensure the backend doesn't over-correct too quickly while waiting for the P1 order to arrive.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Inventory is 0 on-hand with 485 units in-transit (P1: 250, P2: 235). Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the P1 order is expected to arrive at the end of Period 5 (visible in P6). Demand history shows a high initial spike (Jan 7: 175) followed by lower recent weeks (Feb 11: 41, Feb 18: 20). The product is 'Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p', a staple lingerie item. Because we have zero stock and high holding costs relative to profit (1:1), we must be cautious not to over-order while covering the lead-time window. The target base stock logic (q = profit / (profit + holding_cost)) will result in a 0.5 service level (z=0), effectively ordering to the mean demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the post-spike demand level while including the high Jan 28/Feb 4 values to ensure we aren't under-protected if demand returns to its February mean (~120).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is Women's Thong Underwear. Historically, the provided 5 samples (Jan-Feb) had a mean of 120.4, but observations for Period 1-3 show a sharp drop (41, 20, 6). This may be a post-holiday seasonal slump or 'settling' after a peak. Combined mean of the 8 samples is ~74. Lead time promised is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (250) and P2 (235) are still in transit and not expected to arrive until P5 and P6 respectively. On-hand is zero, resulting in lost sales, but ordering more now won't fix immediate stockouts due to the 4-period lead time. I will use recent_N for demand to track the recent cooling while preparing for L+1 (5 periods) of coverage. mu_hat is set to roughly (5 periods * 75 average demand).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a women's lingerie item (Thong). Historical demand samples showed an average around 100 units/week, but the most recent sample in the history (2019-02-04) was 216, and the observed demand in Period 4 was 147. Periods 1-3 showed much lower demand (41, 20, 6), suggesting high volatility or a recently ended clearance/stock-out effect. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 485 units in-transit. The orders placed in Period 1 (250 units) and Period 2 (235 units) have not yet arrived. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, the P1 order (ordered 2019/2/11) should arrive DURING Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. The high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0) suggests a critical ratio of 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target a base stock roughly equal to the mean demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand signals while smoothing out the very low Period 3, and use an explicit lead time of 4. Since we have zero on-hand and high in-transit, the backend's capped policy will likely prevent over-ordering until the first shipment arrives.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p' (Womens Lingerie). Data shows a significant demand increase in the last two periods (P4: 147, P5: 190), compared to the earlier baseline (P1-P3 avg: ~22). This suggests a demand regime shift potentially related to seasonality or product lifecycle. The first order from P1 (250 units) arrived in P5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). On-hand inventory is 60, with one order of 235 units in transit from P2 (expected in P6). To capture the recent spike while maintaining stability, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to include the transition from low to high demand, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. Method 'calculate' for L will be used as the actual lead time aligns with the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 4: Mean demand increased from ~22 to ~168 (+660%). Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The carry-over insights correctly identified a demand regime shift starting in Period 4. Pre-Period 4 demand averaged ~22 units, while Period 4-6 demand averaged ~171.6 units (147, 190, 178). This aligns with a product launch or seasonal shift for this thong SKU. In terms of lead time, we've had two successful arrivals (ordered P1, arrived P5; ordered P2, arrived P6), both confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4). Inventory status: On-hand is 117, with 109 units in-transit (ordered P6, expected P10). With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Our forecast (mu_hat) should be based on the recent high-demand regime. Using N=3 for the demand mean (Periods 4, 5, 6) gives an average of 171.67 units per period. 5 * 171.67 = 858.35. Sigma_hat will also be calculated based on this recent high-volatility period. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) allows the OR backend to target a high service level for this current peak.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019/4/1). The item is a Ginger Thong (Womens Lingerie). A significant demand regime shift was previously detected at Period 4, with demand jumping from an average of ~20 to over 150. However, the last period (Period 7) saw a sharp drop to 59 units. Analyzing the previous 4 periods of the new regime (P4-P7: 147, 190, 178, 59), the mean is 143.5. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new elevated but unstable demand level. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on deliveries in P5 and P6 arriving from orders in P1 and P2. Pipeline inventory is currently 318 (orders from P6 and P7), and on-hand is 58. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures we respond to the recent regime shift while accounting for the high variance introduced by the low Period 7 demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/08. Demand for this SKU (Womens Lingerie) showed a significant regime shift around Period 4 (March 2019), likely due to seasonal spring trends. However, demand in the last two periods (P7-P8) has dropped significantly to 59 and 17 respectively. This volatility suggests the initial surge might be cooling or highly variable. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5; P2 arrived P6). Currently, we have 41 on-hand and 559 in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect the order from P6 (109 units) to arrive in P10, P7 (209 units) in P11, and P8 (241 units) in P12. The pipeline is quite full (559 units) relative to recent low demand. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (which equal profit), I am setting mu_hat using a recent 5-period average (P4-P8) to balance the high March demand with the low April start, resulting in an average of ~84 units/period. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in April: following the P4-P6 surge (avg 171), P7-P8 demand dropped to an average of 38.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), the SKU (Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p) has an on-hand inventory of 0 and 559 units in-transit. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6. History shows high demand volatility: P4-P6 averaged ~171, while the recent three periods (P7-P9) dropped significantly to an average of 42.33. We are currently out of stock, and the order placed in P6 (109 units) is expected to arrive this period (P10), but will only be visible in P11. To avoid over-ordering during a demand slump while recognizing the recent high spikes, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (P5-P9) to capture both the peak and the recent decline. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for this heightened volatility. This approach balances the risk of holding too much inventory (given the high $1 holding cost relative to $1 profit) with the need to recover from the current stockout.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the history for SKU 465655010 (Womens Thong): We have experienced two distinct demand peaks. The first was in early March (P4-P6, avg 171) and the second is developing now in mid-April (P9-P10, avg 92.5). Between these peaks, demand dropped significantly (P7-P8, avg 38). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P10. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in P10 (134) exceeded arrival (109). However, there are 450 units in-transit: 209 from P7 (due P11/today), 241 from P8 (due P12). To account for the recent resurgence in demand while acknowledging the high volatility, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering the end of the first peak to the present). This balances the high demand of P4-P6 with the low periods P7-P8 and the current rise. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent with historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Second peak emerging in mid-April (P10 demand 134) following a low-demand period in early April (P7-P8 avg 38).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. This SKU (Womens Lingerie) has shown high demand volatility through March and April. A significant demand regime shift occurred at P4 (+660% increase), followed by fluctuations. The last 4 periods (P8-P11) have demand values of 17, 51, 134, and 37, averaging 59.75. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P6 arrived P10, P7 arrived P11). Currently, we have 172 units on-hand and an arrival of 241 units (ordered P8) is expected in P12 (visible in P13). Given the profit-to-holding ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand over (L+1) periods. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the volatile history from the start of the March peak through April (P4-P11 mean = 102.375), providing a stabilized estimate for the next 5 periods while the system works through the pipeline inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th. Historically, the demand for this SKU (women's lingerie) has shown significant volatility throughout March and April, alternating between high-demand weeks (e.g., P4-P6, P10) and low-demand weeks (e.g., P8, P12). In Period 12, demand dropped significantly to 16 units. However, looking at the full history since March (P4), the average demand across the last 9 periods is approximately 80 units. In-transit inventory is 105 units (ordered P11) and should arrive in P15 given the consistent 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is currently high (397), which is sufficient to cover about 5 periods of average demand. To prevent excessive holding costs given the $1/unit fee and the volatile nature of the product, I will use a recent demand window to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=9 for demand captures the 'active' regime starting from the first major spike (March 4th) through the most recent data point, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for both the spikes and the lulls.

Carry-over insight: Consistent 4-period lead time confirmed through P12 (P8 order arrived P12). High demand volatility continues; demand oscillates between peak levels (>130) and low levels (<40) every 2-3 weeks.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Historical demand for this item (Womens Lingerie) shows significant volatility, alternating between high (>130) and low (<40) demand weeks. The mean demand across the active regime (Period 4 to Period 13) is approximately 92.4 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (312 units) due to a large arrival in Period 12 followed by relatively low demand in periods 12 and 13. With 312 units on-hand and 105 in-transit (due Period 15), the total pipeline of 417 units is sufficient to cover approximately 4.5 periods of average demand (92.4 * 4.5 = 415.8). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the service level target (critical ratio) is 0.5. To account for the observed volatility while preventing excessive overstocking during this high-inventory phase, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand regime's mean and standard deviation, which reflects the recurring peaks and troughs.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/20. The item is 'Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p' (Womens Lingerie). Historical data shows high demand volatility, with peaks occurring roughly every 4-6 weeks (P4-P6, P10). Recently, demand has softened (P12-14: 16, 85, 33). Historically, the pre-P4 average was ~22, while the active regime from P4 onwards averages ~86. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent (confirmed most recently at P12). On-hand inventory is currently high (279) relative to recent demand, and there are 145 units in-transit (ordered at P11 and P14), which are expected at P15 and P18 respectively. Given Profit=Holding=$1, the target service level is 50%, though the backend caps the base stock. I will use a recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat to capture the 'active' regime from Period 4 onwards, while using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed in this period. Since on-hand + in-transit (424) likely covers the next (L+1=5) periods of demand at the average rate (~86 * 5 = 430), the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order to avoid excessive holding costs during this softening phase.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a pack of cotton thongs, which has exhibited significant demand volatility over the past 15 periods. After a high-demand period in March/April, demand has dropped significantly in May (P12-P15 demands: 16, 85, 33, 8). We are currently in a high inventory state (376 on-hand) relative to recent demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the P11 order arriving in P15. Given the current inventory levels and the recent downward trend in demand, the primary goal is to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining enough stock for potential spikes. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P11-P15) to capture the current low-demand regime (average demand ~36). Sigma is set using the same window to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the earlier transition period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: Demand decreased from an average of ~85 (P4-P11) to ~36 (P12-P15), indicating a move away from the early spring peak.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. The product is Women's Thong briefs, which typically see a peak in spring (March/April/May). Historical data shows a clear regime shift: Period 4-11 had highly volatile demand with several peaks >130 (avg ~85), but since Period 12, demand has significantly decelerated. Specifically, the last four periods (P13-P16) have recorded demands of 85, 33, 8, and 8, indicating that the seasonal peak has passed. The current on-hand inventory of 368 units is very high relative to this new low-demand regime (last 2 weeks avg = 8). With a holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $1.0, the target service level is 50% (q=0.5), meaning we should aim to hold approximately one period of demand as safety stock. Given the high on-hand levels, the priority is to avoid ordering and allow inventory to deplete. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5, covering the downturn since P12) to reflect the lower demand expected for June. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 12: Significant deceleration following the spring peak. Average demand dropped from ~85 (P4-P11) to ~28 (P12-P16), with the most recent two weeks showing single-digit demand (8 units).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 465655010 (Womens Thong Underwear) shows a clear shift. After a spring peak reaching over 100 units/week, demand has plummeted and stabilized at a very low level. For the last three periods (P15-P17), demand has been 8, 8, and 9 units respectively. On-hand inventory is currently 359 units, which covers nearly 40 weeks of demand at the current rate (~9 units/week). With a holding cost equal to the profit ($1.00), excess inventory is highly penalizing. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the post-peak deceleration (avg ~25/week) while allowing the OR backend to minimize further orders until the surplus is depleted.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a women's lingerie item (ginger thong), which showed significant demand spikes in March and April but has since entered a very low demand regime. Historical demand for the last seven periods (P12-P18) has been 16, 85, 33, 8, 8, 9, 1. Excluding the outlier of 85 in P13, the average demand is extremely low (~11 units per week). Currently, on-hand inventory is 398 units with 7 units in transit, while demand has dropped to near-zero (1 unit in P18). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, and the OR backend's capped policy will prioritize reducing this significant overstock. I am setting L to 4 as confirmed by recent arrivals (P14 arrived P18). I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand summer regime (P12-P18), which will result in a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand levels, effectively halting new orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Summer demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging ~7 units/week over the last 4 periods (P15-P18) compared to the higher volatility seen in early spring.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product (Womens Lingerie) has transitioned from a highly volatile spring peak to a very low-demand summer state. Over the last five periods (P15-P19), demand has averaged only ~5.4 units per week, with the most recent two weeks observing only 1 unit each. On-hand inventory is currently 404 units with zero in-transit, which is far in excess of foreseeable needs given the current demand regime. The critical objective is now to avoid further overstocking and allow the current inventory to deplete, minimizing the significant holding costs ($1.0/unit/period). Leading time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this low-demand state and prevent the OR backend from placing more orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains at a 'summer low' floor: average demand for P15-P19 is 5.4 units, a significant drop from the spring average. Previous high inventory levels from earlier orders are now resulting in a large surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-202.00

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Demand for this SKU (Womens Lingerie) was extremely low throughout June (averaging ~5 units until a sudden spike of 101 last week). Despite last week's spike, the 'on-hand' inventory is currently at 303 units, which is massive compared to the average demand over the last month (approx 20.2 units/week including the spike). This current inventory levels (303) covers over 15 weeks of demand at the recent average rate. There are no units in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the objective is to avoid any new orders while burning through the existing surplus. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent low-demand regime while acknowledging the P20 spike, which results in a mu_hat calculation that will not trigger an order due to the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in P20 (101 units) interrupted the summer low floor, but on-hand inventory remains excessively high (303 units), suggesting no ordering required for the foreseeable future.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand spiked unexpectedly to 274 units (Date: 2019/7/1), following a surge of 101 units in P20. This follows a long period of very low summer demand. This sequence (end of June/early July) suggests a significant mid-summer demand event, possibly a sale or seasonal clearing of thong briefs. My on-hand inventory has plummeted from 303 units to just 29 units. There is zero inventory in-transit because I intentionally stopped ordering during the high-surplus phase. With a 4-period lead time, I must order now to avoid a stockout, as the current 29 units will not cover even minor demand over the next 4 weeks if this new high-demand regime persists. I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods (avg 187.5) to capture this sudden spike, and L to the confirmed 4 periods. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant mid-summer demand spike detected: Period 20 (101 units) and Period 21 (274 units) ended the 'summer low' floor; average demand for this 2-week period is 187.5 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a significant mid-summer demand surge (Period 20: 101, Period 21: 274, Period 22: 225), which has completely depleted the previously excessive on-hand inventory. Demand over the last 3 periods has averaged 200 units, a sharp reversal from the 'summer low' seen in June. The order for 389 units placed last period (P22) is in-transit and expected in Period 26 (lead time = 4). However, current on-hand is 0, and lead time is 4 periods, meaning we face a stockout until that shipment arrives. Given the current demand intensity (~200/week), the pipeline (389 units) only covers approximately 2 weeks of this new demand regime. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this 200 unit/week average (5 * 200 = 1000 for L+1) and increase sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during peaks (std of 200, 274, 225 is roughly 38; sqrt(5)*38 approx 85). This will likely trigger a large order to cover the (L+1) window and rebuild a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Period 20-22 demand averaged 200 units/week, ending the June 'summer low' (avg ~5 units). Previous 'summer low' trend is no longer active.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (women's lingerie thong) has entered a high-demand mid-summer regime. Demand for the last four periods (P20-P23) was 101, 274, 225, and 145, averaging 186.25 units/week. This represents a significant shift from the June 'summer low'. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the previous two orders (P22=389, P23=263) are in-transit (total 652 units). Following a 4-period lead time, the P22 order is expected in P26 and the P23 order in P27. Since the target stock (base stock = (L+1) * mu) for a 5-week window (L=4) at the current mean (186.25) is approximately 931 units, and we currently have 652 units in the pipeline, the OR backend will calculate a need for more inventory to maintain the desired service level despite high holding costs. We set L to 4 (confirmed by history) and use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime while budgeting for its volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a high-demand summer surge, starting around late June (Period 20). Over the last five periods (P20-P24), demand averages 190.8 units per week (101, 274, 225, 145, 209). Currently, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 932 units in-transit. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P15 order arrived P19). The orders placed in P22 (389 units), P23 (263 units), and P24 (280 units) are scheduled to arrive in Period 26, 27, and 28 respectively. Since the lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. My current in-transit (932) divided by 190.8 (recent mean) covers approx 4.88 periods. To ensure we maintain stock during this high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the surge period) and keeping Lead Time at 'calculate' as the 4-period window is stable. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current high volatility (Std Dev of ~66 units per week).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand surge confirmed: Period 20-24 average demand is 190.8 units per week, significantly higher than the previous June low of ~5 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a high-demand summer seasonal peak (mid-July to August). Period 20-25 demand has been consistently high, averaging 184.7 units per week (101, 274, 225, 145, 209, 154). We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and awaiting arrivals from the surge orders placed starting in Period 22. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The order from P22 (389 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 26, which will satisfy immediate demand. Total pipeline inventory is 954 units, covering roughly 5 weeks of current demand. Given the high demand and lead time of 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current high-demand regime, and keep lead time at the calculated average (4). This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period window (L+1) until the next replenishment cycle completes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-247.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand mid-summer regime. Period 26 demand was 71, but the average from Period 20 to 25 was approximately 184 units/week. We are in Period 27 (Aug 12). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 318 following the arrival of the P22 order (389 units). Total in-transit is 565 (orders from P23, P24, P25). Total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) = 883. Given the demand average of ~184, the requirements for L+1 (5 periods) is approximately 920 units. However, current on-hand is significant (318) and another 263 units (ordered P23) are expected to arrive in Period 27's resolution phase. I will set mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (N=7 covers P20-P26) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this summer surge, while the pipeline inventory check in the OR backend should naturally limit new orders due to the high volume already in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge (P20-P26) average demand is 158 units/week, characterized by high volatility (range 71-274).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The 'mid-summer demand surge' (Periods 20-27) is ongoing, with demand averaging approximately 158 units per week. Although demand is high, we are currently in an overstock position due to large arrivals from orders placed in July. Specifically, Period 26 and 27 arrivals (652 units total) have boosted on-hand inventory to 381, and there are still 302 units in-transit (orders from P24 and P25). Combining on-hand and in-transit (683 units) provides enough stock to cover roughly 4.3 weeks of demand at the current high-demand rate (158 units/week). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit), the inventory position is already near the estimated base stock level for the current regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the duration of the summer surge) to capture the current mean and volatility, allowing the OR backend to recalculate the base stock. No new order is expected to be placed by the OR engine this period due to the existing pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are in the midst of a sustained mid-summer demand surge that began around Period 20 (late June). Demand over the last 9 periods (P20-P28) has averaged 166.7 units per week, significantly higher than the early June lows. The most recent demand (P28) was 191 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 470 and in-transit units at 201 (from P25 and P28 orders), our total pipeline is 671 units. Given (L+1) = 5, we need to cover approximately 5 * 167 = 835 units of demand. Current inventory levels are slightly below this requirement. I will use the recent 9-period window to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. This will likely trigger a small replenishment order to maintain service levels as we head into September.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (starting P20) remains active: Period 20-28 average demand is 166.7 units/week, characterized by high volatility (range 71-274).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Analysis shows a sustained demand regime starting at Period 20 (late June), characterized by high mean demand and high volatility. The average demand from P20 to P29 is approximately 166 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on arrivals in Periods 26, 27, 28, and 29. Inventory management is currently complex: on-hand inventory is 312 units, with 381 in-transit (orders from P28 and P29). Total pipeline inventory is 693. Given (L+1) = 5 periods of protection, and an average demand of 166 units (5 * 166 = 830), the current pipeline is slightly below the target base stock required for this high-demand regime. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entirety of this mid-summer/autumn shift (regime length = 10 periods).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The 'mid-summer demand surge' that began around Period 20 (late June) is still active but showing typical high volatility. The average demand for the most recent regime (P20-P30) is approximately 157.9 units per week. Although demand in Period 30 dropped to 70 units, the overall trend since late July remains high compared to the spring/early summer lows. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 242, with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 563 units (ordered in P28, P29, and P30). Given the high pipeline and the current on-hand stock, the OR backend's capped policy will manage the actual order quantity to avoid overstocking while maintaining the service level for the (L+1) window. I will set mu_hat based on the last 11 periods (P20-P30) to capture the current high-demand regime, and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the high volatility observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P20-P30) confirmed: Mean demand is ~158 units/week with high volatility (range 70-274). Pipeline inventory is currently high (563 units) following the July/August ordering surge.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in the 'Mid-summer demand regime' which has shown significant strength since Period 20, though the most recent two weeks (P30: 70 units, P31: 33 units) show a potential cooling-off period as we transition out of summer. Despite this recent slowdown, the average demand from Period 20 to Period 31 is approximately 147 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of the P25 order in P29. Inventory position is currently very high: On-hand is 209 and In-transit is 586 (total 795). With an expected demand of ~147/week, we have approximately 5.4 weeks of coverage. Since the lead time is 4 periods (needing 5 periods of coverage for L+1), and we already have 5.4, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a very small or zero order. I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the full scope of the summer regime while acknowledging the high volatility (sigma_hat).

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected in September: P30-P31 demand averaged 51.5 units, down from the P20-P29 average of 166 units (-69%).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 465655010 has entered a clear deceleration phase in September. Following a high-volume mid-summer regime (avg ~160 units), demand for P30-P32 has dropped significantly to 70, 33, and 25 units respectively (avg ~43 units). Current on-hand inventory is 363 units, which is already sufficient to cover over 8 weeks of current demand levels. Furthermore, there are 409 units in-transit (ordered P29-P32), which will significantly increase the surplus. Given that the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), maintaining excess inventory is highly detrimental to total reward. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent sharp drop in demand and ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation recognizes the lower requirement, preventing unnecessary new orders while we bleed off the existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed in September: Period 30-32 average demand dropped to 42.7 units, a 73% decrease from the mid-summer average of 158 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 465655010 has entered a clear deceleration phase in September. The mid-summer surge (P20-P29), which averaged ~166 units/week, has ended. Over the last four periods (P30-P33), demand has plummeted to 70, 33, 25, and 25 units respectively, yielding a recent average of ~38 units/week. Simultaneously, large orders placed during the summer peak are still arriving; P32 and P33 saw arrivals of 179 and 202 units, swellng the on-hand inventory to 540 units. With an additional 207 units in-transit (orders from P30-P32), the total pipeline of 747 units is extremely high relative to the current demand regime. Specifically, the current inventory covers roughly 19 weeks of demand at the new lower rate. To prevent further excessive holding costs while the backend policy manages this surplus, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods and mu_hat to reflect the new lower demand regime using the last 4 periods (N=4). Sigma_hat is also adjusted to the recent volatility profile. No new ordering is expected given the current stock levels.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655010 (Womens Thong Briefs) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime following the mid-summer peak. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) has dropped significantly to 32.6 units, compared to the summer high of ~160. Most recently, P34 demand was only 10 units. We are entering October, and historical patterns/carry-over insights suggest that following seasonal peaks, demand for this category stabilizes at a much lower floor. Current on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 712 units, which is enough to cover more than 20 periods of current demand levels. Pipeline inventory includes 25 units (from P31/P32) arriving soon. Given that holding costs equal profit ($1.00), minimizing further arrivals is critical to prevent significant losses from overstocking. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent deceleration while maintaining a conservative lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor confirmed for Autumn: Period 30-34 average demand is 32.6 units, a ~79% decrease from the mid-summer regime (P20-P29 avg 158). On-hand inventory is excessively high (712 units) relative to current demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655010 (Womens Thong Underwear) is currently in a demand trough, with the autumn period (P30-P35) showing an average demand of 27.2 units, a drastic reduction from the summer peak (P20-P29 avg 158). The current inventory position is extremely high: on-hand inventory is 730 units, which, at the current 6-week average demand, covers approximately 26 periods of supply. The backend logic will attempt to order based on the critical ratio of profit/(profit+holding cost) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 (z=0). My objective is to prevent any further ordering until this massive surplus is depleted. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 (capturing the autumn regime) to reflect the lower demand accurately, while keeping lead time at 'default' (4 weeks confirmed). With on-hand (730) far exceeding the base stock calculated from these parameters, the OR engine will correctly skip ordering (final order = 0).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in the 'Autumn floor' demand regime which started around Period 30 (early September). For the last 7 periods (P30-P36), demand has averaged 24.9 units, but remarkably, the last three periods (P34-P36) have dropped to single digits: 10, 5, and 6 units. The on-hand inventory is currently at 726 units, which is extremely high (nearly 30x the average weekly demand of the current regime). There are no more units in transit. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0/unit), the optimal base stock (q=0.5) is simply the mean demand over the lead time (L+1). With demand currently averaging ~7 units over the last 3 weeks, and even conservatively using the 7-week average of ~25 units, the current inventory is far more than enough to cover the rest of the game (11 periods left). I will set parameters to reflect this low demand state to ensure the OR backend does not place any new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Autumn demand has plummeted further from ~40 units to single digits, averaging 7 units/week over P34-P36.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a very low-demand autumn regime. Period 37 demand was only 1 unit, and the average for the last four periods (P34-P37) is 5.5 units. On-hand inventory is extremely high at 725 units, which covers over 100 weeks of current demand levels. Since the holding cost equals the profit per unit ($1.00), carrying this excess inventory is very expensive. My objective is to prevent any further ordering. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect this low-demand state. Given that on-hand inventory (725) vastly exceeds any reasonable base stock calculation for a mean of 5.5, the OR engine will naturally suppress all new orders. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand floor confirmed (P34-P37): average demand has stabilized at ~5.5 units per week, a further drop from the September average of ~43 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 465655010 has entered a deep autumn/winter floor. Since Period 34 (late September), demand has consistently remained in the single digits, with the most recent three periods (P36-P38) showing demand of 6, 1, and 2 units respectively. The current on-hand inventory is 723 units, which is massive relative to the current average demand of ~5.5 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to minimize holding costs while the system burns through this surplus. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary refill orders, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture only this low-demand autumn regime (approx. 5 units/week). With 723 units on hand and 0 in-transit, there is enough stock to cover over 100 weeks of demand at the current rate, so no new orders will be generated.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a confirmed low-demand autumn/winter floor. Demand over the last 6 periods (P34-P39) has been minimal: 10, 5, 6, 1, 2, 0, averaging 4.0 units per week. This is a significant drop from the mid-summer peak (~158 units) and even the September deceleration (~43 units). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 723 units, which is enough to cover over 180 weeks of demand at the current rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by P32 arrival). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high inventory, the primary objective is to stop all ordering and allow inventory to deplete. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to reflect this new low-demand regime, ensuring the base stock calculation stays well below current inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 confirmed: Average weekly demand has dropped to 4.0 units (P34-P39), marking a move into a stable low-demand winter baseline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is a women's lingerie item (thong briefs). Historically, demand for this SKU follows strong seasonal patterns: a peak in spring, a summer surge in July/August, and a significant drop-off starting in September. We are currently in a very low-demand winter period; demand for the last seven periods (P34-P40) has averaged only 5.3 units/week. On-hand inventory is extremely high at 710 units, which is enough to cover over 130 weeks of demand at the current rate. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. My strategy is to minimize holding costs by not ordering and using 'recent_N' with N=7 for both demand and volatility to reflect the current stable low-demand environment. No orders will be triggered by the OR engine due to the massive inventory surplus.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in Period 42 out of 47. The product is a women's thong, which saw a major demand surge in mid-summer (P20-P29) and a significant drop starting in September (P30). Recent demand (P34-P41) has been very low, averaging around 11 units/week, despite a minor increase to 61 units in Period 41 (likely a pre-Black Friday or seasonal fluctuation). On-hand inventory is extremely high at 649 units, which covers over 50 weeks of current average demand. Because the holding cost equals the profit per unit ($1.00), excess inventory is highly penalized. No new orders are needed as we approach the end of the game (Period 47). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 8 periods (P34-P41) to capture the current low-demand winter baseline while acknowledging the recent uptick, ensuring the base stock level remains below the current on-hand inventory to prevent unnecessary ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Minor demand uptick to 61 units in P41, but overall P34-P41 regime remains low (avg 11 units/week). Massive inventory surplus (649 units) dominates decision-making for the remaining 5 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its final 5 periods (P43-P47). Current on-hand inventory is 270 units. Recent history shows a massive demand spike in Period 42 (379 units), likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday (Date: 2019/11/25). While this spike depleted a significant portion of the previous inventory surplus, demand over the preceding 8 weeks (P34-P41) averaged only 11 units. Given the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (P43) would arrive in Period 47, the final period of the game. With 270 units on hand and 5 periods remaining, the inventory covers an average demand of 54 units per period. Even with the recent spike, the overall trend since September suggests that 270 units is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods without incurring additional holding costs from new orders. Parameters are set to reflect the most recent demand regime (last 3 periods) to capture the spike while effectively zeroing out new orders to manage the end-of-game holding cost risks.

Carry-over insight: End-of-year demand spike detected: Period 42 (Black Friday week) saw demand of 379 units, significantly higher than the Autumn/Winter baseline. Inventory management now focuses on liquidation and avoiding end-of-game holding costs.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 of 47. The most recent demand (Period 43) was only 3 units, following the Black Friday spike of 379 units in Period 42. While a final holiday demand spike could occur around Christmas, the game ends in Period 47. Any order placed now with the confirmed 4-period lead time would arrive in Period 48 (at the start of P48's decision phase), which is after the game concludes. Therefore, those units would generate zero revenue and only incur holding costs if the simulation continued. Currently, we have 267 units on-hand and 479 units in-transit (set to arrive in P47). This total inventory of 746 units is more than enough to cover any potential remaining demand in the final 4 periods (P44-P47) without additional ordering. I will set the OR parameters to baseline levels, knowing the high inventory and remaining lead time will naturally result in zero additional orders.

Carry-over insight: Final order window closed: Orders placed after Period 43 will not arrive before the game ends in Period 47 due to the 4-period lead time.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is currently in Period 45 out of 47. With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) would arrive in Period 49, which is after the simulation concludes (Period 47). Therefore, the decision window for ordering has closed. Currently, there are 256 units on-hand and 479 units in-transit (ordered in Period 43, expected arrival in Period 47 resolution). Given that recent demand (excluding the Black Friday peak in P42) has returned to a low winter baseline (3 units in P43, 11 units in P44), the existing on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover the final two periods. My objective is to avoid adding any more inventory that would incur holding costs and remain unsold at the end. I will set the base stock parameters to zero or effectively zero by using explicit low values to ensure no new orders are triggered by the backend, as the pipeline and on-hand inventory already far exceed likely demand.

Carry-over insight: Final order window closed: As of Period 44, no new orders should be placed as they will not arrive before the game ends in Period 47 due to the 4-period lead time.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 of 47. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Any order placed now in Period 46 would only arrive in Period 50 (46 + 4), which is past the end of the simulation (Period 47). Consequently, ordering is no longer a viable strategy for meeting demand within the game's timeframe. Furthermore, the on-hand inventory is 248 units, which is significantly higher than the average demand observed in the post-Black Friday period (Periods 43-45 avg: ~7 units). Even the massive 'in-transit' volume of 479 units (from Period 43) will likely arrive too late to be sold or will only contribute to excessive holding costs if they arrive in Period 47. The objective now is to minimize holding costs for the final period by not adding any further inventory. Parameters are set to effectively zero out further orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-238.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 is the final period of the game. The current status shows on-hand inventory of 243 units and in-transit inventory of 479 units. Since the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would not arrive until long after the game has concluded (Period 51). Furthermore, the on-hand inventory of 243 is already significantly higher than any projected demand for this final week, which historically remains at a low baseline (5 units in P46, 8 in P45). With a holding cost equal to profit ($1.0), the objective is to minimize ending inventory to avoid penalties. No ordering is required.
