Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 695584001 is a 'Bono hip belt'. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 0, 0, 37, 61, 109 over the last 5 weeks. This suggests a product launch or a seasonal ramp-up (approaching spring fashion). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent growth (avg ~69 units/week) and 'default' for lead time and sigma. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's hip belt. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 0, 0, 37, 61, 109, and most recently 63 (though sales were 0 due to 0 stock). The average demand over the last 4 active weeks is approx 67.5 ((37+61+109+63)/4). Given the 'Women's accessories' category and the late February date, we are entering the Spring season where demand for belts often stabilizes or increases. On-hand inventory is 0. An order of 145 units was placed in Period 1 and is in-transit with a promised lead time of 4. Therefore, arrivals are expected around Period 5. We need to set parameters to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=4 for demand forecasting to capture the growth since Late January while ignoring the initial zero-demand weeks.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historical demand (post-initialization) shows a clear upward trend: 37, 61, 109, 63, 90. The mean of the last 3 periods is 87.3. I will use N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this current regime while ignoring the zero/low values from early January. Promised lead time (L) is 4. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order is scheduled for arrival in P5), and we have 0 on-hand inventory with 262 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since demand > sales (due to stockout), we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a women's belt, which shows a rising demand trend in early February (61 to 109 units) but has faced stockouts because arrivals haven't started. Promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive in Period 5 and be visible to me in Period 6. Therefore, 'arrived=0' in Periods 1-3 is expected behavior. Historical demand samples (0, 0, 37, 61, 109) and the first three game periods (63, 90, 60) show a significant increase from zero to an average of roughly 70-80 units per week. The last sample (P3) showed 60. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture this active regime while smoothing the volatility. I will keep L at default (4) as no orders have reached their promised delivery time yet to suggest a delay.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is a women's hip belt. Historical demand samples (before the game) showed an upward trend (37, 61, 109), but game history (Periods 1-4) shows a stabilization/slight decline (63, 90, 60, 57). The mean demand over these 7 samples is approx 68. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are at the start of Period 5, it is normal that arrivals for orders placed in Period 1 (L=4) have not yet been observed in a 'conclude' message. The first arrival (from Period 1) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 388 units in transit (145 + 117 + 126). I will use recent_N for demand to capture the recent stabilization around 68 units/week, and default settings for lead time until we observe actual delivery performance.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's belt, which generally exhibits stable demand but may see slight shifts with spring fashion cycles. The demand history shows an initial ramp-up in late January/early February (0, 0, 37, 61, 109) followed by a stabilization in the recent five periods: P1=63, P2=90, P3=60, P4=57, P5=48, averaging ~64 units/period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (P1) arrived in P5 (4 periods), confirming the promised lead time for now. On-hand inventory is 97, with 243 units in-transit (orders from P2 and P3). Since P2 and P3 were significantly sized (117, 126), and are expected to arrive in P6 and P7 respectively, we have a healthy pipeline. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (P1-P5) to reflect this stable 'post-launch' baseline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the volatility during this period. L is kept at default as the observation matches the promise.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product is a women's hip belt. Historical demand following the initial launch phase (first 2 weeks of February) has stabilized. Demand over the last 4 periods (P3-P6) has been 60, 57, 48, and 59, respectively, showing a consistent regime of approximately 56 units per week. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrivals in P5 and P6. Currently, we have 155 units on hand and 126 units in transit (ordered in P3). In-transit inventory covers the pipeline for the next 4 periods given the current demand rate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stabilized demand regime (avg ~56/week) and keep lead time at 'default' (4 periods). This results in a mu_hat of approx 280 (5 periods * 56), ensuring we cover potential demand through the lead time plus the review period without excessive holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-launch: avg demand approx 56 units/week (Periods 3-6). Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a women's hip belt. We have observed a stable demand regime since the initial launch spikes. For the last 5 periods (P3-P7), demand has averaged 59.6 units (60, 57, 48, 59, 74). The lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on deliveries from P1, P2, and P3. Currently, we have 207 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 periods * ~60 units/period = 300 units required pipeline. Since existing pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 207, the OR backend needs to place an order. I am using recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable post-launch phase and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains at the default promised/observed value of 4.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Historical demand analysis shows an initial launch spike in the early samples followed by stabilization. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 61.2 units (48, 59, 74, 68). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed through order arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7. The inventory position is currently 139 units on-hand plus 82 units in-transit (ordered Period 8), totaling 221 units. Since we are in Period 9 and demand occurs after our decision, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a forecasted demand of ~61 units per week, the target base stock is approximately 305 units. Subtracting the current total inventory (221) suggests a need for replenishment. I'm using recent_N for both demand and lead-time estimation to capture the post-launch stabilization regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-launch: Period 5-8 average demand is 62 units/week. Lead time consistently holds at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's hip belt. Reviewing the historical data since inventory first arrived (Period 5), demand has been relatively stable: P5 (48), P6 (59), P7 (74), P8 (68), and P9 (51). The average demand over these 5 periods is 60 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). The objective is to cover demand for L+1 (4+1=5) periods. With \u03bc=60, target base stock is approximately 300 units. Current inventory status: On-hand (88) + In-transit (160) = 248 units. The OR backend will calculate the order based on mu_hat = (1+L) * mean. Setting L to 'default' (4) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (the period since arrivals began) aligns the backend's forecast with the stable post-launch demand of ~60 units/week.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stable demand regime (Periods 5-9): average units/week = 60. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the 'Bono hip belt' has transitioned into a stable demand regime following its initial launch phase. Analyzing history from Period 5 to Period 10, demand has averaged approximately 58 units per week (48, 59, 74, 68, 51, 47), though there is a Slight downward trend in the last few weeks. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7 originating from orders in Periods 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Based on the 4-period lead time, the order placed in Period 8 is expected to arrive during Period 12 and will be visible at the start of Period 13. Currently, on-hand inventory is 41 with 212 units in-transit. Given equal profit and holding costs ($1.00), the backend targets a 50% service level which requires the base stock to cover mean demand over L+1 periods. I will use the recent 6 periods (matching the stable post-launch phase) for demand forecasting to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while relying on the default promised lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. The product is a women's belt ('Bono hip belt'), and the date is late April. Historically, demand has stabilized around a mean of 60 units/week since the post-launch surge (Periods 5-11 mean is 57.5). On-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 11 where demand (56) exceeded starting inventory (41). However, we have 249 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the 82 units ordered in Period 8 are expected to arrive during the execution of Period 12 and be available for sale in Period 13. The pipeline includes orders from Period 8 (82), P9 (78), P10 (52), and P11 (37). Given the profit and holding cost are identical ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, aiming to keep inventory close to the expected mean demand across the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (Periods 5-11), and use the same for sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The SKU is a 'Bono hip belt' (Accessories). Historical demand has stabilized following an initial launch phase (Periods 1-2). Examining the post-launch period (Periods 3-12), the mean demand is approximately 56.9 units/week. Most recently (Periods 8-12), demand has been slightly lower but consistent (68, 51, 47, 56, 49), averaging 54.2 units/week. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, P3, and P8 all arriving after exactly 4 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 206 reflects orders placed in P9 (78), P10 (52), P11 (37), and P12 (39). We are currently in Period 13; the P9 order (78 units) is expected to arrive during this period and become visible at the start of Period 14. Inventory is currently low (33 units) because of the gap in ordering between P4 and P7, but arrivals are now resuming regularly. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the stable post-launch demand mean and variance while filtering out the early volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). The product is a women's belt, which generally exhibits stable demand but can fluctuate slightly with fashion seasons. Reviewing historical demand from Period 5 onwards (when stockouts stopped biasing data), the average weekly demand is approximately 53 units. However, there has been a notable decline in demand over the last three periods (56, 49, 27), with Period 13 showing a significant drop to 27 units. While this could be noise, I must be cautious about overstocking given the equal weighting of profit and holding cost ($1.0 each). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since current on-hand (84) plus in-transit (174) equals 258 units, and our expected demand for the (L+1=5) lookahead period at the current average (53) is 265, the pipeline is very well balanced. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent trend (average 47.8), and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of the recent period including the sudden drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in May; Period 13 demand dropped significantly to 27 (vs ~55 avg). Monitoring for a potential seasonal slowdown.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (May 20, 2019), we observe a significant and sustained drop in demand for the 'Bono hip belt'. The last two weeks (Periods 13 and 14) recorded demand of 27 and 22, compared to the previous average of ~60. This suggests a seasonal shift as we move further into May. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on arrivals from orders in Periods 8, 9, and 10. With current on-hand inventory at 114 and in-transit at 122 (orders from P11, P12, and P13), we are overstocked relative to the new demand levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this lower demand regime (averaging ~32 units/week) to minimize holding costs, while maintaining L at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 13: Average demand decreased from ~60 to ~25-30 units/week (-50% drop). Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/27. A significant demand regime shift was confirmed starting in Period 13 (early May). The average demand has dropped from approximately 60 units/week to roughly 21 units/week over the last three periods (27, 22, 14). This item (a grained imitation leather belt) appears to be experiencing a seasonal slowdown or post-launch decline. On-hand inventory is currently high at 137 units due to previous orders arriving against this lower demand. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the high on-hand (137) and in-transit (85) totaling 222 units, which covers roughly 10 periods of current demand, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and allow the OR backend to stop ordering and bleed off excess inventory. Lead time is set to default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand decline intensified: Period 13-15 average is 21 units/week, a 65% drop from the Period 5-11 average of 60.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '695584001' (Bono hip belt) has entered a clear low-demand regime since early May (Period 13). The demand in the last four periods has been 27, 22, 14, and 8, significantly lower than the previous average of ~60. The current date is June 3rd, indicating we are moving away from spring into early summer, where demand for this specific imitation leather belt appears to have dropped sharply. The current on-hand inventory is 168 units, which is extremely high given that the most recent weekly demand was only 8 units. With 46 units still in-transit (expected in Period 17 conclude) and a lead time of 4 periods, our pipeline is over-saturated. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low-demand trend (mean ~17.75) and prevent the OR engine from placing unnecessary orders that would incur high holding costs ($1/unit). Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline confirmed: Period 13-16 average demand dropped to 17.75 units/week (-70% vs P5-11 avg). Highly seasonal slowdown for this SKU in June.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-190.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant seasonal decline. Demand has dropped from a pre-May average of approximately 60 units/week to a recent average (Periods 13-17) of 16.6 units/week. Specifically, the last three periods (15, 16, 17) showed demands of 14, 8, and 12 units respectively, suggesting a new low-demand floor of around 10-12 units/week. Currently, on-hand inventory is 202 units with zero in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current inventory level, we have over 12 weeks of stock (202 / 16.6) based on recent averages, or 16-20 weeks based on the most recent 3-week trend. This is well above the (L+1) requirement. I will set mu_hat to capture the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to reflect this collapse in demand and prevent the system from ordering more. L remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor established: Units/week stabilized at approx 10-15 units starting Period 15 (June). Inventory levels are currently excessive for this demand regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The SKU (Bono hip belt) has entered a significantly low-demand regime since mid-May, with recent weekly demands of 14, 8, 12, and 8 units. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P15-P18) is 10.5 units/week. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 194 units and a forecasted demand of ~10 units/week, the current stock covers nearly 19 weeks of demand. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), and the significant overstock, the objective is to prevent any further ordering. I will adjust mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods of the low-demand regime (N=4) to reflect the current pace (~52.5 for L+1). The OR backend's cap mechanism, combined with the large pipeline/on-hand surplus relative to this updated base stock, will correctly result in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor stabilized at approx 10 units/week (P15-P18). Total inventory significantly exceeds current demand requirements.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-demand summer regime. Since Period 15 (May 20), weekly demand has stabilized at a very low level: 14, 8, 12, 8, and 18 units, respectively. The current average demand for the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is 12 units/week. With on-hand inventory at 176 units and zero in-transit, the current stock covers over 14 weeks of demand at the current rate (176 / 12 = 14.6 periods). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to stop ordering by setting parameters that reflect the current lower demand while maintaining a high service level calculation, allowing the OR backend to naturally deplete the significant overstock. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 695584001 showed a sharp increase to 53 units in Period 20, following a six-week period (P14-P19) where demand averaged only 13.6 units/week. This spike suggests a potential exit from the seasonal summer floor noted in previous insights, or a mid-summer promotional event. However, on-hand inventory (123 units) is still extremely high, covering approximately 9 weeks of demand even at the new higher rate of 53 units/period, or ~24 weeks at the previous low average. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and the high holding cost (Profit=1, Holding=1), there is no immediate need to order additional units until the stock level normalizes or the higher demand proves sustained. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend of the past month and a half, acknowledging the recent spike while not over-ordering against the high existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 20 with a spike to 53 units, breaking the low-demand floor (~11-15 units/week) observed since Period 15. Monitoring to see if this represents a sustained recovery or a one-off event. Current inventory remains more than sufficient to cover multiple lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Bono hip belt has clearly exited its low-demand summer floor (which was ~10-15 units/week) and is experiencing a significant recovery. Recent demand in Period 20 (53 units) and Period 21 (77 units) indicates a return to, and potentially an exceedance of, the previous stable regime of ~60 units/week observed between Periods 5-11. Current on-hand inventory is 46 units with 0 units in-transit, which is insufficient to cover a 4-period lead time plus the review period (total 5 periods of exposure) at the current demand velocity. Therefore, I need to signal the OR backend to place an order. I am setting L to 'default' (4 periods) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the sharp upward shift from the floor (averaging P19: 18, P20: 53, P21: 77 \u2248 49.3/week). This should result in a total mu_hat estimate of ~246.5 for the 5-period window, triggering a necessary replenishment order while on-hand inventory is still 46.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: SKU exited June floor (~11 units/week) with significant increases in Period 20 (53) and Period 21 (77). Evidence suggests a return to the Spring regime (avg ~60).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently transitioning from a significant June seasonal slowdown back into a high-demand regime, likely associated with Summer/Pre-Fall fashion cycles. Recent demand (P20-P22) has surged from ~11 units/week to 53, 77, and now 109 units/week\u2014surpassing the initial Spring average of ~60. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The 99 units ordered in Period 22 are in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 26. Since Period 23 demand is still trending upward and the previous regime (P5-P11) averaged 60, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 350 to cover (1+L=5) periods at an estimated average of 70 units/week. This balances the recent sharp peak (109) with a conservative estimate of the sustained return to high demand. Sigma_hat is set to 120 (recent_N=4) to account for the high volatility seen during the recovery. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 4 periods as consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery accelerated: Period 22 demand reached 109 units, confirming a full exit from the June seasonal floor and exceeding previous Spring levels (avg ~60). Current out-of-stock situation necessitates higher base stock to rebuild service levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant demand surge in July after a June lull, consistent with seasonal accessory trends. Demand skyrocketed from a floor of ~11 units to 53, 77, 109, and most recently 173 in Period 23. This is a clear regime shift. The product is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Period 22 and 23 orders (totalling 233 units) are in transit. Using the promised lead time of 4 periods, these will arrive in Periods 26 and 27. Demand is currently outpacing the previous 'Spring' average of 60; the last 4 periods average 103 units. To capture this momentum and rebuild stock, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the high-velocity regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: July demand has accelerated sharply (P20-P23 avg: 103 units/week), significantly exceeding both the June floor (~11) and the Spring average (~60). This is a seasonal peak.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand seasonal peak (July). Recent demand (P20-P24) transitioned from a June floor (~11 units) to a sharp spike: 53, 77, 109, 173, and 106. The average of the last 4 periods (P21-P24) is approximately 116 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and lead time has consistently been 4 periods. With lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. To estimate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new high-demand regime (116 * 5 = 580). This ensures the OR engine aims for a base stock that accounts for the current peak while we wait for the 422 units in-transit to arrive. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect the increased volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: High-demand peak confirmed in July: Average demand for P21-P24 is 116 units/week, up from ~11 in June. Currently experiencing stockouts while awaiting in-transit recovery.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand peak period (Late July/Early August). While June saw a significant decline (~11 units/week), July has seen a sharp resurgence with demand peaking at 173 (Period 23) and currently averaging approximately 114 units/week over the last 4 periods (P22-P25). We are currently out-of-stock (on-hand: 0) with a large pipeline (582 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the backend target service level is 50%, but our parameters need to reflect the current high-demand regime to ensure the orders placed now cover future demand. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current peak (P21-P25), which balances the explosive growth of early July with the slight cooling observed in P25 (from 106 to 68). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as historical performance has been very consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-demand peak confirmed: Period 21-25 average demand is 106.6 units/week. Recent data suggests demand may be peaking and starting to stabilize around 100-110 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 695584001 (Women's belt) is in a high-demand seasonal peak. After a significant floor in June (~11 units/week), demand surged in July/August. The most recent demand samples (P23-P26) are 173, 106, 68, and 87. While P23 was a massive spike, the average of the last 4 periods is approximately 108.5 units/week. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by the arrival of the P22 order in P26). At the start of P27, we have 12 units on-hand and 483 units in-transit (orders from P23, P24, P25). The total pipeline plus on-hand (495) needs to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Given an estimated demand of ~100-110 units/week, the 5-week requirement is ~500-550 units. Currently, our inventory position is slightly below this target, but since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the backend OR logic will naturally be conservative to avoid excess stock as the peak potentially tapers off in late August. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime while allowing for the volatility seen in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: High-demand peak stabilized: P23-P26 average demand is 108.5 units/week. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand August regime following a significant July peak. Demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P24-P27: 106, 68, 87, 91) with an average of approximately 88 units/week. While this is lower than the absolute peak of 173 (P23) or 109 (P22), it is significantly higher than the early-year spring average of ~60. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 55 units on-hand and 397 in-transit (reflecting large orders placed during the stockout phase in late July), the pipeline is currently very full. However, to maintain the targeted service level for the current demand regime (~88 units/week), I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this post-peak stabilization while ensuring the backend accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). No major new trend is detected beyond the stabilization already noted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-68.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained peak season (July-August), following a significant demand recovery from its June floor. Analyzing recent demand: Period 26-28 saw demand of 87, 91, and 88 units respectively, indicating that the initial sharp volatility of the July peak (which reached 173 units in P23) has stabilized into a more predictable high-demand regime around 90 units/week. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Current inventory (on-hand: 156, in-transit: 208) is healthy. With a stable demand of ~90 units/week and L=4, the coverage required for the OR backend's base stock (L+1) is approximately 450 units. My parameters use 'recent_N' with N=4 (covering P25-P28) to capture this stabilized high-demand level while moving away from the extreme spike in P23, ensuring we maintain high service levels without over-ordering as the season potentially matures.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in late August: Average demand for P26-P28 is 88.7 units/week, down from the mid-July peak of 173 but significantly higher than the spring average (~60).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early September (2019-09-02). History shows a significant demand regime shift: demand peaked in mid-July (up to 173 units), then stabilized in August. The average demand for the last four periods (P26-P29) is 88.75 units (87, 91, 88, 89), showing remarkable stability at a new, higher plateau compared to the spring average of ~60. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Current total inventory (On-hand: 227 + In-transit: 102 = 329) is substantial. Given that the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. At 88.75 units/week, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 444 units. The current total of 329 is below this level. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to capture this stabilized post-peak demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent high stability (low variance).

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued in August at ~89 units/week (P26-P29) following the July peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 695584001 has transitioned from a July peak (avg ~116) to a stable August plateau (avg ~85-90 units). Period 30 demand was 71, slightly lower than the recent average, but consistent with a stabilizing post-peak trend. The product (grained imitation leather belt) is a staple accessory that recovered from a June low. On-hand inventory is 156, with 194 in-transit (P27: 48, P29: 54, P30: 92). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target a 50% service level (z=0). To prevent overstocking during the stabilization phase while maintaining availability for the current ~85 unit/week trend, I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand parameters (covering P27-P30) to capture the most recent post-peak plateau.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed throughout August: Average demand for P26-P30 is 85.2 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-September after a period of stability in August. Demand has consistently plateaued following the mid-July peak, with the most recent five weeks (P27-P31) showing a mean of 79.4 units and a standard deviation of 13.9. Although the August average was around 85, the last two weeks (71 and 58 units) suggest a gradual tapering as we exit the peak summer season. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (as observed in the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31). Current on-hand inventory (146) and in-transit (220) total 366 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering August/early September) to align base stock with the established post-peak plateau while remaining responsive to the slight downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued in late August/early September: P27-P31 average demand reached 79.4 units/week, indicating a step down from the July high-peak (>100) but remaining higher than the June trough (~11).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a post-peak stabilization phase following a high July demand. Demand has decelerated from the mid-July peak (~173) to a more stable plateau in late August/early September. For the most recent 5 periods (P28-P32), demand was: 88, 89, 71, 58, and 55. This clearly indicates a downward trend toward the previous Spring average (~60) as we enter late September. Using N=5 for mu_hat captures this recent deceleration better than a long-term average. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P22-P25 and P27 orders all arrived with L=4). Pipeline inventory (251) plus on-hand (91) is 342, which covers roughly 5-6 weeks of current demand (~60-70 units/week), aligning with the L+1 coverage requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed in September: P30-P32 average demand dropped to 61.3 units/week, returning to the Spring baseline after the July seasonal peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Bono hip belt has stabilized following the significant July peak and subsequent August/September plateau. We are currently in a regime that mirrors the Spring baseline, with an average demand of approximately 64 units per week over the last four periods (P30-P33: 71, 58, 55, 71). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 74 and 216 units in-transit (reflecting orders from P30-P33), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this stabilized September regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the 60-70 unit weekly demand without over-ordering based on the older July peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late September: Average demand for P30-P33 is 63.8 units/week, consistent with the Spring baseline (approx 60) and confirmed exit from the high-summer peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 35 (early October) has stabilized around the Spring/Autumn baseline of approximately 64 units/week. Recent periods (P30-P34) show demand values of 71, 58, 55, 71, 69, which yields an average of 64.8 units/week. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 0.5), making the base stock essentially (1+L) * mu_hat. There are currently 97 units on-hand and 153 units in-transit (Total = 250). Since my mu_hat for L+1 periods (5 * 64.8) is approximately 324, I need to maintain a steady flow of orders to prevent stockouts as the summer peak inventory clears out. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current post-peak stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in early October: average demand for P30-P34 is 64.8 units/week, aligning with the historical Spring baseline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable demand regime following the July peak. Demand has reverted to the Spring baseline, with an average of approximately 64.8 units/week over the last 5 periods (P30-P34). The current date is October 14, 2019. Historical lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods via multiple 'conclude' messages (most recently P35, where the P31 order arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 111, with 153 units in-transit. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, which the OR engine's base stock calculation (\u03bc\u0302) naturally targets. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the stable post-peak demand (Periods 30-35) while excluding the higher August volumes.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable demand regime following the July seasonal peak and the subsequent stabilization in August/September. Since Period 30, the average demand has been approximately 67.5 units per week (P30: 71, P31: 58, P32: 55, P33: 71, P34: 69, P35: 60, P36: 83). The most recent demand of 83 units is at the higher end of this range but consistent with the volatility observed in the Spring baseline (approx 60-70 units). Lead time remains reliably at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 59, with 178 units in-transit (P33: 19, P34: 29, P35: 74, P36: 56). Total pipeline inventory is 237 (59 on-hand + 178 in-transit). Given L=4, the base stock targets (1+L)=5 weeks of demand. With \u03bc observed around 67.5, the required base stock is roughly 337 units. Current pipeline (237) is below this, so additional ordering is needed to maintain service levels. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-September stabilization while excluding the summer peak volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in October at approximately 65-70 units/week, returning to the pre-summer Spring baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand in Period 37 spiked unexpectedly to 97 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). This follows a slightly elevated demand of 83 units in Period 36. While the historical 'Spring baseline' was around 60-65 units, the recent two-week average (P36-P37) is 90 units. This may indicate a pre-holiday ramp-up or a late October seasonal shift for this accessory SKU. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P33 order arrived in P37). Given the stockout and the recent demand increase, I will use a shorter window (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture this upward movement while balancing against the longer-term stable period. N=5 covers P33-P37, capturing the baseline and the recent spike. This will raise the base stock level to ensure better service levels as we head toward the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late October: Period 36-37 average demand rose to 90 units/week (+38% vs Oct baseline of 65). Monitoring for a sustained holiday-related regime shift.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, entering the holiday season for this SKU (Bono hip belt). Historical data shows demand spikes in July and a return to base levels (~65) in September/October. However, recent volatility (P36: 83, P37: 97, P38: 49) suggests the start of a November holiday ramp-up despite the P38 dip. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with significant stockouts in P37 and P38. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Although P38's demand dropped to 49, the 3-period average (P36-P38) is 76.3. Given the approach of Black Friday/Holiday season, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (average 76.3) which represents a roughly 15% increase over the October baseline, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated seasonal risk during the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Holiday seasonal ramp-up suspected. Demand P36-P38 averaged 76.3 units/week, a sustained increase over the 65 unit October baseline despite a single-period dip in P38.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, which is the start of the Q4 holiday shopping season. Historical demand for this SKU shows significant seasonal variability (June floor vs. July peak). Recent demand in the last 4 periods (P36-39: 83, 97, 49, 58) averages 71.75 units, but this includes a stockout-constrained period (P38). The increased demand in late October (P36-37) followed by the November ramp-up suggests we are entering a higher holiday regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 16) relative to average weekly demand, though significant in-transit units (308) are scheduled to arrive soon. To capture the expected holiday lift and ensure high service levels during this period, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period average (P36-P39) to reflect the recent elevation over the 65-unit October baseline, while maintaining a default L=4. This helps the OR backend maintain a base stock that accounts for both current demand and the lead time pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Holiday seasonal ramp-up confirmed: demand in P36-P37 reached 83-97 units, significantly exceeding the 65-unit mid-Autumn baseline. Average demand for P36-P39 (71.75) is approximately 10-15% higher than October despite constrained stock.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the SKU is entering the peak holiday season. Demand in recent weeks has shown higher volatility with spikes in late October (83, 97) followed by a dip in early November (58, 34). The carry-over insights correctly identified a holiday ramp-up. Although the last period was lower (34), this is likely pre-Black Friday variance rather than a trend reversal for a fashion accessory like a belt. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (approx 64 units/week) to capture this higher-than-autumn baseline, and maintain the stable lead time of 4. Current pipeline (287) plus on-hand (38) is 325, which covers roughly 5 weeks of current demand. With a lead time of 4, the OR engine needs to ensure coverage for (L+1)=5 periods. Setting N=5 for both mu and sigma will weigh the recent holiday ramp-up correctly while smoothing the single-period dip from Period 40.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late November (Period 42), heading into the peak holiday season. Historical data shows that while demand dipped in early November (P40-P41), the late October period (P36-P37) saw spikes near 100 units. Given the product is a 'belt in grained imitation leather', it is likely a popular gift item or party accessory for the December holidays. I expect a significant demand surge as we enter the Black Friday and December gift-giving period. The recent lower demand (34, 40) is likely a pre-holiday lull before the December ramp-up. To prevent stockouts during this high-risk period, I am setting mu_hat using an explicit forecast of 90 units/week (total 450 for the 5-period window), which aligns with the observed October peaks and anticipates the seasonal trend. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the higher volatility seen since late October.

Carry-over insight: Holiday seasonal ramp-up observed: late October demand reached 83-97 units. November 11-18 shows a temporary lull (avg 37), but significant acceleration is expected for the late November/December holiday peak.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering the peak holiday season (December). Historically, this SKU (grained imitation leather belt) saw a 10x demand spike in July, and current Period 43 (Dec 2) is the start of the Christmas shopping window. Recent demand has been lower (avg ~50 in Nov), likely a pre-holiday lull similar to the June trough before the July peak. Given the product category and date, I anticipate a significant ramp-up in demand starting this week. The inventory position (on-hand 126, in-transit 235) covers approximately 7 periods at the recent average of 54, but if demand spikes to July levels (100-170), we need higher base stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=7 (P36-P42) to capture the higher volatility and potential upward trend compared to the October baseline.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand ramp-up expected to start Period 43 (Dec 2). Previous seasonal data (July) suggests peaks can reach 2-3x the baseline demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 44 (Dec 9), heading into the peak of the holiday season. Historical data from Period 23 (July peak) showed demand spiking to 3x the spring baseline (from ~60 to 173). After a temporary lull in late November (P43 demand: 17), we anticipate a significant acceleration in the remaining weeks of December. On-hand inventory is 178, with 166 in-transit (Total pipeline: 344). Using a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Periods 44-48. Given the July precedent, we forecast a holiday peak of ~120 units/week for the next 5 weeks (Total requirement: 600). However, because holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0), the OR backend's service level target (q) is 0.5, which is relatively conservative. To ensure the backend places a sufficient order to cover the expected holiday surge while the current pipeline is only 344, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the anticipated seasonal peak (120 mean per week, L=4, so (1+4)*120 = 600). This bridges the gap between historical averages and the expected seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season peak anticipated: December demand expected to reach 2x-3x baseline (target 120 units/week) based on previous July seasonal performance. Current pipeline inventory (344) is below the 5-period peak requirement (~600).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering Period 45 (Dec 16). The historical data shows a significant seasonal peak in July (up to 173 units), and we anticipate a similar or larger holiday peak in late December. While demand in the last two periods (P43-P44) was unusually low (17 and 10 units), this is likely the 'calm before the storm' or reflects late-reporting/pre-holiday lulls often seen before a major spike. The current on-hand inventory (203) combined with the pipeline (334) provides a total position of 537 units. Given the potential for demand to hit 120-150 units/week during the peak (as observed in the July regime), we need to ensure the base stock covers a 5-period window (L+1). A target of 120 units/week over 5 periods suggests a base stock requirement of ~600 units. My current inventory position (537) is slightly short of this. I will use 'explicit' methods to command a base stock that anticipates this surge, rather than relying on recent low-demand averages which would drastically under-order. I'll set mu_hat to 500 (100 units/week * 5 periods) and sigma_hat to 110 to maintain high service levels during the spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak imminent: Despite a brief dip in P43-P44 (avg 13.5), December peak demand is expected to surge based on July seasonal patterns. Targeting a pipeline of ~600 units to support potential 120+ units/week demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the holiday shopping season. Historical data from the July seasonal spike (Periods 21-25) showed demand surging from ~11 to over 116 units/week (a 10x increase from the trough). Although recent demand in December (P43-P45) has been unusually low (avg ~20), we must anticipate a sharp recovery or late-season clearance demand similar to the July peak. The current pipeline inventory is 505 units (171 on-hand + 334 in-transit), which covers roughly 4.2 weeks at a target peak demand of 120 units/week. Since lead time is 4 periods, orders placed now arrive in late January. Based on the July pattern, the peak is sharp but short-lived. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 600 (representing 5 periods * 120 units) to ensure we have sufficient stock to cover the potential 120+ unit/week holiday peak and avoid the stockouts experienced in July. L remains at the promised 4 periods as consistently observed in the conclude messages.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30). In my previous periods, I anticipated a significant holiday spike in December based on the July seasonal pattern (which saw demand peak at 173). However, actual demand in Dec (P43-P46) has been surprisingly low (17, 10, 32, 17), averaging only ~19 units/week. This suggests that for this specific SKU ('Bono hip belt'), the 'holiday peak' either occurred earlier (Oct/Nov saw peaks of 83-97) or is less pronounced than the summer peak. We currently have 285 units on-hand and 298 in-transit (total 583), which is excessive given the recent demand of ~19/week. Even if a late spike occurs in the final week of Dec, our current coverage (~30 weeks at recent avg) is more than sufficient. I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower demand trend while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak for SKU 695584001 did not materialize in December as expected; Dec average (P43-P46) is only 19 units/week compared to the July peak of 100+. October/November appears to have been the primary late-year peak for this item.
