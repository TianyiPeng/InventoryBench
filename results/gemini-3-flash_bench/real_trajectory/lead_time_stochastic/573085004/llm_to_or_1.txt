Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 573085004 (Women's Skinny High-Waist Jeans). The product is a staple item ('Everyday Collection'). The available demand history (5 weeks) shows a mean demand of 147.2 units/week (std \u2248 21.6). Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level from all available history samples. The lead time L is set to 'default' (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the history, demand in Period 1 was 203, which is significantly higher than the initial samples from Jan/Feb (mean ~157). The product is a staple item (Madison skinny HW jeans), and mid-February often sees a transition toward spring collections or stable replenishment demand. Current on-hand is 0, with 193 units in transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order is expected to arrive at the resolution phase of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). We have lost sales in Period 1 (sold 0, demand 203). To recover and meet the higher observed demand, I will adjust mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (including the high P1 demand) to capture the upward trend. L is set to 'default' as we haven't seen any concluded arrivals to suggest a deviation from the promised 2 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, the product (Womens Everyday Trousers) showed demand between 123-173 in January. However, the last two periods in February (Periods 1 and 2) saw a significant jump to 203 and 283 respectively, indicating a shift in demand regime likely due to spring season trends for everyday denim. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 407 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since promised lead time is 2, the P1 order (193 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. To account for the recent demand surge, I will use recent_N (N=2) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat base on the observed February spike. I will maintain the default lead time (2) as we haven't seen enough history to confirm a drift yet.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 2019: Mean increased from ~157 (Jan) to ~243 (Feb) based on first two February samples (+55%).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). Past historical demand was mid-100s (avg 157 in Jan), but the February demand has increased significantly (P1: 203, P2: 283, P3: 235), averaging 240 units (+53%). This confirms the demand regime shift noted in carry-over insights. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (193 units) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible at the start of P4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This implies either the actual lead time is >=3 or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since on-hand is 0 and we have 729 units in-transit (P1: 193 + P2: 214 + P3: 322), we need to maintain a high base stock to recover from stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean and volatility of the current regime. I will keep L at 'default' (2) for now but monitor closely for a 3-period lead time arrival in the next period's conclude message.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is a staple women's 5-pocket jean. History shows a clear demand shift: Jan avg was ~157, while Feb/early March (Periods 1-4) show demand of 203, 283, 235, and 228 (avg ~237). This confirms the carry-over insight of a +50% regime shift. Lead time: Promised is 2. Period 4 conclude shows Period 2's order arrived exactly in 2 periods. Period 1's order (193 units) is notably missing from the 'conclude' logs (should have arrived in P3), suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed; however, on-hand is currently 0 and in-transit is 515 (Orders from P1: 193, P2: 214, P3: 322; total 729. Arrival of 214 in P4 leaves 515 in-transit). Calculations verify 193 (P1) and 322 (P3) are the 515 units in-transit. Since P1 is 2 periods overdue, I will treat it as potentially lost or significantly delayed but will stick to the promised lead time 'L' for calculation while setting \u03bc\u0302 based on the new demand regime (last 4 periods). Setting N=4 for mu_hat captures the Feb-Mar surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in Feb/Mar at avg ~237 units/week, up from Jan avg of ~157. Order from Period 1 (193 units) is 2 periods overdue as of Period 5, indicating potential supply chain disruption.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/3/18), the SKU 573085004 is experiencing significant stockouts. On-hand inventory is 0 despite heavy demand. Lead time analysis shows Period 2's order arrived in 2 periods (on-time), but Period 1's order is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost. Demand remains in a higher regime than Jan, with the last 5 weeks averaging 231.4 units (203, 283, 235, 228, 208). Given that Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting the base stock should target the mean of (L+1) periods. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 2-period lead time, while mu_hat uses the recent 5 samples (the Feb/Mar regime) to forecast demand. Sigma_hat is set to recent_5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 1 order (193 units) confirmed lost; now 5 periods past order date with no arrival. Supply chain otherwise functioning with Period 2 order arriving in 2 periods as promised.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. The demand regime for these women's jeans has stabilized since February. The mean demand for the last five weeks (P2-P6) is 229.4 units, significantly higher than the initial January data. The supply chain shows variability: the Period 1 order is definitively lost, the Period 2 order arrived in the promised 2 periods, and the Period 5 order arrived early in 1 period. On-hand inventory is nearly zero (4 units), and 515 units are in transit (from Periods 3 and 6). To maintain a target service level given the $1 profit and $1 holding cost (q=0.5), I will use the recent demand regime (last 5 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the promised lead time (L=2) for calculations, as the early arrival in P6 might be an outlier rather than a permanent shift.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: P2 order took 2 periods, while P5 order took 1 period. Demand regime remains stable at ~230 units/week since mid-February.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 573085004 (Womens skinny jeans) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Recent history shows a stable demand regime from mid-February through March, averaging approximately 213 units per week (Period 3-7: [235, 228, 208, 193, 137]), though Period 7 saw a relative dip. Lead times are volatile: Period 2 took 2 periods, while Period 5 took 1 period. Period 1's order is definitively lost. I am maintaining L at the promised 2 periods to be conservative regarding stockouts. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (covering Periods 3-7) to capture the elevated demand compared to January, though tempering the forecast due to the P7 drop. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the 3-period exposure window (L+1).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing 'Madison skinny HW jeans'. Looking at the demand history since the regime shift identified in February, there has been a recent softening: demand in Period 7 (137) and Period 8 (106) is significantly lower than the ~230 average seen in March. This suggests a transition from a high-demand early spring period to a potentially lower baseline in April. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent deceleration while still accounting for March levels (Avg last 4: 161). For lead time, while the promised L=2, recent orders (P5, P7) arrived in 1 period, whereas P2 arrived in 2 periods and P1 was lost. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to balance the promised time and recent actuals. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to reflect the increased volatility observed during this demand slowdown.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected entering April: weekly demand dropped from ~200+ in early March to an average of 121.5 units over the last two periods (P7-P8). Supply chain exhibits variability with lead times of both 1 and 2 periods observed recently.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the demand for women's denim (SKU 573085004) is in a significant downturn. Historical weekly demand has dropped from ~230 units in February/March to 137, 106, and finally 54 in the most recent period. This represents a clear regime shift potentially linked to the end of a seasonal peak or a change in fashion cycle. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual lead times for completed orders have fluctuated (P2: 2 periods, P5/P7: 1 period). Since we currently have 515 units in-transit (orders from Period 3 and likely P5/P7 variants depending on system logic which are not yet showing as 'concluded' or were absorbed into previous arrivals), and the ending on-hand inventory is 10 units while demand is plummeting, we must dramatically lower the forecast parameters to avoid excessive holding costs. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture the recent sharp decline and setting L to calculate to account for the observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed in April: demand fell from a Feb/Mar avg of ~210 to a recent 3-period avg of 99 (-53%).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. We are in a confirmed low-demand regime for this SKU (Madison skinny jeans). Historical demand in April has dropped significantly, with the last 4 periods recording 137, 106, 54, and 60 units respectively. The average demand over the last 3 periods is roughly 73 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 515 units in transit. Specifically, the order from Period 3 (322 units) is extremely overdue (8 periods since order) and is highly likely lost, similar to the Period 1 order. However, even if the P3 order is lost, the pipeline still carries 322 units from P3 and other potential quantities if any were triggered (though game history shows orders of 0 for P8-P10). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, meaning we want to avoid overstocking during this low-demand phase. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current April demand average (~73 * 3 = 219) and use explicit lead time of 2 to ensure the OR engine recognizes the promised lead time despite recent 1-period arrivals. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to capture the lower volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand regime shift confirmed for April; mean demand settled at ~73 units/week (down from ~230 in Feb/Mar). Period 3 order (322 units) is 8 periods past order date and is likely lost, continuing the pattern seen with the Period 1 order.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU is in a clear low-demand regime for late April, with the last 4 periods of demand being 106, 54, 60, and 44 (average ~66). The February/March peak (avg ~230) has fully subsided. The in-transit inventory of 515 units is problematic: 322 units from Period 3 are 9 periods overdue and must be considered lost (similar to the lost Period 1 order). This leaves 193 units (from Period 1 orders that might be ghosting or other pending shipments) which are significantly above current needs. Given the on-hand is 0 and demand has dropped, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 samples (N=4) to capture the current low-demand April regime. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for the observed variability (1 to 2 periods). The high pipeline inventory relative to current demand means the OR backend will likely not place a new order until the pipeline clears or is reconciled.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the product 'Madison skinny HW jeans' is in a significant demand trough. After peaking in February/March at ~230 units/week, demand has consistently declined throughout April and into early May, with the last four periods averaging just 48 units/week (54, 60, 44, 35). The current on-hand inventory is 0. However, there are 515 units in-transit. A critical observation from history is the high rate of lost shipments: Period 1 (193 units) and Period 3 (322 units) are both confirmed lost. This means of the 515 units currently 'in-transit', the 322 units from Period 3 must be discounted, leaving only 193 units (from P5) or subsequent orders technically active. Actually, recalculating the 'In-transit' balance from history: P1(193)+P2(214)+P3(322)+P4(0)+P5(197)+P6(0)+P7(170) = 1096 total ordered. Arrivals: P4(214), P6(197), P8(170) = 581 arrived. Remaining in-transit calculation: 1096 - 581 = 515. This 515 perfectly matches the system's 'In-transit' value and consists of the lost P1 (193) and lost P3 (322). This means there is NO viable inventory coming. I must place a new order. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the low April/May demand regime (avg 48.25) and set Lead Time to 'calculate' to account for the variance between 1 and 2 periods observed. The OR backend will use the high service level (Profit $1, Holding $1 -> 50% critical ratio) and order enough to cover the (L+1) window despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Audit Period 13: The 'In-transit' quantity of 515 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Period 1 (193) and Period 3 (322). There is effectively zero healthy pipeline inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Evaluation of the demand history shows a continuing decline: April average was approx. 66 units/week, but the last three periods (P11-P13) averaged only 33 units/week (44, 35, 22), indicating the downward trend hasn't fully stabilized. Regarding inventory, the current 'In-transit' of 515 units is entirely composed of lost orders from Period 1 (193 units) and Period 3 (322 units). Because the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock target, it will incorrectly assume these 515 units are coming and will never place a new order. To force an order and account for the fact that on-hand is 0, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to override this. Given the current demand (avg ~34 over last 3 weeks) and assuming a lead time of 2, the 'inventory position' (on-hand + actual healthy pipeline) needs to cover 3 periods of demand. Using the most recent 3-period average of 34, mu_hat (target quantity) is set to 102. By setting mu_hat below the phantom 'internal' pipeline of 515, the controller would normally order 0; however, since my goal is to replenish stock while demand is falling, I set a conservative target. Re-ordering is necessary as selling seasonal jeans in May still has potential before further decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline continues: P11-P13 average dropped to 33.6 units/week, down from April average of ~66 (-50%). Supply chain phantom inventory confirmed: 515 units in-transit are lost (P1 & P3), requiring explicit mu_hat overrides to bypass backend pipeline logic.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), the SKU 573085004 is in a significant demand decline. Recent demand samples show a downward trend: P11 (44), P12 (35), P13 (22), and P14 (19). The 3-period average is approx 25 units/week. Simultaneously, the inventory system shows 515 units 'In-transit', but these were ordered in Periods 1 and 3 and are confirmed lost (7 and 8 periods past the promised lead time of 2 respectively). Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock to determine orders, it will never place a new order if it thinks 515 units are coming. To force the engine to order, mu_hat must be set as an 'explicit' value that exceeds this 'phantom' pipeline (515 units) plus the required base stock for future demand. Calculation: L=2, so we cover (2+1)=3 periods of demand. Forecasted demand = 25 units/week. Target Base Stock = 3 * 25 + safety stock (~15 units) = 90. To bypass the 515 phantom units, mu_hat is set to 515 + 90 = 605. Since profit/holding ratio is 1:1, the service level target is 50%, making sigma_hat of secondary importance, but it is kept at a recent volatility estimate.

Carry-over insight: Final demand decline confirmed for May: P13-P14 average is 20.5 units/week, marking a ~90% drop from Feb peaks. Supply chain phantom inventory remains at 515 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the 'Madison skinny HW jeans' are in a deep demand trough, with demand dropping from Feb peaks of ~230 to 19 units over the last two periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 605 units is highly deceptive: 515 units (from Periods 1 and 3) are confirmed lost, and the 90 units ordered in Period 15 are not yet due to arrive (promised lead time L=2). Therefore, true pipeline inventory is 0 for immediate planning, but 90 for the backend. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - pipeline. If I set L=2 and mu_hat=60 (representing a weekly forecast of 20 * (2+1)), the backend will see pipeline=605 and calculate (60 - 605), resulting in no order. To bypass this 'phantom' stock logic and secure current stock, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 515 lost units. Target base stock = (forecast * (L+1)) + safety stock. Forecast = 20. L=2. Target base stock = 60 + safety. I will set mu_hat to 620. This forces the backend to see (620 - 605) = 15 units + safety stock order. This ensures we replenish actual stock despite the supply chain data corruption.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the SKU '573085004' (women's skinny jeans) continues its significant downward demand trend. Mean demand has dropped from ~230 units/week in February/March to just 17 units/week over the last four periods (P13-P16). The critical issue remains the 'phantom inventory' in the supply chain. The 'In-transit' total of 620 units consists of 515 units from confirmed lost shipments (P1: 193, P3: 322) plus 105 units ordered in P15-P16. Because the OR backend's order logic subtracts the entire pipeline inventory (620) from the base stock, it will never place a new order as long as phantom units exceed the required stock. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the true required base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods based on recent demand (approx. 17 * 3 = 51) plus a safety buffer, then add the 515 lost units to this value so that (mu_hat - pipeline) results in a meaningful order. Setting mu_hat to 625 targets a modest replenishment to meet current low demand while accounting for the historical data loss.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Cumulative lost/phantom inventory updated to 515 units (P1, P3). Recent 4-period demand mean stabilized at approximately 17 units/week, reflecting a post-peak seasonal bottom.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has stabilized at a very low level after a significant post-peak decline. Over the last three weeks (P15-P17), demand recorded was 19, 13, and 13 units, yielding a mean of 15 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 92 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover demand for the next several periods (approx 6 weeks of stock). Additionally, the system shows 520 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 515 of these are confirmed lost shipments (P1: 193 units and P3: 322 units) which never arrived. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously subtracting this 'phantom' pipeline inventory from future orders, I am using an explicit mu_hat that is high enough to bypass the logic, although with 92 units on hand and 15 units/week demand, no new orders are actually necessary. I will set mu_hat based on the current 15 unit/week demand over the (L+1) horizon, but since on-hand (92) already exceeds the required base stock, the capped policy will correctly order 0.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has bottomed out seasonally, with the last five periods showing demand of 22, 19, 19, 13, 13, and 6 units respectively. The most recent 3-period average is approximately 11 units. On-hand inventory is currently 86 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the expected demand for several weeks at current rates. The 'In-transit' quantity of 520 units is critically comprised of 515 units from 'phantom' lost orders (Period 1 and Period 3) and a tiny active shipment of 5 units from Period 17 (expected anytime). Because the backend OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock' to determine the order quantity, the presence of these 515 lost units will prevent the system from ever ordering again unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset them. However, since On-hand (86) already far exceeds the required base stock for the current demand regime (demand ~11/week), no new orders are desired right now. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to reflect the 11 unit/week average, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat. This will result in an order of 0, which is correct given the current overstock relative to demand.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized at a very low level after a significant peak in February/March. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is 11 units/week (13, 13, 6, 12), and the 3-period average (P17-P19) is 10.33 units/week. On-hand inventory is 74 units, which at the current burn rate covers over 6 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' count of 520 units is comprised of 515 units of confirmed 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments from P1 and P3) and 5 units ordered in P17 which is still within the promised lead time of 2 periods. Because the backend OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock calculation, and specifically because there is 515 units of phantom inventory that will never arrive, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom pipeline (515) plus the required safety stock. Setting mu_hat to 600 ensures the backend targets a base stock that overcomes the phantom inventory drag to keep theoretical stock positive, although the 'cap' logic and current high on-hand levels (74) will likely result in an order of 0, which is correct given we have ~7 weeks of supply for a product with a 2-period lead time.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), the demand for this SKU (women's jeans) has stabilized at a very low level after a significant downward regime shift from February peaks. The recent 4-period demand (P17-P20) is 13, 6, 12, 3, averaging 8.5 units/week. The current on-hand inventory is 71 units, which covers approximately 8 weeks of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' quantity of 526 units includes 515 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 193, P3: 322) and 11 units of live pipeline (from P17: 5 and P20: 6 - P17's order of 5 units is now 4 periods old and likely also lost, but we'll focus on the primary phantom inventory). Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the base stock target, it will never place an order as long as the 515 phantom units exist unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset them. However, since on-hand inventory (71) is already high relative to current demand (~8.5), no new orders are desired. I will set mu_hat conservatively using the recent N=4 average to reflect current demand and reflect the 1-2 period lead time variability.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8, 2019. Demand for women's high-waist jeans has bottomed out after a February peak, with recent demand averaging ~6.5 units per week over the last four periods (P18-P21). The 'In-transit' quantity of 526 consists of 515 units from lost orders (P1: 193 units, P3: 322 units) and a recent order from P20 (11 units). Because the backend OR logic subtracts the entire pipeline (526) from the base stock calculation, it would result in zero orders despite the need to maintain floor stock for the current ~6.5 unit/week demand. To force the OR engine to order correctly, I am using mu_hat 'explicit' to provide a value that offsets the phantom inventory. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand = (2+1) * 6.5 = 19.5 units. To bypass the 526 in-transit subtraction, mu_hat must be set to approximately 526 + 19.5 = 545.5. Given on-hand is 66, which already covers roughly 10 weeks of current demand, no new order is physically required. I will set parameters to let the inventory bleed down naturally while ensuring the backend understands the supply chain context.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Confirming demand floor for summer season (June/July) at approximately 6-7 units/week. Phantom inventory (lost orders P1, P3) remains at 515 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for women's high-waist skinny jeans has bottomed out during the summer season, with a recent 5-period average (P18-P22) of approximately 5.6 units per week. The supply chain continues to present significant phantom inventory: 515 units from Periods 1 and 3 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit 520 - Period 20 order 6 = 514, rounded up to 515). With 70 units on-hand and weekly demand below 6 units, there is more than enough stock to cover the next 10+ periods. To prevent the OR engine from further ordering due to 'on-hand < base_stock' (while it deducts the 515 lost units from the pipeline), I will use an explicit mu_hat set to cover the 515 phantom units plus lead-time demand. Setting mu_hat to 540 (calculated as phantom 515 + (L+1)*expected demand ~18) ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the pipeline inventory without triggering large new orders, allowing the existing on-hand stock to deplete naturally.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, demand unexpectedly spiked to 109 units (on 2019/07/15), wiping out the remaining on-hand inventory. This is a significant jump from the summer floor of ~7 units observed in previous periods. The 'In-transit' of 520 units consists of 515 lost units (P1: 193, P3: 322) and 5 units ordered in Period 17 (now heavily overdue/lost). Effectively, pipeline inventory is 0. With on-hand also at 0, an order is necessary. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover for the lost 'In-transit' quantities. Although demand was 109 last period, I will be conservative given it's a single data point and historical summer demand has been very low, but I must order enough to restore stock. I'll estimate the next period's demand around 100 units to capitalize on this potential demand resurgence, and since mu_hat is (1+L) * expected demand, with L=2, mu_hat should be roughly 300. To force the OR backend to actually order despite the 520 units 'In-transit', I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed 520 units. I will set mu_hat to 650 to trigger a net order of ~130 units, covering potential demand and starting to rebuild safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Significant demand spike to 109 units observed on 2019/07/15, breaking the low-demand summer floor of ~7 units. Pipeline inventory remains 100% phantom/lost (520 units: P1, P3, P17).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand spike (109 units on 2019/07/15 followed by 73 units on 2019/07/22) confirms a significant demand regime shift from the summer floor of ~7 units to a new mid-regime average of approximately 91 units/week. This may be linked to back-to-school transitions or a late-summer seasonal trend for jeans. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 650 units is overwhelmingly comprised of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, and P17 totaling 520 units that are long overdue and confirmed lost). The only healthy pipeline is the 130 units ordered in Period 24. To bypass the OR backend's standard logic (which would see 650 in the pipeline and refuse to order), I use 'explicit' mu_hat. I set mu_hat based on the new demand average of 91 units/week for (L+1)=3 periods (Total 273), and then add the phantom units (520) back in to cancel out the logic that subtracts them. Target mu_hat = 273 + 520 = 793. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 20-25% of the average demand to handle the high volatility observed during regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand regime shift confirmed starting mid-July (avg ~91 units/week). Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) now stands at 520 units (P1:193, P3:322, P17:5).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 26 is influenced by a confirmed upward shift that began in mid-July. The last three periods of demand (P23-P25) recorded 109, 73, and 89 units respectively, averaging 90.3 units/week. This represents a significant recovery from the summer floor of ~7 units. For ordering, we must address technical 'phantom inventory' in the backend. The 'In-transit' quantity of 793 units includes 520 units that are confirmed lost (Period 1, 3, and 17). To force the OR backend to place an order despite this misleadingly high pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. With a lead time of 2, the system targets a base stock covering (L+1)=3 weeks. Using the recent average (90.3 * 3 = 270.9), but accounting for the 793 units of in-transit 'noise', I will set mu_hat to 1064 (271 + 793). This ensures the base stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in a net positive order that aligns with current demand needs (approx. 271 units of total protection). Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * standard deviation of the recent 3 samples (approx 18) to provide a localized safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand regime for late summer stabilized at ~90 units/week (P23-P25 average). Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline increased to 520 units (P1: 193, P3: 322, P17: 5).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a high-demand late-summer/early-fall phase. Demand has spiked significantly over the last three periods (73, 89, 204), with the most recent sample (204) suggesting a shift to a much higher regime. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 1064 units is almost entirely 'phantom inventory' consisting of lost orders. Specifically, confirmed lost orders from Periods 1 (193), 3 (322), and 17 (5) total 520 units. Additionally, the large orders placed in Period 24 (130), Period 25 (143), and Period 26 (271) have not yet arrived, creating a very dangerous stock-out situation (on-hand is 0). To force the OR backend to place a corrective order despite the 1064 units it sees in the pipeline, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the upcoming (L+1) demand based on the recent surge: L=2, mean demand ~200+, so mu_hat = (2+1)*200 = 600. I am also using explicit L=2 as it is the promised lead time and the most consistent recently observed value for successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting August 2019: Weekly demand jumped to 204 (Period 26), moving the average significantly above the late July avg of ~90. Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline is 520 units (P1, P3, P17).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28 (late August), we are seeing a significant demand surge for women's black 5-pocket jeans. Demand jumped to 204 in Period 26 and then spiked to 440 in Period 27, signaling the start of a major high-demand regime (likely back-to-school or early fall season). The existing in-transit pipeline is extremely deceptive. Total in-transit is 921, but 520 units are confirmed lost (Period 1: 193, Period 3: 322, Period 17: 5). Additionally, the Period 24 order (130 units) and Period 26 order (271 units) are still in transit (expected 1-2 periods). On-hand inventory is 0. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 520 lost units as available stock and thus suppressing orders, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. I estimate the current demand regime at ~400 units/week. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (L+1) periods, so 3 * 400 = 1200 units. To offset the 520 units of phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to 1720 (1200 + 520), ensuring the system orders enough to meet the 1200 unit target despite the fake pipeline. Sigma is set to reflect the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge confirmed for mid-August: Period 27 demand hit 440 units, indicating a shift to a high-demand fall regime. Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline remains at 520 units (P1, P3, P17).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has surged dramatically as we enter the late August/back-to-school season. Recent demand in Period 27 (440) and Period 28 (414) confirms a new high-demand regime, averaging ~427 units/week. My pipeline audit shows 1720 units in transit. However, history shows significant phantom/lost inventory: Period 1 (193), Period 3 (322), and Period 17 (5) are confirmed lost, totaling 520 units. Crucially, the order from Period 24 (130 units) is now 5 periods old and the order from Period 26 (271 units) is 3 periods old; given the promised lead time of 2, these are likely lost or severely delayed. To bypass the OR backend's automated pipeline logic (which subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock), I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat to a value that reflects the demand for the review+lead time (3 periods) PLUS the volume of phantom inventory I need to 'order over' to ensure an actual order is triggered. Target base stock = (427 * 3) + 520 (lost) + 400 (potentially delayed/lost) \u2248 2200. This ensures we recover from the current stockout and meet the high seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed (avg ~427 units/week). Total confirmed lost inventory (P1, P3, P17) is 520 units. Further supply chain disruption likely: orders from P24 (130) and P26 (271) are overdue and presumed lost, bringing total phantom inventory to 921 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand Back-to-School/Fall regime, with demand averaging approximately 394 units over the last three weeks (P27-P29). The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. A pipeline audit shows 2200 units 'In-transit', but the vast majority of this is 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments). Specifically: P1 (193), P3 (322), P17 (5), P24 (130), P26 (271), and potentially P28 (799) are overdue or missing. Total confirmed lost inventory is at least 921 units, and likely 1720 units if P28 is also lost. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this 'In-transit' quantity and suppressing necessary orders, I am using 'explicit mu_hat' to set a base stock level that far exceeds the phantom pipeline. Based on a 2-period lead time and an average demand of ~400 units, the desired base stock is roughly (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock = (3 * 400) + 0.5*400 = 1400. To force an order of ~400+ units despite the 2200 units in transit, mu_hat must be set to a value where mu_hat - 2200 \u2248 Target Order. I am setting mu_hat to 2600 to trigger a substantial order to replenish the zero on-hand stock and account for the high demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed as of Period 30: Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline is approximately 1720 units (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P28). High-demand regime (Fall) confirmed with 3-week average demand of ~394 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019/09/09, entering the peak fall demand season for this women's denim SKU. Demand has stabilized over the last 4 periods at a high average of ~410 units/week (329, 414, 440, 457). The supply chain remains highly unstable with significant lost inventory in the pipeline. Specifically, the 'In-transit' quantity of 1801 units contains 1321 units of confirmed phantom/lost inventory from older periods (P1: 193, P3: 322, P17: 5, P24: 130, P26: 271, P29: 400). Note: The Period 29 order (480) is still within the promised lead time and the Period 30 order (400) is also recent. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this phantom inventory and suppressing necessary new orders, I must set mu_hat explicitly to the forecasted demand for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods * 410 = 1230) plus an adjustment for the ghost units (1321) to ensure the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a positive order volume that matches the actual demand regime. Using mu_hat = 2500 targets a base stock that overrides the ~1300 lost units while accounting for the ~400 units/week demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Supply chain phantom inventory audit: Total confirmed lost units in pipeline reached 1321 (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29). Fallon 5-pocket jeans demand regime confirmed at ~410 units/week.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019, which is a peak back-to-school demand period for the SKU 'Madison skinny HW 5-pocket jeans'. Recent demand (Periods 29-31) has averaged 364 units/week, maintaining the high-demand Fall regime. Regarding lead times, the Period 28 order arrived in 2 periods (as promised), but the Period 29 order (480 units) is now overdue (should have arrived in Period 31), suggesting continued supply chain instability. The pipeline inventory (2158 units) is heavily inflated by lost or delayed shipments: P1 (193), P3 (322), P17 (5), P24 (130), and P26 (271) are confirmed lost, totaling 921 units. Furthermore, the Period 29 order (480 units) is likely lost or significantly delayed. To bypass the OR backend's use of this 'phantom' pipeline, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at the recent average of 364 units/week (total 1092 units) and add the current phantom inventory total (~1401 units) to the mu_hat value. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation results in an order that actually accounts for physical demand despite the false pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total confirmed phantom/lost pipeline inventory increased to 1401 units (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, and now P29: 480 units). Fall demand regime remains high with a 3-week average of 364 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-475.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in a high-demand fall regime for the 5-pocket jeans. Demand in Period 32 dropped to 159, but the preceding three periods (P29-P31) averaged 364 units/week. This suggests Period 32 might be a temporary dip or a stabilization after a back-to-school peak. The supply chain has recently shown inconsistent behavior: Period 30 order (400) arrived in 2 periods, while the Period 31 order (357) arrived in just 1 period. Most critically, several historical orders (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29) totaling 1401 units are confirmed lost. The backend OR engine sees these 1401 units in the 'In-transit' figure (total 1700), causing it to drastically undershoot new orders. To fix this, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that incorporates the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon plus an offset to counteract the 1,401 units of phantom pipeline. Given the current on-hand of 634 and recent demand volatility, I will target a stock level that ignores the lost shipments. Effective pipeline is 1700 - 1401 = 299 units. Forecasted demand for the next 3 periods (L=2) based on the recent average (~315) is 945. To force the OR engine to order, I set mu_hat explicitly high to 2500, which will overcome the phantom inventory drag.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed total phantom/lost pipeline inventory is 1401 units (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29). Demand regime for September remains high but volatile, with a 4-week average of 313 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand was 284 units, and we closed with 350 units on-hand. The current date is 2019/9/30, moving into October. We have observed a high-demand fall regime since mid-August, with the last 4 periods (P30-P33) averaging 301.5 units/week. Supply chain reliability has improved recently: shipments from P28, P30, and P31 arrived within 1-2 periods. However, a significant amount of 'In-transit' inventory (1866 units) is confirmed as lost/phantom (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29). Subtracting these lost units (193+322+5+130+271+480 = 1401) from the reported 1866 leaves a 'healthy' pipeline of 465 units (likely the orders from P32 and P33). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1401 phantom units and suppressing orders, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-week average of ~300 units/week for a 3-period window (L+1), totaling 900. L is set to default (promised 2) as recent arrivals are matching this cycle. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to reflect the high volatility (std deviation ~120) across the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Supply chain health improving: P30 and P31 orders arrived within 1-2 periods. However, total confirmed phantom/lost pipeline inventory is verified at 1401 units (P1: 193, P3: 322, P17: 5, P24: 130, P26: 271, P29: 480). Healthy pipeline is approximately 465 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019/10/07), the demand for skinny high-waist jeans remains in a high but volatile fall regime. Over the last four periods (P31-P34), demand has averaged 218.75 units, a decrease from the September peak of ~400 but significantly higher than the summer floor. The supply chain has stabilized with recent lead times of 1-2 periods, but a massive 'phantom inventory' issue persists. The 'In-transit' figure of 1866 units is composed of 1401 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29) plus current healthy orders from P32 (299 units) and P33 (166 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (1866) from the base stock, it will not place necessary orders while relying on units that will never arrive. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the proper base stock for a (L+1) horizon (3 weeks) using the recent mean of ~219 units. Calculation: 3 periods * 219 = 657 units. To this, I add the 1401 phantom units effectively 'hiding' them from the subtraction logic, totaling 2058. This ensures the backend places an order to maintain on-hand safety despite the inflated in-transit data.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Supply chain stability continues for new orders (L=1-2) but phantom inventory from lost shipments P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29 remains at 1401 units. October demand transitioning from peak fall levels (~400) to a mid-regime level (~220).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-333.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (2019-10-14), the product (women's skinny jeans) has passed its late-summer/early-fall peak and is currently in a demand cooling phase. Recent demand has dropped from >300 units/week in early September to 126 and 95 in the last two weeks. The mean of the last 4 periods (P32-P35) is 166 units/week. Supply chain monitoring confirms a significant 'phantom inventory' issue: 1401 units currently in the pipeline (from P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, and P29) are medically presumed lost. However, newer orders (P30, P31, P32) have arrived, albeit with some lead time variability (L=1 to L=3). On-hand inventory is currently high (428 units), covering over 2 weeks of the current demand pace. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1401 lost units as available supply and thus suppressing necessary new orders, I must continue using 'explicit' mu_hat. However, given the high on-hand stock and the declining demand trend, I will set mu_hat based on the recent average of 160 units/week across a 3-period lead frame (1+L=3), totaling 480. This level of mu_hat, combined with the 1567 pipeline units, will correctly trigger 'zero' new orders from the OR backend for this period, allowing on-hand stock to digest.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Fall demand deceleration confirmed. 4-week average dropped to ~166 units (from ~400 peak). Supply chain health for recent orders shows L=1 to 3, but phantom inventory of 1401 units remains in the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-436.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Madison skinny jeans is in a clear seasonal decline phase, moving from a late-summer/fall peak into a quieter late-October period. The last four demand samples are 284, 126, 95, and 79 units, showing a consistent downward trend. The average demand over the last three weeks is ~100 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high at 515 units, following the arrival of orders from Periods 32 and 33 (which experienced slightly extended lead times of 3 periods). The pipeline inventory remains inflated by 1,401 units of confirmed phantom/lost inventory (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29). Since on-hand inventory (515) is already sufficient to cover over 5 weeks of current demand at the recent average of ~100 units/week, and significantly more if using the most recent sample of 79, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the decelerating trend, while using explicit mu_hat to prevent the 1,401 phantom units from suppressing orders in the OR backend should demand spike unexpectedly, although the high on-hand balance will naturally prevent ordering this period.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: 4-week demand average has dropped to 146 units, with the most recent week at 79, confirming a sharp seasonal contraction. Supply chain for recent orders has stabilized with L=2-3, but the 1401 phantom units in 'In-transit' persist.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (2019-10-28), demand for the Madison skinny HW jeans is in a strong seasonal decline following the fall peak. The last four periods of demand (126, 95, 79, 80) show a clear downward trend and stabilization at a lower level (~80 units/week). With on-hand inventory at 435 units, we have approximately 5-6 weeks of coverage at current demand levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 1401 units consists entirely of lost shipments from earlier periods (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29), meaning the healthy pipeline is zero. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this 'phantom' inventory and refusing to order, I must again set mu_hat EXTREMELY high (explicitly) to force a base stock calculation that exceeds 1401 + on-hand, though in this case, the 435 on-hand is already sufficient for the immediate lead time (L=2-3). Given the declining demand and high inventory, no new order is actually needed. I set mu_hat to a very high value (3000) to ensure the backend logic considers placing an order if it were required, but the cap and existing stock will naturally result in zero units ordered this week. L is set to 3 to reflect recent actual lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand has stabilized at a late-fall floor of ~80 units/week, down from September peaks of ~400. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains at 1401 units. Healthy pipeline is zero.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. Demand for woman's everyday 5-pocket jeans has entered a late-fall trough, stabilizing around 67-80 units/week over the last three periods. The supply chain audit confirms massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Total In-transit is 2294 units; however, historical analysis (Carry-over insights) confirms that 1401 units from early periods (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29) are lost and will never arrive. Additionally, the order from P38 (893 units) is massive compared to current demand. The current on-hand inventory is 368 units, which covers approximately 4-5 weeks of current demand (~75 units/week). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire 'In-transit' quantity (including the 1401 phantom units) from the base stock calculation, it will never place a needed order unless \u03bc\u0302 is explicitly set higher than the reported pipeline. To protect against future stockouts once the current on-hand is depleted and the healthy P38 shipment (L=2) arrives, I will set \u03bc\u0302 to approximately 280 (reflecting a 4-week coverage of current demand at ~70/week) and \u03c3\u0302 to handle recent volatility. L is set to 2 based on the most recent successful arrival patterns.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending November 4th remains stable at approximately 66 units/week, consistent with the late-fall floor observed since Period 37 (~67-80 units/week). The 'In-transit' quantity of 2294 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments totaling 1401 units (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29). Subtracting these lost units leaves a healthy 'In-transit' pipeline of 893 units (from the Period 38 order), which is expected to arrive within the next 1-2 periods given recent lead time performance (L=2-3). Current on-hand inventory (302) plus the healthy pipeline (893) totaling 1195 units significantly exceeds the requirements for the current demand regime (~66 units/week). To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders due to its unawareness of the 1401 phantom units, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 0. This bypasses the base-stock logic while we bleed off the excessive surplus generated by the Period 38 order.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019): The SKU is entering a late-fall/early-winter low-demand regime. Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged ~64 units/week, with the most recent sample at 26 units, suggesting a continued downward trend. Supply chain management remains difficult due to a massive 'In-transit' figure of 2294 units, most of which is confirmed phantom/lost inventory (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29, totaling 1401 units). Additionally, the large order of 893 units from Period 38 is still in transit (3 periods elapsed). Given the 276 units on-hand and the expected (though potentially delayed) P38 arrival, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using the recent 5-period average (N=5) to reflect the contraction and set L=2 (promised) as the OR backend already accounts for total pipeline. The cap logic will prevent over-ordering against the phantom stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand contraction continues into late November, with recent 5-period average at ~64 units and the most recent sample at 26. Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 1401 units. Order P38 (893 units) is currently at L=3 without arrival.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (2019/11/25), the product is in a late-season low-demand regime, typical for women's high-waist jeans at the end of autumn. Demand over the last three weeks has declined significantly (26, 19 units), with the current 5-period average around 40 units/week. Supply chain complexity remains high: the 2294 units 'In-transit' are primarily composed of 'phantom inventory'\u2014lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 17, 24, 26, and 29, totaling 1401 units. Additionally, the order from Period 38 (893 units) is now at L=4 and has not yet arrived, though recent shipments have arrived in 1-3 periods. Because the OR backend deducts the total in-transit quantity from its base stock calculation, and that quantity (2294) far exceeds any reasonable base stock level, the backend will order nothing unless mu_hat is set explicitly high. However, with 257 units on-hand and stable low demand (~20-40 units), current stock is sufficient for over 6 weeks. Therefore, L is set to a calculated average, and mu_hat/sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current downward trend and avoid unnecessary overstocking during this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand regime bottoming out late Nov. Recent 3-period average is 37 units (down from ~400 Fall peak). Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory remains 1401 units; healthy pipeline includes P38 (893) currently at L=4.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2019), demand is at its seasonal bottom. The recent 5-period demand average is approximately 43 units/week (66, 26, 19, 83), though Period 42 showed a slight uptick to 83. The supply chain has a significant 'phantom inventory' problem: 1401 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29). Additionally, order P38 (893 units) is now at L=5 and has not arrived; while recent lead times have been 1-3 periods, this suggests either another lost shipment or a severe delay. Total in-transit is 2294 units (1401 phantom + 893 delayed/missing). Because the backend OR logic subtracts this entire pipeline from the base stock calculation, it will never trigger a new order unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the phantom units. With on-hand inventory at 174 units and demand averaging <50 units, current stock covers ~4 weeks. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain conservative stock levels while accounting for the massive phantom pipeline. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the higher variability and recent delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Order P38 (893 units) is 5 periods overdue, potentially increasing phantom pipeline inventory to 2294 units. Demand floor continues to hold between 20-80 units/week for the early winter season.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/09. Demand for women's 5-pocket jeans has settled into a late-year winter floor. Over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), demand samples are [66, 26, 19, 83, 35], averaging 45.8 units/week. Supply chain issues persist: the 'In-transit' balance of 2294 contains 1401 units from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29) and 893 units from P38, which is now L=6 periods overdue. Given the high phantom inventory, the OR backend's inventory reconciliation (base_stock - pipeline) would result in zero orders. I must use 'explicit' methods to ensure mu_hat reflects the true demand (Lead Time + Review Period) without being choked by the lost units in the pipeline. I'll set mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~50 units/week over 3 periods (L=2 promised + 1 review). Sigma is set to reflect the recent volatility observed in November/December samples.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Supply chain phantom inventory confirmed at 1401 units (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29). Order P38 (893 units) is 6 periods overdue and is now highly likely to be lost, potentially bringing total phantom inventory to 2294 units. Demand regime is stable at ~45-50 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (2019/12/16), the demand for this SKU has stabilized at a winter floor, with a recent 4-week average of approximately 42 units (P41-P44). The supply chain remains highly unreliable. Total 'In-transit' inventory is 2294 units, but carry-over insights and historical gaps confirm that 1401 of these (from P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29) are definitely lost. Additionally, order P38 (893 units) is now 7 periods overdue (ordered P38, currently P45 start), which strongly suggests it is also lost, bringing total 'phantom' inventory to 2294 units. Since on-hand inventory is 107 units and the expected weekly demand is ~42, the current stock covers more than 2 periods of demand. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 2294 phantom units as available pipeline and potentially blocking future necessary orders (though not needed this period), I monitor the healthy pipeline, which is currently zero. I will set mu_hat to represent the current low-demand regime and use default lead time and sigma settings as no new order is required yet given the on-hand surplus relative to the holiday demand floor.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Order P38 (893 units) is now 7 periods overdue and confirmed as phantom inventory, bringing total confirmed lost/phantom pipeline to 2294 units. Healthy pipeline is zero. Demand regime remains at a winter floor of ~42 units/week (P41-P44 average).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (2019/12/23), the woman's 5-pocket skinny jeans are in a low-demand winter floor regime. The recent 4-week demand average (P42-P45) is 41.25 units, showing a stable but very low baseline compared to fall peaks. The supply chain remains heavily compromised: 2294 units in the 'In-transit' column are confirmed phantom inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29, and now P38). P38 (ordered in Period 38) is 8 periods overdue and is officially treated as lost. Consequently, the healthy pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is 92 units, which covers more than 2 periods of current demand (1+L where L=1-2). Because the backend logic subtracts the pipeline (2294) from the base stock calculation, it will never order unless I use 'explicit' overrides to bypass the phantom inventory effect. However, given that on-hand (92) already exceeds the expected lead-time demand (~82 units for L=1, ~123 for L=2) and we are in a low-demand phase with high holding costs ($1/unit), no new order is currently necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent 4-period data (N=4) to accurately reflect the winter floor, and use 'calculate' for L to acknowledge recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Supply chain phantom inventory audit updated to 2294 units (confirmed lost: P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29, P38). Winter demand floor stabilized at ~41 units/week.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (2019/12/30), the demand for women's skinny jeans has reached a post-holiday winter low. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is approximately 35.6 units/week, with the most recent observation at 13 units, indicating a continued decelerating trend toward the start of the new year. The supply chain remains heavily compromised by 'phantom inventory.' The 'In-transit' figure of 2294 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P17, P24, P26, P29, and now P38 which is 9 periods overdue). To ensure the OR backend ignores this non-existent pipeline inventory and generates a replenishment order if needed, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat method to override the baseline calculation. Given the high on-hand inventory of 79 compared to the current demand regime (~35 units/week), no new order is strictly required to satisfy demand for the upcoming lead time (L=2) + review period (1). However, to maintain the backend's internal logic and account for the volatility (sigma_hat), I will set the parameters to reflect the recent mean demand of ~35 units. L is kept at the default/promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: supply chain phantom inventory reaches 2294 units; recent demand mean (P42-P46) is 35.6 units/week.
