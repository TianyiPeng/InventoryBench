Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Feb 11, 2019. We are managing a Karin Sports Bra, a jersey-based functional garment. Initial demand samples (5 weeks) show a mean of 117.8 and a standard deviation of 17.5. Considering this is mid-February, demand for fitness apparel typically stabilizes or starts a slight uptrend as 'new year, new you' resolutions transition into consistent habits. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have no units in-transit, we must establish a base stock immediately. Promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning we need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1). I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 2), and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (all available samples) to initialize the forecast based on recent performance while allowing the backend to scale for the (L+1) lead time window.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a sports bra. Historical data shows demand samples ranging from 95 to 136 (avg ~118). In Period 1, we ordered 138 units, but since the promised lead time is 2 periods, this order is currently in-transit and not yet arrived. Our current on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in 99 lost sales in Period 1. To stabilize, I will use recent historical demand to set expectations for Period 2 and beyond. I am choosing N=5 for the demand mean calculation (mu_hat) to capture the average behavior seen in the recent samples (118, 136, 104, 95, 103). The backend will handle the lead time (L) as 2 by default. Since we have very little on-hand, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Looking at the Historical Demand Data (pre-game): 118, 136, 104, 95, 103 (Mean: 111.2, SD: 17.5). Game history shows demands of 99 (P1) and 141 (P2). The P2 demand of 141 is the highest observed but within a reasonable range of the historical mean. Inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0, units sold are 0 for both periods because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from P1 (138 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). The order from P2 (135 units) is expected in P4. Total 'In-transit' is 273 (138+135), which matches our expectations. I will use a recent_N approach for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the slightly higher recent demand (N=5 covers the last 3 pre-game samples plus P1 and P2). L will remain at default (2) as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a lead-time drift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a sports bra. Demand history (samples and periods 1-3) shows a stable average around 115-120 units per week. No shipments have arrived yet. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the order from Period 1 (138 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 3 and become visible in the Period 4 decision (now). However, the Period 3 conclude report shows 'arrived=0', which is expected because the order arrives *during* Period 3 and is visible at the *start* of Period 4. Wait\u2014I am currently at the start of Period 4, and the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. Based on the 'Critical Timing Example', if L=2, an order placed in P1 arrives during P3 and should be confirmed in the 'P3 conclude' message. Since 'arrived=0' in 'P3 conclude', the Period 1 order is delayed. I will continue using L=2 (default) for now, as a single period delay doesn't yet confirm a regime shift in lead time, but I must ensure mu_hat and sigma_hat are calibrated to current demand levels (avg ~118) to maintain the base stock level given the stockout.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/11. The product is a sports bra. Demand history shows relatively stable numbers: 118, 136, 104, 95, 103 (pre-game) and 99, 141, 117, 112 (in-game). Mean demand is approximately 114. Lead time observation: P2 order arrived in P4, confirming a lead time of 2 periods. The P1 order of 138 units is currently overdue (should have arrived in P3 if L=2). Since 'In-transit' is 233 (138 from P1 + 80 from P3 + 15 from P4), the P1 shipment is likely delayed or lost. Given the inventory gap (on-hand is only 23), I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent stability and use 'default' for lead time (2) as the P2 arrival confirms the promised time isn't fundamentally broken, though P1 is an anomaly.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a sports bra. Demand history (samples and observed) shows a stable mean (samples: 118, 136, 104, 95, 103; observed: 99, 141, 117, 112, 118), with a combined average of ~114 units/week. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 345 in-transit. In-transit breakdown: P1 order (138) is now 5 periods since order (overdue, promised 2), P3 order (80), P4 order (15), and P5 order (112). P2 order (135) arrived in P4 (lead time 2). The P1 order is likely lost or significantly delayed, leaving us stocked out. Because lead time is promised as 2, and we've seen one delivery at 2, I will keep L at default (2) but monitor the P1 shipment. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (covering the actual observed demand periods) to reflect current sales velocity. sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture the variance in recent demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. The product is a sports bra, which typically sees steady demand but can spike with fitness-related New Year resolutions (observed in Jan samples) and the start of spring outdoor activities. Historical demand mean is approx 115. Recent demand in the last 3 periods has averaged 110, showing relative stability compared to Jan/Feb peaks. Leading up to today (Period 7), we've observed inconsistent lead times: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods (Period 4), Period 3/4 orders are currently missing/overdue (Period 3 was ordered 4 weeks ago), and Period 5 order arrived in just 1 period (Period 6). The pipeline currently shows 263 units (likely comprising P1, P3, P4, and P6 orders), but none arrived in the Period 6 conclusion despite P1/P3 being well beyond the promised 2-period lead time. This suggests potential lost shipments or significant supply chain volatility. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the trend while ignoring January anomalies. For Lead Time, 'calculate' is selected to incorporate the recent 1-period arrival while remaining cautious about the 'promised' 2-period metric. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility detected: observed 1-period and 2-period arrivals, but also potential lost shipments from P1/P3/P4. Demand remains stable around ~110 units/week.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), the inventory situation is critical with 0 units on-hand and 363 units in-transit. Demand for the KARIN SPORTS BRA remains stable, averaging 117 units over the last 5 periods (P3-P7), while the historical mean is ~114. Lead time is highly unreliable: P2 arrived in 2 periods, P5 arrived in 1 period, but shipments from P1, P3, and P4 are significantly overdue (5+, 3+, and 2+ periods respectively), suggesting they are likely lost. Because lost orders remain in the pipeline inventory, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will be suppressed. To counteract this and trigger sufficient ordering despite the 'ghost' pipeline, I am setting an explicit lead time of 2 periods (promised) and an explicit mu_hat of 450. This mu_hat represents a target base stock that covers the expected demand for (L+1) periods (~350 units) plus a buffer to compensate for the inventory deficit caused by lost arrivals, ensuring the next order is large enough to rebuild on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity compromised: Shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 233 units) are considered lost as of Period 8, causing persistent stockouts despite high in-transit numbers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the cumulative demand history shows a consistent baseline around 110-120 units, but Period 8 saw a significant spike to 182 units, likely driven by seasonal interest in sports apparel (April/Spring). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to persistent stockouts and several lost shipments (P1, P3, P4 are confirmed lost as they are far beyond the observed 1-2 period lead time and haven't arrived). While Period 8 saw a large arrival (130 units from P6 and P7), it was immediately depleted. Current in-transit (333) technically includes the lost units (138+80+15 = 233) and the Period 8 order (100). Subtracting the 233 lost units, the effective pipeline is only 100 units (from P8). Given the recent demand spike and the unreliability of the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the higher recent average plus safety buffer, and use explicit lead time to ensure the OR backend handles the gap. I assume a lead time of 2 (conservative) and a forecast reflecting the recent higher volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 8 (182 units, +54% vs mean). Pipeline significantly overstated by 233 lost units (P1, P3, P4).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 497 is significantly inflated by 233 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are confirmed lost. The 'effective' pipeline is actually 264 units (100 from P8 and 164 from P9). Demand remains generally stable around a mean of 118, despite a one-time spike in Period 8 (182). To recover from the stockout caused by lost shipments and accounting for the OR engine's use of total pipeline (497), I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target inventory to cover L+1 periods (lead time 2 + 1 review period) at a mean demand of 120 is 360 units. Since the OR engine subtracts the full 497 in-transit from the base_stock, I will set mu_hat to 800 to ensure an order is triggered that overcomes the phantom inventory and replenishes the stock. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility recently observed (std dev ~28).

As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the product ('Karin Sports Bra') is experiencing a stabilization in demand after a volatility period. Historical data shows demand around ~110, with a spike in P8 (182) and lower demand in P10 (85). The pipeline inventory remains officially high (548 units), but carry-over insights confirm that 233 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are effectively lost, meaning the 'true' pipeline is roughly 315 units (the P10 order). Arrival patterns show lead times alternating between 1 and 2 periods (P9 arrived in 1, P8 arrived in 2). I will set L to 2 to ensure coverage over the promised lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent average demand which includes the spike and the recent dip, averaging roughly 118 units/period. The OR backend needs to account for the L+1 period demand (3 periods). Given that 179 units are on-hand and 315 are validly in-transit (total 494), and our base stock target (3 * 118 + Z*sigma) is likely near this range, setting parameters carefully prevents over-ordering while maintaining safety stock against lead-time variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 12 (2019-04-29). The product is a sports bra. Historical demand has generally centered around 110 units, with a notable spike in Period 8 (182 units) and a slight cooling recently. Lead times are volatile, oscillating between 1 and 2 periods (P9 arrived in 1, P8 arrived in 2). We have identified 233 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) as permanently lost; these are still counted by the OR backend as 'In-transit', leading it to under-order. Although 'In-transit' shows 548, after subtracting the 233 ghost units, the functional pipeline is 315 (ordered P10). P10 was ordered 2 periods ago, so it is expected to arrive during this period (P12). On-hand is 80, which is insufficient if the P10 order is delayed. To force the OR backend to ignore the lost 233 units, I must use 'explicit' methods for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of 115 units/week over (L+1)=3 weeks. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 115 = 345. However, since the OR engine calculates order = max(0, base_stock - pipeline), and pipeline is 548, I must set the target base_stock high enough to trigger an order if needed, but given the massive 315 shipment coming in, I will focus on resetting the demand expectation. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility recently observed.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation: 233 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost. Functional pipeline as of P12 is 315 units (ordered P10).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, the SKU is currently out of stock. My analysis of the 'In-transit' quantity (548) indicates it consists of the order from Period 10 (315 units) and the confirmed lost units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 233 units). Because the OR backend treats all 'In-transit' items as valid pipeline inventory, it will drastically under-order. To compensate for these 233 'phantom' units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the base demand (\u03bc) as approximately 110 units (historical average excluding the Period 8 spike). For a promised lead time of L=2, the required coverage is (L+1) * \u03bc = 3 * 110 = 330 units. To offset the 233 units that the backend incorrectly thinks are coming, I set mu_hat to 330 + 233 = 563. This will force the order logic to bridge the gap and replenish the stock. Note: The Period 10 order (315 units) is now at lead time 3, which is slightly delayed but consistent with the historical volatility observed; I expect it to arrive this period (P13).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14 (2019/5/13), we are managing a Sports Bra SKU. Previous periods confirmed that 233 units from P1, P3, and P4 are permanently lost. Excluding those, the 'In-transit' figure of 597 units comprises: 315 units from P10 (overdue, expected lead time was 2), 233 lost units (still showing in system but ignored), and 49 units from P13. The OR backend's capped policy will deduct the full 597 from the base_stock calculation unless we intervene. Since On-hand is 0 and the P10 shipment (315 units) is significantly overdue (ordered 4 weeks ago), my focus is on forcing an order to cover the current stockout and expected demand. I will set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the (L+1) demand + the 233 'ghost' units that the backend incorrectly sees as available pipeline, effectively neutralizing them. Average demand is ~110 units. For L=2, (L+1) periods of demand is ~330. Adding the 233 lost units gives 563. I will use 570 for mu_hat to ensure an order is triggered despite the inflated pipeline count. I maintain L=2 as the baseline arrival expectation.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: P10 order (315 units) is now 2 periods overdue (ordered P10, now P14 start, expected arrival by P13 start). Supply chain remains highly unstable.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 678687001 is severely disrupted. As of Period 15, we are facing a persistent stockout. The pipeline inventory (613 units) is heavily contaminated by lost or severely delayed shipments. Specifically, orders from Period 1 (138), Period 3 (80), and Period 4 (15)\u2014totaling 233 units\u2014are confirmed lost. Furthermore, the large order from Period 10 (315 units) is now 3 periods overdue (expected arrival was Period 13), and the orders from Period 13 (49) and Period 14 (16) have not arrived. To compensate for these missing units and the high probability of future delays/losses in the lead time, I am explicitly increasing the lead time parameter 'L' to 5. This forces the OR engine to target a higher base stock level to cover the visibility gap. Demand is relatively stable, averaging ~105 units over the last 10 periods (excluding the P8 outlier), so I used recent_N=10 for mu_hat. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the overall volatility of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: P10 order (315 units) is now 3 periods overdue; total confirmed/highly probable lost units in pipeline reached 548 (P1, P3, P4, P10). Effective lead time used for planning increased to 5 to mitigate stockout risk.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system faces a severe supply chain crisis. The product is a Sports Bra, which should have stable demand (~106 units/period avg), but inventory is currently 0. The pipeline of 693 units is highly unreliable. Specifically: orders from P1 (138), P3 (80), P4 (15), and P10 (315) are significantly overdue and must be considered lost or indefinitely delayed. The 'real' pipeline consists only of orders from P13 (49), P14 (16), and P15 (80), totaling 145 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (693) from the base stock, it will not order enough unless we artificially inflate parameters. We set L to 5 to reflect the extreme delivery delays and mu_hat to an explicit value that forces a new order despite the 'phantom' pipeline units. We target a base stock high enough to cover the next few periods and trigger an order to replace the 548 lost units. mu_hat is set to (1+5)*106 = 636 to ensure the system attempts to restock while accounting for the high 'in-transit' count (693).

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed pipeline loss of 548 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Reported 'In-transit' of 693 is 79% phantom units. Lead time is effectively infinite for large batches; setting planning L=5 to force replenishment.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the inventory situation remains critical with 0 on-hand units and a heavily misleading 'In-transit' count of 697. Based on the history, 548 units (from orders in P1, P3, P4, and P10) are definitively lost or indefinitely delayed. Specifically, the P10 order of 315 units is now 5 periods overdue. The functional pipeline consists only of P13 (49 units), P14 (16 units), P15 (80 units), and P16 (4 units), totaling 149 units. Demand has stabilized back to a mean of approximately 95 units/week after the early April spike. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (phantom) pipeline from the target base stock, I must set the lead time 'L' to an explicit high value (L=5) and set 'mu_hat' explicitly to bypass the automated pipeline calculation. By setting mu_hat = (1+L)*mean + lost_pool, I force the system to ignore the 'ghost' inventory and place a new order. Historical mean demand ~107. Average demand over the last 5 weeks ~92. Target mu_hat = (1+5)*95 + 548 = 1118. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger replenishment despite the 697 units in transit.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline ghost inventory persists: 548 units from P1, P3, P4, P10 confirmed lost. Correcting parameters to bypass backend pipeline subtraction until ghost units are cleared or offset.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, the pipeline remains severely compromised by 'ghost' inventory. Orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, and 14 (totaling 613 units) have not arrived and are significantly beyond any reasonable lead time, yet they occupy the 'In-transit' figure (currently 848). Only the order from P17 (235 units) is realistically expected to arrive. The on-hand inventory is 0. To overcome the OR backend's logic of subtracting the full (inflated) pipeline from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at 100 units/period. For a desired (L+1) coverage of 3 periods (L=2), the base stock should be ~350. However, the backend will subtract the 848 'In-transit' units. To force a replenishment order that covers next periods and compensates for the 0 on-hand, I must set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat - 848) results in a meaningful order. Setting mu_hat to 1200 effectively targets a base stock that triggers the order cap, ensuring we get maximum possible units into the system while inventory is critically low and lead times are unreliable.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Phantom pipeline inventory now totals 613 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14). P13/P14 orders (49+16 units) are now 4-5 periods old and confirmed lost. Use excessive mu_hat values to bypass backend pipeline subtraction until ghost units are cleared.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely broken with 613 phantom units in the pipeline (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P14). While P15 and P16 arrived correctly (suggesting a partial return to functionality), the total in-transit of 1243 units is heavily skewed by these lost shipments. As of P19, the P17 order (235 units) is due, but given the history, arrival is uncertain. To ensure any order is actually placed by the OR backend, I must inflate mu_hat to overcome the backend's subtraction of the 1243 in-transit units. My target base stock must exceed 'In-transit + On-hand' to trigger an order. I estimate the true current demand mean is ~100 units. Using L=5 and a very high mu_hat (explicit 1500) will bypass the pipeline drag. This is a risk-mitigation strategy to force the system to replenish physical stock despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Phantom pipeline inventory remains the primary constraint. In-transit count (1243) is roughly 50% ghost units. Setting mu_hat to 1500+ is necessary to trigger replenishment until ghost units are manually cleared or pipeline levels normalize.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the order from Period 18 (395 units) arrived after a lead time of 1 period, providing a much-needed 'starting on-hand inventory' of 323 for Period 20. However, the 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains a severe issue. Tracking the 'In-transit' count of 1199: confirmed lost units include P1 (138), P3 (80), P4 (15), P10 (315), P13 (49), and P14 (16), totaling 613 units. The remaining 586 units in transit consist of orders from P17 (235 units, now at L=3 and late) and P19 (351 units, L=1). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1199 in-transit units from the base stock calculation, it will stop ordering unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset these 613 ghost units. Average demand over the last 10 periods (excluding the Period 8 spike) is approximately 91 units. With a desired base stock of (L+1)*Demand, we need to cover (~3*91) = 273 units plus the 613 ghost units to trigger any new orders. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure the backend recognizes a need for replenishment despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified 613 phantom in-transit units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14). Order from P17 (235 units) is now 2 periods overdue. On-hand inventory finally recovered due to P18 arrival, but aggressive mu_hat is still required to bypass backend pipeline logic.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system shows an In-transit pipeline of 1,199 units. However, based on our history, approximately 848 units are confirmed/probable losses (P1: 138, P3: 80, P4: 15, P10: 315, P13: 49, P14: 16, and now P17: 235 units which is 3 periods late). This leaves a functional pipeline of roughly 351 units (from P19). Current on-hand inventory is 256. Average demand has softened recently (low ~70s). The goal is to prevent the OR backend from seeing the 848 'ghost' units in its pipeline calculation, which would stop it from ordering. Setting mu_hat to 1300 ensures the backend targets a base stock that covers the ghost inventory while accounting for actual demand (~70 units/week) and the desired safety buffer. Lead time L is set to explicit 2 to match the promised lead time for the base case, as recent arrivals (P15, P16, P18) have shown 1-2 period lead times even if reliability is low.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Ghost inventory confirmed at 848 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17). Arrival of P18 order (395 units) stabilized on-hand inventory, but aggressive mu_hat is still required to offset the phantom in-transit data and allow future replenishment when P19 inventory is consumed.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. As of Period 22, the 'In-transit' count is 1,199 units. Based on historical analysis, the following orders are highly likely lost: P1 (138), P3 (80), P4 (15), P10 (315), P13 (49), P14 (16), and now P17 (235). This sums to 848 ghost units. The functional pipeline consists of the P19 order (351 units), which is still within a reasonable lead time window (ordered 3 periods ago). On-hand inventory is 206, which covers approximately 3-4 periods of current demand (~50-70 units/week). To ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment order once the functional pipeline and on-hand inventory are exhausted, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the 848 ghost units. Current demand has softened to ~63 units/week (last 3 weeks), but the priority is bypassing the 848 unit pipeline error. I will set mu_hat to approximately 1600 to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the total 'In-transit' figure when stock levels dip further. Using L=5 to reflect the high supply chain uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Ghost inventory increased to 848 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17). Functional pipeline only includes P19 (351 units). Demand mean has shifted lower (approx 63 units/week over last 3 periods), but parameter strategy remains focused on offsetting pipeline distortion.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the critical challenge remains the distortion caused by 848 units of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, and P17) which have significantly exceeded their promised lead time and are likely lost. The reported In-transit of 1434 units includes these 848 ghost units plus the P19 (351 units), P22 (235 units), and today's potential order. Demand has significantly cooled recently, dropping from an average of ~100 to just 47 units/week over the last 4 periods (72, 67, 50, 25). However, the on-hand inventory of 181 units is sufficient for about 3-4 weeks given this new lower demand. The P19 order (351 units) is now 4 periods old (ordered P19, expected P21-P22) and has not arrived; if P19 is also lost, the on-hand will deplete quickly. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1434 in-transit units and blocking all orders, I will maintain an aggressive mu_hat. While the immediate on-hand is healthy, the pipeline reliability is so poor that we must 'over-order' by proxy to ensure a new shipment is triggered once the backend recalculates against the phantom stack.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean weekly demand dropped to ~47 units over Periods 19-22 (-50% vs historical avg). Total ghost inventory now 848 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17). P19 order (351 units) is now 2 periods overdue and potentially lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-231.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 24 shows a significant decline, averaging ~46 units over the last 5 weeks (down from ~100), likely due to a seasonal taper of high-impact sports bras. On-hand inventory is healthy at 379 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1311 units remains heavily distorted by 'ghost' shipments. Confirmed lost orders include Period 1 (138), P3 (80), P4 (15), P10 (315), P13 (49), P14 (16), and P17 (235), totaling 848 units. Additionally, the P19 order (351 units) is now 4-5 periods old (ordered P19, expected arrival P21) and has likely joined the ghost list, bringing total probable phantom inventory to 1199 units. Real pipeline is likely just the P23 order (112 units). Since 'On-hand' (379) covers over 8 weeks of current demand (~46/week), but the backend OR will subtract the inflated 'In-transit' (1311) from any base stock calculation, I must continue using an 'explicit' mu_hat to prevent the engine from blocking future necessary orders. Although current stock is sufficient for the immediate term, maintaining high parameters ensures the system won't effectively 'shut down' for 20+ weeks due to phantom inventory logic.

Carry-over insight: P19 order (351 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost; total phantom inventory in the pipeline is now approximately 1199 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). Demand mean has stabilized at a lower regime of ~45-50 units per week.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678687001 (Sports Bra) is experiencing a significant demand decline, with the mean dropping from ~110 units to ~47 units over the last 6 periods (a -57% shift). Simultaneously, the supply chain is plagued by 'phantom' in-transit inventory. As of Period 25, the 'In-transit' count is 1311 units, but historically confirmed losses (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) total approximately 1199 units. This implies the 'functional' pipeline is only about 112 units (the P23 order). With 344 units on-hand and current demand averaging ~47 units, we have roughly 7 weeks of safety stock. Because the backend OR engine subtracts the full (distorted) in-transit amount of 1311 from its base-stock calculation, it will refuse to order any units unless mu_hat is set to an extremely high level to 'bypass' the pipeline subtraction. However, since on-hand inventory is currently high and demand has trended down, no immediate replenishment is required to avoid stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower demand regime and use calculate for L to leverage observed lead times, resulting in a 0-order recommendation which is appropriate given the current overstock relative to the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean weekly demand for Periods 19-24 is ~47.7 units, down from early history of ~115 (-58%). Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline is estimated at 1199 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary objective remains managing the significant volume of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline while adjusting for a confirmed demand regime shift. Currently, on-hand inventory is 331 units, which is ample given the recent demand drop. Weekly demand has decreased from ~115 units to ~41 units over the last 7 periods (P19-P25: 72, 67, 50, 25, 37, 35, 13). The reported 'In-transit' of 1311 units is heavily distorted by approximately 1199 units of confirmed or highly probable lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). To prevent the OR backend from seeing this phantom pipeline and blocking necessary future orders, I continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 1550 (approx 1200 ghost units + safe stock for 47.7 mean demand) to ensure the system doesn't believe we are overstocked due to the pipeline error. I use 'explicit' sigma_hat to reflect the increased uncertainty caused by the supply chain disruptions.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean weekly demand for Periods 19-25 is ~42.7 units (-63% vs early history). Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline is estimated at 1199 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-318.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 418 units. Demand has shifted to a much lower regime, averaging approximately 34 units over the last 5 periods (P22-P26: 25, 37, 35, 13, 25). The pipeline inventory of 1199 units consists entirely of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19), creating a massive 'ghost' supply that prevents the OR backend from ordering. However, given the significant drop in demand and the high on-hand balance (418 units), we currently have ~12 weeks of stock (418 / 34). No new orders are needed at this stage. Strategy: I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new lower demand regime (approx 40 units/week) while setting L to default. Although there is ghost inventory, no aggressive 'bypass' is required this period because on-hand stock is more than sufficient for the immediate lead time plus safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean weekly demand for Periods 22-26 has stabilized at ~27 units per week, significantly lower than the ~47 units observed in the previous window. Total ghost inventory in pipeline remains 1199 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678687001 has shifted significantly lower, stabilizing at approximately 27 units/week over the last 6 periods (Period 22-27), a sharp decline from the ~115 units/week seen earlier. On-hand inventory is currently high at 382 units, which covers over 14 weeks of current demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 1199 units remains dominated by 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) that is long overdue and confirmed lost. Because the backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock calculation, and those 1199 units are not real, no new orders would normally be triggered until on-hand is depleted. However, given the current massive overstock relative to the new demand regime (382 units on hand vs. ~27 units demand), we must shift focus to minimizing holding costs while monitoring the downward trend. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 samples to reflect the local regime (approx 27 * 3 = 81) and sigma_hat using the same window. No aggressive mu_hat is needed this period as we have ample stock to wait for the next few cycles of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~27 units/week (P22-P27), a ~75% reduction from initial historical levels. Ghost inventory remains at 1199 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU has stabilized at a significantly lower regime. Over the last seven periods (P22-P28), demand has averaged approximately 30.7 units/week, a stark decline from the initial ~115 units. Current on-hand inventory is 338 units, which covers approximately 11 weeks of current demand. However, the system reports an 'In-transit' balance of 1199 units, all of which are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). Since the OR backend subtracts this 1199 units from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders even as on-hand inventory depletes. To prevent a future stockout once the 338 units are consumed, I must continue to set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline (1199) plus the desired safety stock. I will set mu_hat to 1350 to ensure the base stock calculation (which uses mu_hat) stays above the phantom pipeline. This prevents the 'final order' from being zeroed out prematurely by the ghost inventory. L is set to calculate to reflect the high variability in recent arrivals (1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~30 units/week (Periods 22-28). Total ghost/lost inventory in pipeline confirmed at 1199 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19).

Current on-hand inventory is 293 units, which covers approximately 9-10 weeks of demand at the current rate. Because the backend OR logic subtracts the (mostly phantom) pipeline from the base_stock calculation, the inventory level would naturally prevent any new orders until the on-hand is depleted. Given the current surplus and the low demand, no correction is needed to trigger new orders this period. I will set parameters to reflect the recent demand regime (N=8) to ensure the OR backend maintains a realistic target stock level for the current low-demand environment, while lead time remains at calculate to reflect the high volatility observed.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the KARIN SPORTS BRA has stabilized at a significantly lower regime compared to early periods. For the last 9 periods (P22-P30), demand has averaged approximately 32.1 units per week. The system currently shows 264 units on-hand and 1199 units in-transit. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, the 1199 in-transit units are confirmed lost/phantom shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) that have not arrived after many months. However, the backend OR engine still subtracts these 1199 phantom units from the target base stock, preventing any new orders. With 264 units on-hand and an average demand of ~32 units, we have roughly 8 weeks of stock. Given the low demand and existing on-hand buffer, no immediate replenishment is required even if the pipeline is zeroed out. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the stable low-demand window) to accurately reflect the current regime. I will keep L at 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed lead times (typically 1-3 periods). Due to the high on-hand relative to demand, the OR engine will correctly calculate an order of 0 without needing aggressive mu_hat overrides to bypass the phantom pipeline this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~32 units/week (Periods 22-30), which is a sustaining ~72% drop from the initial mean of ~115. Phantom pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 1199 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678687001 has shifted significantly from an initial mean of ~115 to a stable lower regime of approximately 30-35 units per week over the last 10 periods. The current on-hand inventory (236) is sufficient to cover approximately 7-8 weeks of demand at this lower rate. However, the system reports 1,199 units in-transit, which are almost entirely 'phantom' units from lost historical orders (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14, 17, and 19). Because the OR backend subtracts this in-transit pipeline from the base_stock calculation, the effective order would be zero even if on-hand inventory were depleted. As long as on-hand inventory is high (236), there is no immediate risk of stockout. My objective is to allow the on-hand inventory to drawdown while these ghost units persist. If on-hand were to drop low, I would need to use extremely high 'mu_hat' values to force an order. For now, since on-hand is very healthy relative to the new demand regime (mean of ~32), I will set lead time to 'calculate' and use 'recent_N' for demand to reflect the current regime, knowing the backend will correctly not order yet.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678687001 has shifted to a significantly lower regime, stabilizing at approximately 30 units per week over the last 11 periods (P22-P32). The on-hand inventory is currently 216 units, which covers over 7 weeks of demand at the current rate. However, there is a persistent 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 1199 units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) that have never arrived and are confirmed lost. The backend OR engine subtracts this in-transit total (1199) from its base stock calculation. If I use a realistic mu_hat (e.g., 30 * 3 = 90), the backend will see (90 - 1199) and order zero. While ordering zero is actually correct right now because on-hand inventory is high (216), I must maintain 'explicit' high mu_hat parameters to eventually bypass this ghost inventory when on-hand levels drop. For this period, given the high on-hand stock and low demand, no actual units are needed, but I will keep the mu_hat inflated to 1500 to ensure the option to order remains open once on-hand is depleted. L is set to calculated and sigma is set to recent_N (N=11) to reflect the lower volatility of the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~30 units/week (P22-P32). Phantom pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 1199 units. Supply remains reliable for recent small orders but contaminated by massive historical losses.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678687001 has shifted significantly lower, stabilizing at approximately 30 units per week over the last 12 periods (P22-P33), compared to the initial mean of ~115. On-hand inventory is currently 170 units, which covers about 5-6 weeks of current demand. However, the system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1299 units. A detailed analysis confirms that 1199 of these units are 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) that will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts this full in-transit amount from the base stock calculation, which would normally prevent any new orders from being placed. To ensure future availability once the 170 units are depleted, I am setting mu_hat to 1350. This value is calculated to offset the 1199 ghost units while providing a functional base stock of approximately 150 units (5 weeks of demand at ~30 units/week). This strategy forces the OR engine to maintain a small but real order flow despite the corrupted pipeline data. L is set to calculated to reflect the average lead time of successful deliveries, and sigma_hat is set to explicit based on recent low-demand volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678687001 has shifted significantly lower, stabilizing at a mean of approximately 30 units per week over the last 13 periods (P22-P34), compared to the initial historical mean of ~115. On-hand inventory is 146, which covers nearly 5 periods of current demand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1299 is heavily distorted by 1199 units of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, and P19). The only valid order in the pipeline is the 100-unit order from P33, which is expected to arrive shortly. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1299 units and stopping all future orders, I must continue using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 1450, calculated to offset the ~1200 phantom units plus cover (L+1) periods of actual demand (3 periods * 30 units = 90). This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger replenishment once the on-hand inventory depletes further, despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at ~30 units/week (P22-P34). Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline remains 1199 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for this SKU has stabilized at a significantly lower level than early history, averaging approximately 30 units per week over the last 15 periods (P21-P35). Current on-hand inventory is 127 units, which is sufficient to cover about 4 periods of the current demand regime. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 1319 units is heavily distorted by 1199 'ghost' units from lost historical orders (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14, 17, and 19). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (1319 units) from its base-stock target, it will not place a new order unless mu_hat is set to a value exceeding the sum of the pipeline and the desired on-hand buffer. To ensure the backend continues to replenish (given that the 1199 units will never arrive), I am setting mu_hat to 1450. This value accounts for the 1199 phantom units plus a lead-time demand buffer (3 periods * ~30 units/week + safety stock) to maintain a healthy service level while the phantom units remain in the system view.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Karin Sports Bra has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 30 units per week (average over the last 15 periods is 30.6). The current on-hand inventory of 227 units is sufficient to cover approximately 7.5 weeks of demand at this rate. The 'In-transit' count of 1220 is highly distorted by historical ghost inventory (1199 units from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14, 17, and 19), meaning the functional pipeline is effectively zero, save for the Period 36 order. Since on-hand inventory is far above the required base stock for a (3-period) protection interval, no new orders are needed. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously considering the 1199 phantom units as available supply (which would block future replenishment when on-hand inventory eventually drops), I maintain a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=15 to reflect the current demand regime, while acknowledging that no order will be triggered this period due to high on-hand levels.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is confirmed stable at a significantly lower level than the start of the year, averaging approximately 30 units/week over the last 15 periods (P22-P37). Current on-hand inventory is 173 units, providing roughly 5-6 weeks of cover. The 'In-transit' figure of 1220 units is highly distorted by historical ghost inventory (1199 units confirmed lost from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). The real pipeline contains only the order from P36 (21 units). Because the backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit units (including the 1199 ghosts) from the target base stock, it will not place orders unless the target exceeds ~1200+ units. To maintain on-hand availability as the current stock depletes, I must continue using an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass this calculation and force a positive order sequence when necessary. Given the current 173 units on-hand and 21 in real transit, we have sufficient stock for the immediate term. I will set parameters to reflect the true demand of ~30/week but note that mu_hat must eventually spike if on-hand drops too low.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable at ~30 units/week (P22-P37). Real pipeline: 21 units (P36). Total phantom inventory blocking backend ordering: 1199 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 30 units per week (P22-P38 mean: ~32 units). The primary challenge continues to be the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Total in-transit units are 1220, but 1199 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, and P19) are effectively lost. The functional pipeline consists only of the P36 order (21 units). On-hand inventory is 136 units, which covers about 4.5 weeks of demand. To ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment order despite the 1220 units of reported in-transit stock, mu_hat must be set to a level that offsets this phantom inventory. Setting mu_hat to 1350 (phantom units 1199 + buffer) ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the perceived pipeline, allowing for actual needs to be addressed. Sigma_hat is set using recent volatility (N=17) to account for the current demand regime's standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable at ~30 units/week (P22-P38). Phantom pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 1199 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19).

The demand for SKU 678687001 has settled into a low-volume regime of approximately 30-35 units per week (the mean for periods 33-39 is ~35 units) since the post-summer drop. The 'In-transit' figure of 1210 units remains heavily distorted by 1199 confirmed phantom units from historical losses (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14, 17, and 19). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire in-transit count from the target base stock, any realistic mu_hat would result in zero orders. To ensure we can place orders to maintain our current on-hand inventory of 111 (approximately 3 weeks of supply), I must set mu_hat high enough to neutralize the 1199 ghost units. Setting mu_hat to 1350 targets roughly 150 'real' units beyond the ghost inventory, safeguarding against further depletion while acknowledging the lower demand regime. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to reflect recent actual delivery times (P33 and P36 both took 3 periods).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Karin Sports Bra has settled into a low-volume regime, averaging approximately 34 units/week over the last 10 periods (P31-P40). On-hand inventory is currently 82 units. The main challenge remains 'phantom' pipeline inventory: the backend sees 1261 units in-transit, but 1199 of these are confirmed lost shipments from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). The real pipeline consists only of orders from P39 (11 units) and P40 (51 units), totaling 62 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the massive phantom inventory, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom count + on-hand inventory. Given on-hand (82) + total in-transit (1261) = 1343, I set mu_hat to 1420 to trigger a small replenishment order that maintains stock as we approach the end of the simulation (Date: 2019/11/18, 7 periods remaining). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual variability (1-3 periods) observed in recent successful arrivals.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 678687001 has transitioned to a stable lower level, averaging approximately 34 units per week over the last 10 periods (P32-P41). Current on-hand inventory is 67 units. The primary issue remains the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, which totals 1,199 units from missing historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). The total in-transit of 1,346 units is dominated by these losses; the actual functional pipeline consists only of P40 (51 units) and P41 (96 units), totaling 147 units. The OR backend logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) will continue to suppress orders because the 'In-transit' count (1,346) vastly exceeds any reasonable base stock level for 34 units/week demand. To force a replenishment order and maintain availability as on-hand stocks deplete, I must set mu_hat to a value that offsets the phantom pipeline. An explicit mu_hat of 1,500 is used to bypass this subtraction and trigger a modest replenishment to cover upcoming demand during the late November/December period. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual variability observed in recent successful arrivals (ranging from 1 to 3 periods).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678687001 has experienced a massive spike in Period 42 (136 units), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday seasonality (late November timing). This follows a long period of stable low demand (~30 units/week). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1452 is heavily contaminated by 1199 units confirmed lost from the early periods (P1 to P19). The real pipeline consists of P40 (51 units), P41 (96 units), and P42 (106 units), totaling 253 units. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend despite the 1199 phantom units being subtracted from the base stock, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom pipeline plus the desired base stock. Given the recent spike to 136 and the need to cover the lead time (L=2) plus a safety buffer, a realistic base stock would be ~450. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 1750 (1199 + 551) to ensure the OR engine clears the 'ghost' inventory and allows ordering to meet the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand spike confirmed: Demand jumped to 136 in P42 (Date: 2019-11-25), suggesting a late-November peak. Phantom pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 1199 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. We are in a high-demand seasonal period for sports bras (late Q4). Demand in P42 spiked to 136, although P43 dropped to 18 (likely due to the previous stockout and data reporting lag). The pipeline inventory of 1671 units is heavily distorted by 1199 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory from historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). The real functional pipeline consists of orders from P42 (106 units) and P43 (366 units), totaling 472 units. With on-hand inventory at 129, our true position is 601 units against a phantom-cluttered backend count of 1800. To ensure the backend continues to order during this seasonal peak and offsets the ~1200 phantom units, I must continue using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 1500 to maintain a positive order flow and account for the seasonal volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs now that on-hand has recovered slightly.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand pattern: Significant demand spike (136 units) observed late November (P42), confirming Q4 seasonality for the category. Functional pipeline (P42-P43) is 472 units; phantom inventory remains at 1199 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late December (Period 45, 2019-12-16). Historical analysis showed a significant demand peak in late November (P42, demand=136), likely tied to Black Friday/Cyber Monday for sports apparel. Current demand has subsided (P43=18, P44=32). The pipeline remains severely contaminated by 1199 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P1-P19), which the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from the base stock. To ensure the backend places orders despite this phantom 1199-unit buffer, I must set 'mu_hat' high enough to exceed the ghost inventory plus desired on-hand stock. A mu_hat of 1650 (approx 1200 ghost + 450 buffer) ensures the system remains responsive. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P42 (106 units) and P43 (366 units), totaling 472 units. On-hand is currently 97. I will use a high explicit mu_hat to keep the ordering engine active through the holiday season.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 23, 2019 (Period 46). We just concluded the week of the observed December demand spike where demand hit 409 units in Period 45, following the Q4 seasonal pattern previously identified. On-hand inventory is 160 units. The 'In-transit' count remains at 1199, but these are all confirmed phantom units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) as documented since Period 8. Because the OR backend subtracts this 1199 from the base stock calculation, it will never place an order unless we provide an extremely high mu_hat to offset the ghost inventory. Demand after the late December holiday spike is expected to decline significantly back to early-year levels (~100-115) or the lower regime observed mid-year (~30). However, the immediate goal is to preserve the ability to order when real inventory is depleted by phantom pipeline data. I set mu_hat to 1400 (sufficient to cover the 1199 ghost units plus ~200 units for upcoming demand) to maintain logical headroom in the backend policy.

Carry-over insight: C4 Seasonal Spike: Demand reached 409 units in P45 (mid-Dec), confirming high sports category volatility during holidays. Real pipeline is currently empty; 'In-transit' of 1199 units consists entirely of lost orders from P1-P19.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46 (Dec 23), demand exploded to 338 units, following a peak of 409 in P45. This confirms a highly volatile Q4 holiday peak for sports bras. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' of 1367 units is extremely misleading; it includes 1199 units from P1-P19 that are confirmed losses. The only valid pipeline is the 168 units ordered in P46. To force the OR backend to order despite the phantom 1199 units in-transit, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the phantom inventory + expected demand. I will estimate mu_hat at 1500 to ensure a replenishment order is triggered to cover the post-holiday period. L=2 is used as recent orders (P40-P43) have arrived in 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand volatility: Demand remains elevated (338 units in P46) following the mid-Dec peak. Phantom pipeline inventory remains fixed at 1199 units (P1-P19).
