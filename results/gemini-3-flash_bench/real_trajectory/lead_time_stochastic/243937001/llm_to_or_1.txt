Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 243937001 (Women's Socks). Historical demand (5 samples) shows a mean of 78 units/week with a standard deviation of 8.2. Although 2019-02-14 is Valentine's Day, women's cotton blend socks typically don't see massive gift-giving spikes compared to other categories, though a slight uptick is possible. With on-hand inventory at 0 and no units in transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The critical fractile for this SKU is q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95, which requires a high service level. I will use the 'default' method for L to start with the promised lead time of 2. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the base demand level while the system stabilizes. This will target a base stock covering approximately (2+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Straight Edge 5p Socks', which has stable demand. In Period 1, we saw a demand of 54 units. Since we started with 0 on-hand inventory, we had 54 lost sales. We placed an order for 92 units in Period 1, which is now 'In-transit'. Given the promised lead time (L) is 2, we expect this order to arrive in Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). In the meantime, we have 0 on-hand inventory for Period 2, meaning any demand this period will also be lost sales. Historical demand samples (70, 77, 91, 79, 73, 54) show a mean of ~74. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend, setting L to default (2). No seasonality spikes are expected in mid-February for this category. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated using all 6 available data points to establish a stable baseline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). This SKU (243937001) is likely a core staple item (Fine-knit cotton blend socks). Reviewing the 5 pre-game demand samples (average: 78) and the first two periods of game demand (54 and 72), there is no evidence of a major regime shift or significant seasonality trend yet, although demand is slightly lower than pre-game averages. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the orders from Period 1 and Period 2 are still in transit (Promised Lead Time = 2). The order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 3) and be visible in the next status update. To ensure we cover demand during the review period and lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), I will use the last 5 samples (P1, P2, and the last 3 pre-game samples) to set mu_hat. This balances recent game data with established pre-game behavior. Lead time 'L' remains at default (2) as we haven't confirmed any deviation yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product (Womens Socks) has a promised lead time of 2 periods. We placed orders in P1 (92 units), P2 (95 units), and P3 (73 units). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests a potential lead time delay or shipping issue, as P1 (ordered 2/11) should have arrived by now if L=2. Historical demand from the provided samples (mean ~78) is higher than the demand observed in the first 3 game periods (54, 72, 48; mean ~58). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 260 units in transit. Since we haven't seen an arrival yet, I will keep L at default (2) for now but will monitor closely next period. I will use recent_N for demand to capture the slightly lower-than-expected early game demand while still accounting for the historical samples.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/03/11. We are managing 'Fine-knit socks'. Historical demand shows an average near 75-80, but the last four periods observed in-game (54, 72, 48, 38) suggest a relative dip compared to the pre-game history (which averaged 78). Specifically, the last two periods (48, 38) are notably lower. We missed sales in Periods 1-3 due to zero starting inventory. Period 4 arrived from Period 2 (lead_time=2, matching promised), but the Period 1 order (92 units) is missing. If it were lead_time 2, it should have arrived in Period 3. Since it wasn't mentioned in Period 4's conclude message, it may be lost or significantly delayed. On-hand is 57, In-transit is 165 (Period 1's 92 units + Period 3's 73 units). To stay safe against the missing Period 1 order and the general demand volatility, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=4) for demand to account for the recent lower observations, while keeping the default lead time (2) since the Period 2 order arrived as promised.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, current inventory is low (20 units) after satisfying demand in Period 5. Analysis of the history reveals a significant lead time issue: the Period 1 order (92 units) has not arrived even after 5 periods (expected in Period 3), whereas the Period 2 order (95 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time 2). This suggests the Period 1 shipment is likely lost or severely delayed. To maintain service levels for this women's cotton blend sock (a core staple), I am choosing 'explicit' lead time as 2 to reflect the promised window, but I must account for the missing pipeline. Demand has slightly softened since the initial samples (average ~78) to a more recent average (~44 over the last 3 periods). Therefore, I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the full trajectory while balancing the earlier high demand with recent lower observations. This ensures the OR engine targets a base stock that covers (2+1) periods of demand, accounting for the 165 units currently in transit (presumably from Period 3 and any recent OR calculations).

Carry-over insight: Potential lost shipment: Period 1 order (92 units) has not arrived as of Period 6 (lead time > 5 periods, promised 2). Sustained demand shift: Historical samples averaged 78, but observed demand in periods 1-5 averaged ~50 units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/03/25). Reviewing history: The Period 1 order (92 units) is officially lost (lead time > 5 periods). The Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2). The Period 3 order (73 units) was placed on 2019/2/25 with a promised lead time of 2, so it should have arrived in Period 5 (visible in Period 6 conclude); since it hasn't, it is also likely lost or severely delayed. Current observed demand (Periods 1-6) averages ~46.6 units, which is significantly lower than the historical samples (~78 units). Total In-transit is 171 (consisting of the presumably lost P1/P3 orders and the P6 order of 6 units). Because the OR backend subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the target base stock, if we treat lost orders as in-transit, the system won't order enough to replenish our zero on-hand inventory. I will set L to 'explicit' = 2 to stay with the promised lead time (since P2 was on time), and set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the lower demand regime (avg ~47 per period). To compensate for the lost pipeline inventory, I will manually elevate mu_hat using 'explicit' to force an order. Since on-hand is 0 and we need to cover L+1 (3) periods of demand (~141 units) and the backend thinks we have 171 coming when we likely only have 6, I will set mu_hat to 300 to clear the pipe and trigger replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 and Period 3 (73 units). Total lost pipeline ~165 units. Demand regime stabilized at ~47 units/period (down 40% from pre-game samples).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 243937001 (Women's Socks) is facing significant supply chain disruption and a sustained demand drop. Historical pre-game demand was ~78, but the average for Periods 1-7 is 45.4 units, confirming a ~42% drop. On the supply side, shipments from Period 1 (92 units) and Period 3 (73 units) are lost (well past the 2-period lead time). The shipment from Period 2 arrived correctly on Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory (296 units) nominally consists of the lost P1 and P3 units (165 total) and more recent orders from P6 (6 units) and P7 (125 units). To correct for the 'lost' pipeline units that the OR engine assumes will arrive, I will use 'explicit' values. I set mu_hat to 141 ((1+L) * 47) based on the current demand regime. For sigma_hat, the historical standard deviation is roughly 14; adjusted for L=2, sqrt(3)*14 is ~24. To ensure the OR engine actually orders enough to cover the zero on-hand and lost units, I must account for the fact that the OR backend subtracts the full 296 In-transit from its target. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime while acknowledging the lost units, the capped policy will trigger replenishments to rebuild the stock for the 47 units/period demand.

Carry-over insight: Supply failure confirmed: Pipeline inventory includes 165 units from P1 and P3 that are lost and will not arrive. Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand dropped from pre-game 78 to ~45-47 units starting Period 1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/4/8), the SKU 243937001 (Women's socks) is in a stabilized low-demand regime. Historical demand since Period 1 has averaged ~44 units (54, 72, 48, 38, 37, 31, 38, 34), which is significantly lower than the pre-game baseline of 78. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this shift. Regarding supply, we have 97 units on-hand. The 165 units 'In-transit' are confirmed as lost (P1 and P3 orders), meaning 'pipeline_inventory' in the OR backend remains falsely inflated. To counter this and trigger a necessary replenishment order, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but will allow the OR backend to recalculate based on recent successful deliveries (P6 and P7 both arrived recently). \u03bc\u0302 will be set to (1+2)*44 \u2248 132 using recent_N=8. \u03c3\u0302 will also be set using recent_N=8 to account for the reduced volatility in the new regime. This approach should ensure the system recognizes the need for stock despite the 'ghost' pipeline inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019-04-15), we are managing 'Straight Edge 5p Socks'. Current on-hand inventory is 66 units. Demand has clearly shifted from the pre-game average of 78 to a lower regime. Over the last 9 periods, the average demand is ~42.5; more recently (last 5 periods), it has averaged ~34.2. We are also dealing with phantom pipeline inventory: 165 units (from P1 and P3) are definitively lost as they haven't arrived in 7-9 periods (promised LT=2). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized lower demand of ~34 units/period. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P6 and P7 orders) showed lead times of 1 and 2 periods, suggesting the supply line has resumed somewhat normal operations despite the earlier losses. The OR engine's 'cap' and 'pipeline_inventory' logic will be slightly skewed by the 165 lost units, so using the more conservative recent demand mean will help prevent excessive ordering if those lost units are ever written off or if demand continues to soften post-winter.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 11 (2019-04-22). The product is a pack of cotton socks. Historical demand samples (pre-Period 1) averaged 78 units, but game history shows a sustained drop. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has decreased to a mean of 30.8 units (38, 31, 38, 34, 31, 20), suggesting a new demand regime. The pipeline shows 165 units 'In-transit', but these were ordered in Period 1 (92 units) and Period 3 (73 units). Given the promised lead time is 2 periods and we are now at Period 11, these shipments are clearly lost. The OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the calculated base stock; if we don't adjust our parameters, the engine will assume we have 165 units coming and won't place orders, leading to stockouts. To fix this, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I'll set mu_hat = (1+L) * mean_demand + 165. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 31 + 165 = 258. This effectively 'neutralizes' the Ghost Pipeline by adding its value to the target stock level. Sigma_hat is calculated based on the standard deviation of recent demand (~6.8) over 3 periods: sqrt(3)*6.8 \u2248 11.8.

Carry-over insight: Lost pipeline offset: Adding 165 units to mu_hat to neutralize phantom inventory from failed P1/P3 deliveries. Demand regime stabilized lower: Average demand periods 6-10 is ~31 units compared to pre-game 78.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/29. Observed demand has declined from the pre-game average of 78 to an average of ~31 units/period over the last 6 periods (Periods 6-11). The pipeline inventory currently shows 232 units, but 165 of these (from Period 1 and Period 3) are confirmed lost shipments that will not arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline from its order calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 165 phantom units. My target base stock calculation: (1+L)*mean_demand + z*sigma_std*sqrt(1+L). With L=2 (promised), mean_demand ~ 30, and a service level target of 0.95 (z~1.645), a normal base stock would be around 110-120 units. However, I must add the 165 lost units back to mu_hat to overcome the phantom pipeline. Total mu_hat = (3 periods * 30 demand/period) + 165 lost units = 255. Sigma is set based on recent volatility (std ~ 7) * sqrt(3) ~ 12.

Carry-over insight: Refined Lost Pipeline Offset: Demand has stabilized at ~30 units/period (Periods 6-11); mu_hat continues to hold +165 units to neutralize the persistent phantom pipeline from P1 and P3 deliveries.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand for the 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the pre-game baseline. Over the last seven periods (P6-P12), demand has averaged 25 units per week (min 17, max 38). The pipeline inventory of 246 units includes 165 'phantom' units from P1 (92) and P3 (73) which are confirmed lost. To prevent the OR backend from seeing these phantom units as available stock and under-ordering, I must neutralize them by adding 165 units to the mu_hat forecast. Using L=2 (promised), a 3-period demand forecast (L+1) based on recent demand (~25 units/period) is 75 units. Adding the offset, mu_hat = 75 + 165 = 240. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 7 periods to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 6-12 average demand is ~25 units/period, down from pre-game 78 and early-game ~45. Phantom inventory of 165 units remains in pipeline (P1, P3).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13, 2019. Demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' has stabilized significantly lower than the pre-game samples (78). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P6-P13) is approximately 23.8 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 187 includes 165 units from orders placed in P1 (92) and P3 (73) which are confirmed lost, as their lead times now exceed 11 periods. The actual pipeline consists only of the P12 order (14) and P13 order (8), totaling 22 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 165 'phantom' units and under-ordering, I must neutralize them by adding 165 to the mu_hat forecast. I use recent_N=8 to capture the stable low-demand window (P6-P13). Expected mu_hat = (1+L)*23.8 + 165 = (3*23.8) + 165 = 71.4 + 165 = 236.4. This ensures the backend maintains a base stock that covers real demand despite the stuck pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Fine-knit socks' has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the pre-game average of 78. Over the last 6 periods (P9-P14), mean demand is approximately 21 units per period. The pipeline inventory (187 units) is heavily distorted by 165 units from orders in Period 1 (92) and Period 3 (73) that are confirmed as lost shipments. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering because of this 'phantom' inventory, I must adjust the target base stock (mu_hat) upwards. Specifically, I set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of current demand (3 * 21 = 63) plus the 165 units of phantom inventory, totaling 228. This ensures the engine accounts for the missing stock. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the lower volatility of the recent stable regime.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' has shifted through multiple regimes: pre-game samples averaged 78, P1-P5 averaged ~50, and P6-P15 has stabilized at ~25 units/period (average over last 10 periods: 24.9). Recent demand shows a slight uptick to 33 in P15 but remains within the late-spring low-demand profile for this product category. The pipeline contains 190 units, but 165 of these are confirmed lost (92 from P1 + 73 from P3). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom/lost pipeline, I must neutralize it by adding 165 units to the mu_hat forecast. Calculation: (1+L) * Mean + Phantom = (1+2)*25 + 165 = 75 + 165 = 240. sigma_hat is set to the standard deviation of the current low-demand regime (approx. 7 units per period) scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 6-15 average demand is ~25 units/period. Phantom inventory of 165 units remains in pipeline (P1: 92, P3: 73) and requires persistent mu_hat offset. Seasonal trend for fine-knit socks shows sustained lower demand through late spring.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd (Period 17). Demand for this item (fine-knit socks) has stabilized at a lower regime; the average demand from Period 6 to Period 16 is approximately 25 units. There is a persistent 'phantom inventory' issue: orders from Period 1 (92 units) and Period 3 (73 units) total 165 units in the 'In-transit' pool. Since the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from its calculated base stock, I must artificially inflate mu_hat by these 165 units to prevent the backend from under-ordering due to these lost shipments. The base demand forecast for 3 periods (L=2 + 1) is ~75 units (25 * 3). Adding the 165-unit offset results in a mu_hat of 240. Sigma_hat is set using recent volatility (Periods 6-16), though its effect is secondary to the pipeline correction. On-hand is low (5 units), and while we have 78 units of 'real' in-transit (P13: 8, P14: 14, P15: 3, P16: 53), the engine needs the mu_hat offset to trigger necessary replenishment.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for fine-knit socks has remained low and stable, averaging ~20 units/period over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) and ~25 units/period over the last 10. The phantom inventory issue persists: P1 (92 units) and P3 (73 units) total 165 units in the 'In-transit' figure that will never arrive. The OR backend ignores this, so I must continue to inflate mu_hat to neutralize the -165 unit deduction that occurs when calculating orders. With L=2, the base stock formula is (1+L) * mu_hat. I target a real mu of ~22 units, which requires an effective mu_hat calculation of (3 * 22) + 165 = 231. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat allows me to precisely maintain this offset. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=8) to reflect the recent lower volatility (demand range 12-33). Lead time 'calculate' remains appropriate as recent arrivals (P2, P6, P11, P12, P15, P16) generally align with the 2-period promise or arrive early (L=1 or 2).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' (fine-knit cotton blend) has entered a low-demand regime. Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), demand has averaged 18 units, dropping significantly from the previous average of ~30. The mean of the last 3 periods is only 12 units. We continue to manage a 'phantom inventory' issue: 165 units from orders in P1 and P3 are lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' total (203 total in-transit - 22 true units from P15 and P17 = 181 units, though the math from actual orders suggests the phantom is roughly 165). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these ghost units, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Phantom Offset). Desired base stock for (L+1)=3 periods at a demand of ~15 units/period is 45 units. Adding 165 units for the offset gives a mu_hat of 210. Sigma_hat is set relatively low to reflect the stable, low-demand summer pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand dropped from ~25 to ~12 units for early summer period. Phantom inventory from P1/P3 remains 165 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' has significantly decreased entering late June, with the last 4 periods (P16-P19) averaging roughly 10 units per period (15, 12, 9, 4), confirming a low-demand regime. The phantom pipeline inventory from Period 1 (92 units) and Period 3 (73 units) remains at 165 units. Because the OR engine subtracts this phantom inventory from the calculated base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to neutralize this. Calculation for mu_hat: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Phantom_Inventory. With L=2 and a conservative forecast of 12 units/period for this season, mu_hat = (3 * 12) + 165 = 201. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower volatility. Lead time (L) remains at the default of 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime confirmed for early summer (June): avg demand fell to ~10 units/period. Phantom inventory of 165 units (P1, P3) persist and continues to require a mu_hat offset.

As of Period 21 (July 1st), we are in a sustained low-demand regime for fine-knit socks, typical for the summer season.

The mechanical OR backend consumes total pipeline inventory (On-hand + In-transit), but our pipeline currently includes 165 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments in Period 1 (92 units) and Period 3 (73 units). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these non-existent units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required mu_hat as: ((L+1) * forecast_demand) + phantom_inventory. With L=2 and forecast=10, this equals (3 * 10) + 165 = 195. This forces the base stock to account for the lost units while maintaining stock for current demand. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the current lower volatility of the summer regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for fine-knit socks has entered a summer trough, stabilizing at approximately 10 units per period over the last 5 periods (Periods 17-21). The 'In-transit' quantity remains 203 units, which includes 165 units of phantom inventory from lost Period 1 and Period 3 orders (92 + 73 = 165). The OR backend calculates the order as: base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to the forecasted demand across the (L+1) window PLUS the 165 lost units. Given L=2, the window is 3 periods. Expected demand is 10 * 3 = 30 units. Adding the offset: 30 + 165 = 195 units. We use 'explicit' for mu_hat (195) and sigma_hat (10, reflecting low volatility in the current regime) to ensure the target inventory level is maintained despite the supply data errors.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed (late June/July): demand has stabilized at ~10 units/period (avg P17-P21). Phantom inventory of 165 units (P1, P3) persists and requires a mu_hat offset of +165 to prevent stockouts.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15. We are in a sustained summer demand trough for fine-knit socks. Demand over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) has averaged ~8.7 units/period, significantly lower than the pre-game average of 78. In-transit inventory is 203 units, but 165 units of this (from Period 1 and Period 3) are confirmed lost shipments that will not arrive. This 'phantom' inventory must be neutralized to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. I set mu_hat using 'explicit' to include both the seasonal forecast for (1+L=3) periods (approx. 3 * 9 = 27 units) plus the 165 unit offset, totaling 192. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=6 to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P15, P16) showed standard 1-2 period delivery times.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019, which is the peak of the summer season. Demand for 'Fine-knit socks' has reached a sustained trough, averaging approximately 9 units/period over the last 7 periods (P17-P23). The system reports a total pipeline (in-transit) of 203 units. However, 165 units from Period 1 (92 units) and Period 3 (73 units) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, though they still count toward the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory'. To prevent the backend from stopping orders due to this 'phantom' stock, I must increase mu_hat by exactly 165 units to neutralize it. The true underlying demand forecast is based on the recent average of 9 units/period. Over the (L+1)=3 periods (review + lead time), expected demand is 27. Corrected mu_hat = 27 (forecast) + 165 (offset) = 192. Sigma_hat is calculated for the recent low-demand regime (sqrt(3) * std_dev of demand P17-P23). Lead time L is set to the promised 2 periods as recent deliveries (e.g., P11, P15, P16) confirmed arrivals within 1-2 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in a deep summer trough for fine-knit socks. Average demand from Period 19 to 24 (6 weeks) is approximately 7 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales in Period 24. There is a persistent 'phantom' inventory of 165 units in the pipeline from Periods 1 and 3 that will never arrive. The total In-transit is 203, but subtraction of the 165 units of phantom inventory leaves an effective pipeline of 38 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the summer demand and account for the phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory: (3 periods * 7 units/period) + 165 units = 186. This ensures the backend (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) calculation results in an order sufficient to meet immediate demand despite the 165 units it thinks are arriving.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough (July) stabilized at ~7 units/period (average P19-P24). Phantom inventory of 165 units (P1, P3) remains and requires a mu_hat offset of +165 to maintain availability.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. The SKU is 'Fine-knit socks'. We are in a summer demand trough, with demand for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) averaging ~7.2 units/period. The pipeline inventory of 203 units contains 165 phantom units from lost shipments in Period 1 (92 units) and Period 3 (73 units) that have never arrived and will not arrive. This phantom pipeline prevents the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes stock is coming. Currently, on-hand is 0 and recent demand is being lost. To force the backend to place an order, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock as (L+1) * forecasted_demand. With L=2 and demand=8, base_stock should be ~24. However, I must add the 165 phantom units to the mu_hat value to negate their impact in the 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' calculation. mu_hat = 24 + 165 = 189. This should trigger an order of approximately 24 units (+/- rounding and cap), providing the necessary stock for the late summer/early autumn transition.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/8/12). Demand for fine-knit socks has reached its annual trough (averaging ~7 units/period over the last 6 periods). We have 0 on-hand inventory and the OR backend sees 203 units in-transit. Crucially, 165 of those units are from Period 1 (92 units) and Period 3 (73 units), which are confirmed lost and will never arrive (phantom inventory). This leaves only 38 units of 'real' pipeline inventory. Since the OR logic subtracts the full pipeline (203) from its target, we must inject a mu_hat offset of +165 to neutralize the phantom inventory and trigger orders that cover future demand. Setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at (1+L) * avg_demand + offset = (3 * 7) + 165 \u2248 186. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the current low-demand stability.

Carry-over insight: End of summer trough: Demand stabilized at ~7 units/period (P22-P26). Phantom inventory of 165 units remains the primary driver for mu_hat adjustments to prevent stockouts while on-hand is zero.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 19, 2019. Demand is beginning to recover from a summer low of ~7 units (P22-P26) to 18 units in P27 as we approach the back-to-school season for socks. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 203, but 165 units are phantom inventory from P1 (92) and P3 (73) that never arrived. The effective pipeline is only 38 units (likely the P17 order). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 165 phantom units, I must offset mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime has shifted upward: I will use a forecast of ~20 units/period for the (L+1)=3 week horizon. Calculation: (3 periods * 20 units/period) + 165 phantom offset = 225. I set sigma_hat to 35 to reflect increasing volatility during a seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school recovery: Demand increased from summer trough (~7) to 18 in P27. Phantom inventory of 165 units (P1, P3) remains the primary driver for high mu_hat values to ensure the OR engine places orders despite the inflated pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the 'Back-to-school' transition period (late August). Following a summer trough where demand averaged ~7 units (P22-P26), demand has increased to 18 (P27) and 13 (P28), averaging ~15.5 over the last two weeks. Based on the product type (Fine-knit cotton blend socks) and the date (2019/08/26), we expect demand to continue recovering toward the pre-game baseline of ~78 or at least the spring level of ~30-45 units. System constraints: On-hand is zero and we have a significant phantom inventory in the pipeline (165 units from P1 and P3 are lost but still counted by the OR backend). To force the backend to place an order despite this 165-unit 'ghost' pipeline, we must set mu_hat to cover both the expected demand over (L+1) periods and the phantom units. With L=2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand plus 165 units. If we forecast demand recovering to ~35 units/period, target mu_hat = (35 * 3) + 165 = 270. We rely on recent demand variance to set sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand recovery confirmed: P27-P28 average demand 15.5 units, up from P22-P26 average of 7 units. Phantom inventory of 165 units (P1, P3) remains the primary driver for mu_hat adjustments to ensure orders are placed while on-hand remains at zero.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, marking the end of the summer low-demand period and the beginning of the autumn retail season. Demand has rebounded from a summer trough of ~7 units (Periods 22-26) to an average of ~15 units over the last three weeks (P27-P29). Crucially, a phantom pipeline of 165 units from Period 1 (92) and Period 3 (73) remains 'in-transit' but will never arrive. To ensure the OR engine places orders despite this inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be set to neutralize this 165-unit phantom inventory plus the expected demand for the (L+1) period window. With L=2 and recent demand at ~15, the target base stock is approximately 210 units (165 phantom + 3*15). I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this offset is accurately captured. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility of the recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school recovery sustained: Average demand for late August (Periods 27-29) is 15 units, double the June/July trough of 7. Phantom inventory (165 units from P1, P3) persist and continues to require a mu_hat offset to maintain availability.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are entering the fall season, where demand for socks typically recovers from the summer trough. Recent demand in Periods 27-30 (18, 13, 14, 34) shows a clear upward trend, with an average of 20 units/period, compared to the summer average of 7 units. Period 30 specifically saw a spike to 34 units. We have 46 units on-hand and 207 units in-transit. However, the in-transit figure is heavily inflated by 165 'phantom' units from lost orders in Period 1 (92 units) and Period 3 (73 units). To ensure the OR engine logic (base_stock - pipeline) triggers an order despite this 165-unit phantom pipeline, I must continue to apply a +165 offset to the mu_hat. I will set the base forecast (before offset) to 25 units/period to account for the fall recovery and potential volatility, resulting in a mu_hat of (1+L)*25 + 165. With L=2, mu_hat = 3*25 + 165 = 240. I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to cover the increasing variance observed in the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Fall recovery confirmed: Late August/Early September demand (P27-P30) averaged 20 units/period, with a significant jump to 34 in P30, ending the summer trough of ~7 units. Phantom inventory from P1/P3 remains 165 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 243937001 (Fine-knit socks) is undergoing a significant seasonal recovery as we move into September (Back-to-School/Fall). Demand in Period 31 reached 39 units, continuing an upward trend from the summer trough (avg ~7). The average demand over the last 3 weeks (P29-P31) is 29 units, and 31 units over the last 5 weeks (P27-P31). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this rising mean, which averages approximately 25 units. A critical factor remains the 'phantom inventory' of 165 units from Periods 1 and 3 that never arrived but are still counted in the pipeline by the OR engine. To ensure the engine continues ordering despite this inflated pipeline, I must apply an explicit offset. With a lead time of 2, the target base stock must cover 3 periods of demand + the 165 phantom units. Forecasted demand for 3 periods (3 * 25) + 165 offset = 240. I will set mu_hat to 240. This allows the OR engine to maintain a positive order flow (as seen in P31 when a similar mu_hat triggered an order of 37). Forecasted sigma for 3 periods is based on the recent volatility observed during the recovery.

Carry-over insight: Fall recovery confirmed: Late Aug/Mid-Sept demand (P27-P31) shows a clear upward trend, moving from ~7 units to 39 units. Average demand for the last 5 periods is 23.6, but the most recent 2 periods average 36.5. Phantom inventory of 165 units (P1, P3) remains and requires a continuous mu_hat offset of +165 to prevent stockouts caused by inflated pipeline inventory.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23 (late September). Demand for 'Straight Edge 5p Socks' is in a strong upward trend (Fall/Back-to-School recovery). The last three demand observations are 34, 39, and 53, with a 5-period average of 30.6. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline contains 231 units total. However, 165 of these units (from P1 and P3) are long-lost 'phantom' inventory that will never arrive. The 'real' pipeline consists only of the P29 order (4 units) and the P32 order (24 units), plus any arrivals from P33 and onwards. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite the 165 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * (current_demand_mean + phantom_units/(1+L)). Using L=2, mu_hat = 3 * (45 + 55) = 300. This covers the high current demand (avg ~45 recent) while neutralizing the 165 units of fake pipeline, ensuring active replenishment during this demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand surge confirmed: Demand increased from summer low (~7) to 53 in P32; current 3-period average is 42. Phantom inventory of 165 units (P1, P3) continues to persist and requires a mu_hat offset of +165 to maintain ordering activity.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks is currently in a rapid fall recovery/autumn surge, increasing from 39/53 units to 93 units in Period 33. The average demand for the last three periods (P31-P33) is ~61.6 units, but the most recent observation (93) suggests significant acceleration. The pipeline is heavily inflated by 165 units of phantom inventory (P1 and P3 orders that never arrived), which the OR engine incorrectly counts as available. To force the OR engine to place an order despite this 165-unit 'ghost' pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My calculation for mu_hat is: (Expected demand for Lead + Review period: 3 * 90) + (Phantom recovery offset: 165) = 435. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge intensified: Period 33 demand reached 93 units, representing a 75% increase over the previous week and ending the recovery phase with a clear high-demand regime. Phantom inventory (165 units) persists and continues to require a large mu_hat offset to maintain ordering.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks is in a sharp seasonal upswing (Autumn/Winter transition). Period 34 demand reached 108 units, and the 3-period average is now ~85. We are currently stocked out (on-hand = 0). There is a significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 165 units from Periods 1 and 3 that will never arrive. To ensure the OR engine places orders despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using an 'explicit' value. My forecasted demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) is approximately 110 units per period, totaling 330 units. To this, I must add the 165 units of phantom inventory to neutralize the pipeline subtraction, resulting in a mu_hat of 495. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=3) to capture high recent volatility during this regime shift. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: Demand has crossed 100 units/period (P34: 108), a 10x increase from summer lows. Phantom inventory (165 units from P1, P3) remains the critical driver for mu_hat inflation.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks is in a massive autumn surge, reaching 113 units in Period 35, following 108 in Period 34 and 93 in Period 33. This represents a sustained high-demand regime as we move into October. On-hand inventory is zero, meaning we are currently losing significant sales. The 'In-transit' figure of 552 includes 165 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost. To ensure the OR engine actually places orders, mu_hat must be set to cover the (L+1) demand window AND neutralize that 165-unit phantom pipeline. Based on the last 3 periods (average ~105 units), the base demand for (L+1=3) periods is 315 units. Adding the 165-unit offset results in a mu_hat of 480. sigma_hat is set using the last 5 periods to capture the high volatility of the surge. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability in arrivals (recent arrivals were 1 and 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Demand stabilized >100 units/period (P34-P35 avg: 110.5). Performance is constrained by stockouts and a persistent 165-unit phantom pipeline inventory (P1, P3).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks is in a high-growth autumn peak. Recent demand (P34-P36) has stabilized at an average of 115.6 units/period (108, 113, 126). The ghost pipeline inventory from P1 and P3 (165 total units) remains in the system; to ensure the OR engine actually places orders, mu_hat must be inflated to counteract this phantom 165 units. Current On-hand is 58. Demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) is estimated at 115 * 3 = 345 units. With the 165-unit offset, mu_hat should be approximately 510. Sigma is set to reflect the higher volatility of the peak season (std dev of last 3 periods is ~9, adjusted for lead time). Observed lead times recently shifted to 3 periods for some orders, so I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure a larger safety window during this peak demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Demand stabilized at ~115 units/period (P34-P36). Persistent 165-unit phantom pipeline (P1, P3) requires continued mu_hat inflation to maintain availability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks has entered a sustained peak autumn/winter regime. Periods 33-37 show demand levels of 93, 108, 113, 126, and 130 respectively, establishing a clear mean of ~115 units/period. The pipeline remains inflated by 165 phantom units from lost orders in P1 (92) and P3 (73). To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite this 165-unit 'ghost' inventory, I am applying a mu_hat offset. Using the recent 5-period average (114 units) multiplied by (1+L) where L=2 (total 342 units base) and adding the 165-unit phantom offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 507. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 15% of the demand mean (~17 per period) scaled by sqrt(1+L), resulting in approximately 30.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed peak autumn demand regime (late Oct): avg demand ~120 units/period (P34-P37). Persistent phantom inventory of 165 units (P1, P3) remains and requires a continuous mu_hat offset to maintain stock levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand autumn peak (late Oct/early Nov) with demand stabilizing around 115-120 units/period (P34-P38). Stockouts have occurred in 4 of the last 5 periods due to high demand and timing of arrivals. Most critically, there is a persistent phantom pipeline of 165 units (92 from P1, 73 from P3) that the OR backend views as incoming stock, even though it will never arrive. To counter this, I must inflate mu_hat by +165 units to ensure the engine places orders despite this 'ghost' inventory. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for demand to capture the current peak (avg ~115) and then add the 165-unit offset via an explicit value. 115 * (1 + 2) + 165 = 510. Sigma is set based on recent volatility to ensure responsiveness.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak plateau confirmed: Avg demand P34-P38 is ~115 units. Phantom inventory of 165 units (P1, P3) remains the primary driver for mu_hat inflation.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks has peaked and is now showing signs of deceleration as we move into mid-November (Period 39 demand dropped to 71 from a peak of ~130). However, the average demand over the last 4 periods remains high (~107). Inventory management is severely complicated by 165 units of phantom pipeline inventory (orders from P1 and P3 that never arrived). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'in-transit' total from its order calculation, I must continue to inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset these 165 lost units. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; using the 'calculate' method allows the backend to adapt to this variance. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a 'recent_N' of 6 to capture the high-regime peak while remaining responsive to the current dip, plus the 165-unit offset to ensure real orders are placed despite the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' of 6 to reflect the high volatility seen during this peak autumn/winter transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed: Period 39 demand fell to 71 units after a sustained plateau of ~115 units (Periods 34-38). Phantom inventory of 165 units (P1, P3) remains the critical driver for mu_hat inflation.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the demand for Women's Fine-knit socks has entered a period of volatility following its autumn peak. Period 40 demand rebounded to 87 units from a dip of 71 in P39, but both are below the mid-October peak of ~120-130 units. The strategy must continue to account for the 'phantom pipeline' of 165 units (from P1 and P3) that will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock; to counteract this 165-unit overstatement, mu_hat must be inflated by 165. For the forecast (the non-offset part of mu_hat), I am using a 4-period average (P37-P40) which is 97.25 units. Total mu_hat = (1+L) * 97.25 + 165. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = 3 * 97.25 + 165 = 291.75 + 165 = 456.75. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of recent demand (P37-P40) which is approximately 25, then scaled: sqrt(3) * 25 \u2248 43.3. This ensures that despite the 526 units in transit (which includes the 165 phantom units and real orders from P34, P38, P39, P40), the system will place orders if the real pipeline is insufficient to meet the cooling but still substantial autumn demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed: Late October/Early November demand (P37-P40) averaged 97 units, down from the peak of 115-120 units in mid-October.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks is currently in a high-demand late-autumn/early-winter regime, though it has stabilized from its mid-October peak. Recent demand (P39-P41) is averaging 83.3 units, compared to the peak of 115+. Stockouts are frequent due to a persistent 165-unit phantom pipeline (P1: 92, P3: 73) which prevents the OR engine from ordering enough stock. To maintain availability as we approach the end of the year, I must continue to inflate mu_hat by the phantom amount (+165 units) while setting the base demand forecast based on the most recent 5 periods (approx 96 units). Total mu_hat = (96 * 3) + 165 = 453. Lead times have been volatile (1-3 periods), so I will use 'calculate' to reflect the average supply performance. This aggressive mu_hat ensures the system triggers orders despite the false 'In-transit' signal.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-peak: Late Oct/Nov demand (P39-P41) averaged 83.3 units/period, down from the peak of 115. Phantom pipeline of 165 units remains the primary constraint.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 243937001 (fine-knit socks) has surged again in Period 42 to 127 units, likely reflecting early December/holiday shopping trends after a brief dip in early November. This follows an autumn peak where demand averaged ~115. Currently, we are at zero on-hand inventory with 516 units in-transit. Crucially, 165 units of that in-transit inventory (from P1 and P3) are 'phantom' units that have never arrived and are considered lost. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the 165 units of phantom inventory that the engine believes we have. Given the recent demand jump, I am using an average of the last 3 periods (approx 102 units/period) for the forecast. For L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 102) + 165 = 471. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility (std dev ~20) over the same 3 periods: sqrt(3) * 20 \u2248 35.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand rose to 127 units, returning to peak autumn levels. Phantom inventory of 165 units (P1, P3) remains the critical driver for mu_hat inflation to ensure availability while on-hand stays at zero.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak December holiday season (Date: 2019/12/9). Demand has shown high volatility with a recent spike to 127 units (P42) followed by 65 units (P43), likely dampened by stockouts (ending on-hand 0). The most significant challenge remains the 165 units of phantom inventory from P1 and P3, which stay in the 'In-transit' bucket indefinitely. To force the OR backend to place orders despite this inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be set to (Actual Forecasted Demand over L+1) + 165. For the next 3 weeks (L+1), I anticipate holiday demand to average ~110 units based on late autumn peaks and current seasonality. Thus, mu_hat = (3 * 110) + 165 = 495. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to account for high volatility seen in the transition from late Nov to Dec. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability in actual lead times (ranging from 1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand confirmed: Period 42 spike to 127 units followed by stockout-constrained P43. Phantom inventory of 165 units (P1, P3) remains the primary driver for mu_hat inflation to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the holiday peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019, middle of the holiday peak for 'Fine-knit socks'. Recent demand is high but heavily constrained by stockouts (On-hand = 0). Demand in P42-P44 has been volatile (127, 65, 84). The critical challenge remains the 165 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory from lost orders in Periods 1 (92 units) and 3 (73 units). Total In-Transit is 619, meaning the 'active' pipeline is 454 units (619 - 165). To ensure the OR engine places orders during this high-demand period despite the inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + 165. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 100 + 165 = 465. I use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen during the autumn/winter peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1577.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 represents the week before Christmas. Historical demand in December (Periods 43-45) shows a high-demand regime averaging 81.6 units per period, despite stockout constraints. The 'In-transit' quantity of 536 units includes a persistent phantom inventory of 165 units (from P1 and P3 losses), meaning the effective pipeline is actually 371 units. To avoid stockouts during the Christmas/Boxing Day week and Year-End, I am maintaining a high mu_hat. I use an explicit mu_hat of 510, which represents (1 + L) * expected_demand_of_115 + the 165 phantom offset. This ensures the OR backend recognizes a demand signal high enough to overcome the inflated pipeline and place necessary replenishment orders for the final periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/30, marking the end of the holiday season and the end of the game. Demand has started a post-holiday taper, falling from 96 (P45) to 72 (P46). The average demand of the last 4 periods (P43-P46) is 79.25 units. We continue to manage the 165-unit 'phantom inventory' from P1 and P3, which prevents the OR engine from ordering enough if mu_hat is set too low. However, with in-transit inventory at 568 units (including the 165 phantom units and recent large orders like P34's 161 units that appear trapped in transit), we are heavily over-pipelined relative to current demand. Since this is the final period (47), we aim to minimize excess holding cost while ensuring the base stock calculation triggers any necessary replacement for actual sales. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) times the recent average (about 80) plus the 165-unit phantom offset, totaling 405. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility (approx 20) during the winter peak.
