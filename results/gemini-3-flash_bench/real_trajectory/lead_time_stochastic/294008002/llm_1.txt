  "rationale": "a) Product Analysis: The item is an H&M+ Cora tee (viscose jersey top). It is a basic but 'fancy' garment. The date is Feb 11, 2019. In the fashion retail cycle, this is late winter/early spring. Demand for short-sleeved tops usually begins to rise as spring approaches. b) Demand Analysis: Historical data from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows a stable demand ranging from 43 to 59 units, with a slight upward trend (mean ~51.2). The last observation was 59 for the week of Feb 4. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 arrive in P3. Decisions must cover demand for P1, P2, and P3 to ensure availability when the order arrives. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. We have an immediate stockout for P1 and P2 because any order placed now won't arrive until P3. e) Order Logic: I will estimate demand for P1, P2, and P3 at ~60 units per week (anticipating the spring rise). Total needed for the pipeline is ~180 units. To build a safety buffer and account for current stockouts, I'll order 180 units to cover the lead time cycles and the period of arrival.",

Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed: P1 (180 units), P2 (80 units), P3 (100 units). Total in-transit = 360. According to the lead time definition (L=2), the P1 order (180 units) placed in P1 should arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in P3's conclude message (read at P4 start). However, the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the P1 order is delayed or the actual lead time is longer than promised. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, meaning we have missed all demand so far (Lost Sales). Total pipeline (0 on-hand + 360 in-transit) covers approximately 4.8 weeks of current demand (~75/week). Given the delay in P1 and the potential for demand to grow as spring progresses, I will place a moderate order to buffer against lead time uncertainty, but I must be cautious as holding costs equal profit ($1.0), making overstocking very expensive.",

Period 1's order (180 units) is now at lead time=3 and has not arrived; Period 4's conclude message confirms Period 2's order arrived with a lead time of 2.

(c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2). P1 order (180 units) is now 3 periods overdue (should have arrived in P3) and must be treated as lost to avoid catastrophic stockouts. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0.

I will forecast a baseline demand of 75 units for the next few weeks. c) Lead Time/Pipeline: The promised L=2.

Historical data and recent trends confirm this is a seasonal SKU that has passed its peak (June/July) and is now in its end-of-life phase. Demand in November has dwindled to approximately 9-11 units per week. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1190 units is composed of 1160 units confirmed as lost or stalled (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, and P34) and a recent order of 30 units from Period 39. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the P39 order is expected to arrive in Period 41. To ensure availability for the remaining 7 periods of the game (P41-P47) at the current demand rate (~10/week), we need roughly 70-80 units. With 0 on-hand and 30 units reliably in transit, I will order an additional 50 units. While holding costs are high ($1.0), the profit is also $1.0, and we are currently missing out on all demand due to 0 stock. This order aims to capture the final trickles of demand without overstocking significantly at the very end of the cycle.",

The P40 order of 50 units is currently 3 periods old (1 period past the promised lead time of 2) but based on the recent arrival of the P39 order with a 2-period lead time, it is highly likely to arrive in Period 43. If the P40 order (50 units) arrives, total available inventory for the remaining 4 periods (P44-P47) will be 56 units.

Ordering more would likely lead to excess ending inventory and unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period), which equals the profit margin, making any excess stock highly detrimental to the total reward.
