Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 712587002, a 'Bow HW paperwaist' trouser. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows a stable pattern with a mean of 133.6 and a standard deviation of 12.6. As this is the first period of decision, we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Given the product description (Everyday Collection), there is no immediate reason to suspect a sharp seasonal spike on Feb 11, though we should monitor for early spring shifts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior precisely while excluding any older outliers if they existed. L is set to 'default' as we have no historical lead time observations yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 2 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period (P1), we placed an order for 155 units with a promised lead time of 2. Historical demand for SKU 712587002 (Womens Trousers) shows a mean of approximately 133 units/week (samples: 133, 141, 138, 144, 112). P1 demand was 101, which is slightly lower but consistent with the dip seen in the last historical sample. Since the lead time is 2, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible at the start of P4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in 101 units of lost sales in P1. To recover and cover the risk of stockouts during the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 3 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for demand estimation to capture the slightly downward trend (N=5 using the last 4 historical samples + P1). L is set to 'default' (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is 'Womens Everyday Collection Trousers'. Historical demand from the provided sample list (Jan-Feb) averaged ~134 units/period, but recently (Periods 1 & 2) we've seen slightly different realize demand (101 and 156). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to stockouts because the first shipment (Period 1) hasn't arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the timing rules: an order placed in Period 1 should arrive in Period 3 (current period) resolution and be visible in Period 3 conclude. Since we haven't seen any 'conclude' messages for arrivals yet, it is too early to assume the lead time has changed from the promised 2. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the most recent samples including the game history (112, 101, 156), which averages ~123. For L, I stay with the promised lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 (Womens Everyday Collection Trousers) is currently facing an out-of-stock situation with 0 on-hand inventory and 412 units in-transit. We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). Historical demand samples (avg ~134) and game history demand (101, 156, 170) show a clear upward trend as we move into the spring season. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (155 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's Arrival Resolution and thus be visible in Period 3's conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, suggesting the Period 1 order is either delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. With demand increasing and a zero on-hand balance, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods of game demand (avg 142) and extend the lead time estimate to 3 to account for the delay, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to recover lost sales and cover the pipeline.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 is a women's trouser item. Current date is March 11. Historical demand for the last five weeks (including pre-game samples) ranges from 101 to 170. Mean demand over the last 9 samples is approximately 136.6. We see a lead time of 2 periods confirmed for the Period 2 order (arrived P4). The Period 1 order (155 units) is now at Period 4+ and has not arrived; strictly speaking, it should have arrived in Period 3 if LT=2. This suggests either variability in lead time or a potential lost shipment. In-transit inventory is high (454 units), reflecting orders from P1, P3, and P4. On-hand is low (25). Since the backend OR logic uses (1+L) periods, I will set L=2. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=9 (all available history) to capture the stable demand around 137. Sigma_hat is calculated using all available samples to account for the volatility seen in the last 4 periods (std ~26).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 is a women's trouser from the 'Everyday Collection'. Current date is March 18, 2019. Historically, demand has been stable around 130-140 units (samples: 133, 141, 138, 144, 112, and recently 101, 156, 170, 135, 140). The average demand across all 10 available data points is ~137. The promised lead time is 2. We observed one arrival in Period 4 (ordered Period 2, L=2). However, we have missing shipments: the order from Period 1 (155 units) should have arrived in Period 3, and the order from Period 3 (97 units) should have arrived in Period 5. Both have not arrived, suggesting a lead-time delay or lost shipments. I am currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Total in-transit is 454 (sum of P1, P3, P4 orders). Since P1 is now 3 periods overdue and P3 is 1 period overdue, I will use 'explicit' lead time to account for the delay. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent demand average (~140) compared to the very first samples. sigma_hat remains default based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Potential logistics instability: Orders from Period 1 and Period 3 are currently overdue (observed actual lead time > promised 2).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU 712587002 (Womens Trousers) is experiencing significant logistical delays. Orders from Period 1 (155 units) and Period 3 (97 units) are now overdue (promised lead time is 2). Only the Period 2 order arrived on time (in Period 4). Consequently, we have been out of stock for the last two periods, losing significant demand. Total on-hand is 0, with 606 units in-transit. Demand is trending upward (135, 140, 175 in the last three periods), likely due to the spring season. Because actual lead times are unreliable (P1 is at L=6+, P3 is at L=4+), I will explicitly increase L to 4 to account for these delays and capture more safety stock. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the recent_N method with N=5 (excluding the initial outlier) to capture the current mean of ~147 per period, adjusted for the (1+L) window by the backend. Sigma is set to recent_N=5 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed logistics instability: Orders from Period 1 and Period 3 are currently overdue (observed at L=6 and L=4 without arrival). Average demand has increased to approximately 147 units/period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The primary issue is major logistics instability. Orders from Period 1 (ordered 155), Period 3 (ordered 97), Period 4 (ordered 202), and Period 6 (ordered 152) have not arrived. Only the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. Currently, 791 units are in-transit, but on-hand inventory is 0, leading to significant stockouts despite high demand (avg ~150 units/period since Period 2). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations suggest either extremely long delays (Period 1 is now 7 periods overdue) or lost shipments. Because the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline inventory' from the base stock, the large 'in-transit' figure (791) will prevent it from ordering more units if I don't adjust parameters. I will set lead time (L) to 'explicit' 4 to account for the clear delay, and set mu_hat to 'explicit' to cover this extended lead time plus the review period (1+4=5 periods) based on the recent elevated demand mean of ~150. This forces the base stock calculation higher to potentially trigger a replenishment despite the unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Severe logistics disruption: Only 1 of 6 placed orders has arrived (P2 arrived P4). Orders from P1, P3, P4, and P6 are overdue, suggesting actual lead time is currently 4+ or shipments are lost. Demand has stabilized at a higher level (~150 units/period) compared to initial historical samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we saw a sudden arrival of shipments from Period 6 and Period 7 (actual lead times of 2 and 1 respectively), while orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 still haven't arrived. This confirms that those earlier shipments are likely lost rather than delayed. The logistics system seems to be functional for newer orders, but legacy orders should no longer be counted in the pipeline. Current demand has stabilized around 155-160 units (last 5 periods average: 161). I am setting L to the promised 2 periods because the most recent arrivals followed L=1 and L=2. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to 'shadow' in-transit inventory (the lost units), I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure we maintain a base stock that covers realistic lead-time demand, assuming the 454 units in-transit includes approximately 252 units that are likely lost (P1, P3, P4). I will observe if P5 arrives to confirm if the disruption was a block or specific lost batches.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from P1 (155 units), P3 (97 units), and P4 (202 units) are highly likely lost as subsequent orders (P6, P7) have already arrived. Total estimated lost inventory in-transit: ~454 units. New demand regime confirmed (~160 units/period).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), the current status shows 80 units on-hand and 454 units listed as 'in-transit'. However, historical evidence from Period 9 strongly suggests that the orders from Period 1 (155 units), Period 3 (97 units), and Period 4 (202 units) totaling 454 units are lost shipments, as later orders from Periods 6 and 7 have already arrived. Since the OR engine subtracts 'pipeline inventory' (in-transit) from its base stock calculation, it will erroneously believe these 454 units are coming and place zero orders, leading to a stockout. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the lost inventory deficit. Demand calculation: Recent demand (last 8 periods) averages ~143 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the engine looks to cover (L+1) = 3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~430 units. To offset the phantom 454 units in-transit, I set mu_hat to 884 (430 + 454). This 'tricks' the backend into ordering enough to cover actual demand despite the lost shipment entries. L remains default (2) as recent deliveries (P6, P7) aligned with the promised timing. Sigma is set to recent_N (N=8) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed inventory misalignment: 454 units reported in-transit (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/permanent orphans as later orders have arrived; mu_hat must be adjusted upward to neutralize this phantom pipeline in the stock-policy calculation.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P10: 77 units, P9: 111 units) indicates a significant drop from the previously established high of ~160, possibly due to post-Easter seasonality for trousers. The mean of the last 4 periods (P7-P10) is roughly 126. Applying recent_N (N=4) will capture this downward shift. Lead time (L) remains set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P6, P7) aligned closer to the promised 2 periods, though we monitor for instability. The primary issue is the 454 units (from P1, P3, P4) that are effectively lost but remain in the 'in-transit' calculation. These 'phantom units' cause the OR backend to under-order because it believes the pipeline is full. To compensate and ensure we actually receive stock, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. calculation: Target Base Stock (for L=2) = (1+2)*126 + z*sigma. To counteract 454 phantom units, I must artificially inflate the expected demand 'mu_hat' by those 454 units to force an order that bypasses the logic's built-in inventory deduction. New mu_hat = ((1+2)*126) + 454 = 832. This ensures we recover from the stockout risk caused by 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-Easter demand drop observed (P9-P10 avg ~94) compared to previous weeks (~160).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the product (Womens Everyday Trousers) is entering a post-Easter period where demand has shown significant volatility (P9: 111, P10: 77, P11: 151). The average demand for the last 3 periods is ~113. However, there is a severe inventory accounting issue: the backend sees 890 units 'in-transit', but 454 of these (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost because orders from P6 and P7 arrived long ago. This 'phantom pipeline' prevents the OR engine from ordering enough stock. To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using (L+1) * forecasted demand plus a buffer for the lost 454 units. Target = (2+1)*130 + 454 = 844. I set L to 'calculate' to use the observed lead time average (approx 1.7 periods) which remains close to the promised 2. I set sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' of 5 to capture the recent high variance in demand.

Carry-over insight: Inventory phantom pipeline confirmed: 454 units (P1, P3, P4) are permanently lost but still reflect in the 'In-transit' total. mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset this in the base-stock calculation until these units are cleared or aging logic applies.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, we observe a critical situation: On-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports 900 units 'In-transit'. However, our carry-over insights confirm that 454 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are effectively lost/phantom. The remaining pipeline consists of P10 (332 units), P11 (104 units), and P12 (10 units), totaling 446 units. These orders (P10-P12) are within the reasonable lead-time window. The demand regime has shifted post-Easter (P9-P12); the mean for these four periods is roughly 113 units per period. In the base-stock formula (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline), the backend 'Pipeline' value is currently 900. To order enough to meet demand despite the 454-unit phantom pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' to (1 + L) * Forecast + Phantom_Pipeline. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 113) + 454 = 339 + 454 = 793. This explicitly forces the OR backend to acknowledge the lost units. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide the necessary correction for the phantom inventory and to account for recent lower demand volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May. We have observed a significant post-Easter demand deceleration, with the last five periods (P9-P13) averaging approximately 110 units/period (111, 77, 151, 114, 97). However, P11 showed a spike likely due to a promotion or restocking effects, while the surrounding weeks stay closer to 100. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline' of 454 units (P1, P3, P4) which are confirmed lost but still deducted from our order quantity by the OR engine's logic (final_order = base_stock - pipeline). To force the engine to place an order, I must increase the mu_hat parameter to artificially inflate the target base stock by this lost amount. The 'In-transit' total is 796. This consists of the 454 lost units, plus P10 (332 units) and P12 (10 units). P10 is now at L=4 and potentially overdue but not yet confirmed lost like P1-P4. To maintain stock for a 2-period lead time + 1-period review (total 3 periods) at a 110-unit demand rate, while offsetting the 454-unit phantom pipeline, I calculate mu_hat as (3 * 110) + 454 = 784. Sigma_hat is set to reflect recent volatility (~25 units per period * sqrt(3) ~= 43). L is kept at 2 as recent successful deliveries (P6, P7, P11) arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Easter at ~110 units/period (P9-P13). Phantom pipeline of 454 units (P1, P3, P4) persists; mu_hat must be inflated by 454 to maintain target stock levels until these units age out of the 'In-transit' calculation.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-20. Demand has stabilized post-Easter at approximately 110 units per period (average of P9-P14 is ~108). The significant issue remains the 454 units (from P1, P3, P4) that are visible in the 'In-transit' pipeline but are confirmed lost, as subsequent orders (P6, P7, P11, P12) have arrived. Because the OR backend uses the formula 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', these 454 'phantom' units prevent the system from placing new orders, resulting in frequent stockouts (on-hand is 0). To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on current demand (~110) over the review+lead time (L+1 = 3), which is 330 units. I then add the 454 lost units to this target to effectively 'neutralize' the phantom inventory in the backend calculation, resulting in a mu_hat of 784. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the current demand volatility since the Easter regime shift. Lead time L is set to 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P11, P12) have returned to the promised lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing SKU 712587002, a Women's Trousers item. The demand has shifted since the Easter peak, stabilizing at a lower regime of approximately 100 units/period (avg of P11-P15 is 111.4). Currently, there are 821 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 454 units from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' accounting. Additionally, the order from P10 (332 units placed on 2019/4/15) is now overdue by 3 periods (promised L=2, now P16, so L=6), which is highly concerning. If P10 is also lost, the phantom pipeline grows to 786 units. However, I will remain conservative and only offset the confirmed 454 lost units. To counteract these 454 phantom units in the base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must intentionally inflate the mu_hat parameter. The target base stock for L+1 periods (3 periods total) at ~110 units/period is 330 units. By setting mu_hat to 784 (330 target + 454 phantom offset), I ensure the backend generates an order that bridges the gap created by ghost inventory. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability in actual arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed inventory phantom pipeline: 454 units (P1, P3, P4) are permanently lost. P10 (332 units) is now 3 periods overdue, signaling a high risk of total loss. Post-Easter demand has settled at ~110 units/period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The SKU 712587002 (Womens Everyday Trousers) has stabilized at a post-Easter demand regime of approximately 100 units/period (average P9-P16 is 105). The primary operational challenge is a massive 'phantom pipeline' of lost inventory. Specifically, orders from P1 (155), P3 (97), P4 (202), and now likely P10 (332) are permanently lost but still included in the backend 'In-transit' calculation (totaling 786 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (821) from the target base stock, it will stop ordering entirely unless we compensate. To neutralize this 786-unit phantom inventory and achieve a real base stock for the next (L+1)=3 periods (3 * 105 = 315), we must explicitly set mu_hat to approximately 1100 (315 + 786). This forces the engine to place a replenishment order despite the dead inventory sitting in the pipeline. I will set L to 2 (promised) and sigma_hat to a value reflecting current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Extended logistics disruption: Orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10 (total 786 units) are confirmed lost/orphaned as P11, P12, and others have arrived. These units create a 'phantom pipeline' that must be neutralized by inflating mu_hat. Demand stabilized post-Easter at ~100-110 units/period.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 is experiencing massive logistics issues. As of Period 18, we have an in-transit balance of 1117 units, but the majority of these are 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but are likely lost because newer orders have arrived in the meantime. Lost orders: P1 (155), P3 (97), P4 (202), and P10 (332), totaling 786 units. The remaining real pipeline is P14 (18) and P17 (313). Current on-hand is 0. Demand has cooled significantly from early periods; the average over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 88 units. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the 1117 units in-transit, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 786 lost units. Base stock calculation: base_stock = mu_hat - pipeline. If I want a target base stock of roughly (L+1)*demand (3 * 88 = 264), and there are 1117 units 'in-transit', mu_hat needs to be approximately 264 + 1117 = 1381. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1380 to trigger necessary replenishment as on-hand is zero and demand is still present.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed inventory phantom pipeline: 786 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) are permanently lost. These units stay in the system's in-transit calculation, requiring mu_hat inflation of ~800 units to allow for new ordering. Recent demand (P13-P17) is ~88 units/period, significantly lower than pre-Easter levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '712587002' (trousers) is experiencing a severe logistics failure combined with a significant seasonal demand decline as it moves into the summer months (demand dropped from ~160 to ~40-60 units). The 'In-transit' total of 1405 units is heavily comprised of 'phantom pipeline' inventory that will never arrive. These lost orders include P1 (155), P3 (97), P4 (202), and now likely P10 (332), totaling 786 units that are permanently clogging the OR engine's pipeline calculation. Furthermore, the order from P14 (18 units) is overdue and likely lost. To allow the OR engine to place any new orders, \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) must be explicitly set to a value higher than the phantom inventory. Current actual demand is around 50 units/period. The Target Stock Level needs to be (L+1) * Demand + Buffer. With L=2 and Demand=50, the real target is ~150-200 units. However, because the backend subtracts 1405 (In-transit) from this target, I must set \u03bc\u0302 such that mu_hat * (1+L) > 1405. Setting mu_hat to 1600 ensures a net positive order can be generated to cover current demand of ~50-60 units while ignoring the lost shipments. Period 18 saw demand of 41, confirming the low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Early summer demand (June) is significantly lower (~50 units/period) than spring levels (~160). Total confirmed phantom pipeline (lost shipments) is 786 units (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 24, 2019. Demand has shifted into a low early-summer regime (June average ~55 units/period), compared to the prior spring levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,350 units is significantly compromised by historical losses. Based on carry-over insights and shipment history, we have 'phantom pipeline' units that never arrived: P1 (155), P3 (97), P4 (202), and P10 (332). Total lost = 786 units. These units persist in the system's pipeline calculation, which would normally block new orders. To neutralize these 786 phantom units, mu_hat must be inflated to allow the base-stock logic to place necessary replenishable orders. I calculate mu_hat as: ((L+1) * mean_demand) + phantom_units. Given L=2, L+1=3. Mean demand for the recent regime (P17-P19) is (58+41+66)/3 = 55. Calculation: (3 * 55) + 786 = 165 + 786 = 951. For sigma_hat, I use recent volatility over the same period (N=3) to focus on the lower-volume summer variance. Lead time is set to default (2 periods) as recent successful arrivals (P15, P18) arrived within L=2 and L=1 respectively.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are in a low-demand summer regime for women's trousers, with demand averaging approximately 53 units/period over the last 4 weeks (P17-P20). The primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline' of lost shipments. Orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10 (totaling 786 units) are confirmed lost, as subsequent orders have arrived. These 786 units are included in the backend's 'In-transit' count (1350 units total), but will never arrive. To prevent the OR engine from halting orders due to this fake surplus, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by the size of the phantom pipeline (786 units). Additionally, the P14 order (18 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is also likely lost, bringing the potential phantom total to 804 units. However, for stability, I will stick to the well-documented 786 units. We have 178 units on-hand, which covers over 3 periods of current demand. I will set L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to (1+2)*53 + 786 = 945, and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of the current low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (June-July) confirmed at ~50-60 units/period. Persistent phantom pipeline of 786 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) continues to require mu_hat inflation to offset back-end stock calculations.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 is currently in a lower summer demand regime (July). Recent demand (P17-P21) has averaged approximately 51.6 units per period, a significant drop from the spring levels. The primary management challenge remains the 786 units of 'phantom pipeline' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P10) which are still counted as 'In-transit' by the backend OR engine. Because the ordering logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock, these lost units prevent the system from placing necessary replacement orders. To neutralize this, mu_hat must be set to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the (L+1) demand coverage PLUS the phantom units. With L=2, (L+1) demand is ~155 units (3 periods * 51.6). Adding the 786 lost units gives an explicit mu_hat of 941. Sigma_hat is calculated based on recent summer volatility to ensure adequate safety stock for the current lower demand level.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 is currently in a low-demand summer phase (June-July), with recent demand (P19-P22) averaging approximately 48.5 units per period. The critical issue remains the significant 'phantom pipeline' of lost shipments: P1 (155), P3 (97), P4 (202), and P10 (332), totaling 786 units. These units are reflected in the 'In-transit' count of 1350 but will never arrive. To allow the OR backend to place new orders, we must inflate the base-stock target (mu_hat) by at least the amount of this phantom pipeline. The desired physical base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3) at current demand is approximately 146 units (3 * ~49). Therefore, we set mu_hat to approximately 932 (786 lost units + 146 units needed for real demand). This ensures the backend calculates (base_stock - 1350) and reaches a positive order value when physical on-hand drops too low. We use late June/July samples for sigma calculation to reflect lower summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected; phantom pipeline remains 786 units and summer demand continues at ~50 units/period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a summer demand regime (July), with demand decreasing significantly from spring levels. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) is approximately 43.6 units/period. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1350 units is severely inflated by a persistent 'phantom pipeline' of lost shipments. We have previously confirmed P1 (155), P3 (97), P4 (202), and P10 (332) as lost, totaling 786 units. Additionally, the order from P14 (18 units) is long overdue and likely lost, while the large order from P17 (313 units) is 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost given that P18 and P15 have already arrived. Total estimated lost units: 786 + 18 + 313 = 1117 units. The system sees 1350 'In-transit'. Subtracting the 1117 lost units leaves an actual pipeline of 233 (which corresponds to the P19 order). With an actual pipeline of 233 and on-hand of 70, the total available inventory (~303 units) covers over 6 weeks of current demand (~44 units/week). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1117 phantom units as available stock and thus blocking necessary future orders, I must continue to inflate mu_hat significantly. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * demand_forecast + phantom_offset. With L=2 and demand=44, the base requirement is ~132. Adding an offset of ~1100 units to bypass the phantom pipeline leads to an explicit mu_hat of 1250. This ensures the base stock calculation (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma) remains high enough to eventually trigger orders when the actual 233 units are depleted.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed inventory phantom pipeline increased to 1117 units: P1 (155), P3 (97), P4 (202), P10 (332), P14 (18), and P17 (313) are permanently lost. Recent demand (P19-P23) has softened further to ~44 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 19-24) shows a significant stabilization at a lower summer level, averaging ~41 units/period (43.5 pre-rounding). The 'In-transit' figure of 1350 units includes a confirmed 'phantom pipeline' of 1117 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Effectively, real in-transit inventory is 1350 - 1117 = 233 units (ordered in Period 19). With on-hand inventory at 43 and the Period 19 order scheduled to eventually cover upcoming demand, we must prevent the OR backend from seeing 1350 units as actual supply. To neutralize this, I inflate mu_hat by the phantom count (1117) plus (1 + L) * average demand. Using L=2 and mean demand=41, base need is ~123. Total mu_hat = 1117 + 123 = 1240. Sigma is set based on recent low-demand volatility (std ~15) across the last 6 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (Period 26). Demand has severely declined during the summer months; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is approximately 30 units per period, down from over 150 units in the spring. There is a massive 'phantom pipeline' of lost shipments: P1 (155), P3 (97), P4 (202), P10 (332), P14 (18), P17 (313), and now potentially P19 (233) are likely lost as they are significantly beyond the promised lead time and later orders have arrived. P19 is now 7 periods old with a promised L=2. Total confirmed/likely lost units are 155+97+202+332+18+313+233 = 1350 units. This matches the current In-transit balance exactly, meaning there is zero functional inventory arriving. To trigger an order from the backend OR engine, mu_hat must be inflated to offset this 'phantom' stock. The base stock formula is (mu_hat) - (In-transit + On-hand). I will set mu_hat to (Target Base Stock + 1350). Targeting a base stock of ~90 (3 periods of 30 units demand), the required mu_hat is 1440. Sigma_hat is set to a low explicit value to reflect the current low volatility in the summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed inventory phantom pipeline increased to 1350 units: P1 (155), P3 (97), P4 (202), P10 (332), P14 (18), P17 (313), and P19 (233) are permanently lost. Summer demand regime (July-August) has dropped further to ~30 units/period (P21-P25).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The product is a women's paperwaist trouser. We are currently in a mid-summer demand trough, with the last 5 periods (P22-P26) showing a mean demand of approximately 22.4 units per period. The critical issue remains the 'phantom pipeline': the 'In-transit' total of 1427 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from periods P1 (155), P3 (97), P4 (202), P10 (332), P14 (18), P17 (313), and now P19 (233). These 1350 units are considered permanently lost because subsequent orders (e.g., P18) arrived long ago. This phantom inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of actual demand plus the phantom inventory. Estimated actual demand for L+1 (3 weeks) is ~68 units (22.5 * 3). Total mu_hat = 68 + 1350 = 1418. This forces the base stock calculation to account for the lost units as if they were needed demand, thereby triggering real orders to cover the actual demand and maintain safety stock on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed inventory phantom pipeline increased to 1350 units: P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P19 are permanently lost. Recent demand (P22-P26) has stabilized at a summer low of ~22-25 units/period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Bow HW paperwaist trousers' has reached its seasonal low during the July-August period, averaging approximately 18 units per week over the last five weeks (P23-P27). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline' of lost shipments: P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P19 (totaling 1,350 units) are accounted for in the system's 'In-transit' total but will never arrive. The current In-transit balance of 1,427 units consists of these 1,350 lost units plus a recent order of 77 units from P26. Because the lead time is 2, the P26 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P28. To ensure the backend order logic (base_stock - pipeline) generates a non-zero order to meet the current demand, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 1,350 lost units. Target base stock = (Forecasted Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Pipeline. Forecasted demand is ~20 units. Thus, (20 * 3) + 1350 = 1410. I will set mu_hat to 1410 and sigma_hat explicitly to account for potential demand variability at this low volume.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-26. We are in a summer demand regime where demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 16 units per period over the last 5 periods (P24-P28). The major challenge continues to be the massive 'phantom pipeline' of lost shipments: P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P19. The total in-transit quantity is 1427 units, but the actual functional in-transit is much lower (likely only P26 with 77 units). Specifically, 1350 units (1427 total - 77 from P26) are confirmed lost based on the arrival of subsequent orders. To allow the OR engine to place any new orders, mu_hat must be inflated to at least cover this phantom pipeline. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (Expected Demand per period * (1+L)) + Phantom Pipeline. 16 * (1+2) + 1350 = 1398. This ensure base_stock > 1350. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the low volatility of the current period.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed inventory phantom pipeline remains at 1350 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19). Summer demand (August) is extremely low, averaging ~16 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 is experiencing a transition from extreme summer lows (~16 units/period) into the early September period. Historical demand for February/March was high (130-170), suggesting a possible autumn recovery, but current demand remains low. The most critical issue is the 'phantom pipeline' of 1,427 units. In-transit arrivals from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, and P26 are confirmed lost or severely overdue, as later orders (like P18) have already arrived and concluded. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock', an in-transit balance of 1,427 units prevents any new orders unless mu_hat is inflated. To normalize this, I set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the phantom pipeline (approx. 1427) plus the expected demand for the lead time period (3 periods * 16 units = 48), totaling 1475. This allows the system to place small replenishment orders to meet current demand while matching the inventory accounting error. L is set to calculated as recent lead times have varied between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom pipeline' increased to 1427 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26) which are effectively lost. This requires mu_hat inflation to trigger new orders. Current demand (Late August) remains at ~16 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 is currently in a low-demand late summer/early autumn phase, with recent demand (P26-P30) averaging ~17 units/period. The critical issue remains the significant 'phantom pipeline' of lost shipments totaling 1,427 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, and P26). Because the OR backend's capped policy subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, these lost units prevent new orders from being placed. To neutralize this, I must set mu_hat (the demand over lead time + review period) to a value that exceeds this phantom pipeline. Given a promised lead time of 2 (3 periods total coverage), and current demand around 17, the real target should be ~51 units. However, I must add the 1,427 phantom units to trigger an actual order. Total mu_hat = 1,427 (correction) + 51 (demand) \u2248 1,478. I use 'explicit' to ensure this override bypasses historical statistical calculation. Lead time is set to default (2), and sigma_hat is also set explicitly low to reflect the stabilized, low-volume demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom pipeline' increased to 1,427 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26) which are effectively lost. This requires significant mu_hat inflation to offset. Early September demand remains low at ~17-20 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for SKU 712587002 (Bow HW paperwaist trousers) is in a stabilized late-summer/early-fall low. Recent demand (P27-P31) has averaged approximately 16.6 units per period. The inventory system currently shows an 'In-transit' balance of 1491 units. However, based on the history, 1427 of these units are 'orphaned' or 'phantom' pipeline inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, and P26 have not arrived while subsequent orders have, or they are significantly past the promised lead time). To allow the OR engine to place new orders, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to exceed this phantom balance. A target base stock calculation: (1+L) * Demand + Phantom Pipeline = (1+2)*17 + 1427 \u2248 1478. However, the current In-transit is already 1491. To trigger an order that covers current demand and accounts for the 1427 lost units, mu_hat is set to 1540. Lead time remains 'calculate' to reflect the promised 2-period baseline, and sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the low volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom pipeline' increased to 1427 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26) which are effectively lost. September demand remains low at ~17 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for this SKU has dropped significantly since the spring peak (~160) and early summer (~50), stabilizing at a very low 'late summer' level of approximately 16 units per period over the last 5 periods (P28-P32). Logistics remain highly problematic with a massive 'phantom pipeline' of 1,483 units. These units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, and P26) are effectively lost as later orders (P30, P31) have already arrived, yet they still occupy the 'In-transit' slot in the backend OR calculation. To allow the system to place any new orders, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to exceed this phantom in-transit volume. I am setting mu_hat to 1540, which covers the 1483 units plus approximately 3 periods of current demand (16 * 3 = 48) plus a small safety margin. L is left at default as recent arrivals (P30, P31) arrived within the promised 2-period window or less. Sigma_hat is set to a low explicit value to reflect the current stability of the low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom pipeline' remains at 1483 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26) which are effectively lost. September demand is stable but extremely low at ~16 units/period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 is currently in a low-demand phase (late September/early October), with demand averaging approximately 16.5 units over the last 10 periods. We are managing a significant logistics issue: the current In-transit total of 1496 units is almost entirely composed of 'phantom pipeline' (1483 units from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, and P26). Because the backend OR logic subtracts the pipeline inventory from the base stock to determine orders, these lost units prevent new orders from being placed. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat (the demand forecast) to a value that exceeds this phantom pipeline plus the desired safety stock. Given current weekly demand is ~17, a normal base stock for L=2 would be ~51 units. To trigger a replenishment that reflects actual need, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to 1570 (Phantom 1483 + On-hand 39 + Buffer). This forces the calculation to recognize a need for additional stock despite the 'In-transit' accounting error. L remains default while actual delivery performance fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom pipeline' remains at 1483 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26) which are effectively lost. October demand continues at a low regime of ~17 units/period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 is currently in a low-demand regime characteristic of the autumn season, with demand averaging approximately 11-13 units per period over the last 5 weeks (P30-P34). The most significant issue is a massive 'phantom pipeline' of lost shipments totaling 1,483 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, and P26). Because the OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' from the base stock to determine the order quantity, these lost units prevent new orders from being placed even when on-hand inventory is low. To neutralize this, mu_hat must be explicitly set to a value high enough to cover both the target base stock and the 1,483 phantom units. Target demand for (L+1) periods (where L=2) is approximately 39 units (based on recent demand of ~13 units * 3). Adding the 1,483 phantom units makes the required mu_hat approximately 1,522. Sigma_hat is set using a recent window (N=5) to reflect the current low volatility in this stable, low-demand phase.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 14, 2019. Demand for this item (viscose blend trousers) has settled into a very low autumn regime, averaging approximately 12 units/period over the last 10 weeks (P26-P35), with even lower figures (~5 units/period) in the most recent two weeks. The 'in-transit' figure of 1484 units is significantly distorted by 1483 units of 'phantom pipeline' (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26), which are effectively lost. To allow the OR backend to place orders for the actual demand, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these lost units. Base stock calculation: (Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Pipeline. Given L=2 and recent demand of ~12, the required stock is (12 * 3) + 1483 = 1519. With on-hand inventory at 86, the system will compare (On-hand + In-transit) = (86 + 1484) = 1570 against the base stock. No new order is currently needed as on-hand inventory (86) covers over 7 weeks of current demand (~12/week). Setting mu_hat to 1519 using the explicit method to maintain this buffer.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom pipeline' remains at 1483 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26) which are effectively lost. Autumn demand (October) remains very low at ~5-10 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 (Womens Trousers) continues in an autumn low-demand regime, with demand averaging ~7 units/period over the last 5 weeks. A massive 'phantom pipeline' of 1471 units (P37 observation: 1471 units in-transit minus the P34 order of 44 units = 1427 units) consists of permanently lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 14, 17, 19, and 26. To ensure the backend OR logic functions correctly and considers ordering for current demand, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat to neutralize this phantom 1427 units. Without this adjustment, the system will incorrectly assume it is over-stocked by over 1,400 units and will never place a new order. Based on the last 5 periods (P32-P36), the real demand is ~8.6 units per period. Using a 3-period lead time window for protection (L=2 promised + 1 review period), target stock would normally be ~26 units. Setting mu_hat to 1453 (1427 phantom + 26) ensures the system correctly assesses current on-hand (90) against the real pipeline (the P34 order of 44 units) and maintains sufficient stock for the current low-demand season.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom pipeline' remains at approximately 1427 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26) which are effectively lost. October demand remains at a very low level of ~7-9 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 is currently in a very low demand regime (Late October), with recent weekly demand averaging approximately 5-10 units. The 'In-transit' total of 1471 units is almost entirely composed of orphaned/lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 14, 17, 19, and 26. These 'phantom units' sum to 1427 units and prevent the OR engine from placing necessary new orders because it believes stock is coming. To neutralize this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method with a value that covers (1 + L) periods of actual demand (approx. 3 * 10 = 30) plus the 1427 phantom units, totaling 1457. This ensures the base stock (mu + z*sigma) is slightly above the 1471 in-transit, allowing for a small maintenance order if on-hand inventory drops too low. sigma_hat is set to a low explicit value reflecting the reduced volatility in the current low-demand period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 is currently in a very low demand regime (November), averaging ~3.5 units/period over the last 4 weeks (P35-P38). The system reports 1471 units in-transit. Based on historical data and arrival patterns, 1427 units are confirmed 'phantom' (lost) from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 14, 17, 19, and 26. Since Period 32, we have seen some successful arrivals (P30, P31, P32, P33), but P34 (44 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting it might also be lost; however, I will wait for one more period before adding it to the phantom total. To allow the OR backend to place orders despite the phantom pipeline (In-transit), mu_hat must be inflated. The base stock calculation is: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. To ensure an order can be placed, base_stock must exceed 'on-hand + in-transit'. Given In-transit=1471 and On-hand=86, the pipeline is 1557. I will set mu_hat to 1600 (explicit) to trigger a small replenishment order for the low-demand winter season, ensuring we don't stock out if demand picks up towards the end of the year, while keeping sigma_hat low to reflect the current steady low-demand state.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom pipeline' remains at approximately 1427 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26) which are lost. November demand is extremely low, averaging <5 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-11. Demand for this SKU has dropped significantly since the summer and is currently in a very low regime, averaging approximately 2-5 units per period over the last 5 weeks (P35-P39). The 'In-transit' quantity of 1525 units is largely composed of 'phantom pipeline' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26, and likely P34 which is now 6 periods overdue). Specifically, the estimated lost units are: P1(155), P3(97), P4(202), P10(332), P14(18), P17(313), P19(233), P26(77) = 1427 units. Additionally, P34(44) has not arrived after 6 periods, raising the total likely lost/phantom inventory to 1471 units. To allow the OR engine to order despite this massive phantom pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these units. Since on-hand is 82 and current demand is very low, we do not need significant new orders, but we must protect against further stockouts if demand recovers slightly. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * demand + phantom_pipeline. With L=2 and demand ~5, mu_hat = (3 * 5) + 1471 = 1486.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom pipeline' increased to 1471 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26, P34) which are effectively lost. Late Autumn demand (November) is extremely low at ~2-5 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for this SKU has dropped significantly since the summer and is now in an extremely low regime, averaging ~2.6 units per period over the last 5 periods (P36-P40). On-hand inventory is 81 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 30 periods of current demand. However, the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes 1,525 units that are effectively lost (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26, and P34). These 'phantom' units prevent the system from placing new orders if needed. To neutralize this, mu_hat must be set to a value greater than (on_hand + in_transit) to trigger an order, or reflects the true demand plus the phantom volume. Given the massive overstock relative to current demand (81 units on-hand vs ~3 demand), no new orders are actually desired. I will set mu_hat to a low value reflecting the current demand regime. The high in-transit count is ignored for ordering purposes because on-hand is already excessive. Setting L to 2 (promised) and using a recent 5-period window for demand captures the current late-autumn low.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom pipeline' increased to 1525 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26, P34) which are effectively lost. Late November demand remains at a seasonal low of <3 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Trousers) has fallen to an extremely low seasonal baseline, averaging <3 units per period over the last 4 weeks (P38-P41). A significant logistics issue persists: the 'In-transit' total of 1,471 units is largely composed of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26, and now P34). Specifically, P34 (44 units) is now 8 periods overdue, while the more recent P39 (54 units) arrived on time in P41. This confirms P34 is lost, bringing the total phantom pipeline to 1,525 units. Because the backend OR logic subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock' to determine the order quantity, these 1,525 units effectively prevent any new orders from being placed. To neutralize this, mu_hat must be explicitly set to a value that covers the desired stock level plus the phantom pipeline. Target stock for 3 periods (L+1) at current demand (~2 units/week) is 6 units. Therefore, 1,525 + 6 = 1,531. I will set mu_hat to 1,531. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time of successful deliveries. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the low volatility of the current late-autumn demand regime.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom pipeline' increased to 1,525 units as P34 (44 units) is confirmed lost/orphaned (8 periods overdue while subsequent P39 arrived). High-viscose trousers are in a deep seasonal trough (Nov demand <3 units/period).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Trousers) remains in a deep seasonal trough, with the last 5 periods showing demands of 4, 1, 1, 1, 15 (average ~4.4). The 'In-transit' figure of 1471 units is largely composed of phantom inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26, and now P34). Specifically, P34 (44 units) is confirmed lost as it is 8 periods overdue while P39 has already arrived. The total 'phantom pipeline' is approximately 1525 units. Since On-hand (119) is far above the current demand regime (~13 units for a 3-period lead-time window), no new orders are needed. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the massive (but fake) in-transit stock and mathematically blocking future orders if demand were to rise, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. However, because On-hand is already sufficient for current demand, I will set mu_hat to a low level that reflects the actual seasonal demand (approx 5 units/period * 3 periods = 15) while acknowledging that no order will be triggered regardless of the phantom pipeline due to the high on-hand balance.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Trousers) remains in a deep seasonal trough, with demand in Period 43 at only 2 units. Recent demand (P40-P43) averages ~4.75 units/period. The 'In-transit' figure of 1471 units is almost entirely composed of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26, and P34), which total exactly 1471 units. These are 'phantom pipeline' units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its inventory position. However, because on-hand inventory is currently 117 units and demand is near zero, there is no immediate need to order more. To prevent the system from being blocked by the phantom pipeline when demand eventually rises, I must maintain an inflated mu_hat. For this period, I will use a recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current low regime, but since on-hand (117) vastly exceeds expected demand for the lead time (3 periods * ~5 = 15), no new orders will be triggered regardless of the phantom pipeline. Lead time is set to default (promised 2) as recent successfully delivered orders (P30, P31, P32, P33, P39) have stabilized around 1-3 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712587002 is in a deep seasonal trough (mid-December, Winter), with demand consistently below 3 units per period for the last 5 weeks. There is a confirmed phantom pipeline of 1,525 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26, and now P34) which are lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' total of 1,471 units (the system has partially resolved or reconciled some older units, but 1,471 still remains as a 'ghost' quantity). Because On-hand (115) is extremely high relative to current demand (~2 units/week), no new orders are necessary. However, to ensure the backend logic does not see the 1,471 'In-transit' units as available supply for the future, I must continue to keep mu_hat inflated. Given the game is near completion (Period 45 of 47) and we have massive excess stock (115 units vs demand of 2), I will set mu_hat to explicitly cover the phantom pipeline plus a small buffer for the final periods. I am setting mu_hat to 1,500 to neutralize the 1,471 in-transit 'noise'.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed deep seasonal trough (Dec demand <3 units/period). Phantom pipeline of ~1471 units persists in system in-transit calculations, requiring mu_hat inflation.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. Demand for these viscose-blend paperwaist trousers is in a deep seasonal trough (averaging ~2-5 units/period since November). On-hand inventory is 110 units, which covers over 20 weeks of current demand. However, the system's stock calculation is distorted by a 'phantom pipeline' of 1471 units (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26, and P34 are confirmed lost based on subsequent arrivals). To prevent the OR backend from seeing this 1471 as 'incoming stock' and effectively blocking all future orders, mu_hat must be inflated. Although we don't need to order right now due to high on-hand stock and low demand, we maintain the mu_hat inflation logic to ensure the policy remains responsive to future demand increases. We use L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+L)*3 + 1471 = 1480, and a small sigma_hat to reflect the stable low-demand environment.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. Demand for these viscose trousers is in a deep seasonal trough, averaging <3 units per period over the last 5 weeks (P42-P46 demands: 15, 2, 2, 5, 1). With an on-hand inventory of 109 units, we have over 30 weeks of stock at current consumption rates. The 'In-transit' figure of 1471 units consists entirely of 'phantom pipeline' (lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, P26, and P34). Because this phantom pipeline (1471) is massive compared to our target stock level for a demand of ~2-3 units/period, any standard ordering logic would be suppressed. However, given the current overstock (109 units), NO new orders are needed. I will set L to the promised 2, and mu_hat to a very low value reflecting the current seasonal floor. I am not inflating mu_hat this period because there is no desire to trigger an order; we merely want to let the current excess inventory deplete naturally.
