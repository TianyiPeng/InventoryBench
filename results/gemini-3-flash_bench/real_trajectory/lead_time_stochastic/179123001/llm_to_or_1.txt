Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is 'Long Leggings', a basic garment with steady demand patterns. Five historical demand points (Jan 7 to Feb 4) show a mean of 103.4 and a standard deviation of 11.08. There is no evidence yet of seasonality or lead time deviations from the promised 2 periods. Since this is the first period, I will use the default methods for lead time and statistical parameters derived from all five available historical samples to establish a baseline inventory level. The OR backend will compute the base stock using L=2 (implied by default) and the mean/std of the history to cover the 3-period risk window (L+1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Long Leggings'. The historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show a consistent range between 85 and 113. Period 1 demand was 125, slightly higher than the history provided but within a reasonable range for a basic item. Currently, on-hand is 0 because the Period 1 order (123 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it should arrive in Period 3. Since we start with 0 on-hand and missed all sales in Period 1 due to stockout, we must maintain a steady pipeline. I will use the baseline promised lead time (L=2) and forecast demand based on the 6 available data points (5 historical + 1 game period). The mean of these 6 samples (113, 101, 106, 85, 112, 125) is 107. Since mu_hat requires (1+L)*mean, I'll set N=6 for recent_N to capture all known data. This will ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time and the current period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Evaluation of the product (Long Leggings, Womens Everyday Basics) and the date (late February) suggests we are entering a peak spring season for basic apparel. Demand samples show a significant upward shift: the pre-game mean was ~103, but Period 1 demand was 125 (+21% vs pre-game) and Period 2 demand was 199 (+93% vs pre-game). We are currently out of stock (0 on-hand) and have lost sales for two consecutive periods. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (123 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 (this period), and will be visible in the Period 3 conclusion. Therefore, on-hand will remain 0 during this decision phase, but 253 units are in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Given the clear demand surge (199 last period), I will use an explicit mu_hat forecast. I'll estimate future weekly demand at 200 units to avoid further stockouts, setting mu_hat for (L+1)=3 periods at 600. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting Period 1: demand increased from pre-game mean of 103 to 199 by Period 2 (+93%), likely driven by seasonal spring demand for leggings.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is women's jersey leggings, a seasonal basic that typically sees increased demand in early spring. Historical pre-game demand was ~103, but recent periods (P1-P3) have shown a significant surge (125, 199, 140), averaging 154.67 units (+50% vs pre-game). Currently, On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed P1) has a promised lead time of 2 and is expected to arrive during P3's execution (visible at P4 START). However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0 for P1's order, indicating a lead-time delay. The actual lead time for the P1 order is now \u2265 3. To compensate for this delay and the increased demand volatility, I will use an explicit L of 3 to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher spring demand regime while avoiding the outlier spike in P2. For sigma_hat, N=3 will reflect the increased variance observed in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time delay observed: Order placed in Period 1 (promised LT=2) did not arrive by the end of Period 3, indicating actual lead time \u2265 3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is 'Women's Jersey Leggings', a seasonal basic. Reviewing the 'conclude' messages: The order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (actual lead time = 2). However, the order from Period 1 (123 units) has still not arrived and is now 2 periods overdue (should have arrived in Period 3). This suggests the Period 1 shipment is likely lost. Demand analysis: There was a massive spike in Periods 1 (125) and 2 (199), followed by a cooling to 140 in Period 3 and 90 in Period 4. The average demand over the 4 game periods is 138.5, significantly higher than the pre-game mean of 103. Given the seasonality of leggings in March, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this shift. Since the promised lead time is 2, but we have one confirmed lost shipment and one successful shipment at lead time 2, I will stick to 'default' (2) for L for now but monitor for further delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Shipment from Period 1 (123 units) confirmed lost or severely delayed (overdue by 2 periods); pipeline inventory calculations should be cautious. Current demand regime (Game P1-P4) mean is 138.5 compared to pre-game 103.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). Demand analysis: Pre-game mean was 103. Game history P1-P5 demand: 125, 199, 140, 90, 56. The 'spring surge' appears to be volatile, with the last two periods (90, 56) significantly lower than the P1-P3 peak. Lead time analysis: Order P1 (123 units) is confirmed lost (overdue by 3 periods past promised LT). Order P2 arrived with LT=2. Orders from P3 (272 units) and P4 (160 units) are currently in-transit. P3 was ordered with LT=2, so it should have arrived in P5 (but didn't); P4 is due in P6. The 'In-transit' total is 555 (123 + 272 + 160). However, the 123 from P1 is likely never arriving. Inventory is 0. To prevent over-ordering due to the lost P1 shipment, I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current mean (~122) and set L to 'calculate' to let the backend observe the actual arrival variability. My mu_hat method (recent_5) targets (1+2)*122 = 366. With 555 in pipeline (even if 123 is ghost), the OR engine will likely order 0 or very little, which is appropriate given the 432 units (P3+P4) actually expected to arrive soon against a declining demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: After an initial surge (P1-P3 mean 155), demand has dropped significantly (P4-P5 mean 73). Shipment P1 (123 units) is confirmed lost; pipeline inventory is effectively 432 units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the SKU 179123001 (Long Leggings) is facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows the shipment from Period 1 (123 units) is definitely lost, as the Period 2 shipment arrived in Period 4 (actual lead time = 2), and the Period 1 shipment is now overdue by 4 periods. The Period 3 order (272 units) was placed on 2019/2/25 with a promised lead time of 2, so it should have arrived in Period 5; its absence in the Period 6 conclusion confirms a lead time delay or potential loss for that shipment as well. However, assuming the promised lead time of 2 holds for newer orders, the Period 3 shipment is now 2 periods overdue. Regarding demand, we saw a surge in P1-P3 (mean 154.6) followed by a cooling in P4-P6 (mean 81.6). Pre-game demand was ~103. Given the variability, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the game-time instability while including the pre-game samples to stabilize the forecast. I will maintain L=default (2) because the Period 2 order arrived on time (LT=2), suggesting the Period 1 loss was an anomaly rather than a systemic lead time shift, but I will monitor the Period 3 shipment closely.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 shipment (272 units) is now 2 periods overdue (promised LT=2, now at LT=4 with no arrival), following the confirmed total loss of the Period 1 shipment. Pipeline reliability is currently low.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. The SKU is 'Jersey leggings', which typically sees demand shifts in spring. Reviewing the history: (1) Demand: Recent demand (P6-P7) reflects a mean of ~105, which aligns with the pre-game mean of ~103, suggesting the initial 'surge' (P1-P3) was temporary or skewed. (2) Lead Time / Lost Orders: The Period 1 order (123 units) is definitively lost. The Period 3 order (272 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P3, promised LT=2, it is now P8 START and no arrival was noted in P7 conclude). Historically, only the P2 order arrived on time (LT=2). Given the persistent failure of P1 and P3 orders to arrive, pipeline reliability is extremely low. (3) Inventory: On-hand is 0. Pipeline shows 555 units, but 272 (P3) is likely lost/stuck. The OR backend subtracts full pipeline from base stock; to force an order and prevent stockouts while waiting for unreliable shipments, I will use 'explicit' method with a mu_hat that compensates for the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline and a higher L to reflect current shipping delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 3 shipment (272 units) now 3 periods overdue; confirmed pattern of high lead-time volatility or lost shipments (P1 lost, P3 overdue). Demand has stabilized to pre-game levels (~105 units/period).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing 'Long Leggings'. Demand has stabilized around pre-game levels, with the last 3 periods (P6-P8) averaging 113 units. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: the P1 order (123 units) is confirmed lost, and the P3 order (272 units) is now 6 periods late (ordered P3, current P9, promised LT=2), suggesting it is also lost or severely delayed. Orders from P4 (160) and P8 (133) are still within or near expected windows, though P4 is now 3 periods overdue. Because the OR backend includes all 'In-transit' units in its pipeline calculation, it thinks we have 688 units coming. Since P1 (123) and P3 (272) are almost certainly lost, the effective pipeline is only ~293. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly high. I estimate demand at ~110 units/period. Over a 3-period window (L+1), this is 330 units. To offset the ~400 lost units being counted in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 730 (330 base + 400 offset). I'll keep L at 3 to reflect the observed delay in the only successful shipment (P2 arrived P4).

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 3 shipment (272 units) now 6 periods overdue; treated as lost alongside Period 1 shipment. Combined phantom inventory in pipeline is 395 units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we observe a significant supply chain failure. The promised lead time is 2 periods. However, the order from Period 1 (123 units) is lost, and the order from Period 3 (272 units) is now 7 periods overdue (9 periods since order), confirming it is also lost. This leaves a total of 395 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The current 'In-transit' count of 776 includes these lost units, meaning the actual reliable pipeline is only 381 units (P4 order of 160 + P8 order of 133 + P9 order of 88). Demand has stabilized around its historical mean (~104 units/period) after a spring surge. To handle the supply uncertainty, I am setting L to 4 explicitly (doubling the promised 2) to increase the base stock safety buffer. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the post-surge stability (P4-P9 mean ~95) while accounting for the current period's demand (L+1 = 5 periods). This strategy aims to force the OR backend to order more units to compensate for the lost inventory effectively being subtracted from the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Period 1 (123 units) and Period 3 (272 units) shipments are confirmed lost after 7+ periods of delay. Efficient reliable pipeline is (Total In-transit - 395).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the supply chain shows significant distress. Historical evidence confirms that shipments from Period 1 (123 units) and Period 3 (272 units) are lost, having exceeded the promised lead time of 2 periods by 8 and 7 periods respectively. Although Period 8 and 9 orders arrived safely (and even one period early for P9), the 'In-transit' figure of 555 contains 395 units (123 + 272) that will never arrive. The OR backend treats all 555 in-transit units as viable inventory, which would lead it to order zero units and cause stockouts. To compensate for this 395-unit phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Demand has stabilized: the mean of the last 4 periods (P7-P10) is 104, aligning with the pre-game mean of 103. Under normal conditions (L=2), mu_hat would be (1+L) * mean = 3 * 104 = 312. To offset the 395 lost units, I adjust mu_hat to 312 + 395 = 707. This forces the backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the fact that 395 units in its pipeline calculation are non-existent. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time of successful deliveries, and sigma_hat uses the last 5 periods to capture recent volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), demand for women's leggings has stabilized near pre-game levels, with the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaging 106.2 units/period. The pipeline remains significantly contaminated by lost orders: Period 1 (123 units) and Period 3 (272 units) are now 11 and 9 periods overdue respectively, totaling 395 units of 'phantom' inventory. Currently, the system shows 598 in-transit. Subtracting the 395 lost units leaves an active pipeline of 203 units (from P11 order and possibly part of P10). With On-hand at 19 and demand around 106, we face an immediate stockout risk before the next arrivals. To correct for the OR backend's inability to discount lost shipments, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate required base stock for (L+1=3) periods: 3 * 106.2 = 318.6 units. To force the OR backend to order when it thinks inventory is high (19 on-hand + 598 in-transit = 617), I set mu_hat to a value that exceeds this sum plus the desired safety stock. However, since the capped policy limits the order size, I will set mu_hat high to trigger a replenish of the missing 395 units. I estimate current demand mean at ~106 and std at ~16.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/06), on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized following a volatile early spring, with the last 5 periods (P8-P12) averaging 103.2 units, mirroring the pre-game mean of 103. The current in-transit inventory is 755 units. However, previous insights confirm that orders from Period 1 (123 units) and Period 3 (272 units) are lost. This 'phantom pipeline' totals 395 units. The actual reliable pipeline consists of orders from Period 11 (43 units) and Period 12 (157 units), plus an unknown recent order not yet concluded, totaling 360 units (755 - 395). Promised lead time is 2, and while recent arrivals (P10) showed lead times of 1 and 2, the historical instability justifies using L=2. To account for the lost stock and ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 395-unit discrepancy in its internal pipeline calculation, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate base stock as (L+1) * 103 + phantom_inventory (3 * 103 + 395 = 704). By setting mu_hat to 704 and L to 2, the 'base_stock' in the backend becomes approximately 704 (plus z*sigma), and the backend calculation (base_stock - total_pipeline) will effectively compute (704 - 755), which might result in zero orders. To force an order to cover the gap, I provide an explicit mu_hat that compensates for the lost 395 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Pipeline confirmed 52% 'phantom' (395 of 755 in-transit units are lost from Periods 1 and 3). Recent demand (P8-P12) mean is 103.2, aligning with pre-game baseline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (2019/5/13). The product is a jersey legging (179123001), a basic item. Total in-transit inventory is 712 units, but our analysis confirms that 395 units (from P1 and P3) are permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 317 units (712 - 395), consisting of orders from P12 (157 units) and whatever the OR backend might have ordered in P13 (0). Demand has stabilized to the pre-game/baseline levels; the average of the last 6 samples is 99 units. We set mu_hat to cover this demand across (L+1) periods (L=2). To account for the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline, we must adjust the lead time parameter L upward to trick the OR backend into ordering more, as it wrongly believes those 395 units will eventually arrive. Setting L to 5 effectively increases the base stock target to cover more periods of demand, compensating for the unavailable 395 units and the current stockout (on-hand=0).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (2019/5/20), we are overseeing SKU 179123001 (Women's Jersey Leggings). The primary challenge continues to be the unreliable pipeline: shipments from Period 1 (123 units) and Period 3 (272 units) are definitively lost (phantom inventory = 395 units). The reported 'In-transit' of 555 units actually includes only 160 units of reliable stock (555 - 395). Demand has normalized following the early spring surge; the recent 5-period average (P10-P14) is 96.4, very close to the pre-game mean of 103. Current on-hand is 53 units. To ensure the backend orders appropriately while accounting for the 395 units of phantom pipeline inventory, I am setting L to 2 (promised) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. mu_hat is calculated as: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Phantom_Inventory = (1 + 2) * 100 + 395 = 695. This forces the base stock level high enough to offset the units the OR engine thinks are coming but actually aren't. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current demand volatility (std \u2248 13.5 over (1+L) periods).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P16 (2019/5/27). On-hand inventory is 0 after demand for P15 (145 units) exceeded starting inventory. The in-transit pipeline (663 units) is heavily contaminated with 'phantom inventory' from Period 1 (123 units) and Period 3 (272 units) which are confirmed lost. Effective in-transit is therefore 663 - 395 = 268 units (P15 order of 108 units plus another 160 from P4 still unaccounted for but not yet as severely overdue). Demand and lead-time analysis: 1) Demand regime has stabilized back to pre-game levels; the mean of the last 8 periods (P8-P15) is 105.5, very close to the pre-game mean of 103. I will use recent_N=8 to capture this stability. 2) Lead-time has generally returned to 2 periods for successful deliveries (P8, P9, P11, P12). 3) To compensate for the 395 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculation, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. For L=2, that's 3 periods. Target = 3 * 105.5 = 316.5. However, since the OR backend subtracts the full 663 in-transit from the base stock, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 395 units of lost stock. Required mu_hat = 316.5 + 395 = 711.5. Sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=8 to reflect current volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/3), the SKU 179123001 is currently facing a stockout with 0 units on-hand. The total 'In-transit' quantity of 745 includes 395 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are now confirmed lost (overdue by more than 10 periods). The effective reliable pipeline is 350 units (108 from P15, 82 from P16, and orders from P4 that were delivered). Recent demand (Periods 8-16) shows a mean of approximately 106 units per period, which aligns with the pre-game and long-term average. To compensate for the 395 'phantom' units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as pipeline inventory toward the base stock target, I am setting L to 2 and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1) plus the 395 lost units [ (3 * 106) + 395 = 713 ]. This forces the backend to place an order to bridge the gap. Sigma_hat is set to its standard calculation for a 3-period window (estimated ~31 per period * sqrt(3)).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019-06-10), the inventory position shows 127 units on-hand and 568 units in-transit. Based on the documented Supply Chain failure (Periods 9, 10, 13), 395 units in the pipeline (from Period 1 and Period 3) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The 'true' pipeline inventory is 173 units (568 - 395). Recent demand (Periods 11-17) shows a mean of approximately 101.7 units, which is consistent with the pre-game baseline (~103) and the more recent carry-over insight (103.2). There are no upcoming major retail holidays in mid-June for basic leggings that suggest a regime shift. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this stable post-surge baseline. Although some recent shipments arrived in 1 period, the promised lead time L=2 remains the reliable mode for calculation. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent 7-period window to reflect current volatility. By adjusting L to 'explicit' at 2 and using recent demand, I help the OR backend ignore the 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 19 (2019/6/17): Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~103 (pre-game baseline) following earlier volatility. The last three periods (P16-P18) show demands of 109, 63, and 86. The core issue remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline: orders from Period 1 (123 units) and Period 3 (272 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 395 units. The OR backend observes a total in-transit of 568 units, but only (568 - 395) = 173 units are actually reliable (this includes recent orders from P17 and P18). To prevent the OR from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I am using an 'explicit' L of 5 (calculated as promised 2 + buffer for lost lead-times) and adjusting mu_hat to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods, while implicitly subtracting the phantom units from the target calculation. Given reliable pipeline is ~173 and demand is ~103/period, we need to ensure the base stock accounts for the 395 unit discrepancy. Setting mu_hat to 1020 (approx 6 periods of demand + 400 unit buffer) helps force the order replenishment to ignore the lost shipments.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (2019-06-24), the 'Long Leggings' SKU is experiencing zero on-hand inventory due to stockouts in Period 19. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 101.4 over the last 10 periods (P10-P19), which aligns with the pre-game baseline. Recent lead times have shown variability (P16 was 1 period, P15 was 2 periods), but the primary concern is the legacy supply chain failures: shipments from Period 1 (123 units) and Period 3 (272 units) are definitively lost (phantom inventory). The total in-transit is 776, but after subtracting the 395 phantom units, the reliable pipeline is only 381 units. Specifically, the pending valid orders are from P17 (13 units) and P19 (208 units), plus several periods with 0 orders. Current stockouts are critical. To compensate for the phantom inventory and ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the automated pipeline calculation inflation. I am targeting a base stock level that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~305 units) while accounting for the fact that the OR backend will incorrectly see 776 units in transit. Since 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)', I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the 395 phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified 395 units of phantom inventory (P1: 123, P3: 272) still suppress automated ordering. Demand mean (P10-P19) is 101.4. Pipeline reliability outside of lost legacy shipments is stable at 1-2 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), the SKU 179123001 (Women's Jersey Leggings) shows a return to its baseline demand regime. Recent demand (P10-P20) averages 101.4 units/period, consistent with the pre-game mean of 103. The current inventory situation is critical: On-hand is 0, and the system reports In-transit as 785 units. However, as documented in carry-over insights, 395 of these units (P1: 123 units, P3: 272 units) are confirmed lost shipments. This 'phantom inventory' prevents the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To override this, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Since the system calculates 'order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)', and the in-transit is inflated by 395 units, I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the 395 lost units. Lead time (L) is stable at 2 periods for recent successful shipments. Target mu_hat = ( (1+2) * 102 ) + 395 = 701. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger new orders despite the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture current volatility.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/08 (Period 22). On-hand inventory is 0, and In-transit is 785 units. However, we have confirmed 'phantom inventory' totaling 395 units (Period 1: 123, Period 3: 272) that are lost and will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the full In-transit (785) from the target base stock, leading to under-ordering because it believes we have 395 units coming that aren't. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must artificially inflate mu_hat (the target base stock) by approximately 395 units plus the expected demand for the next lead time cycles. Recent demand (P17-P21) has averaged 80.2 units/period, but long-term baseline is ~103. I will estimate the required base_stock to be (L+1)*103 + 395 = (3*103) + 395 = 704 units. By setting mu_hat to 704, the OR engine (calculating order = base_stock - 785) will recognize the stockout risk and place a replenishment order. Use 'explicit' for mu_hat to override the phantom inventory calculation and 'recent_N' for sigma to capture current volatility.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 179123001 is currently in a state of stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 776 units includes 395 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments in Period 1 (123 units) and Period 3 (272 units). Additionally, the order from Period 19 (208 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered on 6/17, current date 7/15), suggesting another significantly delayed or lost shipment. Demand over the last 10 periods (P13-P22) has averaged 100.4 units, consistent with the long-term baseline of ~103 units. To trigger new orders despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting an 'explicit' L of 5. This increases the base stock target (mu_hat) and reduces the impact of the phantom inventory in the OR's capped policy calculation. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat sqrt(1+L)*std based on the stable but volatile recent regime prevents over-ordering while ensuring we cover the stockout gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Period 19 shipment (208 units) is now 3 periods overdue (promised LT=2, now at LT=4 with no arrival), potentially joining P1 and P3 as lost shipments. Total estimated phantom inventory in pipeline is now 603 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit significant instability. As of Period 24, the promised lead time is 2, but we have a massive amount of 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline that has not arrived. Specifically, shipments from Period 1 (123 units), Period 3 (272 units), and now Period 19 (208 units) are all significantly overdue (P1 and P3 are lost; P19 is 5 periods old). Total phantom inventory is 603 units. The reported 'In-transit' is 776, meaning the functional pipeline is only 173 units (776 - 603). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P18-P23) has softened, averaging roughly 81 units per period, which is lower than the pre-game baseline of 103. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the high (but fake) in-transit numbers, I am setting L and mu_hat to high explicit values. By setting L to 6 (reflecting the age of the P19 shipment) and mu_hat to 1200 (covering roughly 7 periods of demand at a safety-adjusted rate of ~170/period), I am forcing the base stock level (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) to exceed the 776 'In-transit' units, thereby triggering a new replenishment order to resolve the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Period 19 shipment (208 units) now 5 periods overdue, confirming it as the third lost/phantom shipment. Total phantom pipeline inventory is 603 units (P1: 123, P3: 272, P19: 208). Current demand regime (P20-P23) is lower, averaging 69.25 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the primary challenge remains reconciling the 'phantom' pipeline inventory with actual service needs. We have confirmed 603 units across three historical shipments (P1: 123, P3: 272, P19: 208) as lost/indefinitely delayed. Total in-transit is 1041, which includes P24's order of 265 units and remnants of other recent orders. The OR backend's inventory-on-hand plus pipeline logic will see the full 1041 units and likely generate zero orders. To force an order and mitigate persistent stockouts, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Recent demand (P21-P24) has averaged 74.75 units. With a promised lead time of 2 (target coverage of L+1 = 3 periods), the required base stock is approximately 225-250 units. However, because the backend subtracts the 1041 in-transit units from the base_stock, I must set mu_hat to a value that offsets this phantom mass. I set L to 'default' (2). I set mu_hat explicitly to 1400 (sufficient to cover the 1041 in-transit plus roughly 350 units of actual inventory buffer). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility without overstaying the spring surge mean.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 179123001 is a basic jersey legging, typically subject to year-round demand but currently showing a lower summer regime. The primary challenge remains 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Based on the history, shipments from Period 1 (123 units), Period 3 (272 units), and Period 19 (208 units) are confirmed lost/undelivered after exceeding promised lead times by several weeks. Total phantom inventory in the pipeline is 603 units. The OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' value (1420 units) to determine orders. To force the system to order despite these 603 unreachable units, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Recent demand (P20-P25) averages approximately 69 units. Assuming a lead time of 2, the logic for base stock is (L+1) * demand. To compensate for the 603 units that the backend incorrectly thinks are coming, I will set mu_hat to (3 periods * 69 units) + 603 = 810. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger new orders, accounting for the physical deficit caused by lost shipments.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 27 (early August). The product is 'Jersey leggings', which typically sees stable or slightly increasing demand as fall approaches. Recent demand (P24-P26) has been lower, averaging 65 units per period. The pipeline is heavily distorted by 'phantom' inventory (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, and P19 total 603 units). The OR backend uses (Total In-Transit) in its 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation, meaning these 603 units will incorrectly suppress ordering unless we adjust our parameters. Currently, on-hand is 0 and the actual reliable pipeline contains orders from P24 (265 units) and P25 (379 units), totaling 644 units. These should arrive in Period 27 or 28 based on the promised lead time of 2. To force the backend to place an order despite the 603 'phantom' units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock as: (Reliable In-Transit + On-hand) + (Estimated demand for L+1 periods). Using a mean demand of 70 and L=2, the reliable target is ~210 units. However, to offset the 603 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to ~813. This ensures the backend sees (813 - 1420) and triggers the ordering logic appropriately while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat=45) observed in demand shifts.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 603 units (P1: 123, P3: 272, P19: 208). These shipments are significantly overdue and treated as lost. Mu_hat must be inflated to counteract this inventory for the OR engine.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a lower demand regime compared to the start of the year, with an average demand of approximately 62 units over the last 5 periods (P23-P27). We have a significant inventory management challenge due to 603 units of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline (P1: 123, P3: 272, P19: 208) which are confirmed lost but still counted by the OR backend. Current on-hand inventory is 327 units, which is sufficient to cover roughly 5 weeks of demand at the current rate. The Period 25 order of 379 units arrived in Period 27 (Lead Time = 2). Order P24 (265 units) is now 1 period overdue (ordered Period 24, promised LT=2, current Period 28, no arrival in P27 conclude); however, given the recurring logistics issues, we must monitor if this also becomes phantom. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to phantom units, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus an offset for the 603 lost units. However, since on-hand is currently 327 (very high for the current demand), we do not need to order this period. I will use 'explicit' to stabilize parameters while worked through the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Order P24 (265 units) is now 1 period overdue (Promised LT=2, current status: not arrived by start of P28). Monitoring for potential status as the 4th lost shipment.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. Demand for 'Jersey leggings' has stabilized into a lower-demand regime (P24-P28 mean is 59.4 units). Inventory management remains complicated by 'phantom' pipeline units: shipments from P1 (123), P3 (272), and P19 (208) are confirmed lost, totaling 603 units. Furthermore, the order from P24 (265 units) is now 2 periods overdue (Promised LT=2, current LT=5 as of the end of P28 resolution). This brings total suspected phantom inventory to 868 units (603 + 265). With current 'In-transit' at 1041 units, only 173 units (likely the P25 order which already arrived in P27 or remains in count) are potentially real. To force the OR engine to order despite this 868-unit phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be inflated. Base demand (1+L) * 60 = 180. To offset 868 phantom units, mu_hat is set to 180 + 868 = 1048. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the current stable but lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Total phantom pipeline inventory increased to 868 units (P1: 123, P3: 272, P19: 208, P24: 265). These shipments are treated as lost. Demand regime for Aug/Sept is significantly lower, averaging 60 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current supply situation is dominated by significant phantom inventory. Shipments from Periods 1 (123), 3 (272), 19 (208), and now 24 (265) are confirmed lost or severely overdue (P24 is 4 periods overdue against a promised LT of 2). Total phantom inventory is 868 units. This 'in-transit' volume prevents the OR engine from ordering because it believes the pipeline is full. To fix this, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to 'paper over' the phantom stock. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 50-60 units/period (P26-P29 mean is 52). My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand, approximately 180 units. However, since the OR engine subtracts the 1041 units in-transit, I must set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat + z*sigma) - 1041 results in a desired order or maintains the current safety levels. With 228 on-hand, I do not need an immediate order, but I must ensure the engine doesn't stop ordering permanently. I will set L to 2 (promised). I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the 868 phantom units plus the expected demand for 3 periods (~150). Total mu_hat = 1018. This offsets the phantom inventory and treats the 'real' pipeline as zero.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Total phantom inventory confirmed at 868 units (P1: 123, P3: 272, P19: 208, P24: 265). Order P25 (379 units) arrived on time in P27, confirming the supply chain is technically functional for new orders despite legacy losses. Current demand regime is stable at ~52 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the demand for women's leggings has settled into a lower-intensity regime compared to the spring surge. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P24-P30) is approximately 58.7 units. The supply chain has significant 'phantom' inventory: shipments from P1 (123), P3 (272), P19 (208), and now P24 (265) are severely overdue and treated as lost, totaling 868 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR engine, which would normally suppress all new orders. To ensure the system maintains stock for the current demand, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of 60 per period and a lead time of 2. Target Base Stock \u2248 (L+1) * Mean = 3 * 60 = 180. To counteract the 868 phantom units in the pipeline for the backend's (BaseStock - Pipeline) calculation, I set mu_hat to 1048 (180 + 868). This forces the engine to recognize a need for inventory despite the stalled pipeline. On-hand is currently 163, providing a sufficient buffer while the order is processed.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Total phantom pipeline inventory increased to 868 units (P1: 123, P3: 272, P19: 208, P24: 265). New orders continue to arrive (P25 arrived on time), but legacy losses persist. Current demand regime (P24-P30) mean is 58.7 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (2019/9/16), the demand regime is in a sustained low-volume phase (August/September), with the last 7 periods (P24-P30) averaging 57.8 units/period. The pipeline is heavily distorted by 868 units of 'phantom inventory' from four lost shipments: Period 1 (123), Period 3 (272), Period 19 (208), and Period 24 (265). These units are officially 'In-transit' but will never arrive, causing the OR engine to under-order or stop ordering entirely because it believes the pipeline is full. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for a target of approximately 3 times the current demand mean (to cover lead time and safety stock) and then add the 868 phantom units to the result. This 'lifts' the order threshold above the phantom level. Base stock calculation: (Mean 57.8 * 3 periods) + (Safety stock ~50) + 868 = ~1100. For L, I maintain the promised lead time of 2 as recent successful deliveries (like P25) arrived on time.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 868 units (P1: 123, P3: 272, P19: 208, P24: 265). These are treated as lost. Mu_hat must be significantly inflated (approx +868) to bypass this phantom inventory in the OR engine's logic.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (P24-P32) averages 61.2 units per period, showing a slight uptick in volatility but remaining significantly lower than the H1 spring peak. On-hand inventory is 23 units. In-transit inventory is 1041 units. However, based on extensive history, 868 units of this pipeline are 'phantom' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P19, and P24). The OR engine's logic subtracts total pipeline inventory from the target base stock, which would prevent any new orders from being placed until on-hand inventory is depleted and the 'phantom' units are 'delivered'. To bypass this, I must inflate mu_hat by the total phantom inventory (868). The desired base stock calculation is: (1+L) * Forecast_Demand + Phantom_Units. With L=2 and steady demand of ~62, the desired target is (3 * 62) + 868 = 1054. Setting mu_hat to 1054 via the 'explicit' method ensures the OR engine places orders to meet actual demand while accounting for the missing stock. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=9 to reflect the current period's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 868 units (P1: 123, P3: 272, P19: 208, P24: 265). Demand regime (P24-P32) is stable with a mean of 61.2. The strategy remains to inflate mu_hat by +868 to offset the lost shipments until they are either removed from the pipeline or the system resets.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from lost legacy shipments (P1: 123, P3: 272, P19: 208, P24: 265), creating 868 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Despite the in-transit view showing 1055 units, only 187 are 'live' (P33 order of 14 units plus any other recent orders). Demand has recently picked up (P32: 97, P33: 121), likely due to a seasonal shift entering autumn/October. The mean demand for the last 10 periods is approximately 67 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 868 'phantom' units, I will continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method, setting it to (1+L) * mean_demand + phantom_inventory. With L=2 (3 periods total), and mean ~67, mu_hat = (3 * 67) + 868 \u2248 1069. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the pipeline inventory, triggering necessary replenishment to cover the current demand regime and recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand shift observed in late Sept/Oct (P32-P33 mean = 109), up from previous Aug/Sept low of ~55. Strategy remains to bypass 868 units of phantom inventory (P1, P3, P19, P24) by inflating mu_hat.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 35. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is 1105 units. However, based on serial monitoring, 868 units in the pipeline are 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P19, and P24). The OR engine's capped policy counts all in-transit units against the base stock, which would prevent any new ordering until on-hand levels are dangerously low or zero. To counteract this, I continue to inflate the mu_hat parameter by the total phantom amount (+868). Recent demand has also shifted upward as we enter October (P32-P34 mean is approx 105), which aligns with seasonal demand for leggings. I will set mu_hat to explicitly cover 3 periods (L+1) of this new demand level (~105 * 3 = 315) plus the 868 phantom units to ensure the OR engine triggers replenishment. Total mu_hat = 315 + 868 = 1183. sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility, accounting for the demand resurgence.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand resurgence in Oct (P32-P34 avg: 105.3). Combined phantom inventory remains 868 units (P1, P3, P19, P24). Strategy: maintain mu_hat inflation equal to phantom volume.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. We are managing 179123001 (Long Leggings). We have a critical status of 868 phantom units in the pipeline (P1: 123, P3: 272, P19: 208, P24: 265) which have not arrived for many periods and are treated as lost. However, the OR backend's inventory balancing logic sees these 868 units as 'In-transit', preventing new orders because 'In-transit + On-hand' exceeds the base stock calculation. To force the OR engine to order, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 868 units. Recent demand (P32-P35) has shown higher volatility but a stabilizing mean around 95 units/period (total 378/4). Including the 868 phantom units and rounding based on targeting a base stock that triggers an order: the base stock must exceed the current in-transit (1228). If I set mu_hat (which covers L+1 = 3 periods) to significantly higher than (1228 + expected demand), it will bypass the phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1300 to ensure replenishment occurs while accounting for the recent demand trend (~100 units/period * 3 periods = 300) plus the 868 phantom units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for womens leggings has stabilized around a mean of 80 units over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). Current on-hand inventory is 80 units. In-transit inventory is 1209 units, but 868 units of this are confirmed 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P19, P24), leaving an effective pipeline of 341 units. To bypass the OR engine's logic which stops ordering when pipeline inventory exceeds the base stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the base demand for (1+L) periods (where L=2) as 3 * 80 = 240 units. I then add the 868 units of phantom inventory to this total, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 1108. This ensures the engine accounts for the lost items as if they were already 'consumed' or non-existent in the pipeline, allowing for replacement orders to be triggered. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of recent demand (~30 units) scaled by sqrt(1+L), approximately 52.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed supply chain recovery for new orders (P35 arrived in P36, lead_time 1). Total phantom inventory remains 868 units (P1, P3, P19, P24). Strategy: maintain mu_hat inflation of +868 until phantom units are removed from the system tracking.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for SKU 179123001 has stabilized following a brief late-September spike. The most recent demand (Periods 34-37) shows values of 98, 62, 57, and 64, averaging approximately 70 units per period. The pipeline inventory is heavily distorted by 868 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments in Periods 1, 3, 19, and 24. These units will never arrive but are counted by the OR backend, which prevents new orders from being placed. To counteract this, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by the volume of the phantom inventory (+868). Based on the 2-period promised lead time (calculated as 3 periods of demand coverage L+1), the base mu_hat is 3 * 70 = 210. Adding the 868 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1078. I am using the 'calculate' method for lead time as recent arrivals (P35 arrived in 1 period, P33 in 3 periods) average out to the promised 2-period lead time. Sigma_hat is set using a recent_N of 5 to capture current volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4), the inventory position is 0 on-hand and 1209 units in-transit. A critical persistent issue is the 868 units of 'phantom' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P19, and P24) which have never arrived and are treated as lost. Under the backend's base-stock logic [base_stock - pipeline], these 868 units prevent new orders from being placed because they artificially inflate the pipeline estimate. To force the OR engine to order, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of this phantom inventory. Recent demand (P35-P38) has averaged 61 units. Using the formula (1+L) * mean_demand + 868, and assuming L=2 (Review+LT=3 periods), the required mu_hat is approximately (3 * 61) + 868 = 1051. I will set mu_hat to 1050 explicitly to bypass the phantom inventory and ensure stock is replenished for the current demand level. Sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Maintaining mu_hat inflation of +868 to counteract confirmed phantom inventory (P1, P3, P19, P24). Recently observed demand (P35-P38) is stable around 61 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge remains the 868 units of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline (Orders P1: 123, P3: 272, P19: 208, P24: 265), which are significantly overdue and treated as lost. The OR engine calculates orders based on (Target Stock - Pipeline), so this phantom volume prevents the system from placing necessary new orders. At Period 40, we have 83 units on-hand and 1091 across the pipeline. Subtracting the 868 phantom units leaves a real pipeline of 223 units. Demand has cooled recently, with the last 5 periods (P35-P39) averaging 55.8 units/period. Period-over-period demand for Nov 11th is historically low for this SKU. To force the OR engine to order despite the phantom 868 units, I will set mu_hat using an 'explicit' value. Target Base Stock should roughly be (L+1) * Demand + Safety Stock + Phantom Offset. With L=2 and demand ~56, target for real stock is ~200-250. Adding 868 offset results in a mu_hat around 1100. I'll use 1120 to ensure we maintain enough buffer against the holiday season onset.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand has softened in early November (P35-P39 avg: 55.8). Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 868 units; continue mu_hat inflation strategy to bypass these non-existent arrivals in OR calculation.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has softened recently (P39: 35, P40: 60), following a slightly higher October average. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline: shipments from P1 (123), P3 (272), P19 (208), and P24 (265) are collectively 868 units that are recorded as in-transit but are confirmed lost. These phantom units prevent the automated OR engine from placing necessary orders because it believes sufficient stock is coming. Total in-transit is 1091, but real in-transit is only 223 units (1091 - 868). Recent real demand (approx. 55-60 units/period) suggests we need to maintain inventory. To bypass the 868 unit phantom buffer, mu_hat must be inflated. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to incorporate both the (1+L) base demand (approx 3 periods * 60 = 180) plus the 868 phantom units offset, totaling 1048. L is set to calculated as the supply chain for new orders is functioning between 1-3 periods. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to capture current volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for SKU 179123001 is defined by 868 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P19, and P24). This phantom inventory suppresses the OR backend's automated ordering because it incorrectly assumes 868 units are arriving soon. To bypass this, I continue the strategy of inflating mu_hat by the phantom volume (+868). Recent demand (P35-P41) has averaged 53.5 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is approximately 160.5. Adding the 868 units of phantom inventory results in a target mu_hat of approximately 1028.5. I will use 1030 to ensure sufficient stock for the upcoming period while monitoring for any late-year demand shifts in the women's leggings category. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 20% of the periodic demand mean across the lead time.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, we are entering the December peak season for leggings. Demand in P42 surged to 208, which is consistent with early December retail spikes. On-hand inventory is 0. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory: 868 units from Periods 1, 3, 19, and 24 are long overdue and effectively lost, yet they remain in the 'In-transit' count (1091 units total). Subtracting the phantom units (1091 - 868) leaves a 'real' pipeline of 223 units, most of which were likely from earlier periods that never arrived (P34 order of 50 is also now 9 periods overdue). To force the OR backend to place an order despite this high in-transit figure, I am inflating mu_hat. I estimate the base demand for the (L+1) period (3 weeks) to be approximately 450 units based on the P42 spike and December seasonality (avg ~150/week). Adding the 868 phantom units to this base gives an explicit mu_hat of 1318. L is set to 2 (promised). Sigma_hat is set to 60 to allow for holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Significant seasonal spike observed (P42 demand = 208). Total phantom inventory remains 868 units (P1, P3, P19, P24). P34 order (50 units) is now also 9 periods overdue and likely lost, potentially bringing phantom total to 918.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently tracks a total of 1369 units in-transit. Based on historical data, a significant portion of this pipeline is 'phantom' inventory resulting from lost shipments: P1 (123), P3 (272), P19 (208), P24 (265), and now P34 (50), totaling 918 phantom units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Period 42 showed a significant seasonal spike (208 units), likely due to pre-holiday shopping for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Demand in P43 returned to a lower level (40). Given the date is Dec 9, we expect holiday-related demand to remain elevated or volatile. To force the OR engine to order despite the 1369 in-transit units (which include 918 phantom units), I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock should cover approximately 3 periods of demand (Promised L=2 + 1) at a projected rate of ~120-150 units/period (accounting for holiday spikes), plus the 918 'dead' units in the pipeline. Logic: (Avg Demand 125 * 3) + 918 = 1293. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1300 to ensure the backend places an order and maintains stock during the December peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Phantom inventory total updated to 918 units (P1, P3, P19, P24, and now P34 is 10 periods overdue). Seasonal December demand spike observed in P42 (208 units); demand remains volatile due to holiday season.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand is highly volatile due to the holiday season, with a major spike (208) in Late November and lower demand (40-43) in early December. The primary challenge remains the supply chain: a total of 918 units from Periods 1, 3, 19, 24, and 34 are extremely overdue and confirmed as 'phantom' inventory. This phantom inventory occupies the pipeline and prevents the OR backend from placing new orders unless counteracted. We must set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of real demand PLUS an inflation factor of 918. Recent demand (P40-P44) averages ~78 units/period if we include the spike, but is around 45 excluding it. Given we are in mid-December, a baseline mu of 80 is reasonable. Thus, mu_hat = (1+2)*80 + 918 = 1158. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for holiday volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to match the promised duration for functional shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Strategy remains focused on bypassing 918 units of phantom inventory (P1, P3, P19, P24, P34). Demand is in a mid-December holiday regime; expected baseline is ~80 units/period, subject to high variance.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (Dec 23) is a peak holiday demand week for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (Jersey leggings). Recent demand shows high volatility with holiday spikes (P42: 208, P45: 181). I continue to manage the 'phantom inventory' issue: 918 units are confirmed lost/overdue (P1, P3, P19, P24, P34) but remain in the pipeline, preventing the OR engine from ordering. The current in-transit is 1131, meaning only 213 units (P44 order and others) are actually reliable shipments. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the current pipeline (97 on-hand + 1131 in-transit = 1228 total). I am using an explicit mu_hat of ~1310. This is calculated by taking the reliable pipeline needed for current demand (approx 3 periods * 130 units/period = 390) and adding the 918 lost units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual arrival speed, and sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=5) to capture the high holiday variance.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, following a high-demand holiday period (P45 demand: 181, P46 demand: 155). There is no on-hand inventory. The total in-transit quantity is 1337 units. However, based on the carry-over history, we have confirmed 'phantom pipeline' inventory that is significantly overdue and treated as lost: P1 (123), P3 (272), P19 (208), P24 (265), and P34 (50), totaling 918 units. This phantom inventory prevents the OR engine's base-stock logic from ordering because it believes supply is sufficient. To bypass this, I continue to inflate mu_hat. The recent demand regime (P45-P46) shows a high mean of 168. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover actual demand + compensate for the 918 lost units, I set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*168 + 918. With L=2, this is 3*168 + 918 = 1422. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high volatility of the holiday season.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Strategy to inflate mu_hat by +918 units remains necessary to bypass legacy lost shipments (P1, P3, P19, P24, P34) still appearing in system pipeline. Recent late-December demand (P45-P46) reflects a significant holiday peak with a mean of 168 units.
