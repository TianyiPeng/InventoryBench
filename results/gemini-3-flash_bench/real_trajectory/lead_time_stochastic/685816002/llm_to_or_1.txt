Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for the Ronny Reg RN T-Shirt, a basic cotton jersey item. This is a stable staple product in the Men's Underwear category. On-hand and in-transit inventory are zero. Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 (5 data points) shows a mean of 64 units per week (76, 64, 73, 53, 65). There are no clear seasonal spikes or holidays currently affecting this basic category. Given the lead time is 2 periods, the inventory coverage must account for demand in periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 = 3). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent stable demand average (64) while allowing the OR backend to apply the (1+L) multiplier. Sigma_hat will also be based on these 5 periods to capture local variance. Lead time starts at the promised 'default' of 2.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a Men's Jersey T-shirt, a staple item. Initial on-hand inventory was 0, and Period 1 demand was 96 units, resulting in 96 lost sales. There are 81 units currently in-transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, we expect this arrival during Period 3 (visible in Period 4's start). Historical samples (Jan-Feb 2019) show a mean demand of 66.2 units and a standard deviation of 8.8. However, the most recent observation in Period 1 (96 units) is significantly higher than the previous 5 samples (maxing at 76). This suggests either a regime shift or higher volatility than the historical data indicates. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to include both the local historical data and the recent high demand spike, ensuring the OR backend captures this shift while maintaining a buffer. For lead time, I will stick to the 'default' promised 2 periods as there is no evidence yet of delivery delays.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. The product is a Men's Round-necked T-shirt, a basic staple. Historical demand (P-5 to P-1) was [76, 64, 73, 53, 65], mean \u2248 66.2. However, observed demand in Period 1 (96) and Period 2 (102) indicates a significant upward shift (+50% vs historical mean). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 177 units in-transit (81 from P1, 96 from P2). Promised lead time is 2, meaning the P1 order (81 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the P3 conclude message. Since demand has shifted, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture the higher demand regime [96, 102], and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture a broader volatility window since 2 samples is too few for stable variance. L is kept at default (2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt, which typically has steady demand but shows a rising trend in the early weeks of the year (96, 102, 119 in the last three periods, vs 53-76 in Jan). Total historical mean is ~76.7, but recent demand is significantly higher. Given a promised lead time (L) of 2, the order placed in Period 1 (81 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, suggesting the order placed in Period 1 is either delayed or the lead time is longer than 2. Since we have 311 units in-transit (81+96+134) and 0 on-hand, we are experiencing stockouts. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the higher demand regime (avg ~106) and set L to 'calculate' to allow the system to adjust if lead times are consistently longer than promised.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1544.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a men's jersey basic T-shirt, which typically has stable, non-seasonal demand. Currently at Period 5 (March 11), we see the first shipment arrival (ordered Period 2, arrived Period 4 conclude) confirming the promised lead time of 2 periods. Historical demand data (pre-game) showed a mean of ~64 (range 53-76). In-game demand (Periods 1-4) has been higher, averaging 99.75. Period 1's order is still missing (it was due to arrive in Period 3 conclude if L=2), but since Period 2's order arrived exactly as expected in Period 4 conclude, Period 1's shipment is likely lost or significantly delayed. On-hand inventory is low (14), and demand is exceeding the pre-game baseline. I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent in-game data (N=4) to account for this higher average (approx 100/week) and use the standard lead time of 2. This sets the base stock targeted at (1+2)*100 = 300 units.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (2019/03/18). The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt. Looking at the history, the demand samples are: 76, 64, 73, 53, 65 (pre-game) and 96, 102, 119, 82, 65 (Periods 1-5). There was a clear surge in Periods 1-3 (avg ~105) compared to the pre-game mean (~66), which has since settled back towards ~70-80 in Periods 4-5. The order from Period 1 (81 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting it is likely a lost shipment. The order from Period 2 arrived on Period 4 (Lead Time = 2). The order from Period 3 (134 units) was expected in Period 5 but did not arrive; it is currently 1 period overdue but still 'In-transit'. I will stick with the promised Lead Time (L=2) as one delivery was on time. For demand (mu_hat), the recent fluctuation suggests using a slightly shorter window to capture the post-surge levels while still accounting for the higher volatility seen recently. I'll use N=5 for both mu and sigma to weight the actual game history over the pre-game samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic cotton T-shirt, which typically has stable demand, but we are currently seeing high volatility and stockouts. Historical demand (pre-game) averaged 66, while in-game demand (Periods 1-6) has averaged 86.6, suggesting a higher demand regime in early 2019. Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 2's order arrived in 2 periods, while Period 5's order arrived in 1 period. Period 1 and Period 3 orders are notably absent (Period 1 is definitely lost; Period 3 is now overdue). With only 18 units on-hand and 263 in-transit, we are vulnerable if the in-transit units (especially the large P3 order) don't arrive soon. I will set L to 'calculate' to incorporate the variable lead times and use recent_N=6 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher in-game average (~87/period) compared to the pre-game samples, while maintaining a default sigma to account for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: In-game average (P1-P6) is 87 units/period vs pre-game average of 66. Period 1 shipment (81 units) is confirmed lost. Lead time is variable (observed 1 and 2 periods).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), the SKU 685816002 (Cotton Round-necked T-shirt) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Looking at history, demand has averaged 83 units/period (P1-P7), significantly higher than the pre-game average of 66. The Period 1 order (81 units) is confirmed lost as it is 5 periods overdue. Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods, while Period 5 order arrived in 1 period. Period 3 (ordered 134) and Period 4 (ordered 40) are still in-transit. Period 3 is now 4 periods overdue, suggesting it may also be lost. To recover from the current stockout and account for the high demand (83 units/period) and volatile lead times, I am setting L=2 (promised) but will use recent demand (N=7) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation covers at least 3 periods of the higher observed demand (249 units total) to replenish inventory effectively.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 3 shipment (134 units) is likely lost (now 4 periods overdue). Historical demand (P1-P7) remains elevated at 83 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $874.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, demand spiked to 128 units, likely driven by the start of April/Spring season for t-shirts. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 271, but this includes potentially lost shipments from Period 1 (81 units) and Period 3 (134 units). Excluding these likely lost units, the reliable pipeline is only 54 units (ordered in Period 8 and 9). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are 1 or 2 periods. To recover from stockouts and account for the seasonal demand increase, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) at a forecasted rate of ~100 units/period (reflecting the recent spike and seasonal relevance of basic t-shirts). This will trigger an order to cover the current deficit and build safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed in April: Period 8 demand reached 128 (+50% over game avg). Reliability of pipeline is low; Period 1 (81 units) and Period 3 (134 units) are confirmed as lost after 8 and 6 periods respectively.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (April 15). Demand context: April show a significant demand spike (P8: 128, P9: 100), averaging 114 units/period compared to the pre-April game average of 83. The product is a basic T-shirt, which typically sees increased demand as weather warms. Inventory Situation: On-hand is 0. Pipeline reliability remains a major concern: P1 (81 units) and P3 (134 units) are confirmed lost. P4 (40 units ordered on 3/4) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost as well. The current 'In-transit' of 384 units includes these likely dead units (81+134+40=255 lost). Setting L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P6 and P7) arrived in 1-2 periods. I am setting mu_hat to 360 using 'explicit' because (1+L)*avg_demand (3*120) accounts for the current April demand level. This higher base stock target will help the OR engine trigger new orders to compensate for the lost pipeline which is artificially inflating the 'In-transit' figure used in the backend subtraction (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline).

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 4 shipment (40 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods overdue). April demand is averaging 114 units/period, a ~35% increase over the Mar/Feb average of 83.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late April (2019/4/22). History shows a demand spike starting in April (P8-P10: 128, 100, 90; average 106) compared to the March average (~68). Inventory reliability is a major concern: orders from P1 (81 units), P3 (134 units), and P4 (40 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 255 units in the 'In-transit' figure that will never arrive. The actual 'living' pipeline consists only of the P10 order (64 units). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (average 1.5). With only 39 units on hand and 255 phantom units in the pipeline calculation, the OR engine's capped policy will under-order unless we adjust. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the April regime (N=3) and set lead time to 2 to be conservative against volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the increased variance seen in the last 6 periods (including the spike and the drop).

Carry-over insight: April demand regime confirmed: Avg demand (P8-P10) is 106 units/period vs pre-April avg of 77 (+37%). Pipeline reliability is poor: 255 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and distort pipeline inventory calculations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/04/29) context: Demand has surged in April, with the most recent Period 11 demand hitting a peak of 158 units. The average demand for the April regime (P8-P11) is 119 units, significantly higher than the pre-April average of 77. Inventory management is complicated by significant pipeline distortion: shipments from P1 (81 units), P3 (134 units), and P4 (40 units) are confirmed lost (totalling 255 units). Although 'In-transit' shows 359 units, only 104 units (ordered P10 and P11) are likely to arrive. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will set L to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals show lead times of 1-2 periods. I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 357 (based on (1+L=3) * April average of 119) to ensure the base stock levels are calculated against the recent surge. To account for the lost orders distorting the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, I must use an explicit value or a high sigma to force an order; however, since the OR engine subtracts (total_in_transit) from the base_stock, and total_in_transit (359) already exceeds a typical base_stock, the OR engine will order 0 unless I compensate. To fix this, I utilize the 'explicit' mu_hat at a high enough level to trigger a purchase and use a high sigma_hat of 120 (approx 40% of mean) to account for volatility and the risk of further lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: April/Spring surge confirmed: Mean demand increased from 77 to 119 (+54%) between P8-P11, peaking at 158 in P11. Cumulative lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) total 255 units, which artificially inflates 'In-transit' totals used by the OR backend.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), the SKU (Round-necked T-shirt) is exhibiting a sustained spring/summer demand surge. The average demand from Periods 8-12 is 121 units/period, compared to the pre-April average of 77 units. Recent demand samples are [128, 100, 90, 158, 129]. I will use N=5 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (avg ~1.5). Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 555 units is severely inflated because orders from Period 1 (81 units), Period 3 (134 units), and Period 4 (40 units) are confirmed lost (total 255 units). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory = In-transit' to calculate orders, I must use 'explicit' methods to bypass this. My target base stock must cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 and mean demand=121, \u03bc_hat should be ~363. To account for the 255 lost units that the OR backend incorrectly thinks are coming, I will set mu_hat to 618 (363 + 255). This forces the backend to place a physical order despite the Ghost inventory. Sigma_hat is set to cover the high volatility observed in the recent 5 samples (std dev ~27, sqrt(1+L)*std ~47).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) total 255 units. These units will never arrive and must be compensated for by increasing mu_hat in the OR parameters to prevent perpetual stockouts caused by inflated pipeline inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (May 13). The SKU '685816002' (Men's Cotton T-shirt) is in a high-demand spring regime (Avg P8-P13 \u2248 115 units/period). On-hand inventory is 0. The current In-transit (pipeline) is 655 units, but 255 of those units (Orders from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The OR backend uses 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)'. If we use the default mu_hat, the backend sees 655 in-transit vs a base stock of ~350, resulting in a 0 order and perpetual stockouts. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on dynamic demand (115 units/period * (L+1)=3 periods = 345 units) and add the 255 lost units back into the requirement to neutralize their impact on the pipeline subtraction. mu_hat = 345 + 255 = 600. Lead time remains variable (1-2 periods), so I use 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation persists: 255 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, requiring mu_hat to be offset by +255 to allow the OR backend to place orders.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (May 20), we are managing a T-shirt SKU during the spring/early summer season. Demand has shifted higher since April, with the last 7 periods (P8-P14) averaging 118 units, compared to the pre-April average of 87. Most critically, 255 units from early orders (P1: 81, P3: 134, P4: 40) are confirmed lost, as they have not arrived despite passing the 2-period lead time by 10+ weeks. These units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count, which suppresses new ordering (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline). To force the OR backend to place orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1)=3 period window using the current demand regime (118 * 3 = 354) and then add the 255 'phantom' units as an offset (354 + 255 = 609). This ensures the backend sees a requirement that actually triggers procurement. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1-2 periods), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture the higher volatility seen in the spring demand spike.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late May. Demand has shifted higher during the spring/May period (avg ~124 units/period from P11-P15 compared to ~83 units/period in Feb/March). On-hand inventory is 0 after P15. The 'In-transit' count is 619, but this includes 255 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost. The remaining 364 units in pipeline are from P13 (140), P14 (23), and P15 (137). Order P13 (placed P13, L=2) should have arrived during P15 and be visible now, but 'Period 15 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests P13 (140 units) is either delayed or also lost. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 255 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order. Using an explicit mu_hat that covers the forecast (3 periods at ~130 units = 390) plus the 255-unit liability (total 645) is necessary to ensure the backend sees a need for stock despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 13 shipment (140 units) is at least 1 period overdue (placed P13, expected arrival P15) and may be lost, further complicating pipeline reliability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 is currently in a state of rolling stockouts due to high demand and significant pipeline integrity issues. Total demand in the most recent 3 periods (P14-P16) averaged 152 units, compared to the early-game average of ~80. The 'In-transit' total of 720 units is severely inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1 (81), 3 (134), and 4 (40), totaling 255 units. Additionally, the Period 13 order (140 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P13, expected P15, current P17), bringing the likely total of actual lost or indefinitely delayed inventory to 395 units. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock; since 395 of those 720 units will never arrive, the backend will under-order or stop ordering entirely unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these ghost units. To restore ordering and meet the current demand regime of ~150 units/period for the (L+1)=3 period coverage window, I am setting mu_hat to 850 (approx 3 * 150 + 400 lost units). I use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bypass the backend's reliance on the corrupted pipeline inventory and historical averages that don't reflect the current surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Cumulative lost/severely overdue shipments now estimated at 395 units (P1: 81, P3: 134, P4: 40, P13: 140). Demand regime for late May/early June is confirmed at ~150 units/period, a significant increase from the April avg of 114.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10th), the T-shirt category is experiencing a significant early summer surge. Demand over the last three concluded periods (P15-P17) has averaged 160 units/period (148, 175, 158). The item has a profit of $19 and a holding cost of $1, yielding a critical ratio of 0.95, which requires a high service level. The primary operational challenge is the high volume of lost/dead pipeline inventory. Confirmed lost shipments include: P1 (81), P3 (134), P4 (40), and now P13 (140), totaling 395 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (711 units) but will never arrive. Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders, these 395 phantom units prevent the system from placing sufficient replenishment orders. To counteract this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Expected_Demand + Lost_Pipeline_Correction. With L=2 (promised) and current demand at 160, the expected demand over (1+L) periods is 480. Adding the 395-unit correction results in an explicit mu_hat of 875. This allows the backend to 'see' through the dead inventory data and maintain stock for the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed: P15-P17 avg demand is 160 units/period (+40% over April avg). Total confirmed lost shipments reached 395 units (P1, P3, P4, P13), requiring a permanent mu_hat offset for the remainder of the game.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), we are in a high-demand summer regime. Historical demand over the last 4 periods (P15-P18) averages 149.5 units/period (148, 175, 158, 117). However, the critical issue is significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Shipments from Period 1 (81 units), Period 3 (134 units), Period 4 (40 units), and Period 13 (140 units) have not arrived and are confirmed or highly likely lost. This totals 395 units that 'In-transit' displays (887 total) but which will never arrive. The OR backend calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). To force the backend to place necessary orders, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this 395-unit error. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the 'stock-up-to' level needs to cover 3 periods (L+1). Expected demand for 3 periods at 150/period is 450. Adding the 395-unit offset to compensate for lost inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 845. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-2 periods), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost/ghost inventory confirmed at 395 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). Period 13 shipment is now 5 periods past order date (promised 2) and is classified as lost. Demand for June remains strong, averaging ~150 units/period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for T-shirts (Ronny Reg RN) is in a sustained high-demand summer regime. The most recent demand (P17-P19) shows an average of ~130 units/period, following a higher peak in P16-P17. However, the critical issue remains 'ghost' inventory: confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1 (81), 3 (134), 4 (40), and 13 (140) total 395 units. These 395 units are included in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation (733 units) but will never arrive. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must apply a corrective offset to mu_hat. Following the logic of previous periods: Target mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (1+L)) + Lost Units. With L=2 and expected weekly demand ~140, the core mu_hat is 420. Adding the 395 lost units results in a total mu_hat of 815. I set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns. Ghost inventory remains at 395 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). Summer demand remains the dominant regime.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21 (2019/7/1). Demand for this 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt remains high during the summer regime, averaging 141 units/period over the last 5 weeks (N=5). The 'In-transit' figure (829 units) is significantly inflated by 395 units of confirmed/highly likely lost shipments (P1: 81, P3: 134, P4: 40, P13: 140). Because the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory from its base stock calculation (final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory), it will fail to place sufficient orders unless we offset the mean demand. Expected demand for (L+1) periods (where L=2) is 141 * 3 = 423 units. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 395 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to 818 (423 + 395). This forces the backend to recognize the immediate need for stock while treating the lost units as satisfied demand that will never arrive. I use sigma_hat from the recent high-demand regime to maintain a 95% service level.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the SKU '685816002' (a men's basic T-shirt) is in a high-demand summer regime. Over the last five periods (P17-P21), the average demand is 141 units/period. The current stock status is 0 On-hand, with 908 units \u2018In-transit\u2019. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 395 units are confirmed lost (P1: 81, P3: 134, P4: 40, P13: 140). This 'ghost inventory' artificially inflates the pipeline, preventing the OR backend from placing necessary orders. Additionally, the P17 order (229 units) is now one period overdue; given the history of losses, this is a concern, but we focus on the confirmed 395 units. To counteract the 395 units of ghost inventory and ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value. The calculation is: (1 + Lead Time) * Mean Demand + Ghost Inventory. With L=2, mean demand ~140, and ghost inventory of 395, the value is (3 * 140) + 395 = 815. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility (N=5).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 (T-shirt) is in a high-demand summer regime. Over the last 5 periods (P18-P22), demand has averaged 133 units/period. The major challenge is the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Shipments from P1 (81), P3 (134), P4 (40), and P13 (140) are confirmed lost, totaling 395 units that still appear in 'In-transit' (currently 812), but will never arrive. This inflation prevents the OR backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) from triggering necessary orders. To counteract this, I set mu_hat using 'explicit' to incorporate the current demand forecast for the L+1 window (3 periods * ~135 units = 405) plus an offset to neutralize the 395 lost units. Total mu_hat = 405 + 395 = 800. Additionally, I am using a recent_N sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in the summer months.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/22 (Period 24). Historical demand in the summer regime (June/July) remains robust, averaging ~130 units/period. The pipeline inventory is severely distorted by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1: 81, P3: 134, P4: 40, P13: 140), totaling 395 units. These 395 units are included in the 'In-transit' count of 799 but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend (which uses base_stock - pipeline_inventory) actually places orders, I must artificially inflate the demand parameter (mu_hat). Calculation: Anticipated demand per lead-time cycle (L+1=3) is ~130 * 3 = 390. To offset the 395 units of ghost inventory that the backend thinks are coming, I must set mu_hat to approximately 785 (390 + 395). This allows the system to correctly target a real inventory position that covers actual demand while ignoring the lost units. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to capture recent volatility during this peak season without overreacting to individual spikes.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25 (late July). Historical performance shows a summer demand regime (June-July) averaging approximately 120 units per period. The product is a basic jersey T-shirt, which remains relevant through summer. The pipeline is heavily distorted by 4 confirmed 'ghost' or lost shipments: P1 (81), P3 (134), P4 (40), and P13 (140), totaling 395 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (864) but will never arrive, causing the OR backend to underestimate the need for new orders. To compensate, I must increase the mu_hat parameter. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to incorporate both the forecasted demand (approx 125 units/period over 3 periods, L+1) and the 395-unit offset to bypass the ghost inventory. Calculation: (125 * 3) + 395 = 770. Lead time remains approximately 2 periods, but I will use the 'calculate' method to allow the backend to use the actual observed history. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent variance in the summer regime (approx 30-40 units) to maintain high service levels (profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 19:1).

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns. Ghost inventory remains at 395 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). July demand shows a stabilizing trend around 100-120 units, slightly lower than the June peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26. Historical analysis indicates a persistent issue with 'ghost inventory' \u2013 shipments from P1 (81 units), P3 (134 units), P4 (40 units), and P13 (140 units) totaling 395 units are essentially lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure (876 units). These 395 units must be offset in our order calculation. Demand in July (P21-P25) has stabilized after the June peak, averaging approximately 99 units/period (137, 118, 102, 82, 56). However, the late July dip (82 and 56) may be seasonal or due to stockouts affecting behavior. Given the 1-period observation delay and the 2-period promised lead time, we use recent_N=5 for demand (avg ~99) and lead time calculation. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 395 units of ghost inventory, I am setting an explicit mu_hat. Base Stock = (1+L)*demand + safety_stock. With L=2, demand=99, and a ghost inventory of 395, we need the OR backend's target base stock to be at least (3 * 99) + 395 + safety_stock to trigger a replenishment order. I am setting mu_hat to 720 (approx 105 daily demand * 3 periods + 395 offset + 10 safety) to ensure we bridge the gap created by lost shipments and maintain availability for the upcoming August period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Lead times continue to be highly unreliable, with the Period 23 order arriving after 3 periods instead of the promised 2. A critical systemic issue is the accumulation of 395 'ghost' units in the pipeline (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P13) which are confirmed lost but still count towards the OR backend's pipeline inventory, preventing normal replenishment. To force the OR backend to order, mu_hat must be set using an 'explicit' value that incorporates both the current demand forecast and an offset for the ghost inventory. Demand has stabilized post-summer peak; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is 88 units. Applying L=2 (promised), mu_hat should ideally cover (1+L) periods, which is 3 * 88 = 264 units. Adding the 395 unit offset to bypass ghost inventory gives an explicit mu_hat of 659. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent ghost inventory total remains at 395 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). August demand regime has shifted lower, averaging 88 units/period (P22-P26) compared to the June peak of ~150.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand for August (P24-P27) is averaging 82 units/period, showing a significant decline from the June peak (~150). There is a persistent 'ghost' inventory of 395 units (P1, P3, P4, P13) that have never arrived and likely never will. This inflated 'In-transit' figure prevents the OR backend from ordering. To compensate, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory. With L=2, the target demand coverage for 3 periods at ~82 units/period is 246. Adding the 395 ghost units brings mu_hat to 641. Since we are in a declining demand regime, I used a recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect the lower current volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the SKU '685816002' (t-shirt) is in a post-summer demand regime. Recent demand (P24-P28) has averaged 88.6 units/period, showing a cooling trend from the June peak (~150). However, the critical issue is 'ghost inventory'. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 798 units. Based on historical analysis, 395 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13). Furthermore, recent orders from P24 (65 units), P26 (0 units), and P27 (0 units) are absent, and the pipeline is dominated by the massive P17 order (229 units) which is now 12 periods overdue and also appears lost. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its calculated 'base_stock' to determine the order quantity. If 'In-transit' is artificially high due to lost shipments, the system will never order, leading to perpetual stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). To force the backend to place an order, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the expected demand for (L+1) periods PLUS a massive offset of 650 units. This offset accounts for the 395 confirmed lost units plus the likely-lost P17 order (229 units), totaling ~624 units. I set mu_hat = (3 periods * 90 units/period) + 650 = 920. This allows the backend to overcome the ghost inventory 'block' and replenish the stock for the end-of-summer/early-fall period.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inflation update: The P17 order (229 units) is now 12 periods overdue (promised 2) and is classified as lost. Total ghost inventory is now estimated at 624 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). mu_hat must be offset by approximately +650 to ensure ordering resumes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 1016 units in-transit. However, 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) has reached a critical level. As of Period 30, the confirmed lost units include: P1 (81), P3 (134), P4 (40), P13 (140), and now P17 (229). Total ghost inventory = 624 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 1016 in-transit from the calculated base stock. To trigger a new order and prevent further stockouts, mu_hat must be set to cover (expected demand during L+1) + (ghost inventory). Recent demand (P24-P29) has stabilized around an average of 93 units/period. For L=2, expected demand over 3 periods is ~279 units. Adding the 624 lost units results in a required base stock of approx 903. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 900 will ensure the pipeline subtraction (1016) is partially offset, allowing the system to maintain a flow of fresh inventory despite the massive pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inflation update at Period 30: Total ghost inventory (confirmed lost/severely overdue shipments) has reached 624 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). This requires a large mu_hat offset (approx +630) to bypass OR backend logic and maintain product flow.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline (orders P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17), which totals 624 units. These units are confirmed lost or severely overdue (up to 29 periods), but they still inflate the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. To bypass the base-stock policy's logic (which subtracts pipeline inventory from the target stock), I must continue to apply a massive offset to mu_hat. Current demand in late August/early September (P26-P30) has stabilized around an average of 97 units/period. The target base stock should ideally cover (L+1) periods of demand, approximately 3 * 97 = 291 units. To force an order when the pipeline shows 1016 units (including the 624 ghost units), the target mu_hat must exceed (1016 + desired order). I will use mu_hat explicit value of 1150 (roughly 1000 ghost/recent transit + 150 for immediate needs) to ensure product flow resumes as autumn approaches. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability (1-3 periods) observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed at 624 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). These units never arrived and permanently inflate the In-transit total. September demand regime is steady at ~95 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation is dominated by a substantial amount of 'ghost inventory' - orders that were placed but never arrived, which permanently inflate the 'In-transit' total visible to the OR backend. As of Period 32, this ghost inventory is estimated at 624 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17). Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (In-transit) from its calculated base stock to determine order quantities, this inflation prevents the system from placing necessary orders. To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat (the expected demand over the lead time + review period) significantly higher than actual demand to offset this 624-unit error. Current demand is stabilized around 90-100 units. I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 920, calculated as (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory \u2248 (100 * 3) + 624 = 924. This ensures the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the ghost inventory. L is maintained at 'calculate' and sigma_hat at 'default' as the primary issue is the mean shift caused by the pipeline error.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand has stabilized in a post-summer regime, with recent samples (P31-P32) showing 79 and 59 units, and an August/September average of approximately 85-90 units. Significant 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) continues to inflate the In-transit total. Specifically, orders from P1 (81), P3 (134), P4 (40), P13 (140), and P17 (229) totaling 624 units are confirmed lost/overdue by many weeks. The OR backend uses (Inventory + In-transit) to calculate orders; since In-transit is artificially high by 624 units, the 'mu_hat' must be offset to include this ghost volume so the backend continues ordering. Forecasted weekly demand is ~85 units. With L=2, the required coverage is 3 periods of demand (~255 units). To override the 624 ghost units in the backend's base_stock calculation (mu_hat - (OH + InTransit)), I set mu_hat to approximately 910 (255 actual + 655 offset) using the explicit method. This ensures the backend perceives a need for fresh stock despite the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stabilized at ~85 units/period (P29-P32 avg: 82). Ghost inventory is fixed at 624 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime compared to the summer peak. The average demand for the most recent 10 periods (P24-P33) is approximately 90 units/period. The primary challenge is the significant 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) that never arrived but remain in the In-transit total. Based on Carry-over Insights, we have 624 units confirmed as lost: P1 (81), P3 (134), P4 (40), P13 (140), and P17 (229). Current In-transit is 1016. Subtracting the ghost inventory (624) gives an effective pipeline of 392 units. To prevent the OR engine from stopping orders due to this inflated In-transit count, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' and include an offset. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (1+L) * Forecast Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2 and Forecast=90, Base Stock would be ~300-350. However, because the backend logic is 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)', we must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 624 phantom units. I am setting mu_hat to 950 (Approx 325 real target + 624 ghost units) to ensure the system realizes we need to order more as the 392 legitimate in-transit units arrive or are consumed.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a critical 'ghost inventory' challenge: 624 units are permanently stuck in 'In-transit' (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17) and will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from its target base stock, it will not place new orders unless the target exceeds the ghost inventory + on-hand inventory. Currently, on-hand is 0 and In-transit is 1016. Recent demand (P29-P34) has stabilized around 91 units per period. To force the OR backend to place an order, mu_hat must be set to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the inflated pipeline. Given L=2 and target service level is high (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), the target stock should be approximately (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock. With 3 periods of demand at ~95 units, the base stock would normally be ~350. To overcome the 1016 In-transit units, I must set mu_hat significantly higher. I will set mu_hat to 1250 to ensure an order of approximately 200-250 units is generated to recover from the current stockout.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 is facing significant supply chain disruption. In-transit inventory stands at 1312 units, but a large portion is 'ghost inventory' (lost or severely overdue): shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17 total 624 units. Additionally, the P29 order (218 units) is now 6 periods overdue (promised 2), increasing suspected lost units to 842. The OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the base stock; to force an order when on-hand is 0, mu_hat must be set to exceed the (In-transit - Lost) threshold. Current demand is stabilized around 90-100 units (P31-P35 avg: 85 units). Using 'explicit' mu_hat helps bypass the logic bottleneck. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*100 units + 842 (offset) \u2248 1142. L is set to explicit 2 as recent arrivals (P31) suggest a return to promised lead time if shipments actually arrive.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inflation update at Period 36: Period 29 order (218 units) is 4 periods overdue beyond promised lead time and is likely lost. Total confirmed ghost inventory reaches approximately 842 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P29).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685816002 is currently facing a significant inventory management challenge due to 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. As of Period 37, the total In-transit inventory is 1016 units. Based on historical data, 842 of these units are confirmed lost or severely overdue (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P29). These units will likely never arrive but remain in the backend's 'pipeline' calculation, preventing new orders from being placed. Current demand has stabilized in a lower autumn regime, with demand in Period 36 dropping to 33 units, though the September/October average is closer to 80-90 units. With 263 units on-hand, we have enough stock for ~3 periods of demand at the current rate. To ensure the OR backend continues to order when this stock depletes, I must set mu_hat (demand across L+1 periods) high enough to offset the 842 ghost units. I calculate the target mu_hat as: Expected Demand (approx 90 units/period * 3 periods = 270) + Ghost Inventory Offset (842) \u2248 1112. Using method 'explicit' for mu_hat ensures the backend ignores its own (incorrect) pipeline logic and places orders based on this adjusted threshold. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for recent demand volatility (33 to 117 range).

Carry-over insight: In-transit inflation update at Period 37: Confirmed ghost inventory (lost/severely overdue) is 842 units (P1: 81, P3: 134, P4: 40, P13: 140, P17: 229, P29: 218). Demand is now in an autumn low-regime, averaging ~85 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand is in an autumn low-regime, with the most recent sample at 51 units and a 4-period average (P34-P37) of 69 units/period. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) totaling 842 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P29). These lost units reside in the 'In-transit' figure of 1096, creating a false pipeline of 842 units. Subtracting these, the true pipeline consists of orders from P35 (arrived) and P37 (80 units). To bypass the OR engine's logic (which subtracts the inflated pipeline from the base stock), mu_hat must be set to the true expected demand PLUS the ghost inventory. I'm using a target cycle-stock of roughly 2.5 periods of demand (approx 175 units) and adding the 842 ghost offset. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current low-regime volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering November (Period 39). Historical demand for the last few periods (P36-P38) has trended lower, averaging approx 50 units/period, down from the September/October average of 85. 'On-hand' inventory is currently 224 units, which covers over 4 periods of recent demand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1016 is severely inflated by 'ghost inventory' from multiple lost shipments. Based on the cumulative record, shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 17, and 29 are confirmed lost or significantly overdue, totaling 842 units (81+134+40+140+229+218). This inflation prevents the OR backend's capped policy from triggerring new orders. To maintain product flow for the remainder of the game and compensate for the 842 units of 'stuck' pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for (1+L) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory offset. With L=1 and expected demand ~60, mu_hat = (2 * 60) + 842 \u2248 962. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inflation update at Period 39: Cumulative ghost inventory (confirmed lost/severely overdue) remains 842 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P29). November demand regime shows a further seasonal slowdown, averaging ~50-60 units/period.

The critical challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' from 6 confirmed lost/severely overdue shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P29) totaling 842 units. These units permanently inflate the 'In-transit' count (currently 1016), preventing the OR backend from placing necessary orders unless compensated for. Current on-hand is 161. To ensure we have enough stock for the forecast period (L+1 = 3 periods) despite the ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock by taking the current demand forecast (approx 55 units/period) for 3 periods (~165) and adding the 842 offset to bypass the ghost inventory check, totaling 1007. This ensures that if on-hand + in-transit (actual + ghost) drops below ~1000, the system will order. Given the current inventory levels (On-hand 161 + In-transit 1016 = 1177), no order will be triggered this period, which is appropriate given the 161 on-hand units and low demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late-November seasonal low. Recent demand (P38-P40) is averaging ~60 units/period, significantly lower than the Summer/Autumn peaks. Currently, on-hand inventory is 113 units, which provides nearly 2 periods of cover at current demand levels. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1016 units is severely inflated by ghost inventory. This ghost inventory is composed of confirmed lost/overdue shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, and P29, totaling 842 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing a massive pipeline and stopping all orders (which could lead to a stockout as on-hand depletes), I must set mu_hat to offset this inflation. Using an explicit mu_hat of ~1020 ((1+L) * demand + ghost_inventory) ensures the system 'sees' a need to maintain the current stock levels. Given the seasonal downturn and existing on-hand stock, a conservative ordering posture is preferred, but the priority is bypassing the pipeline logic.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand is in a seasonal trough, averaging ~55 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P37-P41), down from the ~85 unit average seen in September/October. Total ghost inventory (confirmed lost or severely overdue shipments) has reached 842 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P29). These lost units artificially inflate the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. With on-hand inventory at 58 and real In-transit at 0 (since all 1016 units except for potential recent arrivals are accounted for as ghost stock), the system will not order unless mu_hat is offset to mask the ghost inventory. To trigger an order that covers the next 3 periods of demand (~165 units) while accounting for the 842-unit inflation, I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 1150 (approx 842 + 3 * 100). This provides enough buffer to resume ordering as on-hand is nearly depleted. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed average of ~1.5 periods (mostly 1 and 2).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 43 (Dec 2, 2019). Demand in Period 42 spiked significantly to 207 units, likely due to a seasonal/Black Friday event, which exhausted all 58 units of on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 1167 is heavily inflated by 842 units of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, and P29). Subtracting this ghost inventory reveals a functional pipeline of 325 units (the P42 order of 151 plus other recent, potentially valid orders). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method. I am setting mu_hat to 1200, which accounts for (1+L) periods of demand plus an offset to neutralize the ~842 ghost units. Demand is expected to remain high during the December holiday season, so I am forecasting a mean of ~120 units/period (360 for 3 periods), then adding the 842 offset to arrive at ~1200. Sigma_hat is set explicitly higher (150) to account for the high volatility observed in the recent 207-unit spike.

Carry-over insight: December seasonal spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 207 units. Total ghost inventory remains 842 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P29).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44, entering the second week of December. Historically, Period 42 showed a major seasonal spike (207 units). Total 'In-transit' is 1447 units, but a large portion of this is 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments. Based on history, the ghost inventory includes orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, and P29, totaling 842 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory as available stock and stopping all orders, mu_hat must be offset. Current demand is in a high-volatility December regime. I will utilize the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to account for both the expected high December demand (averaging ~130-150 across the spike/dip) and the 842-unit pipeline inflation. I set mu_hat to 1250 (approx 3 periods of 135 demand + 842 ghost units) and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure a robust safety stock during the holiday volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December). Historical patterns indicate a significant seasonal demand spike in December (observed demand of 207 in P42). Total 'In-transit' inventory is 1497 units, but a large portion consists of 'ghost inventory' (shipments that are confirmed lost or severely overdue). As of Period 43, ghost inventory was estimated at 842 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P29). We are now monitoring the P35 (296 units - arrived), P37 (80 units - arrived), and the recent P42 (151 units), P43 (280 units), and P44 (50 units) orders. The P42 order is now 1 period overdue (placed P42, expected P44). If P42 is also lost, ghost inventory increases to 993 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1497 'In-transit' units from its target inventory, it will stop ordering unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these ghost units. I will set mu_hat to approximately 1300 to account for 3 periods of expected high December/January demand (avg ~100-150) plus an offset of roughly 1000 ghost units to force the OR backend to maintain product flow during the holiday peak.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inflation update at Period 45: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost/overdue shipments) is estimated at 993 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P29 confirmed; P42 now 1 period overdue). Demand regime remains in high-volatility December seasonal peak.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late December (Period 46), approaching the end of the year and the height of a seasonal Christmas/Holiday spike. Historical Period 42 showed a demand of 207 units, and current arrivals are satisfying substantial on-hand inventory (327 units). The critical issue remains 'ghost inventory'. Total lost or significantly overdue shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P29) equal 842 units. These units are counted in 'In-transit' (1116) but will never arrive. To ensure the backend places orders despite this inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be set to a value and method that offsets this inventory. Recent demand (P42-P45) averages 114 units, but including the seasonal spike, a base demand of ~100-120 per period is appropriate. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1150 (roughly 3 periods of demand + 842 ghost units) to bypass the pipeline calculation, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility of the holiday season.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 842 units. Order P42 (151 units) and P43 (280 units) arrived in P45, confirming late-season arrivals are still occurring with 2-3 period lead times. December volatility is high (range 64-207).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final period of 2019 (Date: 2019/12/30). Current on-hand inventory is 269 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' total of 1116 units, but analysis confirms that 842 of these units are 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P29). Subtracting this ghost inventory gives a realistic pipeline of 274 units (orders from P44, P45). Total available stock (on-hand + actual pipeline) is 543 units. Recent post-holiday demand is decreasing (Period 46 demand was 58). With on-hand inventory alone covering approximately 4.5 periods of current demand, and the realistic pipeline providing even more, no new orders are necessary. However, because the OR backend's 'In-transit' value (1116) far exceeds any reasonable safety stock level, it would normally block all orders. To maintain the possibility of ordering if needed and to prevent the backend from seeing a massive surplus, I continue to use a large 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the ghost inventory, although with current stock levels, the 'cap' logic will likely result in a zero order regardless.
