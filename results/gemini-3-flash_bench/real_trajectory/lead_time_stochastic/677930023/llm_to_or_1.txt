Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'Queen Sweater', a lightweight sweatshirt. Historical demand data from early January to early February shows a significant spike in the first week (229 units) followed by a drop to a relatively stable range of 42-68 units. The initial spike on 2019-01-07 likely represents post-holiday clearance or a specific promotion. Excluding the outlier of 229, the mean demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 60.25 units. Since we are in mid-February, we are moving away from peak winter but still in sweatshirt season. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this stabilized post-spike demand level. The promised lead time is 2, and since no orders have been placed yet, I will use 'default' for L. Sigma will also be calculated using 'recent_N' (N=4) to reflect current volatility excluding the initial outlier.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Queen Sweater', a lightweight sweatshirt. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 75 units, which are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (per the L=2 definition). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to 36 lost sales in Period 1. Historical demand for January and early February shows a significant spike on 2019-01-07 (229 units) followed by a stabilized lower range (42-68 units). The most recent sample (Period 1) was 36 units. Given the transition from winter to spring in mid-February, I expect demand to remain relatively steady or slightly decline for a sweatshirt. I will use the last 4 samples (P1: 36, Feb-04: 42, Jan-28: 62, Jan-21: 68) to capture the current post-spike regime. N=4 results in a mean of 52. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. mu_hat = 3 * 52 = 156. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 4 samples to reflect recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). This is a 'Queen Sweater' (lightweight sweatshirt). Historical demand shows a downward trend from a peak of 229 in early January to 42 in early February. However, observed demand in P1 (36) and P2 (55) suggests stabilization or a slight post-winter uptick. Inventory is currently critical: On-hand is 0, and we have lost all sales in P1 and P2 because the arrival of the P1 order (lead time 2) is expected in Period 3 but only visible in P4 START. The OR backend needs to cover demand for Period 3 and Period 4 plus Lead Time buffer. Given the shift from pre-launch historical data (mean ~90) to recent performance (mean ~45), I will use recent_N to prevent over-ordering as we move further into spring, while maintaining a safety buffer. P1-P2 arrivals are pending as expected per the 2-period lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a lightweight sweater. Historical demand over the last 8 weeks (seed + active periods) has been relatively low (avg ~74). However, we are entering early March, a transitional spring period where 'lightweight sweatshirt fabric' typically sees steady demand. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (75 units) was placed on 2019-02-11; with L=2, it should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Since the P3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and that shipment is still listed in 'In-transit', it is technically 1 period late or delayed. Current in-transit is 178 (75 from P1, 78 from P2, 25 from P3). I will maintain the explicit mu_hat based on recent historical average (~90 units/week to be safe) multiplied by (1+L). I will keep L at 'calculate' to see if the backend adjusts for the delay, but I'll monitor for lost shipments next period.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a lightweight sweatshirt. Demand over the last 5 weeks (2019-02-11 to 2019-03-11) has been [36, 55, 48, 31]. Pre-start samples from January were significantly higher [229, 49, 68, 62, 42], but the last 8 observations (since mid-January) suggest a shift to a lower, stable regime after an initial spike. Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Current on-hand is 47, and in-transit is 236 (Orders from P1, P3, and P4). Period 1's order (75 units) is now at lead_time 4 and hasn't arrived, suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed; however, with a confirmed lead time of 2 for the P2 order, we will maintain the promised L=2 for now. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current stable demand environment (mean ~42.5), which is more relevant than the high January outlier.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a lightweight sweatshirt, and historical demand has fluctuated between 23 and 229, though recent weeks (last 5) show a lower average of ~45. The promised lead time is 2. Looking at history: the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2). The Period 1 order (75 units) has NOT arrived by the start of Period 6 (it should have arrived in Period 3 if L=2), suggesting it is lost. The Period 3 order (25 units) should have arrived in Period 5, but didn't, and the Period 4 order (136 units) should arrive in Period 6. Currently, on-hand is 24, and in-transit is 236 (75 from P1, 25 from P3, 136 from P4). Since P1 and P3 orders (total 100 units) appear delayed or lost, I must adjust the pipeline assumption. Transitioning into spring (mid-March), demand for 'lightweight sweatshirt fabric' is likely to remain stable or slightly decrease before the warmer season. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to reflect the current post-initial-spike regime. I'll maintain L=2 as the 'calculated' lead time while acknowledging the missing units in my mental pipeline audit.

Carry-over insight: Potential loss of Period 1 (75 units) and Period 3 (25 units) shipments; lead time observed at 2 periods for P2 order, but reliability is currently low.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU is a lightweight sweatshirt. Demand is trending downwards (31, 23, 20 in the last three periods) compared to the initial weeks (36, 55, 48). This suggests the post-winter/early spring transition for sweaters. Regarding lead times: the order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (L=2), consistent with promised lead time. However, Period 1 (75 units) and Period 3 (25 units) orders are significantly overdue (now 6 and 4 periods since order, respectively). I must treat these as lost shipments. Pipeline inventory currently shows 236 units (composed of Period 4: 136, Period 5: 0, Period 6: 0). Period 4's order is due to arrive this period (P7). Given the current on-hand inventory is near zero (4 units), we need to ensure the pipeline is replenished despite the lost early shipments. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the lower demand regime and 'explicit' lead time to account for the risk observed in delivery reliability, but keeping L=2 as the baseline for the OR calculation while acknowledging the losses in the rationale.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from P1 (75 units) and P3 (25 units) are confirmed lost (no arrival after 6 and 4 periods respectively). Current demand regime (P4-P6) has stabilized at a lower mean of ~25 units/period compared to the initial ~46 units/period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). Observation: On-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 7. Demand has stabilized at a lower level since Period 4 (P4: 31, P5: 23, P6: 20, P7: 21). The mean demand for this recent 'spring' regime (N=4) is 23.75 units/period, significantly lower than the initial February levels (~46 units). Shipments from Period 1 (75 units) and Period 3 (25 units) are confirmed lost as they haven't arrived within 6 and 4 periods respectively (promised L=2). The only pending arrival is the Large order from Period 4 (136 units), which is now due based on L=2 (it should arrive during Period 8). I will set L to the default (2) as the Period 2 shipment arrived on time, but I must adjust the demand forecast to the recent lower regime (N=4) to avoid over-ordering, while the OR engine manages the gap between the target base stock and the 136 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Post-Feb demand (P4-P7) mean is ~24 units/period, down from ~46 units/period (-48%).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Historically, the demand for this 'Queen Sweater' has dropped significantly from an initial mean of ~46 units/period to a stable regime of ~24 units/period (P4-P8). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 236 units in-transit. The in-transit total includes 136 units ordered in P4 (promised L=2, now at 5 periods elapsed) and 100 units from older, likely lost orders (P1 and P3). Since April is a transition out of sweater season, and we had significant stock-outs in P7-P8 due to the arrival failure of the P4 order, we must assume the lead time is currently unreliable or the P4 order is also lost. However, the OR backend's capped policy will limit ordering if we set \u03bc\u0302 too low while pipeline is high. I will set the lead time to explicit=5 to reflect the current delay of the P4 shipment and use N=5 for demand to capture the recent stable lower mean of ~23.8 units/period. This will force a replenishment order to address the current 0 on-hand status while acknowledging the likely obsolescence of the pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 4 shipment (136 units) is now 3 periods overdue (total 5 periods elapsed), indicating potential loss or severe logistics disruption. Lead time is significantly exceeding promised 2 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The item is a lightweight sweatshirt, a category that typically sees declining demand as spring progresses toward summer. The historical demand data shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-3 averaged ~46 units/period, while Period 4-9 has stabilized at a much lower mean of ~21 units/period (21.7). On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 236 units, consisting of orders from P1 (75), P3 (25), and P4 (136). The P1 and P3 orders are over 6 periods old and are confirmed lost (as per Carry-over Insights). The P4 order (136 units) is now 6 periods since placement (promised lead time: 2). While P2 arrived in 2 periods, the failure of P1, P3, and now the extreme lateness of P4 indicates a broken supply chain or lost shipments. Because 'In-transit' still counts these 236 units, the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent any new orders from being placed. To force an order and replenish stock, I will set L to 5 (reflecting the observed delay) and mu_hat to a value that accounts for the current demand regime (~22 units/period) plus a significant buffer to overcome the phantom pipeline inventory. I will use 'explicit' values to ensure the engine places an order despite the 'In-transit' bloat caused by lost/stalled units.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 4 shipment (136 units) is now 6 periods overdue (promised 2), confirming a sustained logistics failure for this SKU. Demand has further stabilized at ~22 units/period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (Queen Sweater) is experiencing a severe logistics failure. Three shipments (Period 1: 75 units, Period 3: 25 units, and Period 4: 136 units) are now critically overdue and confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed based on the history where the only successful arrival was from Period 2 with a lead time of 2 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory of 236 units is entirely composed of these lost shipments. Consequently, the OR backend's 'cap' and 'base_stock' calculations will be suppressed by this phantom inventory (pipeline). Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 21.6 units per period since Period 5 (post-winter seasonality for a lightweight sweater). To force the system to order and restore service, I am setting L to 10 to reflect the actual delayed state, while using an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the backend perceives a need for new stock despite the 236 'in-transit' units. mu_hat is set to 260 (covering 11 periods of demand at ~23 units/period plus safety stock), which should exceed the pipeline value slightly to trigger a small replenishment order if the cap allows.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 4 (136 units) is now 7 periods overdue; total 'phantom' pipeline inventory is 236 units. Logistics reliability is near zero for this SKU.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (Queen Sweater) is experiencing significant supply chain failure. Shipments from P1 (75 units), P3 (25 units), and P4 (136 units) are lost or severely delayed (8, 6, and 5 periods overdue respectively). The 'In-transit' count of 272 is largely 'phantom' inventory (236 units). Only the P11 order (36 units) is potentially viable. Demand spiked to 131 in P11 (late April), likely due to a seasonal clearance or a specific late-spring event, deviates from the previous mean of ~22. We must ignore the phantom pipeline to trigger new orders. I set L=explicit (3) to account for the reliability issues, mu_hat=explicit to cover the recent demand spike and expected pipeline replenishment, and sigma_hat=explicit to reflect high volatility and lost orders.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in P11 (131 units), breaking the previous stable regime of ~22 units/period. Logistics reliability remains extremely low with 236 out of 272 in-transit units confirmed overdue/lost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces two severe challenges: a significant spike in demand starting in Period 11 (demand jumped from ~22 to 131, then 179 in P12) and catastrophic logistics failures. The 'In-transit' quantity of 508 units is misleadingly high because 236 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost or indefiniteley delayed, leaving only 272 potentially active units. Specifically, the P11 order (36 units) is expected to arrive in P13 (this period) and the P12 order (236 units) in P14, assuming a 2-period lead time. However, current demand levels (131, 179) suggest a total demand across the (L+1=3) period window of approximately 450-540 units. Since 508 total units are in-transit and 236 are likely phantom, the 'real' pipeline is only 272. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the new high-demand regime (avg ~155/period) and setting a conservative sigma_hat. I am keeping L at 'default' (2) to reflect the promised window, but the lead time reliability remains a high-risk factor that necessitates high base stock settings to trigger substantial replenishment orders.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand spike confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~22 to ~155 (+600%) starting Period 11. Logistics reliability remains critical: 236 units of the current 508 in-transit units are from Periods 1, 3, and 4 and are confirmed lost/undeliverable.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 occurs during a significant demand spike that began in Period 11 (May seasonality for 'Queen Sweater'). Demand in P11 (131), P12 (179), and P13 (70) confirms a high-demand regime, though P13 suggests the absolute peak might be passing. The logistics reliability remains poor: P1 (75), P3 (25), and P4 (136) orders are confirmed lost (total 236 units 'phantom' pipeline). The P11 order (36 units) arrived on time (L=2), providing a recent valid data point for lead time. Moving into P14, on-hand is 0. The true pipeline inventory is 243 units (479 in-transit minus 236 lost). mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 3 to capture the spike regime (avg ~127). sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the high volatility seen during this spike (std dev of 131, 179, 70 is approx 55, and sqrt(1+L) * 55 \u2248 95).

Carry-over insight: P11 order arrival confirms that lead time remains 2 periods for operational shipments, despite the heavy loss rate for early-period shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/20. The product is a lightweight sweatshirt (Queen Sweater). We are in a high-demand regime that started around Period 11. Although Period 14 demand dropped to 50, the preceding three periods (131, 179, 70) indicate a significantly higher baseline than the earlier spring baseline of ~22 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this new elevated mean of approximately 107.5 units/period. Regarding logistics, we have confirmed that orders from Periods 1 (75 units), 3 (25 units), and 4 (136 units) are lost, totaling 236 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Current 'In-transit' is 243 units, which means 236 are lost and only 7 (ordered in Period 13) are live. I will use 'explicit' lead time (L=2) and set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (1+L) periods of demand while ignoring the phantom inventory. I want to target a base stock reflecting the high demand regime (~107 x 3 = 321). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that compensates for the 236 units it *thinks* are coming but aren't. Target Base Stock = 321. OR engine calculation: Base Stock - In-transit. If I set mu_hat to 557 (321 actual target + 236 phantom), the OR engine will order approximately 321 + 236 - 243 - 186 = 128 units to recover the stock position.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, moving into June. Historically, demand for this 'Queen Sweater' showed a significant spike in Periods 11-13 (Late April/Early May), followed by a cool-down in Period 14 (50 units) and Period 15 (21 units). This suggests the peak season for this lightweight sweatshirt is ending as summer approaches. Logistics reconciliation: Total in-transit is 457 units. However, orders from P1 (75), P3 (25), and P4 (136) are confirmed lost/overdue (total 236 'phantom' units). The operational pipeline contains the P13 order (7 units) and P15 order (214 units). Since lead time for operational shipments is confirmed at 2 units (based on P11 and P12 arrivals), the P13 order should arrive this period (P16) and the P15 order in P17. Given the current on-hand of 165 and the large P15 order coming next period, the system is well-covered for the current low-demand regime. Using recent_N=5 for demand captures the recent volatility and the subsequent drop, preventing over-ordering at the end of a seasonal peak while accounting for the high loss rate in the pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/03), we are managing SKU 677930023. Analysis shows demand has cooled significantly following a major spike in late April/early May (Periods 11-13). The last three periods (P14-P16) show demand of 50, 21, and 24, indicating a return to a lower demand regime, likely below the P11-P13 peak of ~126/week. The current mean for the last 6 periods (P11-P16) is approx. 79 units. Regarding logistics, the promised lead time remains 2 periods, and recent successful arrivals (P11 order arriving in P13, P12 order in P14) confirm that operational shipments now adhere to this 2-period lead time. However, 236 units from P1, P3, and P4 remain lost. Total 'In-transit' is 457, but 236 are 'phantom' stock, leaving 221 real units in the pipeline (specifically the 7 units from P13 and 214 from P15). With 141 units on-hand and 221 viable units in-transit, we are well-covered for the current lower demand trend. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the post-spike stabilization while maintaining protection against the recent volatility, and set sigma_hat to default to account for the overall high variance seen in May.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-spike (P14-P16) has stabilized at a lower mean of ~32 units/period, significantly lower than the P11-P13 peak of ~126 units/period.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Queen Sweater' is currently in Period 18 (June 10). Significant seasonal demand has passed, with demand now stabilizing at a lower post-spike mean. In the last three periods (P15-P17), demand has been 21, 24, and 8, averaging ~18 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 347 units, which is extremely high relative to this current demand levels (covering nearly 20 periods). The pipeline inventory of 243 units consists largely of 'phantom' inventory from early-period losses (P1: 75, P3: 25, P4: 136, total 236 units), meaning the true operational pipeline is only 7 units (ordered P13). Since inventory is severely bloated, no new orders are desired. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent decline, while default L and sigma_hat are used as the system's cap mechanism will naturally prevent ordering given the massive on-hand surplus.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand (P15-P17) has dropped further than initially observed in Period 17, now averaging ~18 units/period, suggesting a seasonal exit for this sweater SKU.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a 'Queen Sweater', which is seasonally entering the low-demand summer period. Recent demand has plummeted from a peak in Periods 11-13 (~126 units/avg) to a very low level in Periods 16-18 (24, 8, and 5 units respectively). The mean demand over the last 3 periods is only 12.33 units. On-hand inventory is currently 342 units, which is significantly higher than any foreseeable demand in the near term (covering approximately 27 weeks at the current rate). The in-transit inventory includes 236 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) that are confirmed lost/undeliverable, and 7 units from P13 which are also likely lost. Given the massive overstock relative to current demand, the objective is to prevent any further ordering to minimize holding costs. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3-period regime captures the seasonal decline accurately, while the existing on-hand stock ensures a 100% service level without new orders.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 19, the sweater SKU has entered a deep seasonal trough with demand averaging ~12 units/period (P16-P18), down from the P11-13 peak of ~126 units/period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (Queen Sweater) is currently in a deep seasonal trough as of late June. Historical demand analysis shows a significant decrease from a localized peak in April/May (Period 11-13) to very low levels now. Demand in the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 24, 8, 5, and 4 units, respectively, averaging approximately 10 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 338 units, which is extremely high (covering ~33 periods of current demand) relative to the current sales velocity. Additionally, there is a persistent 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 236 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost/undeliverable, inflating the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR backend. To prevent unnecessary ordering and minimize high holding costs ($1.0/unit/period), I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent seasonal decline. I am setting an explicit lead time of 2 periods, as operational shipments (P11, P12, P15) have consistently arrived with a 2-period lead time, despite the historical losses.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (Queen Sweater) is currently in a deep seasonal trough, as confirmed by the last 4 periods of demand (8, 5, 4, 1). With the current date being July 1st, demand for this lightweight sweatshirt/sweater fabric is naturally minimal. Average demand over the last 3 periods (P18-P20) is only 3.33 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 337 units, which is extremely high (over 100 periods of cover at current demand levels). There is also a pipeline of 243 units, though 236 of those (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost legacy shipments. Even ignoring the 'phantom' pipeline, the on-hand stock is far in excess of anticipated needs. I will set the mean demand (mu_hat) to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=3) to prevent the OR backend from ordering more against this high inventory. I keep L at 2 based on the consistent 2-period lead time observed for all successful arrivals (P2, P11, P12, P15 orders).

Carry-over insight: Demand has hit a seasonal floor as of July; P18-P20 mean is ~3 units/period (~97% lower than the P12 peak).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Queen Sweater' has entered a deep seasonal trough in July, with historical demand dropping from a peak of 179 in Period 12 to a consistent average of ~3 units/period over the last 4 periods (P18-P21). Current on-hand inventory is 333 units, which is extremely high given the current demand regime. With a total of 243 units in-transit (though 236 units are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4), the actual operational inventory is more than sufficient. I am choosing recent_N methods with N=4 to capture this low-demand seasonal floor (July) and ensure no new orders are placed by the OR engine. The parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand (approx 3 units/period) while the backend's base-stock calculation will naturally see the 333 on-hand units and signal zero orders.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (Queen Sweater) is currently in a deep seasonal trough as of July 15. The demand mean has collapsed from a peak of ~126 units/period (P11-P13) to just ~1.8 units/period over the last 5 periods (P18-P22). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 333 units, which is enough to cover over 100 periods of demand at the current average. Additionally, there are 243 units remaining in-transit, 236 of which are confirmed lost (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) as per previous carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory for the OR engine consists of 333 (on-hand) + 243 (in-transit) = 576 units. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, minimizing further inventory is paramount. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (N=5) to reflect this seasonal floor and prevent the OR engine from ordering more until the existing surplus is cleared.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight sweater currently in a seasonal trough (July). Historical demand from the last 5 periods (P19-P23) shows an average of 2.2 units per period, a substantial drop from the spring peak. On-hand inventory is 331 units, which is extremely high relative to current demand levels; this inventory was accumulated during the May-June replenishment cycle following a demand spike. The pipeline inventory (243 units) includes long-lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 236 units), meaning the 'live' pipeline is effectively only 7 units (ordered P13). Lead time for operational shipments has consistently remained at 2 periods. Given the high stock relative to the very low seasonal demand, no additional orders are necessary. I will set parameters to reflect this low-demand regime to prevent the OR engine from triggering further unnecessary orders and incurring more holding costs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Queen Sweater) is in a significant seasonal trough (mid-summer). Demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) has averaged 3.8 units/period, far below the spring highs. On-hand inventory is 319 units, which is enough to cover current demand for over 80 periods. Additionally, there are 243 units in-transit, 236 of which are confirmed lost/phantom (P1, P3, P4) per historical insights. Even excluding phantom units, current stock is highly excessive. To minimize further holding costs, the order should remain zero. Parameters are set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand stability while maintaining a default promised lead time of 2 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight sweater currently in a seasonal trough (August). Recent demand (P22-P25) has shown a slight uptick (0, 2, 12, 20) averaging 8.5 units/period, but overall remains very low compared to the on-hand inventory of 299 units. The 243 units in-transit includes 'phantom' inventory from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 236 units), meaning actual reliable in-transit is nearly zero. However, with 299 units on-hand and an average demand of ~8.5, the inventory covers over 30 weeks of supply. The priority is to avoid ordering and minimize holding costs while the system slowly depletes the excess. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the slight recovery from the absolute floor of 0-2 units, while keeping L at default (promised) to ensure the OR logic doesn't overreact to old 'lost' lead times.

Carry-over insight: Significant 'phantom' pipeline: 236 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, but remain in current in-transit visibility. Demand is slowly recovering from the July floor of <5 units/period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a lightweight sweater. Current demand has exited the summer floor (<5 units) and is trending upward (P24: 12, P25: 20, P26: 22), indicating the start of the pre-autumn recovery. However, on-hand inventory is 277 units, which is significantly higher than the current weekly demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 243 units includes 236 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost shipments (phantom pipeline). Excluding these, the effective pipeline is only 7 units. Given the high on-hand stock relative to current low demand (avg ~18 units recently), there is no immediate need to order more. The goal is to allow current inventory to deplete as demand gradually picks up for the fall season. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the upward trend from the summer trough without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed (July floor ~3 units/period); pre-autumn recovery started at Period 24 (demand increasing 12->20->22).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are entering the transitional period from the summer trough (July mean ~3 units/period) into the autumn season for this 'Queen Sweater'. Demand has shown a steady week-over-week recovery starting at Period 24 (12, 20, 22, 36). The most recent demand (36) matches the mean observed in Feb/March before the spring/summer drop. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this upward trajectory (P24-P27) which averages 22.5 units/period; however, since we are moving into sweater season, I will use an explicit forecast slightly higher than the current average to avoid stockouts during the ramp-up. We have 241 units on-hand and 243 units in-transit. Crucially, 236 units of the in-transit amount are 'phantom' stock from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost. The operational in-transit amount is only 7 units (from P13). Lead time for operational orders is stable at 2 periods. The OR backend will see (on-hand 241 + pipeline 243) = 484 units. Since 236 are lost, the actual useful inventory is 248. The mu_hat is set to 90 (3 periods * 30 avg) to ensure sufficient stock for the autumn ramp-up while managing the high holding cost ($1.00 vs $4.00 profit).

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: Demand increased from July floor (<5) to 36 units in P27 (a 12x increase in 4 weeks). Transitioning from 'Summer Trough' to 'Autumn Ramp-up' regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late August/early Autumn period, where demand for lightweight sweatshirts normally begins to ramp up following the July trough. The last 5 periods (P24-P28) show a clear upward trend (12, 20, 22, 36, 27) with a mean of ~23.4 units, a significant recovery from the mid-summer floor of <5 units. However, current on-hand inventory is 214 units, which covers roughly 9 periods of current demand. Additionally, There are 243 units in-transit, but 236 of these (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are confirmed lost/phantom inventory. The actual operational pipeline is only 7 units (from P13). By using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, I calibrate the model to the early autumn recovery phase (mean ~23.4). The OR engine will subtract the pipeline inventory (243) from the base stock. Since on-hand (214) + pipeline (243) = 457 dramatically exceeds the base stock for this demand regime, the OR engine will correctly suggest 0 units. We must burn through the excess on-hand stock before ordering more, especially since holding costs are $1/unit.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery regime confirmed (P24-P28): demand mean has risen to ~23 units/period from the July floor of <5. Significant phantom inventory (236 units) persists in 'In-transit' totals.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight sweater (Queen Sweater), currently entering its peak autumn/winter season (September 2nd). Demand analysis shows a clear transition from the July summer floor (mean <3) to an autumn ramp-up starting Period 24. Recent demand (P27-P29) has consistently risen (36, 27, 40), suggesting a new regime. I am setting N=6 for demand forecasting (Period 24-29) to capture this upward trajectory, which yields a mean of ~26 units/period. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast to anticipate further seasonal growth as we enter September, setting it to 150 (roughly 50 units/period over L+1 periods) to ensure sufficient coverage during this high-growth phase. Lead time remains consistently 2 periods for operational orders (confirmed at P14, P17). Inventory note: 236 units of the 243 currently 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4) and will never arrive, leaving only 7 legitimate units in-transit. On-hand stock is 174, which is currently healthy but will deplete rapidly if the seasonal surge mimics the spring peak (~130-170 units/week).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter ramp-up regime confirmed: Demand mean has increased from <3 (July) to ~26 (August) and is trending upward for the September season. Inventory integrity: 236 units in-transit are confirmed lost assets.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Queen Sweater) is entering a strong autumn/winter seasonal ramp-up. We observed a significant demand jump to 172 units in Period 30 (Date: 9/2), which aligns with late summer/early autumn shopping. This breaks the previous local mean of ~30. I will treat the demand from Period 30 as a new regime start. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (2 units). Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 243 units includes 236 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. The 'real' pipeline is only 7 units (ordered P13, though at this point even that is highly suspect). Since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (243) from the base_stock, and the current pipeline is dominated by 'phantom' lost stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to force a large enough order to overcome this calculation offset. I am forecasting a mean of ~150 units per period for the immediate seasonal surge. Base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods, so 450 units. To offset the 236 phantom units, I need a mu_hat/base_stock target that accounts for this. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 500 units to ensure the OR engine places a substantial order despite the inflated in-transit value. Lead time 'calculate' is used to track the promised vs. actual performance of non-lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter seasonal surge confirmed: Demand spiked from ~30 to 172 (+470%) as of 2019-09-02 (P30). Significant phantom pipeline (236 units) continues to distort order calculations.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Queen Sweater' has entered a significant Autumn/Winter surge, with demand jumping from ~30-40 units to 172 and 186 units over the last two periods (2019-09-02 and 2019-09-09). The current on-hand inventory is 0. While the system shows 514 units 'In-transit', 236 of those are confirmed lost from Periods 1, 3, and 4. This means the 'effective' pipeline is 278 units (including the 271 ordered last period). Given the lead time is 2 periods, we must cover demand for the current and subsequent 2 periods. The previous seasonal peak (P11-13) saw demand reach ~179. With current demand at 186, I will set mu_hat to 540 (representing 180 units/period * 3 periods) to ensure the OR backend attempts to reach a base stock that accounts for this high-velocity regime. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat because the automated 'recent_N' would still be diluted by the lower-demand weeks in August, and 'explicit' for L to account for the promised 2-period lead time while ignoring the phantom/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Autumn surge: Demand for Period 31 (186 units) confirms the upward trajectory following Period 30 (172 units). Effective pipeline is currently 278 units, as 236 units remain confirmed lost assets despite being listed in IT.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (Queen Sweater) is experiencing a rapid seasonal surge typical of late September. Current demand in P32 reached 234 units, significantly higher than the 186 units observed in P31. I am detecting a sustained high-demand regime beginning at P30. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 (P30-P32) to capture this surge, resulting in an average of ~197 units per period. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the high volatility during this ramp-up. Regarding inventory, the P31 order arrived in P32, indicating a lead time of 1 period, though the promised lead time is 2. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance. The system shows 387 units in-transit, but 236 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/phantom assets. The effective pipeline is actually 151 units (P32 order + any operational arrivals). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current surge ensures the capped base stock policy remains aggressive enough to meet the demand while accounting for the high 'phantom' inventory distortion.

Carry-over insight: Automn/Winter demand peak confirmed: Demand has increased from 40 (P29) to 234 (P32), a 485% increase in 4 weeks. P31 order arrived in 1 period, suggesting potential lead time compression or variability during peak season.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Queen Sweater) has entered a major seasonal peak as of late September (Date: 2019/9/30). Demand has increased sharply over the last choice periods: 172 (P30), 186 (P31), 234 (P32), and 352 (P33). The current mean demand over these 4 weeks is 236 units. The P31 shipment arrived with a lead time of 1 period, suggesting potential lead-time compression or high-priority shipping during peak season, although the promised lead time remains 2. Total in-transit is 603 units, but 236 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/phantom inventory. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 367 units (603 - 236). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a significant demand surge, I need to set mu_hat to cover the peak. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current regime (~236/period) and sigma_hat (N=4) to account for high volatility. I will use 'calculate' for L to see if the recent lead time reduction persists.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak is accelerating: Demand jumped from 234 (P32) to 352 (P33), a 50% week-over-week increase. Effective pipeline monitoring is critical as 236 units in-transit remain confirmed lost assets.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight sweatshirt/sweater (SKU 677930023), currently in its peak Autumn/Winter demand regime. Demand jumped significantly starting in Period 30, with the most recent four periods showing demand of 172, 186, 234, 352, and 222 (avg ~233). Although Period 34 showed a slight dip to 222, this is still high-velocity demand. I must reconcile the pipeline: Current In-transit is 828 units. However, 236 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 592 units. On-hand is 0. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the total inventory coverage (on-hand + effective pipeline) needs to satisfy demand for the next 3 periods (L+1). At the current average of ~233/period, 3 periods of demand is ~700 units. Since 592 < 700, the OR engine needs to order. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current peak mean (~233) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility during this surge. L remains at the promised 2 periods for planning, despite occasional faster arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak demand has stabilized at a high level (P30-P34 mean: 233 units/period). Inventory integrity remains compromised: 236 units in the In-transit total are confirmed lost assets (from Periods 1, 3, 4).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the Autumn/Winter peak demand season for this sweater. Demand over the last five periods (P31-P35) has averaged 232.2 units. Although demand dropped to 167 in P35, the overall trend remains significantly higher than the summer floor. Lead times have been volatile: P31 arrived in 1 period, while P32 arrived in 3 periods. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the OR backend average these fluctuations. Inventory integrity is a major concern: 236 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost but are still present in the 'In-transit' figure of 684. This means the 'effective' pipeline is actually 448 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand across (L+1) periods plus a compensation for the 236 lost units. Base demand forecast: ~230 units/period. For L=2, required inventory is (2+1)*230 = 690. Adding the 236 phantom units to the target base stock ensures the 'capped policy' (base_stock - pipeline) results in an order that ignores the lost units. Total explicit mu_hat target = 690 + 236 = 926. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current high volatility of the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Peak season lead time volatility confirmed: P31 lead_time=1, P32 lead_time=3. Phantom inventory (236 units) continues to persistently inflate 'In-transit' figures.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-to-late Autumn/Winter season (October 21). Historical demand from the last five periods (P32-P36) shows high activity: 234, 352, 222, 167, and 132. Although there is a downward trend in the last three weeks, the 'Queen Sweater' product category suggests demand will remain significant through the colder months. The average demand of the last 5 periods (~221 units/period) is a representative figure for the current regime. Lead time reliability remains a concern: P31 arrived in 1 period, while P32 and P33 both arrived in 3 periods. I will use L=3 to be conservative. The 'In-transit' total of 816 units is heavily distorted by 236 units of 'phantom' inventory from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 580 units (816 - 236). With on-hand inventory at 84, the effective inventory position is 664. I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover 4 periods (L+1) at a forecast of ~200 units/period (800 total) to maintain service levels while acknowledging the slight recent cooling in demand. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed during peak season: observed lead times of 1, 3, and 3 periods for P31-P33. Effectiveness of pipeline inventory remains reduced by 236 units of confirmed 'phantom' assets (P1, P3, P4).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28, in the middle of the Autumn/Winter peak season for this sweater SKU. Demand has stabilized but remains high compared to the summer floor, with recent periods (P34-P37) averaging ~160 units/period, showing a slight cooling from the late September peak of 352 units. Lead time volatility is confirmed (ranging from 1 to 3 periods); I will use an explicit L of 3 to provide a safety buffer against recent 3-period arrivals (P32 and P33). mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime of ~160 units/period (totaling 640 across L+1 periods). sigma_hat is set to 'default' as the standard deviation across all samples is sufficient to cover current fluctuations. Note: 236 units of the 858 'In-transit' units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4) and must be ignored; the OR backend will deduct the full 858 from the base_stock, so setting a higher mu_hat/L helps offset this 'phantom' deduction and prevent stockouts.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 39 (early November), which is the peak season for a lightweight sweatshirt/sweater SKU. Demand has stabilized at a high level, with the last 5 periods (P34-P38) averaging ~161 units/period. The lead time has been volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P37 order arrived in 1 period, P33 in 3 periods), so I will use a conservative lead time estimate (L=2) to handle this variance. A critical challenge is the 'phantom' pipeline: 236 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but remain in the IT total of 816 units. The OR engine will subtract the full 816 from the base stock. To compensate for the 236 units that will never arrive, I am shifting the mu_hat explicitly. Base stock calculation: Demand is ~161/period. For L=2, required inventory across (L+1) periods is 161 * 3 = 483 units. To negate the 236 units of lost inventory that the OR engine incorrectly assumes is coming, I set mu_hat to approximately 483 + 236 = 719. This ensures the engine places an order that accounts for both actual demand and the persistent reporting error in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom' inventory of 236 units (from P1, P3, P4) continues to persist as of P39, requiring explicit mu_hat adjustments to prevent under-ordering.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '677930023' (Queen Sweater) is currently in its peak Autumn/Winter demand season. Period 39 demand dropped to 50, but the previous weeks (P30-P38) showed a much higher mean of ~178 units/period. The drop in P39 is likely a temporary fluctuation rather than a seasonal exit, given the mid-November date. Real-world lead times during this peak season have been volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P36 order arrived P39, LT=3; P37 order arrived P38, LT=1; P33/P32 also LT=3). I will use L=2 (promised) as the base but expect variance. The 'In-transit' figure of 468 is heavily distorted by 236 units of 'phantom' inventory from P1, P3, and P4 which are confirmed lost. The actual operational pipeline is 468 - 236 = 232 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock based on a conservative peak mean of 150 units/period across (L+1)=3 periods, which equals 450 units. To offset the 236 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to 686 (450 + 236). This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a calculated need of 450 units against the real pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Peak season demand remains active but volatile (P30-P39 mean ~165). Lead time volatility persists (LT fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods). Phantom pipeline distortion of 236 units remains constant.

Demand has notably cooled from the September/October peaks (which reached >300 units/period) to a more stable range of 50-165 units over the last four periods (P37-P40 mean ~96). I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this cooling trend while maintaining safety against volatility. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods); I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical average for stability. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 505 units is heavily distorted by 236 units from P1, P3, and P4 which are confirmed lost. The 'real' pipeline is 269 (505 - 236). Since the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (measured by it) to subtract from the base stock, and the recorded pipeline is inflated by 236 'phantom' units, I must explicitly increase mu_hat by these 236 units to offset the backend's over-subtraction and prevent a stockout.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (late November), the product is in its peak season. Recent demand (P39-P41) has moderated to 50, 51, and 47 units, averaging ~49 units/period. The 'In-transit' figure of 505 units contains 236 'phantom' units (orders from P1, P3, and P4) that are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 269 units. Since 225 units are from the P34 order (now 8 periods overdue and likely lost as well, given previous patterns), the ONLY viable recently placed order is 37 units from P40. With 200 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of only 37 units, total available stock is 237 units. To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at the current rate of ~50 units/period (req. ~150 units), the on-hand stock is currently sufficient. However, the OR engine's 'base_stock' calculation will be severely distorted by the 505 units reported as 'in-transit'. To force the OR engine to place an order, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent demand regime (last 3 periods) to ensure a realistic base stock, while accepting that the backend will subtract the inflated pipeline inventory. Current plan is to hold steady as current on-hand covers the immediate horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: P34 order (225 units) is now 8 periods overdue; like P1, P3, and P4, it is highly probable this shipment is lost. Total 'phantom' pipeline is likely 461 units (236 + 225).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late peak/winter season (Period 43, early December). Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~57 units over the last 3 weeks (P40-P42), following the massive Autumn surge. A critical issue is the 'Phantom Pipeline': out of 505 units in-transit, 461 units are confirmed lost/overdue (P1=75, P3=25, P4=136, P34=225) and will never arrive. The OR backend uses total 'In-transit' to calculate orders, so it will think we have 505 units coming when we only have 44 (P40 order). To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a stabilized demand of ~60 units/period and a lead time of 2. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mu = 3 * 60 = 180 units. However, because the backend subtracts the phantom 505 from its calculation, I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat that, when used in the formula (mu_hat - phantom_pipeline), results in a positive order to reach my target. I set mu_hat explicitly to 210 (representing 3 * 70) to ensure the backend maintains sufficient stock given the actual 126 on-hand units and minimal real incoming inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed total 'phantom' pipeline is 461 units (P1, P3, P4, and now P34). P34 (225 units) is 9 periods overdue. Real pipeline inventory is only 44 units (from P40). Demand mean for the last 3 weeks is ~57 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9). Demand has significantly cooled from the autumn peak (P30-P38 mean 186/period) to a more stable late-season level (P41-P43 mean 50/period). The product description is a 'lightweight sweatshirt', which typically sees lower demand as core winter sets in after the autumn transition. Logistics reliability remains poor: the internal 'In-transit' figure of 468 is heavily distorted by 461 units of 'phantom' inventory (P1: 75, P3: 25, P4: 136, P34: 225) which are confirmed lost or massively overdue. This leaves only 7 units actually in transit (likely the P43 order activity). With 134 units on hand and demand around 50/period, and given we are nearing the end of the simulation (P47), we must avoid over-ordering to minimize ending inventory (holding cost). The OR backend uses (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders. Since the system sees 468 units in transit but only ~7 are real, I will set mu_hat explicitly high to trick the OR backend into placing an order if needed, but given the massive 461 phantom units already in 'pipeline', the backend will unlikely order anything unless mu_hat is set to an extreme value. However, current on-hand (134) covers over 2 periods of current demand (50), which is sufficient for the remaining 3 periods of the game given the seasonal decline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed total phantom pipeline is 461 units (P1, P3, P4, P34) as of Period 44. Recent demand (P41-P43) has stabilized at ~50 units/period, down from peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final weeks (P45-P47) of the game. Current demand has stabilized post-peak, averaging 50.0 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P40-P44). To determine the appropriate order for P45, we must reconcile the inventory position. Total In-transit is reported as 468 units, but carry-over insights and historical arrival analysis confirm 461 of these units are 'phantom' assets (P1: 75, P3: 25, P4: 136, P34: 225) that will never arrive. The real inventory position is actually: On-hand (85) + Real In-transit (7) = 92 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 461-unit inflation, I must adjust mu_hat. I target a base stock sufficient for the next 3 periods (L+1) using the recent mean of 50. Total demand forecast = 150. Because the backend subtracts the full 468 In-transit, I provide an explicit mu_hat of 611 (150 + 461) to offset the phantom inventory. This effectively sets the real target base stock to 150 units. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility (~16) scaled for the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed total phantom pipeline remains 461 units (P1, P3, P4, P34) as of Period 45. Recent demand mean (P40-P44) is 50.0 units/period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Dec 23rd (Period 46). Demand has stabilized post-peak season, with the last 6 periods (P40-P45) averaging 47.8 units/period. The current in-transit (pipeline) is reported as 550 units, but 461 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' assets (P1: 75, P3: 25, P4: 136, P34: 225) that are extremely overdue and likely lost. The real pipeline consists of only the P45 order (82 units) and 7 units from P40 arrival calculations. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock, I must account for this 461-unit distortion. I am setting mu_hat using the recent 6-period mean (~48) multiplied by (1+L) = 144, but then explicitly adding the 461 phantom units to the base stock calculation to offset the false pipeline (144 + 461 = 605). Lead time remains variable between 1-3 periods, so I retain L=2 (default) for the logic while using explicit values to counteract inventory distortion.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Total phantom pipeline confirmed at 461 units (P1, P3, P4, P34). This heavily distorts 'In-transit' accounting. Demand has stabilized at ~48 units/period for the late-December season.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late-December/early-January period (Period 47). Recent demand (P43-P46) has stabilized at a mean of ~37.5 units/period, showing a post-holiday decline. The 'In-transit' figure of 580 units is heavily distorted by 461 units of 'phantom' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P34 are confirmed lost/undeliverable). Subtracting these 461 phantom units results in an actual pipeline inventory of 119 units (P45 order for 82 and P46 order for 37). Combined with current on-hand inventory of 13, the net effective inventory is 132 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 593 (13+580) units and suppressing new orders, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat settings that incorporate the phantom inventory offset. Target base stock for a 3-period coverage (L=2) at ~37.5 units/period is roughly 112 units. Since effective inventory (132) currently covers this, L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile observed lead times (1-3 periods), and mu_hat is set to 112 to maintain stock levels without over-ordering.
