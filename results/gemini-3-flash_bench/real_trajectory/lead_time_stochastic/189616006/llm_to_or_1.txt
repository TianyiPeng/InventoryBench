Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 189616006 (Leggings). Historical data shows a clear upward trend in demand: 37, 95, 121, 153, 145. The average demand of the last 3 periods is ~140, significantly higher than the overall average of ~110. Given this recent growth, I will use `recent_N` with N=3 to capture the current demand level. The promised lead time is 2, so the parameters must cover (2+1)=3 periods of demand. No in-transit or on-hand inventory exists, so the OR engine needs to place an initial order to establish the base stock.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the product (sturdy jersey leggings) and the calendar, we are in February, a typical winter-to-spring transition period for basic apparel. Demand history shows a steady increase over the last 5 weeks: 37, 95, 121, 153, 145 (mean of last 3 is ~140). In Period 1, valid demand was 135, but on-hand was 0, resulting in 135 lost sales. We have 168 units in-transit from Period 1. Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, we expect this to arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). Current on-hand is 0. I will keep L at 2 (default). I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand level (averaging ~140/week), and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility seen in the trend.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Looking at historical demand (Jan: 37, 95, 121, 153; Feb: 145, 135, 191), there is a clear upward trend as we move into the spring season for leggings. The average of the last 4 periods is approximately 156. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (168 units) should arrive during Period 3 (L=2). However, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory and have faced stockouts in Periods 1 and 2. To capture the recent demand surge and ensure sufficient safety stock for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to focus on the February demand level. I will stick to the promised lead time 'default' as we haven't yet seen a completed delivery cycle to prove a shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/4. The product is a jersey legging (Divided Basics), which typically sees stable but growing demand in spring. Demand history shows mean ~129.2 (including seed data: 37, 95, 121, 153, 145 and in-game: 135, 191, 132). Expected lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (168 units), P2 (160 units), and P3 (197 units) are all in-transit. Based on L=2, the P1 order should have arrived during P3 and be visible in the P3 conclude message. However, the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests a possible delay in the supply chain or that the 'conclude' message timing requires another period for the P1 order (ordered P1, arrives P3, visible P4). I will maintain the promised lead time for now but monitor for lost shipments. I am using recent_N for demand to capture the recent higher levels (~130+) compared to the very early January data.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic Legging'. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend from early Jan (~37-145) into Feb/March (avg ~150). The most recent period (P4) saw the arrival of the P2 order with a lead time of 2 periods, confirming the promised lead time holds. However, the P1 order (168 units) is overdue and should have arrived in P3 conclude; its absence suggests a lost shipment or severe delay. Current on-hand is low (20), but pipeline (365) accounts for orders from P3 and P5. Given the product's basic nature and the slight dip in P3/P4 demand (132, 140) compared to P2 (191), I will use the last 5 samples (P0-P4) to estimate future demand (avg ~148/period). With L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+2)=3 periods of demand (~444). I'll use recent_N for both mean and volatility to capture the recent higher demand regime compared to the early January samples.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (168 units) significantly overdue as of P5; probable lost shipment. Demand regime stabilized around 145-150 units/period since February.

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, demand for these 'extra sturdy jersey leggings' has averaged 147 units over the last 5 periods. The Period 1 order (168 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived, confirming it is lost. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on the promised lead time (L=2). The Period 3 order (197 units) was placed in P3, and with L=2, it is expected to arrive during Period 5's resolution phase, making it visible at the start of Period 7. To stabilize, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand (covering the observed history) and default settings for lead time and sigma, allowing the OR engine's service level logic to account for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) while targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: P1 order (168 units) is officially categorized as lost (3 periods beyond promised L=2). P2 order arrived on time (L=2). Demand remains consistent around 140-150 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2090.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the P1 order (168 units) remains lost, while the P5 order arrived surprisingly early (L=1). The P3 order (197 units) is currently in transit and overdue (placed P3, promised L=2, now P7), which historically indicates a high probability of loss or transit disruption. The P6 order (15 units) is still within the expected lead time. On-hand inventory is critically low (19 units) compared to the stable demand regime (averaging ~145-150 units). To recover and ensure availability for the next 3 weeks (L+1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the stable jersey legging demand) and explicitly setting L to 2 to reflect the promised duration, despite recent variability. I am using recent_N for sigma to account for the consistent volatility observed in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability: Observed L=2 (P2) and L=1 (P5), while P1 and P3 are significantly overdue/lost. Demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' has stabilized at ~130-140 units/week.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (Jersey Basic Leggings) shows a consistent demand profile, averaging approximately 130-140 units over the last 7 periods, with a slight downward trend recently (P6: 111, P7: 110). Looking at fulfillment: the P1 order (168 units) and P3 order (197 units) are both long overdue (L=7 and L=5 respectively) and are treated as lost. The P2 order arrived with L=2, and the P5 order arrived with L=1. This indicates high lead time volatility and unreliability from the supplier. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 488 (comprising P3=197, P6=15, P7=108, and the implicit P1=168 which is actually lost). Because the OR engine counts all in-transit units against the base stock, but P1 and P3 are lost, the system will under-order unless we adjust. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average of successful deliveries (avg 1.5). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the stable demand around 130 per period, resulting in a forecast covering 1+L periods. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: P3 order (197 units) is now 3 periods beyond promised L=2 and is likely lost, joining P1 (168 units). Only P2 and P5 have successfully arrived, showing actual L varies between 1 and 2.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are managing 'Jersey Basic Leggings'. Current inventory is very low (7 units) with 365 units in-transit. A reconciliation of in-transit orders shows: P1 (168) and P3 (197) are significantly overdue (7 and 5 periods respectively) and are considered lost. The only reliable shipments have arrived from P2 (L=2), P5 (L=1), P6 (L=2), and P7 (L=1). Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero because the 365 units in-transit correspond to the lost P1 and P3 orders. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime: the last 5 periods (P4-P8) show a mean of 120.4 units, down from the earlier average (~145). I will set L to 2 (the promised and maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the base stock covers the current period plus the 2-period lead time. Mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the shift to ~120 units/period. The OR backend will see 365 'in-transit', but since these are lost, the system would under-order; however, the capped policy and my parameter choice aim to trigger a replenishment despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime shift: Period 4-8 average demand is 120 units, compared to Period 1-3 average of 153 units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The item is 'Leggings in extra sturdy jersey', a basic item. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand, with 390 units in transit. Reviewing history: P1 order (168) and P3 order (197) are confirmed lost (7+ periods since order). P2 arrived L=2, P5 arrived L=1, P6 arrived L=2, P7 arrived L=1. Actual lead time is averaging around 1.5 periods, but the system's pipeline inventory calculation is heavily distorted by the 365 lost units (P1, P3) which will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock'. Since In-transit (390) includes lost units, it won't trigger new orders until we 'offset' this. Demand has entered a lower regime; the last 5 periods (P5-P9) show an average demand of ~110.6 units, significantly lower than the initial ~145. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of this 110-unit demand, but I must use 'explicit' to force a high enough base_stock to overcome the ghost pipeline of lost units (365 units) and ensure a fresh order is generated to meet immediate needs.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory total: 365 units (P1: 168, P3: 197). These units remain in 'In-transit' indefinitely, requiring an upward adjustment in base_stock/mu_hat to trigger new orders.

The system reports 619 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 1 (168 units) and Period 3 (197 units) are lost. These 365 phantom units prevent the OR engine's capped policy from ordering enough to meet demand because the engine thinks the pipeline is full. Recent demand has stabilized at ~100 units/period (mean of last 5 periods: 109 units). To bypass the capped policy and trigger a replenishment that reflects actual availability, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculated the target base stock (L=2) as (1+2)*109 + z*sigma. To offset the 365 lost units and refill the empty on-hand stock, I've set mu_hat to an explicit value that forces an order. I am also using 'calculate' for L as recent arrivals show lead times of 1 or 2 periods, making the average a reliable measure.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory remains inflated by 365 'phantom' units (P1: 168, P3: 197) which are officially considered lost. Demand has declined from Jan/Feb highs (~150) to a stable spring regime of ~100-110 units/week.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU '189616006' (Heavy jersey leggings) is in a stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' figure of 780 units, which contains 365 units from lost orders (P1: 168 and P3: 197). Because the OR engine subtracts all pipeline inventory (including these 365 'phantom' units) from its base stock calculation, it will chronically under-order unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset this loss. Regarding demand, we are seeing a clear downward trend/stabilization: early Jan/Feb demand averaged ~130-150, but since Period 9 (early April), weekly demand has hovered around 74-97 units. For Period 12, I am setting L=2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P9) show short lead times, and setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to bypass the pipeline inventory issue. To cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) at an estimated 100 units/week, plus the 365 lost units, I set mu_hat = (3 * 100) + 365 = 665. This ensures the backend (base_stock - 780 pipeline) still triggers a replenishment order to meet immediate needs while acknowledge the lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime shift: Post-April demand has stabilized at ~80-100 units/week, down from Feb/Mar avg of ~130. Total 'phantom' in-transit inventory remains 365 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the system is facing a severe stockout due to a combination of declining demand and significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory from lost shipments (P1: 168 units, P3: 197 units). Total phantom inventory is 365 units. Current in-transit is 780, of which only 415 (780 - 365) are realistic arrivals (P10: 254 units, P11: 161 units). Since L=2, the order from P10 should arrive during P12 and be visible now, but it hasn't appeared in the P12 conclude message, suggesting lead times are currently at least 2 or the shipments are further delayed. Demand has clearly shifted from ~140 in March to ~80 in April/May. To trigger a new order despite the 365 phantom units blocking the base stock calculation (final order = base_stock - inventory), I must explicitly increase mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of actual demand (~85 units/period) plus the 365 lost units to offset the backend calculation. Calculation: (1+2)*85 + 365 = 620. This ensures the OR engine places an order to bridge the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Demand floor identified at ~75-85 units/week for May. Lead time for P10 (254 units) is now > 2 periods, confirming continued logistics instability.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14 (May 13), we are managing 'Jersey Basic Leggings'. Current on-hand inventory is 107. The 'In-transit' count of 619 units is highly misleading because it includes 365 units from P1 and P3 that are long-lost, plus 254 units from P10 which are now overdue (L > 3), suggesting P10 may also be lost or severely delayed. To compensate for the 'phantom' in-transit inventory and trigging necessary ordering, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly high. Recent demand has stabilized significantly lower, averaging ~75 units over the last 4 periods (P10-P13), reflecting a post-April seasonal decline. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 619 'in-transit' units from the calculated base stock, I will use an explicit 'mu_hat' that accounts for the (L+1) demand coverage PLUS the 365 phantom units to force a replenishment order. Setting L to 2 remains the most consistent achievable lead time despite recent shocks.

Carry-over insight: P10 order (254 units) is now 4 periods old (promised L=2) and has not arrived; it is likely lost, bringing total 'phantom' in-transit inventory to 619 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), the SKU 189616006 (Leggings) has a severe discrepancy between accounting and physical inventory. The backend 'In-transit' figure is 792 units, but detailed analysis of the history confirms 619 of these units are lost (P1: 168, P3: 197, P10: 254), as they are significantly beyond the promised L=2 or even observed L=3/4. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit + On-hand) to calculate orders; because it thinks 792 units are coming, it will stop ordering. To force the system to order despite these 'phantom' units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock: (Average Demand \xd7 (L+1)) + (Safety Stock). Recent demand (Period 11-14) averages ~68 units. With L=2, the base stock should cover 3 periods (~204 units) plus safety stock (~80-100 units). However, because the backend subtracts 792 (phantom) + 35 (on-hand) from my mu_hat, I must set mu_hat to approximately (Desired Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) to trigger a replenishment. I set mu_hat to 1100 to offset the 827 units the backend overcounts, effectively aiming for a physical base stock of ~270. L is kept at 2 as recent successful deliveries (P11) arrived in 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 619 units (P1, P3, P10). Demand has entered a low-season stable regime averaging ~70 units per week since late April.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the 'Jersey Basic Leggings' are in a stable low-season demand regime, averaging ~70 units per week. The system is under significant stress due to 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Specifically, 619 units from orders P1 (168), P3 (197), and P10 (254) are considered lost, yet they remain in the OR engine's 'In-transit' calculation, preventing it from placing new orders. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set as an 'explicit' value that accounts for the phantom units. The logic is: Required Base Stock (for L+1=3 periods of demand) + Phantom Inventory = mu_hat. At 70 units/week, the 3-period demand is 210. Adding the 619 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 829. This allows the OR backend (which subtracts 1148 in-transit) to place necessary orders when combined with current pipeline activity. L is kept at 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P2, P5, P6, P7, P9, P11) show a mix of 1 and 2 periods, while lost shipments are handled via mu_hat. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' has significantly decreased from early-year highs (~150/week) to a summer low-season regime, averaging ~50 units/week over the last three periods (P14-P16). The OR logic is currently blocked from ordering due to 619 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (P1, P3, P10) which are confirmed lost but still visible in the pipeline. I will continue using an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these lost units. Target base stock = (Demand during Lead Time + Review Period) = (L+1) * 50 = (2+1) * 50 = 150 units. To trigger an order when on-hand is 0 and pipeline is 1148 (including 619 lost), mu_hat must be set to approximately (Base Stock + Total Pipeline) = 150 + 1148 = 1298. Sigma_hat is set relatively low (30) to reflect the recent stability in the low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Low-season demand regime confirmed: Avg demand for periods 14-16 is 57 units/week. Logistics instability persists with total lost 'phantom' inventory rising to 619 units (P1, P3, P10).

Daily Reward (R_t): $704.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10) indicates we are in a low-season demand regime for 'Jersey Basic Leggings'. Demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) has averaged 55 units/week (54, 72, 50, 48, 53), which is significantly lower than the Jan-March averages (~130 units). On-hand inventory is currently high (303 units) following the arrival of the Period 15 order (356 units, L=2). The supply chain is highly unreliable: orders P1 (168), P3 (197), and P10 (254) are considered lost, totaling 619 'phantom' units in the In-transit figure (current In-transit 992 - 619 phantom = 373 real units: P14=173, P17=200). Since 303 units on-hand already covers over 5 periods of demand at the current rate (55 units/week), and there are real units still in transit, the goal is to prevent any new orders being triggered. I will set mu_hat explicitly to a low value reflecting the current (L+1) demand (3 * 55 = 165) which, when combined with the inflated 'pipeline_inventory' in the backend (at least 303 + 992), will ensure zero new orders are placed while we bleed off the excess stock.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' has entered a late-spring/early-summer low season, with the last 5 periods (P14-P18) averaging approximately 52 units, significantly lower than the winter/spring peaks. Logistic reliability remains a major issue: the current In-transit total of 992 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1: 168, P3: 197, P10: 254, P14: 173). Total confirmed lost inventory is 792 units (P1, P3, P10, and now P14, as it is 4 periods old with a promised L=2). On-hand inventory is 267, which covers nearly 5 weeks of current demand. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 992 units as available stock and refusing to order more when needed, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 160 units). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory, I must inflate mu_hat manually to offset the 792 lost units in the pipeline. However, with 267 on-hand, we are already above the desired stock level for this low-demand regime, so no new orders are necessary this period.

Carry-over insight: P14 order (173 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived; it is officially considered lost alongside P1, P3, and P10. Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory matches 792 units. Demand has hit a new low-season floor, averaging ~50 units/week since mid-May.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' has significantly stabilized at a low-season floor of approximately 40-50 units per week (Period 18: 36, Period 19: 35). The current on-hand inventory of 232 units covers approximately 4-5 weeks of demand at this rate. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure is 992 units, which contains 792 confirmed 'phantom' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14). To prevent the OR engine from stopping orders due to this fake pipeline, mu_hat must be adjusted upward to 'offset' the phantom units. Target Base Stock = (\u03bc * (L+1)) + (Safety Stock) + Phantom Units. Estimated \u03bc is 50. With L=2, \u03bc*(L+1) = 150. Safety stock is ~60. Phantom is 792. Total Target = 1002. Since OR calculates base stock from mu_hat = \u03bc*(L+1), I will set mu_hat to approximately 1000 to ensure the backend recognizes the need to maintain stock despite the frozen in-transit numbers.

Carry-over insight: Low-season floor demand established at ~35-45 units/week since June. Logistics loss rate remains severe: 792 units (P1, P3, P10, P14) are confirmed lost and constitute 'phantom' in-transit inventory.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616006' (Leggings) is currently in a low-demand summer regime, with the last three periods (P18-P20) averaging 30.3 units/week, down significantly from the spring average. The logistics situation is severely compromised: 'In-transit' shows 992 units, but history confirms that orders from P1 (168), P3 (197), P10 (254), and P14 (173) are lost, totaling 792 units of 'phantom' inventory. Additionally, the order from P17 (200 units) is now at its promised lead time (L=2) and has not arrived; if it does not arrive next period, it will also be suspect. With 212 units on-hand and current demand ~30-40, we have over 5 periods of stock. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' to offset these 792 lost units. We set mu_hat = (Forecast * (L+1)) + Lost_Units = (35 * 3) + 792 = 897. Sigma is set to reflect the higher variability caused by both demand shifts and erratic arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed lost 'phantom' inventory remains at 792 units (P1, P3, P10, P14). Summer demand regime has further softened, averaging ~30 units/week in June. P17 order (200 units, L=2) is now at the promised arrival window but not yet confirmed.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (July 8), the SKU 'Jersey Basic Leggings' is in a low-season summer slump, with demand averaging approximately 25 units per period over the last 3 weeks (P19-21: 35, 20, 21). On-hand inventory is 191 units, which covers nearly 7-8 periods of current demand. The In-transit figure of 992 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: P1 (168), P3 (197), P10 (254), and P14 (173), totaling 792 lost units. The most recent non-lost order was P17 (200 units), which was ordered 5 periods ago (L=2 promised) and has not arrived. Since P17 is now 3 periods overdue, it is increasingly likely to be lost as well, adding another 200 units to the phantom total (792 + 200 = 992). This suggests the entire 992 units currently 'In-transit' are likely lost. However, because on-hand inventory is currently high relative to the low summer demand, there is no immediate risk of stockout. I am setting L to explicit 2 (promised), mu_hat to a recent_N of 5 to capture the summer demand floor (~30 units/period), and sigma_hat to recent_N 5 to reflect the reduced volatility of the current regime. This configuration will prevent the OR backend from ordering more units while we burn through existing safety stock, despite the high phantom in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: P17 order (200 units) is now 3 periods beyond promised lead time (ordered P17, now P22); it is officially added to the list of likely lost shipments. Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory now accounts for the entire 992 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17). Summer demand has reached a floor of ~20-30 units/week.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15), the 'Jersey Basic Leggings' are in a deep low-season demand regime. Recent demand (Periods 20-22) has averaged ~27 units/week. Logistics instability is severe: the total 'In-transit' inventory of 992 units consists entirely of 'phantom' stock from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, and now P17, which is 5 periods old). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 992 units of 'pipeline inventory' from the base stock calculation, it will likely never place a new order unless the target base stock exceeds 992. Given the current demand (27 units) and L=2, the calculated base stock would be only around 100-150 units. Therefore, the goal is to set parameters that prevent new ordering while we burn through the 151 units of existing on-hand stock, which covers over 5 weeks of current demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current trough of 27 units/week and sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect current low volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Logistics failure confirmed for P17 (200 units); total phantom in-transit inventory is 992 units. Summer demand trough stabilized at ~25-30 units/week.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a low-season stable demand regime for 'Jersey Basic Leggings', with the last 5 periods (P19-P23) averaging 32.6 units. The on-hand inventory is 104 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 3 weeks of current demand. However, the system's 'In-transit' count is severely inflated by 992 'phantom' units (orders from P1, P3, P10, P14, and now P17) that have never arrived and are considered lost given the time elapsed. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit) to calculate orders, it will keep the order quantity at 0 as long as on-hand + phantom units exceed the base_stock. To counteract this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that captures the true demand (33 units) but also adds the lost 992 units to the 'required' base stock level. This forces the base stock formula (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) to accommodate the phantom units, allowing the OR engine to potentially place a replenishment order if on-hand inventory drops too low. L is kept at 2, and sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility (N=5) to reflect the summer trough stability.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory remains 992 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17). Summer demand regime is stable at ~30-35 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/07/29), we are in a low-season summer demand regime for 'Jersey Basic Leggings'. Demand has stabilized between 20-40 units per week over the last 7 periods (avg ~33). The primary challenge continues to be the massive amount of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (totaling 992 units from orders P1, P3, P10, P14, and P17) which haven't arrived long past their promised lead time. Since technical 'In-transit' is 1021 and we know 992 is likely lost, the 'real' pipeline is only 29 units (P24). On-hand is 76. To ensure the OR backend ignores the 992 lost units and orders against the current low demand, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the phantom inventory. The formula is: target_base_stock = (observed_demand_rate * (L+1)) + (phantom_inventory). Current demand rate is ~35. With L=2, (35 * 3) + 992 = 1097. I will set mu_hat slightly higher to ensure a small buffer, as the OR engine will subtract the 1021 'in-transit' units from this base stock to decide the order quantity.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Inventory analysis reveals a chronic logistics issue: 'In-transit' inventory stands at 1053 units, but 992 of these (orders from P1, P3, P10, P14, and P17) are confirmed as lost or extremely overdue beyond the promised 2-period lead time. Only the orders from P24 (29 units) and P25 (32 units) are realistically expected to arrive. Effective in-transit inventory is therefore only 61 units. Demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' is currently in a summer trough but shows signs of slight recovery, with the last two periods (P24, P25) averaging 45.5 units, compared to the June/July floor of ~30. I will use recent_N=5 for demand to capture this slight uptick while maintaining the summer baseline. Because the OR backend uses the inflated 'In-transit' figure (1053) to subtract from the base stock, it will likely not generate an order unless mu_hat is set extraordinarily high. To counteract this, I will set an explicit mu_hat that compensates for the 'phantom' 992 units to ensure the backend maintains actual service for the real demand. Given L=2, the required total coverage should be (1+L)*demand + phantom_offset. With demand ~45 and 992 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1130 to trigger a small replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed phantom in-transit inventory at 992 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17). Summer demand showing early signs of recovery from 25-30 floor to 40-60 range in late July.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' is showing a significant late-summer recovery. Demand in P26 reached 89 units, confirming the upward trend from the 30-35 unit trough seen in June/July. As we head into August and the upcoming 'Back to School' season, leggings demand historically increases. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1164 units is heavily distorted by 992 units of confirmed lost 'phantom' inventory (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17). This leaves a real pipeline of 172 units (P24, P25, P26). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1164 units from the base_stock, I must increase mu_hat significantly to 'offset' the phantom 992 units and trigger necessary ordering to meet the recovering demand. I will use an explicit mu_hat calculated as: (Actual Forecasted Demand for L+1 periods) + Phantom Inventory. Estimating future demand at ~100 units/week and L=2, the required coverage is ~300 units. Adding the 992 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1292. I'll use explicit sigma_hat to reflect the higher volatility observed during demand shifts.

Carry-over insight: Early August demand recovery confirmed: demand increased from ~30 to 89 units over 3 periods. Phantom in-transit inventory remains 992 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/19. Demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' is showing a clear seasonal recovery, with the last three periods recording demands of 63, 89, and 105. This marks a transition from the summer trough (~30) into a late-summer/pre-fall regime. Logistics remain highly unreliable: P24 (29 units) is overdue (3 periods), and total 'phantom' in-transit inventory (units ordered but never arriving) is now 1021 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24). Consequently, the OR backend's inventory view of 1384 in-transit units is inflated; the actual effective pipeline is closer to 363 units (P26, P27). To counteract this, mu_hat must be set explicitly to account for the phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value that covers 3 periods (L+1) of the current recovery demand (~100-110 units/week) plus an offset to neutralize the 1021 phantom units. This triggers the OR engine to place a replenishment order despite the high visible in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: P24 (29 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, joining the list of lost shipments. Total phantom in-transit inventory is 1021 units. Demand recovery confirmed: August demand has ascended from ~60 to 105 units/week.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/26. Demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' is in a confirmed recovery phase, moving from a summer floor of ~30 to an average of ~100 units/week over the last three periods (P26-P28). Logistics remain extremely unstable with a massive phantom in-transit inventory of 1,021 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24). Consequently, the OR backend sees an 'In-transit' value of 1,396, which drastically exceeds the actual physical units available for arrival. To force necessary orders and maintain stock during this seasonal upturn, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to override the pipeline stock calculation. Setting mu_hat to 1,350 effectively targets a base stock that accounts for the 1,021 phantom units plus a buffer for the current demand (~330 units for L+1). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period arrivals of the surviving shipments. Sigma_hat remains 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the increased volatility of the recovery regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: August demand has ascended to ~100 units/week. Phantom in-transit inventory increased to 1,021 units as P24 is now confirmed lost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019-09-02), demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' is in a recovery/growth phase following the summer trough. Recent demand (P26-P29) has averaged 91.75 units/week, significantly higher than the summer floor of ~35. The logistics situation remains the primary challenge: the 'In-transit' figure of 1396 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24), totaling 1021 units. To counteract these lost units\u2014which the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive and thus suppresses new orders\u2014I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. By setting mu_hat high enough to cover the phantom inventory PLUS the expected demand over (L+1) periods, I force the base-stock calculation to trigger necessary replenishment. Specifically, with an L=2, the required coverage is 3 periods of demand (approx 3 * 95 = 285) + 1021 phantom units = 1306. I will use 1350 for mu_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime recovery: P26-P29 average is 92 units/week, up from summer trough of 30. Total confirmed phantom in-transit inventory is 1021 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31 (Sept 9), we are seeing the recovery and stabilization of the autumn demand regime. Recent demand (P27-P30) has averaged 90 units per week. Logistics uncertainty persists: while P27 arrived with a lead time of 3 (L+1 delay) and P28 arrived with L=2, several previous orders (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24) totaling 1021 units are confirmed lost. These 'phantom' units are still counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory, which prevents the auto-generation of necessary orders. To counteract this, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on the current demand (90 units/week) and a lead time of 2 (target base stock \u2248 (2+1)*90 = 270). However, because the backend subtracts the 1138 units of 'In-transit' inventory, I must set the mu_hat value high enough to offset these 1021 phantom units and still trigger an order to cover future demand plus safety stock.mu_hat is calculated as ((Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Units) = (90 * 3) + 1021 = 1291. Sigma_hat is set to cover the 20-30% volatility seen during the recent recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stabilized: Avg demand (P27-P30) is 90 units/week (recovery from summer floor of 30). Total confirmed phantom in-transit inventory remains 1021 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' has stabilized in a post-summer recovery regime, averaging approximately 90 units/week over the last 4 periods (P27-P30). The 'In-transit' figure of 1209 units is heavily compromised by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24), totaling 1021 units. This leaves an actual reliable pipeline of only 188 units (P26, P30, P31). To ensure the OR engine triggers necessary orders despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the (1+L) demand requirement plus an offset that 'neutralizes' the 1021 lost units. With L set to the calculation method (reflecting an actual mean near 2), the inventory target is calibrated to provide a high service level for the 90 units/week demand while ignoring the phantom stock.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stabilized: Avg demand (P27-P30) is 90 units/week. Total confirmed phantom in-transit inventory remains 1021 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24). Actual reliable pipeline is 188 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' has stabilized into a secondary regime post-summer recovery, averaging ~89 units/period over the last 6 periods (P27-P32). The logistics environment remains highly unstable with 1021 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24). These 'phantom' units are still counted in the system's in-transit total (1172 - 1021 = 151 actual units). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the current demand (90 units/week) and a lead time of 2, then add the count of phantom units to 'force' the engine to ignore them. Target base stock = (1+L)*90 + safety stock \u2248 350. By setting mu_hat explicitly to (Target + Phantom) / (1+L), we counteract the bias. With L=2, this implies a base stock around 1371 units to ensure the OR engine orders to cover actual demand despite the 1021 'phantom' units.

Carry-over insight: Phanton in-transit inventory remains at 1021 units. Current demand regime (P27-P32) is stable at ~90 units/period. Recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616006' (Heavy Basic Leggings) is in a fall stabilization/growth phase, moving from summer lows (~30 units/week) to a consistent September average of ~90 units/week, with a peak of 126 in Period 33. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total 'In-transit' shown is 1172, but the Carry-over Insights confirm 1,021 of these are 'phantom' units (lost shipments P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24). Consequently, the actual reliable pipeline is only 151 units (P26=111, P32=40). To ensure the OR engine triggers an order despite the high phantom in-transit count, I must significantly inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. For L=2, mu_hat represents demand across 3 periods (L+1). With demand around 90-100 units, expected demand is ~300. To offset the 1,021 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1321 (300 + 1021). This forces the base_stock (mu_hat + safety stock) above the total reported in-transit of 1172, triggering a replenishment for the current demand regime. L is set to 2 based on recent average arrival patterns (P28-P32).

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P27-P33) is ~90-100 units/period, showing seasonal recovery from summer troughs. Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 1,021 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' has stabilized in a post-summer recovery regime, with Period 27-34 averaging ~97 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 1372 units is severely inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24), totaling 1021 units. Another order (P26, 111 units) is now 8 periods old and officially lost, increasing phantom inventory to 1132 units. The only reliable units in the pipeline are P32 (40 units) and P34 (200 units), totaling 240 units. Since the OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (1372) from the base stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to offset these 1132 phantom units. Targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~300 units) plus the phantom units (1132), I set mu_hat to 1432. This ensures the OR engine (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculates a needed order of approx 60 units (1432 - 1372).

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory increased to 1132 units as P26 (111 units) is now 8 periods old and confirmed lost. Stable autumn demand regime (P27-P34) confirmed at ~95-100 units/week.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36, the total phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 1,132 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24, P26). These units will never arrive but remain in the OR engine's pipeline calculation. To counter this, I am using explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat values. The current demand regime (Autumn) is stable, with an average demand of approximately 95 units per week over the last 9 periods (P27-P35). Lead times are volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I've set L explicitly to 3 to ensure sufficient safety stock. mu_hat is calculated as (L+1) * 95 = 380. I've set sigma_hat to reflect the moderate weekly demand variance observed in the autumn regime (~15 units/week), scaled by sqrt(L+1). By using explicit values, I bypass the OR engine's reliance on a pipeline that includes 1,132 non-existent units, forcing it to order based on actual demand needs.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' is currently stable in an autumn regime. Analyzing the results from Period 27 to Period 36, the average demand is 94.2 units/week (standard deviation ~17). Period 37 is late October, where demand for leggings usually remains consistent or slightly increases before winter. The logistics system continues to show high instability; currently, 1,132 units are confirmed as 'phantom' in-transit (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24, P26). The actual \u2018real\u2019 pipeline inventory consists of P34 (200 units), which is now in its intended arrival window (L=2) but hasn't arrived in the P36 conclude message. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 10-period regime (P27-P36) average (~95) multiplied by (1+L). To account for the 1,132 phantom units inflating the pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' L of 10 to force the OR engine to calculate a base_stock that triggers orders despite the phantom inventory, essentially bypassing the capped order logic that would otherwise block new procurement.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 1,132 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24, P26). Autumn demand regime (P27-P36) remains stable at ~95 units/week.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616006' (Heavy Basic Leggings) is in a steady autumn demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 95 units per week over the last 10 periods (P27-P36). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The primary challenge remains the severe 'phantom' in-transit inventory, which has increased to 1,132 units across seven lost orders (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24, P26). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (1,332 units) from its base stock calculation, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset this phantom stock. Total pipeline (1,332) minus phantom stock (1,132) leaves a 'real' pipeline of 200 units (from P34), which is currently overdue (ordered P34, now P38). I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to force the OR engine to recognize more demand than actually exists, effectively 'neutralizing' the phantom 1,132 units so that a sufficient order is generated to cover the upcoming 3 periods (L+1) of actual demand (~285-300 units).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, entering the late autumn/winter season. Demand for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' has been stable since September (Period 27 onwards), averaging approximately 90-100 units/week. Recent arrivals (P30, P32, P35, P36) show actual lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods, averaging close to the promised L=2. The dominant issue is the extreme 'phantom' in-transit inventory. As of Period 38, the In-transit total is 1,500 units. My historical tracking (carried over since P5) identifies 1,132 of these units as lost: P1(168), P3(197), P10(254), P14(173), P17(200), P24(29), and P26(111). Furthermore, P34 (200 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived, making it likely lost. Only P38 (168 units) is realistically in the pipeline. With 0 on-hand inventory and the OR controller seeing 1,500 units in-transit, it will not order unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the 1,332 phantom units. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*100 + 1332 to force the backend to place an order that covers current demand while ignoring the lost shipments. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals suggest the 2-period average is holding.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total phantom in-transit inventory increased to 1,332 units as P34 (200 units) is now 4 periods old and confirmed lost. Autumn demand regime remains stable (~95 units/week).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. The demand regime for 'Jersey Basic Leggings' has stabilized at an average of ~85-95 units/week throughout the autumn (P27-P38 average \u2248 92). The logistics environment is notoriously unreliable. Total 'phantom' in-transit inventory is now 1,332 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24, P26, P34). These are units that the OR engine believes exist but will never arrive. To ensure the backend triggers orders despite this phantom pipeline, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock (approx (L+1) * demand) and add the phantom count to it. For P40: L=2, demand=92, base_stock_target = (3 * 92) = 276. Adding 1,332 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1,608. This forces the engine to recognize that current on-hand (0) and real pipeline (P38, P39 = 348 units) are insufficient. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high lead-time volatility observed (L varies between 1 and 3).

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 1,332 units. Autumn demand regime is stable at ~90-95 units/week. Logistics remain volatile with frequent lost shipments (~50% loss rate historically).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 1,855 units. Based on historical tracking, 1,332 of these units are 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24, P26, and P34). The remaining 523 units consist of P38 (168), P39 (180), and P40 (175). None of these have arrived yet as they are within or just at the promised lead time window (L=2). Demand has recently softened from the ~95 units/week autumn regime to ~54 units/week over the last two periods (P39-P40), suggesting the start of a late-November dip. I am setting L to 'calculate' to account for recent lead time variability (range 1-3). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (covering P36-P40) to capture the recent softening while maintaining enough stock to cover the established autumn average, as 54 may be a short-term outlier. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will subtract the 1,855 'In-transit' units from the base stock; since 1,332 are phantom, this typically results in under-ordering. However, given the high loss rate and current zero stock, explicit adjustments or using recently observed demand to set the base stock is necessary to ensure the backend triggers a new order despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom in-transit inventory remains 1,332 units. Demand has dipped to ~54 units/week in the last two periods (P39-P40) following a stable autumn regime of 95.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-25. The autumn demand regime of ~95 units recently shifted downward in November to ~55 units/period (P39-P41). This represents a seasonal transition or late-autumn trough. Logistics remain hazardous. We must account for 'phantom' in-transit inventory, which is inventory the OR backend thinks is coming but is actually lost. Total phantom inventory is 1,500 units (P1: 168, P3: 197, P10: 254, P14: 173, P17: 200, P24: 29, P26: 111, P34: 200, plus P38: 168 which is now 4 periods old with L=2 and likely lost). Total in-transit is 1675, with 1500 phantom, leaving only 175 units (from P40) as reliable pipeline. With on-hand at 125 and demand at ~55, we have roughly 2 periods of stock. However, since the OR engine uses total (including phantom) in-transit to calculate orders, the base_stock must be significantly inflated to force a new order. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers 3 periods of expected demand (approx 165 units) PLUS the 1500 phantom units to counteract the backend's deduction of lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: P38 order (168 units) is now 4 periods old and confirmed lost. Total phantom in-transit inventory is 1,500 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the actual on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 1675 units is heavily distorted by 1500 'phantom' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24, P26, P34, P38). The true reliable pipeline consists only of P40 (175 units), ordered 3 periods ago and likely to arrive soon. Demand has been volatile: after a dip in Nov (~55), it spiked to 129 in P42, possibly signaling early December/holiday demand for leggings. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover for the 1500 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) at approximately 300 units (100 units/week), and then add the 1500 units of lost pipeline to the target, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 1800. This triggers the necessary procurement by compensating for the stalled in-transit figures.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, on-hand inventory is 129 units. The In-transit pool is 1706 units, but analysis indicates 1500 units are 'phantom' stock from lost orders (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24, P26, P34, P38). The actual reliable pipeline contains only 206 units from P43. Demand has recently softened, averaging ~52 units over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), down from the autumn average of ~95. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this deceleration. Lead time has been fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; using 'calculate' allows the engine to use the historical average of successful deliveries. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for higher volatility observed during the autumn-to-winter transition.

Carry-over insight: Lesser demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P39-P43 is 52 units/week, down ~45% from the autumn regime (95 units/week). Phantom in-transit inventory remains 1,500 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616006' (Jersey Basic Leggings) is in a logistics-heavy environment with a high shipment loss rate. Currently, there are 1,500 units of 'phantom' inventory (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24, P26, P34, P38) that will likely never arrive, yet they inflate the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. To counteract this, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to trigger necessary orders. Demand has shifted from an autumn average of ~95 units to a lower winter regime of ~52 units/week (P39-P44 average). However, simply setting mu_hat based on this lower demand would fail to place orders because the system believes the 1,500 phantom units are still coming. To force the base stock above the current pipeline (OH 84 + IT 1706 = 1790), I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value of 1,850. This ensures the backend recognizes a deficit and places an order to cover actually fulfillable demand while accounting for the inaccessible 'phantom' stock. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P39 at L=2, P40 at L=3) align with the promised L=2 on average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5510.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, demand spiked significantly to 356 units (likely due to festive/pre-Christmas shopping given the date of 2019/12/16), completely exhausting the 290 units on-hand. The current date is 2019/12/23 (Period 46). Logistics instability remains a critical issue; total phantom (lost) in-transit inventory is confirmed at 1,500 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24, P26, P34, P38). Recent actual lead times have stabilized around 2-3 periods. To account for the 'phantom' units that the OR backend incorrectly views as available pipeline, I am setting an explicit 'mu_hat'. The recent base demand regime (excluding the holiday spike) was ~52 units/week, but the recent spike suggests we need to protect against higher seasonal volatility. I'll set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of the increased demand and add a buffer for the 1,500 units of lost inventory that the backend is subtracting from my order calculation. Total In-transit is 1652, of which only 152 (from P45) is likely real. Effectively, the OR backend sees 1500 'phantom' units. To force an order that compensates for the out-of-stock and the lost pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 1,500 units of fake inventory. Setting mu_hat to 1800 to ensure a robust order is placed to restock after the Christmas sell-out.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Major demand spike observed in Period 45 (356 units) due to Christmas season. Logistics reliability remains low with 1,500 units of verified lost shipments creating 'phantom' in-transit inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, right after the Christmas peak (P45: 356 units). Period 46 demand was 180, significantly higher than the low-season average of 52, but lower than the peak, suggesting the post-holiday taper. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 2047 units, but 1500 of these are verified lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P24, P26, P34, P38). This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 547 units (P45: 152, P46: 395). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 1500 'phantom' units, mu_hat must be adjusted upward. I am setting L to 2 (promised), and mu_hat using 'explicit' to account for (L+1) = 3 periods of expected demand. Given the holiday taper (180 recently), I estimate demand for the next 3 weeks at approximately 150, 100, and 80 (avg ~110), totaling 330 units. To offset the 1500 phantom units, I add them to this forecast (330 + 1500 = 1830). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of the recent holiday transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-Christmas demand tapering observed: P45 (356), P46 (180). Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 1,500 units.
