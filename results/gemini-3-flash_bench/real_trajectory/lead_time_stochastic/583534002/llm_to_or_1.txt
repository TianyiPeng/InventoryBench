Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Joggers in lightweight sweatshirt fabric'. The available history shows a clear downward trend in demand from early January (367 units) to early February (125 units), indicating a post-holiday/early-year cooling period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use recent_N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the most recent, lower demand levels (avg ~175) rather than the higher January peaks, ensuring we don't over-order into a declining trend. L is set to 'default' (2). The OR backend will calculate the order based on (1+L)=3 periods of demand coverage.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the product description (Joggers/Jersey Basic) and the historical demand, we see a declining trend from early January (367 units) to early February (125 units). Last period (P1) demand was 123. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The order placed in P1 (253 units) is in-transit and expected to arrive in P3. There is currently 0 on-hand inventory, leading to missed sales in P1 (demand 123, sold 0). To stabilize the forecast around the recent lower demand levels while accounting for the lead time, I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the post-holiday baseline, and L=default (2). mu_hat needs to cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is Women's Jersey Joggers. Historical demand data shows a significant drop from January (avg ~221) to early February (125). However, in periods 1 and 2, observed demand was 123 and 165 respectively, suggesting a slight recovery or stabilization around a lower mean than the January peak. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (253 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (this period). Consequently, 'Period 3 conclude' (visible next period) should show an arrival. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in P1 and P2. The pipeline (In-transit: 492) consists of orders from P1 (253) and P2 (239). I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (P1, P2 + 3 most recent historicals) to capture this lower volume regime while ensuring the OR engine targets enough stock to cover the predicted demand during the (L+1) window. I will use the default promised lead time as there is no evidence yet to suggest a delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product 'Joggers' is a basic garment. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) were 367, 213, 219, 181, 125, while the recent 3 periods (Feb 11 to Feb 25) showed 123, 165, and 82. This indicates a downward trend from January peaks. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because all orders are still in transit. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order from P1 (ordered 2019/2/11) should arrive during P3 and be visible in 'P3 conclude', but it is not listed as arrived. This suggests either a lead time drift (L=3+) or a delay. However, per the 'Critical Timing Example', the P1 order (L=2) should arrive during P3 and be visible in 'P3 conclude'. Since 'P3 conclude' shows arrived=0, the lead time is likely at least 3 periods. I will set L=3 via explicit method to account for this delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers the extended pipeline. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 3 periods average is 123.33. For sigma_hat, the volatility is moderate. I will use recent_N=3 for both to reflect the most current decreased demand regime.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is Women's Jersey Joggers. Historical demand shows a declining trend: 367, 213, 219, 181, 125, 123, 165, 82, 51. The most recent 3-4 periods (P1-P4) show significantly lower demand (avg ~105) compared to the initial January samples. In Period 4, we received the order from Period 2 (239 units) after a 2-period lead time, confirming the promised lead time holds. The order from Period 1 (253 units) is conspicuously missing; as it should have arrived in Period 3 (2+1 delay), it is now 2 periods overdue and likely lost. On-hand is 188, and in-transit is 325 (comprising the possibly lost P1 order of 253, plus P3's 55 and P4's 17). To mitigate the risk of the P1 order being lost while accounting for the downward demand trend, I will set L to the default (2). I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the recent lower demand levels (avg ~105) to avoid overstocking holding costs ($1/unit). I will use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Potential shipment loss: Period 1 order (253 units) hasn't arrived by Period 5 (expected Period 3). Recent demand regime (P1-P4) significantly lower than Jan/Feb (avg ~105 vs ~200+).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019-03-18), we are managing 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Joggers'. Demand in the last two periods (P4: 51, P5: 146) shows higher volatility compared to P1-P3 (avg ~123). Specifically, the P5 demand of 146 suggests a potential rebound or stabilization after a low P4. Regarding logistics: The Period 1 order (253 units) is now 3 periods past its expected arrival (promised lead time 2, now at 5), and is highly likely lost. The Period 2 order (239) arrived on time in Period 4. The Period 3 order (55) was due in Period 5 but has not arrived; however, one period of delay is not yet definitive for a loss. Current on-hand is low (42). To protect against the loss of the P1 shipment and the delay of the P3 shipment, I will use recent_N for demand to capture the current regime more accurately (N=5 covers the observed activity since P1). I'll stick to 'calculate' for lead time to allow the OR engine to average the successful P2 shipment while I monitor the potential P3 delay.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Shipment from Period 1 (253 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed, promised 2). Shipment from Period 3 (55 units) is currently 1 period overdue.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), the product (Womens Joggers) shows a Stock-Out condition. On-hand inventory is 0. History analysis: 1) The Period 1 order (253 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods passed). 2) The Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2). 3) The Period 3 order (55 units) is now 2 periods overdue (Expected P5, currently P7). 4) The Period 4 order (17 units) is 1 period overdue (Expected P6). Since P1 was lost and subsequent orders (P3, P4) are overdue, I am adjusting L to 'explicit' = 3 to reflect the current supply chain instability and prevent the OR engine from underestimating the pipeline requirement. Demand context: Post-Feb demand (P1-P6) has averaged 119.6 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P4-P6) averaged 116 units. However, we are entering the spring season (late March). I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the post-winter regime while maintaining safety stock (sigma_hat recent_N=6) to cushion against the current high stock-out risk and delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Supply chain instability confirmed. P1 order lost; P3 and P4 orders are currently 2 and 1 periods overdue respectively. Lead time reflects a shift from 2 to at least 3 periods or total loss.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. The product is Women's Joggers. Historical demand has transitioned from a low of 51 (Period 4) to 187 (Period 7), showing a clear upward trend as spring progresses. Average demand over the last 4 weeks is ~134 units/period. Supply chain reliability is highly compromised: Period 1 order (253) is definitely lost; Period 3 order (55) is 3 periods overdue; Period 4 order (17) is 2 periods overdue; Period 6 order (42) should have arrived this period (Period 8) but status is only seen in Period 9. Given the missing shipments and high demand (187) last period, we have 0 on-hand. We must assume a longer lead time to cushion against delays and set a higher safety factor. I will explicitely set L=3 (one period higher than promised) to force the OR engine to account for a longer pipeline, and use recent_N=4 for demand to capture the rising trend (avg 134).

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Demand increasing into spring (134 avg last 4 periods, peaking at 187). Severe supply chain failure: P1 order lost; P3, P4, and P6 orders are significantly delayed or lost. Operational lead time effectively 3+ periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $221.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we saw a sudden influx of inventory: the Period 6 order (42 units) arrived with a lead time of 2, and the Period 7 order (187 units) arrived with a lead time of 1. This resolves the immediate stockout, but confirms significant supply chain volatility. The orders from Period 1 (253 units), Period 3 (55 units), and Period 4 (17 units) are now effectively confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, as orders from Periods 6 and 7 have already arrived. Current on-hand is 139 units. Pipeline inventory is 79 (from Period 8). Demand is showing a rising trend as we move into April (spring joggers), but remains volatile (90 last week, but 187 two weeks ago). Given the high delivery uncertainty and the lost shipments, I will use an explicit L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a wider safety window. mu_hat will use the mean of the last 4 periods (approx 143/week) scaled for (1+L)=4 periods. sigma_hat will be set explicitly to account for the high variance in both demand and lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Supply chain 'unblocked' but erratic; P6 and P7 arrived while P1, P3, P4 are lost. Effective lead time varies between 1-3. Demand regime shifted higher in late March (avg ~145).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. The product is lightweight sweatshirt joggers, which are seasonally relevant for spring. Comparing historical demand: Jan/Feb early samples averaged ~200+, whereas Feb-Apr has shown significant fluctuations with an average around 120-130 despite some spikes (P7 demand was 187, but P8/P9 fell to 90 and 59). The supply chain remains unreliable: P1, P3, and P4 orders (totaling approx 325 units) are definitely lost as they are many weeks past the promised 2-period lead time. However, P6 arrived in 2 periods and P7 arrived in 1 period, suggesting that while some shipments are lost, those that do make it through follow the 1-2 period lead time. On-hand inventory is 80, with 528 units in-transit (reflecting aggressive ordering in P8/P9 to compensate for losses). I will set L to 2 (promised) as recent successful deliveries were 1-2 periods. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the volatile spring demand (~105 avg) and apply the (1+L) multiplier. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for this high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Shipments P1 (253), P3 (55), and P4 (17) are confirmed lost and will not arrive. Supply chain shows binary outcome: shipments either arrive within 1-2 periods or are lost entirely.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, 2019. The SKU is lightweight joggers, a staple item. Demand analysis shows a significant drop-off in the last two periods (59 and 44) compared to the late March peak (~150+). This may indicate that the spring peak is subsiding or a temporary lull. On-hand inventory is currently high (239 units), and we have 325 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4 are confirmed lost, so effectively we are looking at later orders). Based on the carry-over insights, P1, P3, and P4 are lost. Recent arrivals (P8 and P9) followed lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively, suggesting the supply chain has stabilized for new orders. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for demand to capture the recent deceleration while still accounting for earlier April volume. For lead time, I'll return to 'default' (2) as recent deliveries have met or exceeded the promised 2-period window, and the lost shipments are now fully accounted for as losses rather than delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed in mid-April (avg ~52 units over P9-P10, down from ~145 units in late March). Supply chain stabilized with recent orders arriving in 1-2 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU 'Jersey Basic Joggers' is experiencing a significant demand deceleration. Since the peak in late March (Period 7: 187 units), demand has dropped sequentially for four consecutive periods: 90, 59, 44, and 34. The average demand over the last three periods (P9-P11) is approximately 45.6 units, compared to the overall historical average. On-hand inventory is 205 units, which already covers approximately 4.5 periods of current demand. Additionally, 325 units are in-transit (orders from Period 10 or later are not visible but pipeline is full relative to demand). Supply chain stability has improved, with recent arrivals (P8, P9) arriving in 1-2 periods, although older orders (P1, P3, P4) remain lost. Given the current surplus (205 units on-hand vs. ~45 demand), I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime (using recent_N=4 to capture the slowdown) and reset Lead Time to the promised 2 periods to avoid over-ordering, as current stock is more than sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed: Avg demand dropped from ~145 in late March to ~45 in April (-69%). Current inventory (205) is significantly above current demand requirements.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6). Demand for the 'Jersey Basic Joggers' has confirmed a sustained downward shift throughout April and into early May. The last 4 periods show demands of 59, 44, 34, and 33 units respectively, suggesting a new mean demand of approximately 42 units per period, down from peaks in March. On-hand inventory is 172 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4 periods of demand. Additionally, There are 325 units currently in-transit (orders placed during periods of supply chain uncertainty) which will likely result in a significant inventory surplus upon arrival. Since the supply chain has stabilized to arrival within 1-2 periods for recent successful shipments, I am setting L to the prometed 2 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=4 to capture the low-demand spring regime. The goal is to avoid ordering further units until the current inventory and massive pipeline are depleted.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '583534002' (Women's Jersey Joggers) has entered a stable low-demand regime in May, with demand consistently between 33-35 units over the last three periods (P11-P13). This follows a sharp decline from the late March/early April peak. Currently, on-hand inventory is 137 units, which is roughly 4 weeks of current demand coverage. Additionally, there are 325 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4 are confirmed lost, but recent orders have shown improved reliability). Given the current on-hand stock and the low demand rate, the system does not need to place new orders. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the recent average of ~34 units using recent_N=3. The lead time (L) remains at the promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P8, P9) arrived in 1-2 periods. This approach will allow the high existing inventory to deplete naturally while preventing excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand stability at ~34 units/period confirmed for May (P11-P13), representing a floor after the April decline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for these jersey joggers has stabilized at a significantly lower level (mean ~34 units/period) throughout May (P11-P14), following a steep decline in April. On-hand inventory is 119 units, which covers approximately 3.5 periods of current demand. Additionally, there are 325 units in-transit (orders from P10-P14 were 0, so these represent older unresolved entries or system artifacts, though the game log shows orders P1-P4 were the primary losses). Regardless, the current on-hand stock is more than sufficient for the immediate (L+1) horizon. I will use the recent 4-period window to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend does not over-order based on high Q1 demand. Lead time has stabilized at 1-2 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for 'Jersey Basic Joggers' has stabilized at a significantly lower level following the post-winter decline. Over the last five periods (P11-P15), demand has averaged 28.6 units (34, 33, 35, 18, 23), confirming a 'summer floor' regime significantly lower than the ~145 observed in late March. The supply chain has stabilized with lead times of 1-2 periods for recent arrivals, though P1, P3, and P4 are long-confirmed lost. Current on-hand inventory is 96 units, which covers approximately 3.3 periods of current demand. Including the 325 units in-transit (ordered in P10 or earlier and likely including significant lost units not yet purged from the frontend counter, though the backend logic uses \u03bc\u0302 and L to determine orders relative to pipeline), the inventory position is high relative to the slow sales. I will set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 using recent_N=5 to capture this new low-demand floor, and set L to default (2 periods) as \ucd5c\uadfc arrivals suggest the supply chain has returned to promised levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor established for late May/early June: Avg 28.6 units/period (P11-P15). Supply chain stabilized at L=1 or 2 for current orders.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '583534002' (Women's Joggers) has entered a stable low-demand summer phase. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand has averaged 26.3 units/period, down significantly from the spring peak (~145). The current on-hand inventory is 81 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of the current demand regime. With a promised lead time of 2 periods (L=2), the on-hand stock is sufficient to cover the 3-period risk window (L+1). There has been no order activity since Period 9 due to this surplus. The supply chain has stabilized, with recent historical arrivals showing lead times of 1-2 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the current stable low-demand regime, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat to maintain safety buffers while avoiding unnecessary over-ordering.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for these jersey joggers has stabilized at a low summer floor, with an average of approximately 22 units per period over the last 5 weeks (P13-P17). On-hand inventory is 61 units, and there are 325 units currently in-transit (orders placed in very early periods that were flagged as likely lost but technically remained in the piping, or backend adjustments). Given the current holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, the target service level is 80%. My priorities are to avoid unnecessary ordering while demand is low and inventory is sufficient, especially since the in-transit volume is massive relative to demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the summer demand floor, and keep L at the default promised lead time of 2 as recent successful deliveries (P8-P10) arrived in 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor for June confirmed at ~22 units/period (P13-P17). Total pipeline inventory (325) significantly exceeds current seasonal needs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is lightweight sweatshirt fabric joggers, which is entering a low-demand summer season. Historical demand has consistently decreased from an average of ~145 units in late March to a stable 'floor' of approximately 21 units per period over the last five weeks (P14-P18). On-hand inventory is currently 50 units, and the in-transit pipeline contains 325 units from historical orders (though some of these are likely the early-period losses mentioned in carry-over insights). Even accounting for losses, the current pipeline-to-demand ratio is extremely high (pipeline + on-hand covers many months of current demand), making the risk of stockout nearly zero. My priority remains to prevent any further orders by keeping parameters low, allowing the system to burn through the excess inventory. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current low-demand regime (~21 units/period).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey jogger (Womens Everyday Basics). Analysis of the demand history shows a significant and sustained decline since the March peak (avg ~145 units). Late May and June demand has plummeted to a floor of roughly 13 units per period (P16-P19 observed demand: 15, 20, 11, 5). On-hand inventory is 45 units, and in-transit is 325 units. Even though the in-transit units contain historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4 total 325 units, which matches the current 'In-Transit' figure exactly), the current on-hand 45 units still covers ~3-4 weeks of demand at the current average. To prevent over-ordering while demand is at its seasonal minimum, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this low floor, and use the default lead time (L=2) as recent operational stability has returned. This will result in a low base stock, effectively pausing new orders until the existing on-hand is consumed.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor for June/July revised down further to ~13 units/period (P16-P19) from previous ~22 average. Pipeline inventory of 325 units remains reconciled as the sum of lost shipments P1, P3, and P4.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are entering the peak of summer. The product is lightweight sweatshirt fabric joggers, which typically sees its lowest demand in hot July/August months. Historical demand confirms a significant downward trend: from ~145 in late March, to ~34 in May, to ~13 in June, and reaching a floor of 5 units/period in the last two weeks (P19-P20). The 'In-transit' figure of 325 units is correctly identified as the sum of lost shipments from Periods 1 (253), 3 (55), and 4 (17). These will never arrive and will not satisfy demand. Current on-hand inventory is 40 units. Given the demand is now very low (avg ~5), 40 units provides approximately 8 weeks of coverage. Therefore, no new order is required. I will set mu_hat to reflect the new seasonal floor (recent_N=3 for the last 3 periods) and sigma_hat to reflect the low volatility of this floor.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor for July reached: avg ~5 units/period (P19-P20). Inventory on-hand (40) is sufficient for ~8 weeks of current demand levels.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8th. The product is a 'lightweight sweatshirt fabric' jogger, which is experiencing a significant seasonal decline as summer progresses. Demand has dropped from ~35 units/period in May to a very low plateau of 5 units/period over the last three weeks (P19-P21). On-hand inventory is 35 units, which provides approximately 7 weeks of cover at the current demand rate (35/5 = 7). The 'In-transit' figure of 325 units is confirmed to be composed of lost shipments from periods 1, 3, and 4 (253+55+17 = 325) and should be ignored for actual supply planning. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00) and the current inventory buffer during a low-demand season, no new orders are required. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current 5-unit demand floor and setting L to explicit 2 to match the promised lead time, ensuring the OR backend's base-stock calculation remains below the current on-hand plus (phantom) pipeline levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor of ~5 units/period established for July (P19-P21), confirming continued seasonal decline from the June average of ~13.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for 'Joggers in lightweight sweatshirt fabric' has reached a seasonal low, averaging approximately 7.5 units over the last four periods (P19-P22). With 20 units currently on-hand and a demand floor of ~5-15 units, the current inventory covers at least two periods of demand. The 'In-transit' quantity of 325 units is correctly identified in carry-over insights as the sum of confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (253), Period 3 (55), and Period 4 (17). Because the OR backend subtracts this pipeline inventory (325) from the calculated base stock, and the base stock for a product selling ~7.5 units/week will be significantly lower than 325, the system will naturally order 0 units. I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L) to reflect the current stable low-demand regime and recent shipment reliability (1-2 periods). Specifically, N=4 for mu_hat captures the July floor (5, 5, 5, 15).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '583534002' (Women's Jersey Joggers) is currently in a seasonally low demand period for the late July/summer phase. Historical demand has settled into a low regime: P19-P23 show demand values of 5, 5, 5, 15, and 11, averaging approximately 8.2 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 9 units, which covers about one period of the current mean demand. Although the 'In-transit' figure is 325, this is confirmed by carry-over insights to be the sum of lost shipments (P1: 253, P3: 55, P4: 17 = 325 units), meaning the actual operational pipeline is empty. The OR backend needs to place a small order to stabilize stock. I will use the last 5 periods (P19-P23) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they represent the most recent July demand regime. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time (L) as recent successful arrivals (P8, P10) showed 1-2 periods, which aligns with the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime confirmed at ~8 units/period (P19-P23), significantly lower than the June average of ~13 units. The pipeline inventory (325) remains confirmed as lost stock from early periods (P1, P3, P4).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/29. Demand for this SKU (Womens lightweight sweatshirt joggers) has consistently declined from a peak of ~187 in late March to a current July floor of ~8 units/period (avg P19-P24). On-hand inventory is now 7 units, which essentially matches the current average weekly demand. The in-transit inventory of 325 units is confirmed lost (orders from P1, P3, and P4), but because the OR backend treats in-transit as valid pipeline, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to trigger an order. To ensure 7 on-hand + new order covers 3 periods of demand (L=2 + 1), I set mu_hat to 350. Since base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock, and the backend subtracts pipeline (325), a mu_hat of 350 (plus safety stock) will force an order of ~25-30 units, which matches roughly 3-4 weeks of current demand (~8/week) to replenish the depleted on-hand stock and provide a buffer for the upcoming August/September season.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime confirmed at ~8 units/period (P19-P24), significantly lower than the June average of ~13 units. The pipeline inventory (325) remains confirmed as lost stock from early periods (P1, P3, P4).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/08/05), we are in a low-demand summer phase for this lightweight sweatshirt jogger (Womens Everyday Basics). Demand over the last 7 periods (P19-P25) has averaged 7.3 units. The on-hand inventory is now 0. The in-transit inventory is 351, but 325 of these units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost, leaving a real pipeline of 26 units (ordered last period). To prevent a stockout, I need to place an order now. I estimated demand mean at 10 units/period to account for potential late-summer variability. With a promised lead time of 2, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~30 units). Since only 26 are truly in-transit and 0 are on-hand, I am setting parameters to trigger the OR engine to order a small buffer. mu_hat is set to 30 (3 * 10) and sigma_hat is set to 10 (approx sqrt(3)*5.8) to maintain a healthy service level while demand is at its floor.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are dealing with jersey joggers, a product whose demand has significantly tapered off through July and August (average ~5-8 units/period). However, the system shows 0 units on-hand and 351 in-transit. Crucially, 325 of those in-transit units are from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (confirmed lost in carry-over insights), meaning the 'true' pipeline inventory is only 26 units from the order placed in Period 25. That Period 25 order is expected to arrive this period or next (L=1 or 2). Given current demand is very low (4 units last period), the 26 units in transit cover approximately 4-5 periods of demand. I will maintain a low base stock to avoid high holding costs as we approach late August, while using 'explicit' L to account for the true available pipeline. I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the low summer demand regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19 (Late August). The product is lightweight joggers, which are part of 'Everyday Basics'. Demand for such items typically transitions from a summer floor into a back-to-school or autumnal uptick as the weather cools. Recent demand has stabilized around early August levels: P25-P27 demand was 8, 4, and 13 units respectively (avg ~8.3). On-hand inventory is 13 units. The pipeline (325 units) remains confirmed lost from P1, P3, and P4, and should be ignored by the OR controller. I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure it matches the promised and observed lead time of P25's shipment. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the stable late-summer floor (~8 units/week) while remaining responsive to the slight uptick seen in P27 (13 units). This approach balances holding costs against the potential for late August demand recovery before the fall season formally begins.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand floor confirmed: Avg demand for P23-P27 is ~7.6 units/period. The pipeline (325 units) remains effectively write-off stock and does not contribute to available supply.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26), and the SKU (Jersey Joggers) is an everyday basic. Demand has stabilized at a low late-summer level, with the average demand over the last 6 periods (P23-P28) being approximately 8 units per period. The pipeline inventory of 325 units consists of orders from P1, P3, and P4 which are long-lost; however, the OR backend includes all 'in-transit' units in its logic. To prompt an order when current on-hand (8 units) is insufficient for the next 3 weeks of demand, mu_hat must be set high enough to overcome the phantom 325 units in pipeline. Given the low current demand, and the risk of the OR engine suppressing orders due to the phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' logic to target a base stock that covers expected demand (~8 units/week) over the review and lead time (3 weeks total). An explicit value of 350 for mu_hat (325 phantom + ~25 units for demand) is necessary to force the system to see beyond the lost shipments and maintain stock for the upcoming weeks.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic' jogger, which typically sees a seasonal demand increase as we enter autumn (September). Current on-hand inventory is 4 units. Period 29 demand was 4 units. Historical demand from early 2019 (Jan/Feb) was significantly higher (range 125-367). Recent demand (P23-P29) has been very low, averaging ~7 units/period. However, given the product type (sweatshirt fabric joggers) and the date (Sept 2), a seasonal uptick is likely. The pipeline inventory (349) is comprised of 325 units confirmed lost from P1/P3/P4 and a recent order of 24 units from P29. The OR engine needs to account for the seasonal transition. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the stable floor while allowing for the start of the autumn trend, but I will use the 'explicit' method for L to ensure the engine doesn't under-order due to the 'lost' pipeline units, effectively ignoring the 325 lost units by maintaining a tight stock cover.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal transition: demand for jersey joggers expected to rise from summer floor (~7 units). Pipeline inventory of 349 includes 325 units (P1, P3, P4) confirmed lost; only 24 units are active in-transit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 31 (Sept 9), which marks a seasonal transition for jersey joggers as cooler weather approaches. Historical demand for similar basics in early Feb was high (123-165 range). Current demand remains low (avg ~7 units over P23-P30), but we expect an uptick. Inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' total of 349 includes 325 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) that are confirmed lost. Only 24 units (ordered P29) are active, expected to arrive in Period 31 (visible in P32). To prepare for the seasonal rise, I will set mu_hat using a recent mean that includes the early September activity while allowing the OR backend to handle the safety stock via sigma_hat. I use N=8 to capture the most recent stable summer floor while acknowledging the slight variance. I will rely on the OR engine's service level calculation to buffer against the expected seasonal increase without manually over-ordering until the trend is confirmed.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal transition: First sign of demand recovery from summer lows (demand increased from 4 to 8 units in P30). Pipeline analysis: 325 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and should be treated as 0 for replenishment logic.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 16th. Demand for joggers (lightweight sweat fabric) is entering a seasonal recovery phase as we move from summer lows into autumn. Demand in Period 30 and 31 remained at 8 units, up from the summer floor of ~4-5. The pipeline inventory of 349 units is problematic: 325 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, while 24 units are in-transit from P29 (expected arrive P31 or P32). Since on-hand is 0 and the P29 order has not yet been confirmed as arrived in the P31 conclude message, I will assume it arrives during Period 32. To account for the 325 lost units that the OR backend mistakenly views as 'inventory', I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. I am forecasting a mean demand of 12 units per period for the upcoming cooling season. Total demand for (L+1) periods (where L=2) is 3 * 12 = 36. To offset the 325 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 36 + 325 = 361. sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the volatility of the seasonal pivot.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal recovery confirmed: demand increased from summer floor of ~5 to 8 units. Pipeline reconciliation: 325 units are lost (P1, P3, P4); only order from P29 (24 units) is active.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 33 (late September). Demand for jersey joggers is showing a seasonal recovery from the summer floor of ~7 units, with recent demand around 7-8 units. The supply chain has stabilized to a lead time of 1-2 periods for active orders. However, there is a major discrepancy in 'In-transit' stock: 325 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, yet they remain in the system's pipeline calculation. Only 34 units (ordered P32) and potentially 24 units (ordered P29) are active, though P29 is now potentially delayed/lost as well (4 periods elapsed). To force the OR engine to order despite the 'ghost' 325 units in the pipeline, I will use 'explicit' methods. I estimate L=2. Demand is trending upward for autumn; I will forecast a mean (mu) of 15 units per period to account for seasonal growth (total mu_hat = (1+L)*15 = 45). I'll set sigma_hat to reflect moderate volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal transition: demand recovery confirmed. Pipeline reconciliation: 325 units (P1, P3, P4) are permanently lost and must be bypassed by setting explicit OR parameters to ignore the 'ghost' pipeline and trigger new orders.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/9/30, where demand for jersey joggers (winter/autumn seasonal) is beginning to rise from summer lows. However, the system is blocked by a 'ghost' pipeline of 325 units (Orders from P1, P3, and P4) which have been confirmed lost since Period 10. To trigger an order and overcome this inventory distortion, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high. Actual in-transit inventory is 58 units (P29: 24 units, P32: 34 units), neither of which have arrived yet. Demand in the last two periods was 7 and 6 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and active pipeline at 58, I need to ensure the OR engine sees a requirement large enough to place an order despite the 383 total 'in-transit' units. I will set mu_hat to 450 to force a replenishment order that accounts for the lost stock and seasonal upturn, while keeping L at default (2) as recent arrivals (P25) adhered to promised lead times.

Carry-over insight: September demand recovery is slow but consistent (6-8 units/period); however, the 325 'ghost units' in the pipeline require explicit mu_hat manipulation to force the OR engine to order.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/07. We are managing 'Jersey Basic Joggers', which is a seasonal product entering autumn/winter. Historically, demand was high in Feb/Mar (100-200 units) and fell to single digits in July/Aug. We are now seeing a gradual transition out of the summer floor. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline inventory is 467 units, but 325 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, and the orders from P29 (24 units), P32 (34 units), and P34 (84 units) are the only active shipments. Total 'real' pipeline is 142 units. To trigger necessary replenishment for the autumn rise while bypassing the 325 'ghost units' that the OR engine counts as available supply, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. I estimate forecasted demand for the L+1 period (next 3 weeks) to be approximately 30-40 units total, but I will inflate mu_hat to 450 to offset the 325 lost units in the pipeline calculation (450 - 325 \u2248 125 effective base stock). Lead time is stable at 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: October seasonal transition: Demand for joggers is expected to increase as temperatures drop. Pipeline correction: 325 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed permanent losses; OR parameters must be adjusted upwards (explicit mu_hat) to force replenishment despite the visible pipeline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in mid-October. The product is 'Jersey Basic Joggers', which typically sees a significant demand increase during the autumn/winter season. While recent demand (P31-P35) has been low (~6 units/avg), we anticipate a seasonal uptrend. Our main challenge is the 'ghost pipeline' of 325 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) that are confirmed lost but still registered in the OR backend's logic. Current on-hand is 29 plus an active in-transit of 108 units (24 from P29 and 84 from P34). The P29 order is late (lead time was promised at 2), and P34 is still within the normal window. To ensure the OR engine maintains stock for the upcoming seasonal peak despite the ghost pipeline, I will use an explicit mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock level that ignores the 325 lost units. Total actual pipeline is 108. I set mu_hat explicitly to allow for the observed demand plus a seasonal buffer, effectively 'trumping' the pipeline deduction.

Carry-over insight: October seasonal transition: Demand for joggers is expected to increase as temperatures drop. Pipeline correction: 325 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed permanent losses; OR parameters must be adjusted upwards (explicit mu_hat) to force replenishment despite the visible pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21. The product is jersey joggers, which typically see increased demand during autumn and winter. Recent demand has been very low (4-8 units), but seasonality suggests a likely upturn. A critical issue is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 325 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) that are confirmed lost but still visible in the backend's 'In-transit' figure of 455. The actual active pipeline is only 106 units (P29: 24 (partially arrived/lost?), P34: 84, P36: 22). To bypass the ghost inventory and trigger necessary orders for the seasonal upturn, mu_hat must be set explicitly high enough to exceed the perceived pipeline (on-hand + ghost in-transit). I am setting mu_hat = 480 (calculated as roughly 160 units/period for L+1=3 periods) to ensure the OR logic places a replenishment order despite the 325 lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed that total In-transit (455) contains 325 units of 'ghost inventory' from P1, P3, and P4. Active pipeline is only 130 units. Explicit mu_hat manipulation is required to force orders until the ghost units are reconciled or bypassed.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), demand for jersey joggers is beginning to rise (demand jumped from 4 to 16 in P37) as we move into the colder season. The critical issue remains the 'ghost' pipeline: 325 units from P1, P3, and P4 are permanently lost but still reflect in the 'In-transit' total (506). The active pipeline consists of orders from P29 (24 units), P34 (84 units), P36 (22 units), and P37 (51 units), totaling 181 units. However, P29 (ordered 9 weeks ago) is now likely lost as well. Therefore, the truly active pipeline is likely just P34, P36, and P37 (157 units). Because the OR engine's capped base-stock policy subtracts the full pipeline (506 units) from the target, it will refuse to order unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the 325-unit ghost inventory. To maintain a safety stock of ~3-4 weeks (approx 60-80 units) on top of the ghost units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 480. This level signals to the backend that it needs to maintain a pipeline + on-hand balance that can handle the ghost units while still triggering fresh orders to meet the growing seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: P29 order (24 units) now 7 periods overdue; added to 'ghost' pipeline total (now 349 units lost). Demand recovery confirmed: 300% increase (16 vs 4) in P37 versus previous week, signaling start of winter seasonal peak for joggers.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4), the product (women's joggers) is entering its peak winter season. Demand recently spiked to 16 in P37, and although P38 was 4, seasonally demand remains in an upward trajectory compared to the summer floor. The pipeline of 455 units remains heavily distorted by 349 'ghost units' (P1: 253, P3: 55, P4: 17, P29: 24) which are confirmed lost or severely overdue and should not arrive. The active pipeline consists only of orders from P34 (84 units) and P36 (22 units), totaling 106 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 56. To ensure replenishment occurs despite the 349 ghost units registered in the OR backend's pipeline logic, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate forward-looking demand at ~25 units/period (reflecting winter seasonality), and with L=2, mu_hat (representing (1+L) periods of demand) would normally be 75. However, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the 349 ghost units. Setting mu_hat to 500 forces the backend to see a requirement that significantly exceeds the total recorded pipeline (455) and current on-hand (56), triggering an order to maintain safety stock for the winter peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Ghost pipeline total increased to 349 units (P1, P3, P4, P29). Demand entering winter seasonal peak for joggers; explicit mu_hat manipulation required to bypass lost units and maintain stock levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. The product is jersey joggers, currently entering a seasonal peak as temperatures drop. Demand in P39 was 10 units, following a spike of 16 in P37 (avg ~10 for the last 3 periods), much higher than the summer floor of ~4-5. Supply chain reconciliation: On-hand is 68. Total In-transit is 433. However, 'ghost' units from P1 (253), P3 (55), P4 (17), and now likely P29 (24) and potentially the P34 order (84) contribute to this volume. Total confirmed lost/severely overdue 'ghost' pipeline is 349 units (P1, P3, P4, P29). Subtracting this from the total In-transit (433 - 349 = 84), we find the active pipeline is 84 units (the order from P34). Lead times are erratic, varying between 1 and 3 periods. To bypass the OR engine's 'ghost' pipeline and ensure it triggers a needed order for the winter peak, I will use an explicit mu_hat. I'm projecting a demand of ~40 units across the review + lead period (3 periods total), but setting mu_hat to a value that exceeds the current active pipeline + on-hand (84+68=152) minus the ghost units. I'll set mu_hat explicitly to 550 to force an order that accounts for the ghost inventory distortion while preparing for higher winter demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed 'ghost' pipeline increased to 349 units (P1, P3, P4, P29). P34 order (84 units) is now 6 periods old and potentially lost as well, but not yet fully written off. Active seasonal demand for joggers is trending at ~10 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 67 units with a pipeline of 504 units. Critical analysis of the pipeline reveals that 325 units (P1, P3, P4) are long-term losses, and P29 (24 units) and P34 (84 units) are likely lost as well (now 12 and 7 periods overdue respectively), totaling 433 'ghost' units. The active pipeline is only 71 units (ordered P40). Current seasonal demand for joggers in mid-November is erratic (1 unit in P40, 10 in P39, 4 in P38, 16 in P37), averaging ~8 units over the last 4 periods. Because the OR engine counts all 504 in-transit units as available supply, it will not place a new order. To ensure availability for the winter season despite the ghost pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 465 (calculated as (1+L)*demand_forecast + ghost_units). This bridges the gap by making the target base stock sufficiently high to trigger a replenishment order of approximately 30-40 units, ensuring the system maintains at least 6-8 weeks of actual physical coverage while accounting for the ~433 lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Ghost pipeline confirmed at 433 units (P1, P3, P4, P29, P34). Demand remains seasonal for joggers (avg ~8 units) but requires explicit mu_hat manipulation to bypass the 433 units of lost stock that the OR engine incorrectly considers as arriving supply.

Current demand has been unusually low (avg ~4 units over P38-P41), but historical data from Jan/Feb (Period 1-4) showed demand levels between 125-367 units, suggesting a massive spike is imminent as the cold season fully sets in. A critical issue remains the 'ghost pipeline': of the 504 units currently in-transit, 433 units (from P1, P3, P4, P29, and P34) are confirmed or highly likely lost. The OR backend is blind to these losses and sees 504 units as 'incoming supply', which would normally suppress new orders. To bypass this and ensure we are stocked for the winter peak, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 650, which targets a base stock of roughly 650 units (assuming L=2, covering 3 periods). This value is calculated to exceed the ghost pipeline (433) plus current on-hand (65), forcing the system to place a substantial replenishment order to prepare for December/January demand. A lead time of 2 is maintained as the default, as recent successful deliveries (P36, P37) arrived in 1-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Ghost pipeline confirmed at 433 units; OR parameters must remain manually inflated (explicit mu_hat) to trigger orders until lost stock is reconciled or ignored by the backend.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (Dec 2), entering the peak winter season for joggers. Historical demand shows a significant spike in early January (367 units), and we must prepare for this. The current In-transit balance is 712 units. Crucially, 433 units are confirmed 'ghost units' (P1, P3, P4, P29, P34) that are lost shipments. The backend OR engine incorrectly counts these as coming supply, preventing it from ordering enough. Total perceived pipeline (712) - Ghost pipeline (433) = 279 actual units in transit (mostly from the large P42 order of 208 units). With 54 units on Hand and 279 arriving, we have 333 total available units against a looming Jan peak of ~360+ per week. To bypass the ghost stock, I am using an explicit mu_hat. I estimate we need a base stock of approximately 800 units to cover the multi-period lead time and the massive seasonal surge. Setting mu_hat to 800 (explicit) ensures the OR engine calculates (Base Stock - Pipeline) using the inflated target, forcing the necessary replenishment despite the 433-unit 'ghost' inventory bloat.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost pipeline total increased to 433 units (P1, P3, P4, P29, P34). Current In-transit (712) is severely decoupled from reality; explicit mu_hat manipulation is mandatory to sustain stock for the projected Jan peak (historically >350 units/period).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 583534002 (Jersey Joggers) is entering its peak seasonal demand period, as evidenced by historic January demand >350 units. We are currently at Period 44 (Dec 9). There is a massive 'ghost' pipeline of 433 units (orders P1, P3, P4, P29, P34) that are confirmed lost or significantly overdue and should not be expected. The current In-transit of 802 includes these 433 lost units, plus Period 42 (208) and Period 43 (161). To ensure we have stock for the January surge, we must bypass the ghost units. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to force the OR engine to maintain a base stock that covers the expected holiday/January peak. Given the historical data provided in the prompt (Jan 7: 367, Jan 14: 213, etc.), I am forecasting a weekly mean of 240 units. Over a 3-period horizon (L=2 + 1 review period), this requires mu_hat = 720 units. This 'inflation' is necessary to offset the 433 ghost units that the backend incorrectly subtracts from the order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Ghost pipeline remains 433 units. Preparing for Jan peak (historical mean ~240 units/week). Mu_hat set explicitly to 720 to bypass lost inventory and target a base stock sufficient for the seasonal surge.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December). Historical data shows a massive demand surge for this SKU (jersey joggers) in early January (Period 1 had 367 demand units, and the weeks prior to the game start were also high). Current demand is low (3 units in Period 44), but the seasonal peak is imminent. The system reports an 'In-transit' pipeline of 802 units. However, based on the carry-over history, 433 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P29, P34). This leaves an active pipeline of 369 units (orders from P42 for 208 units and P43 for 161 units). To prepare for the January surge where weekly demand can exceed 350 units, we need a base stock covering lead time (2-3 periods) plus the current period. Given the high 'ghost' inventory, the OR engine's formula [base_stock - pipeline] will result in zero orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the 433 lost units. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 750 to ensure we trigger a replenishment that bridges the gap between the currently active 369 units and the required safety stock for the ~350 units/week peak.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated: P34 order (84 units) is now 11 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total lost/ghost inventory is 433 units (P1, P3, P4, P29, P34). Current active pipeline consists only of P42 (208) and P43 (161).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (Dec 23), we are approaching the historical peak demand period (January) where demand for joggers previously spiked above 200-350 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 484 units, which appears high against recent low demand (avg <5 units), but is necessary to cover the anticipated seasonal surge. The In-transit total of 433 units is entirely comprised of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P29, P34) and must be bypassed. I am maintaining the mu_hat at 720 (explicitly) to target a base stock of roughly 700-800 units, ensuring that even with the ghost inventory being deducted by the backend, we maintain sufficient stock on-hand for the Period 48-52 peak. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P42, P43) arrived in 2-3 periods, aligning with the backend's expectations. \u03c3\u0302 is kept at 240 (explicit) to reflect the high volatility observed during previous seasonal shifts.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 47 (Dec 30), approaching the historical January peak. Historically, demand for this SKU (jersey joggers) spiked significantly in early January (Period 1 had 123 demand, and user data show Jan 2019 values >300). Current on-hand inventory is 480 units, which is a good buffer for the start of the surge. The In-transit total of 438 units is largely comprised of the 'ghost pipeline' (433 units from lost orders P1, P3, P4, P29, and P34). Because this ghost inventory is perceived as incoming supply by the OR engine, it will prevent natural ordering unless we maintain an inflated mu_hat. Given historical Jan weekly demand of ~200-350 units and a desired base stock to cover L+1 (3 periods), we need to bypass the 433 ghost units. Setting mu_hat to 1200 ensures the calculated base stock (approx 1200 + safety) stays well above the ghost pipeline + on-hand, allowing the system to maintain a healthy stock level through the peak. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: January Peak confirmed: Historical data (Jan 2019) shows demand surges to >350 units/period, requiring proactive stock positioning in late Dec. Ghost pipeline of 433 units (P1, P3, P4, P29, P34) is permanently lost.
