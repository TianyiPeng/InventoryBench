As we enter the week of 2019-02-11 (Period 1), there is no significant seasonal peak immediate, but spring approaching usually increases demand for 'sneaker socks' as people transition from boots. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive in P3. My target is to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 + current visibility gap). Total expected demand for 3 periods is ~115 units (37.6 * 3). Current inventory is 0.

However, we recently observed a massive spike: Period 1 demand was 44, and Period 2 demand jumped to 114. This date (late February) correlates with the onset of spring weather when consumers transition from boots/winter socks to low-cut 'sneaker socks'. I expect this higher demand regime to persist as spring progresses. Lead time is promised at 2 periods. Order placed in P1 (130 units) is expected to arrive during P3. Order placed in P2 (50 units) is expected to arrive during P4. Currently, on-hand is 0, and total in-transit is 180. I am currently out of stock and losing significant profit. To cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods), I need enough stock for P3, P4, and P5. Estimating demand at ~110 units/period, total needed is ~330.

Total in-transit is 330 units. However, looking at the 'Period 3 conclude' message, Order 1 (placed P1) has NOT yet arrived despite lead_time=2. Total demand is roughly 80-100 units/period. My current pipeline (in-transit) of 330 units covers roughly 3-4 periods of demand if deliveries stabilize.

Historical demand averaged ~35, but recent actual demand (Feb/March) has averaged ~71 units (44, 114, 75, 50). Looking at Period 4, the Period 2 order (50 units) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, confirming the promised lead time holds. However, the Period 1 order (130 units) is now 2 periods overdue (should have arrived in Period 3), suggesting a potential lost shipment.

Demand Regime: Historical data shows a jump from ~35 in Jan to ~64 average in Feb/Mar (44, 114, 75, 50, 50). The '114' in Period 2 appears to be an outlier or early peak; recent stability at 50 units/period suggests a mean demand around 60-70 for the Spring season.

P4 (100 units) was ordered in Period 4 with L=2, so it was expected in Period 6 arrival resolution but did not show up in Period 6 conclude.

This suggests the peak spring transition is over and demand is stabilizing at a lower late-spring/early-summer baseline. Current on-hand is 87 units. Lead time analysis shows recent reliability of 1-2 periods. In-transit includes orders from P12 (80), P13 (80), plus long-lost units from early periods (380 units). Discounting the lost units, actionable in-transit is 160 units (P12+P13). The expected demand for the next 3 periods is likely in the 30-40 range. P12 order (80) is due this period (P14), which would bring inventory to ~130 including sales. P13 order (80) is due P15.

Demand analysis: After a dip to 38 in early May, demand rebounded sharply to 82 and then 127. Current status: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit analysis: Total in-transit is 610. However, our carry-over insights confirm that orders from P1 (130), P3 (150), and P4 (100) are lost (total 380 units). Effective in-transit = 610 - 380 = 230 units (from P10, P13, P15).

Only the P15 order (50 units) is within the promised lead time. Forecast logic: Based on the current trend and late May/early June seasonality, I expect demand to fluctuate between 80-130 units.

Demand analysis: As noted in Period 26, the summer seasonal peak (June/July ~105 avg) has ended. Demand has dropped significantly in the last period (43 units), consistent with a transition out of summer footwear seasonality into late summer/early autumn. I expect demand to stabilize around a mean of 40-50 units/period. Lead time and Supply Chain: The supply chain remains erratic; P23 arrived in 3 periods (L=3), while others like P21 and P22 arrived in 1-2. Importantly, multiple historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19) are confirmed lost, totaling 860 units. Current pipeline: In-transit is 1200, but after subtracting the 860 'ghost' units, the real active pipeline is 340 units (from P24, P25, P26). Inventory assessment: On-hand is 233, which covers nearly 5 periods of forecasted demand (at ~45/period). Real Pipeline (340) + On-hand (233) = 573 units.

Historical data confirms this seasonality: demand peaked in summer (June/July mean ~105) and has been steadily declining through autumn. The current November demand (P39) was 30 units, suggesting the baseline has dropped below the previous October estimate of 50. Inventory management for the final 8 periods should prioritize clearing existing stock to avoid holding costs, as current on-hand inventory (265 units) covers over 8 periods of demand at the current rate (30 units/period). The pipeline is heavily congested with 1250 units in-transit, though the vast majority are long-lost (1100 units from P1-P26). Even ignoring lost shipments, the 150 units from P34 and 150 from P33 (which just arrived in P36) create an oversupply risk if they eventually arrive. With 265 units on hand and 7 periods remaining, no additional orders are required.",

Historically, sneaker socks (short socks designed to be hidden) are highly seasonal, peaking in summer and tapering off as weather cools and closed-toe shoes/boots become standard. Demand over the last 4 periods has averaged ~31 units (30, 28, 22, 45 - the spike to 45 in P42 appears to be a minor fluctuation or early holiday promo effect, but remains significantly below the summer peak of ~105). Current on-hand inventory is 170 units. With an current demand mean of approximately 30-35 units, the inventory on-hand is sufficient to cover roughly 5 periods of demand (170/35 \u2248 4.8 periods). Given that we are at Period 43 of 47, there are only 4 periods remaining in the simulation. My current inventory (170) exceeds the total expected demand for the remainder of the game (4 periods * ~35 units = 140 units), assuming no major holiday spike for this specific 'invisible' sock type. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs and risk ending the game with excess stock. The pipeline (in-transit) is already heavily bloated with 1250 units, though the vast majority (~1100+) are confirmed lost from much earlier periods. Even if a late order arrives, it would only worsen the overstock position. Therefore, I will place an order of 0.",
