  "rationale": "a) Product Analysis: The item is a core denim staple ('Push Up Jegging'). The historical data shows a significant jump in demand from ~60 units in January to 154 units in the first week of February. b) Calendar/Seasonality: The current date is Feb 11, 2019. The recent spike (154 units on Feb 4) likely corresponds to the lead-up to Valentine's Day and the general transition into spring fashion retail cycles. c) Lead Time/Inventory: Promised lead time is 2 periods. No orders currently in transit. On-hand is 0. d) Forecast: Given the jump to 154, I expect demand to remain elevated during the spring transition. I need to cover demand for current period (P1) plus the lead time (P2, P3). Expecting ~150 units per period, total coverage needed is 150 * 3 = 450 units. e) Order Logic: To establish a baseline inventory and cover the pipeline for L+1 periods, I will place an order for 450 units.",

Historical data shows a base demand of ~54-78 in January, with a significant spike to 154 on Feb 4th and 177 on Feb 11th. This suggests a seasonal 'Spring' shift or a specific promotional event for denim. b) Demand Regime: The demand has more than doubled from the January average (~63) to the current February average (~165). I will forecast demand around 170-180 units per week for the near term. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 450 units placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible in Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, meaning we lost 177 units in sales last period. d) Inventory Assessment: Current on-hand = 0. In-transit = 450 (due Period 3).

For P4 (March 4), demand is expected to remain in the 90-150 range. Inventory status: On-hand is 0, resulting in significant lost sales. Arriving pipeline: The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed: P1 (450 units), P2 (150 units), P3 (150 units).

Lead-time analysis: Promised lead time is 2. P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2). P5 order arrived in P6 (L=1). There is significant variability in delivery. P1 order (450) is confirmed lost. P3 and P4 orders (150 each) are currently in-transit and overdue based on L=2 (P3 should have arrived P5, P4 should have arrived P6). P6's order of 250 is also in-transit.

Our on-hand (148) covers about 1.5 weeks. Even if P3/P4 are lost, the P6 order (250) is likely to arrive within the next 1-2 periods. However, to hedge against further lost shipments and maintain service levels for this high-margin product ($4 profit vs $1 holding), I will place a conservative order to maintain the pipeline.

The supplier has a high rate of lost orders: shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P10 (total 1000 units) appear lost as they are significantly beyond the promised 2-period lead time. In-transit inventory stands at 1400, but 1000 of these are likely 'ghost' units from P1 (450), P3 (150), P4 (150), and P10 (250).

With current on-hand inventory at 75 and an expected lead time of 2 periods, we must cover roughly 3 weeks of demand (~200 units).
