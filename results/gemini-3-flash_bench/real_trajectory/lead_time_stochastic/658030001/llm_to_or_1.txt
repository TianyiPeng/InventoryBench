Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 658030001 (Push Up Jegging). The product description (denim jeggings) and the historical demand show a significant jump on 2019-02-04 (from ~50-70 units up to 154). This likely signals the start of the spring fashion season or a specific promotion. Demand for the last 5 weeks: 54, 53, 67, 78, 154. Mean of all samples is 81.2, but the most recent sample (154) is nearly double the average. The promised lead time (L) is 2. To ensure availability given the upward trend, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the growth (mean of last 3 is ~100 per period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few weeks. L is set to default (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the historical demand for SKU 658030001 (Ladies Denim Jeggings), there is a significant jump in demand starting Feb 4th (from ~50-70 units to 154) and continuing into Period 1 with 177 units. This indicates a demand regime shift or seasonal peak. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (Period 1) has a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it shouldn't arrive until Period 3. To set OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'default' (2) as we haven't seen any concluded arrivals yet to suggest otherwise. 2) mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent surge (Samples: 154, 177, and current expectation). This helps the backend calculate a higher base stock to meet the new demand level (average ~165 per period). 3) sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is facing a stockout situation with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) showed a significant jump from ~50-70 units per week to 154 units on Feb 4. The recorded demand in Period 1 (177) and Period 2 (162) confirms a new, higher demand regime near ~170 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (178 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 3 (arrival resolution phase), which will be visible in the next starting inventory. My goal is to maintain the pipeline to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using N=3 for demand forecasting to capture the recent spike (154, 177, 162).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean increased from ~60 to ~165 (+175%) starting early February.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. We are looking at SKU 658030001 (Push Up Jeggings). In the first three periods, demand has been significantly higher (avg ~143) than the initial historical samples (avg ~61), confirming a demand regime shift likely due to seasonality or product lifecycle. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with significant lost sales occurring because the promised lead time of 2 periods has not yet yielded arrivals. Order 1 (Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution and become visible in Period 4's conclude message (which I will see next period). Order 2 (Period 2) is expected in Period 4. Currently, 511 units are in-transit. Given the high demand and zero stock, I will maintain the higher demand forecast. I will use recent_N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime (177, 162, 91) which averages 143.3. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for these new levels (L+1=3 periods of demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of the Period 2 order (222 units) with a confirmed lead time of 2 periods. The Period 1 order (178 units) has not arrived after 4 periods, which strongly suggests it is lost. Current on-hand is 106, with 111 units in-transit from Period 3 (expected to arrive in Period 5 conclude/read in Period 6). The demand history shows a spike in early February (154, 177, 162), followed by a slight cooling to 91 and 116. The carry-over insight correctly identified a shift to a higher regime (~165), though the most recent two points suggest the mean may be stabilizing around 120-130. Given the lost shipment in Period 1, the system is currently under-stocked relative to demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 samples (177, 162, 91, 116) to account for the sustained higher volume compared to the January baseline, resulting in a mean of ~136.5 per period. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*136.5 = 409.5. This will signal the OR backend to place an order to bridge the gap left by the lost Period 1 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (178 units) likely lost: 4 periods elapsed with no arrival confirmation vs. promised lead time 2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019/3/18), we have 21 units on-hand and 362 in-transit. The order from Period 1 (178 units) is officially confirmed as lost, as 5 periods have passed despite a promised lead time of 2. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. The Period 3 order (111 units) was expected in Period 5 but has not arrived yet; it is now 1 period overdue but not yet considered 'lost' based on the 3-period buffer rule. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime after the initial February spike: the last three periods (P3-P5) show a mean of ~97.3, compared to the early February peak (~160). I will use N=3 for demand and sigma estimation to reflect this stabilization. Although one order arrived on time, the missing P1 order and delayed P3 order suggest instability, so I will explicitly set L to 2 (promised) to ensure the OR engine maintains levels for 3 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 3 order (111 units) is 1 period overdue (expected P5, not yet arrived).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. Demand over the last three periods (P4-P6) has averaged ~101 units per period, while demand in P1-P2 was much higher (~170). The early February spike appears to have settled into a lower 'spring' regime. Supply reliability is low: P1 order (178 units) is lost, and P3 order (111 units) is now 2 periods overdue beyond its promised lead time of 2. P2 arrived on time (L=2) and P5 arrived early (L=1). On-hand inventory is 0. With total in-transit at 289 units (P3: 111 units; P5: 178 units - wait, P5 was 73 units and arrived, P3 is 111, plus the backend likely placed orders in P4/P6 not explicitly listed here), I need to account for the lost P1 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the stabilized demand (~101/period) and maintain a cautious silver-standard sigma. I will keep L at default (2) because while P5 was fast, the P3 delay and P1 loss suggest variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 order (111 units) is now 2 periods overdue (Expected P5 arrival, still not arrived at P7 START). Supply chain variance remains high.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: Today is 2019-04-01. SKU 658030001 (Jeggings) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). History shows high lead-time volatility: P2 order arrived in 2 periods, P5 order arrived in 1 period, but P1 and P3 orders appear lost (missed for 4+ periods). The demand mean since early Feb (P1-P7) is ~118.5 per week. With L=2, the total exposure period (L+1) is 3 weeks. To reconcile the supply chain instability, I must assume the current in-transit (326 units, which likely includes the overdue P3 order and the P7 order) may not arrive reliably or on time. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 360 units) using the post-Feb regime average (~120/week), and maintaining a high sigma_hat to account for the high variance in both demand and supply arrival. Using L=2 as the baseline, but the backend will see the gap between on-hand+in-transit and the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply chain instability: Orders from P1 and P3 likely lost or severely delayed (missing for 4+ periods). Lead times are highly variable (observed range 1-2 periods for successful arrivals). Recommend cautious buffering.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a staple denim item (jegging) which showed a temporary spike in early February (Likely CNY or early spring demand) followed by a stabilization between 85-115 units/period. Significant supply chain issues persist: orders from Period 1 (178 units) and Period 3 (111 units) are long overdue and must be treated as lost to prevent under-ordering. Recent successful arrivals (P5 and P7) arrived in 1 period, but the promised lead time is 2. Currently, inventory is 0 and the pipeline contains 120 units (P8 and potentially P5/P6 gaps). Given the recent demand stability (avg ~101 over the last 4 periods), I will set mu_hat based on N=4 to capture the stabilized post-spike demand. I will set L to 2 (promised) to remain conservative in the face of lost shipments, despite recent 1-period arrivals. Pipeline inventory is currently 120 (P8 order of 83 + P7 residue or adjustments). The backend base stock calculation will determine the order to cover (L+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability confirmed: Period 1 (178 units) and Period 3 (111 units) orders are officially considered lost (6+ periods overdue). Demand has stabilized to a new regime of ~100 units/period (avg 99.5 over Periods 5-8) following the February spike.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), inventory is currently 0 with 372 units in-transit. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 1 (178 units) and Period 3 (111 units) are lost, as they are 7+ periods overdue. Only the Period 8 order (83 units) is genuinely in transit. Demand has stabilized into a post-spike regime; the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 96.6 units. Lead times for successful arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. To avoid stockouts caused by the zero on-hand balance and the high risk of shipment loss, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples to reflect the current ~97 units/period demand and using recent_N for sigma to capture recent volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed arrival times (1 and 2 periods).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22nd. Demand for this denim SKU has transitioned from a high-February peak (~150) to a more stable regime. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 91.6, while the demand for the most recent period was 60, suggesting a slight cooling as we move further into spring. Regarding supply chain, historical lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. Orders from P1 and P3 are officially written off as lost. The in-transit inventory of 289 reflects the 'lost' orders being tracked by the backend OR, which creates a risk of the OR engine under-ordering due to a perceived high pipeline. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) based on the post-peak mean (~90/week), resulting in 270. Since the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' from 'base_stock', and 289 units are technically 'in-transit' (but 178 + 111 = 289 are confirmed lost), I will use an explicit mu_hat that forces an order by overriding the internal calculation. To ensure we rebuild on-hand inventory (currently only 23), I'll set mu_hat to 560 (289 pipeline + 271 target base stock) to trigger an order that fills the gap left by lost shipments.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has trended downward over the last 3 weeks (85 to 60 to 44 units), likely as the post-February seasonal spike settles into a stabilizer lower-demand spring period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 510 units in-transit (reflecting the large order of 221 from Period 11 and ongoing attempts to recover from lost shipments in P1 and P3). The observed actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P2 arrived in 2, P5 in 1, P7 in 1, P8 in 2). I will assume a lead time (L) of 2 periods to be conservative given past instability. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), the recent 3-period average is approximately 63 units/period (85, 60, 44). I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples to account for the recent cooling trend, providing a balanced forecast for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 samples to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed: Avg demand dropped from ~100 (Periods 5-9) to ~63 (Periods 10-11) as the seasonal peak subsides.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a 'Ladies Denim Push Up Jegging'. Recent demand history shows a stabilization after a February spike, but Period 12 saw a sudden jump to 100 units following two lower periods (60, 44), which might be a pre-summer ripple or volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 221 units in transit from Period 11 (expected arrival P13/P14). The Carry-over insights confirm that orders from P1 and P3 are lost. Demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has been 114, 85, 60, 44, 100, averaging 80.6 units/period. Given the stockout in P12 (ending OH=0, demand=100), we need to maintain a robust base stock. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this average of ~80.6/period, and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (60->44->100). Lead time will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variance (1-2 periods).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14 (May 13). Recent demand (Periods 11-13) averaged 71.6 units per period, showing a stabilization after the April deceleration. The current on-hand inventory is 150 units, and there are 289 units in transit (though our history suggests orders from Period 1 and 3 are permanently lost). The order from Period 11 arrived in Period 13 (Lead Time = 2). Given the supply chain instability identified in previous carry-over insights, I will set L to 2 (promised). For demand forecasting, I'll use a recent window (N=3) to reflect the post-peak stabilization (~72 units/period). The mu_hat calculation will be (1+L) * 72 = 216. This should prevent over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock to handle lead-time variability in the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a lower post-peak level: Avg 71.6 units/period (Periods 11-13) vs ~100 in early Spring.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), the demand for the 'Push Up Jegging' has stabilized following the spring peak. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P11-P14) is 67.25 units, significantly lower than the ~100 units/period seen in the previous regime. The supply chain remains unreliable, with P1 and P3 orders confirmed lost, though the most recent order (P11) arrived as promised in 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 96 units, and there are no active in-transit orders (the in-transit count of 289 reflects the lost P1 and P3 orders which will never arrive). Since current on-hand inventory (96) exceeds the expected 1-period demand (~67), and we expect to maintain a base stock covering approximately 3 periods of demand (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current stabilized demand level of ~67 units/period for mu_hat. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the variance in observed lead times (1-2 periods) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Ladies Denim Push Up Jegging'. At Period 16 (May 27), we are post-spring peak. Demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (Periods 11-15) with an average of 72 units per period, following a higher peak in Feb/March. On-hand inventory is very low (5 units), but there are 289 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P3 are officially considered lost, leaving the system with 0 pending from those; the 289 in-transit likely refers to more recent replenishment not yet concluded). Actual lead times for fulfilled orders have been stable at 1-2 periods. Given the high stockout risk (ending OH=5) and the 289 units already in transit, the OR backend needs to maintain a baseline of approximately 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 3). Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the current post-peak stability (~72/week), and sigma_hat will be based on the same period to account for the current volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030001' (Push Up Jegging) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) facing a demand environment that has stabilized following a spring peak. Recent demand (Periods 11-16) averages 70.3 units per period. The supply chain has shown significant instability in the past, with early orders lost, but more recent orders (P11) have arrived on a 2-period lead time. However, there has been no ordering activity since Period 11, resulting in the current stockout. The in-transit inventory of 289 units appears to be a composite of several overdue orders from very early periods (P1 and P3) which were previously identified as lost, and potentially some other units\u2014though looking at the history, the 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard likely still counts those lost units. Given the inventory is 0 and recent demand is ~70, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the stabilized post-peak demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to use the observed average, noting that while 2 is promised, 1-2 is the actual successful range.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. This product (Ladies Denim Trousers) has clearly exited its early Spring peak (where demand was ~100) and settled into a lower-volume regime. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), the average demand is 64.2 units/period. The current stock status is 0 On-hand with 289 units in-transit. These in-transit units represent orders from P1 (178) and P3 (111) which were flagged as likely lost back in Period 9 and Period 12. Since they have not arrived by Period 18 (15+ periods overdue), I must assume they are nonexistent in order to trigger a fresh order from the OR backend. However, because the backend simply subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock', and 289 units far exceed any reasonable base stock for a 65-unit demand mean, the OR engine will order 0 unless I significantly inflate mu_hat to offset the phantom pipeline. To resolve this, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L)*65 + 289 = (3*65) + 289 = 484. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected demand plus the stalled 'phantom' pipeline, resulting in a physical order to replenish the currently empty shelves.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand for this jegging SKU spiked in February/March (~100 units/period) but has significantly decelerated as we enter summer. Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), mean demand is approximately 59.4 units per week. Inventory is currently critical: On-hand is 0, and we have experienced numerous stockouts. The 'In-transit' of 481 units is highly misleading because it includes lost veteran orders (P1, P3) and a large recent order from P18 (192 units). Specifically, orders from P1 (178) and P3 (111) are long overdue and confirmed lost in Carry-over Insights (289 units total). Thus, the effective pipeline is only 192 units. To prevent further stockouts given the 2-period lead time, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (recent deceleration) and use a slightly higher N for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed 1-2 period variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Average demand from Period 14 to 18 has settled at ~60 units/period, down from the ~72 units seen in mid-Spring.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a 'Push Up Jegging', a classic denim item. Following a high-demand period in February and March (peaking at ~154), demand has stabilized. For the last six periods (Periods 14-19), demand has averaged 57.1 units (54, 91, 62, 43, 47, 46). The most recent three periods (17-19) show even lower stability at 45.3 units. I will use N=6 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current plateau. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (latest was 1 period); I will use the 'calculate' method to let the backend average valid historical arrivals. Total pipeline inventory is 289 units (mostly from recent large order in P18 and potentially P20 replenishment logic), and on-hand is 146. Given the current plateau, the system is well-buffered.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Recent demand since the mid-spring peak has stabilized. Over the last 7 periods (P14-P20), mean demand is 47.3 units/period, showing a significant drop compared to the previous regime of ~60-70. Specifically, Period 20 showed a very low demand of 15 units. We are currently well-stocked with 131 units on-hand and 289 in-transit (P1 and P3 orders of 178 and 111 respectively are likely still being counted in 'in-transit' by the backend despite being lost). My goal is to prevent over-ordering as we enter the summer months. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 samples to reflect this lower demand plateau (approx 47 units/period) and use N=7 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. Lead time calculation remains stable around the 1-2 period mark for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Mean demand decreased from ~60 to ~47 units/period (based on P14-P20) as summer begins.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for 'Push Up Jegging' has transitioned into a summer lull, confirmed by a regime shift at Period 20. The average demand over the last three periods (P19-P21) is 31.6 units, reflecting a significant drop from the spring average of ~60-70 units. On-hand inventory is currently 97 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 3 periods of the current low demand. Additionally, there are 289 units in-transit (likely from larger orders placed during the spring/stabilization phase), implying a very high pipeline inventory relative to current demand. The OR backend needs to recognize this lower demand regime to avoid further overstocking and unnecessary holding costs. I am setting L to default (2 periods) as recent lead times (P18 order arrived in 1 period) have stabilized. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this immediate summer demand drop and prevent the system from over-ordering based on higher historical averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Summer demand drop confirmed, 3-period average (P19-P21) is 31.6 units/period, down from previous plateau of ~60.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Ladies' Denim Jegging) has entered a consistent summer trough. Historical demand from Periods 20-22 shows values of 15, 34, and 37 units (average ~28.7), confirming the 'summer drop' identified in previous insights. The current on-hand inventory is 60 units, and there are 289 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P3 are officially lost; however, recent orders like the P18 order of 192 units have cleared, leaving older stalled orders contributing to the 'in-transit' count without arriving). Given the low summer demand regime, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent average of ~29 units per period across the (L+1) horizon. With L=2, mu_hat is set to 87. Sigma_hat is kept relatively tight to avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand period, as the current stock (60) plus the pipeline (excluding stalled units) significantly exceeds the summer requirements.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has significantly decelerated during the summer months. Over the last five periods (P19-P23), demand has averaged 33.2 units per period (46, 15, 34, 37, 34), confirming the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights for Period 22. In-transit inventory is currently 289 units (likely from an unobserved large order placed around P22-P23 or a replenishment push); given the current on-hand of 26 and a mean demand of ~33, the pipeline coverage is very high (~8-9 periods). Lead times have been stable at 1-2 periods for recent successful deliveries. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this low summer demand regime and use calculate for L to reflect the mix of 1-2 period lead times. The OR backend will likely not place a new order due to the high in-transit balance relative to current demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor confirmed: Avg demand for Periods 20-23 has stabilized at 30.0 units/period (down 50% from the Spring plateau of ~60).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' (Ladies Denim) has stabilized at a summer floor level. Over the last five periods (P20-P24), demand has been: 15, 34, 37, 34, 14, averaging ~26.8 units/period. The Carry-over insights from Period 24 correctly identified this shift. On-hand inventory is currently 12 units, and there is a large in-transit pipeline of 289 units (likely from a massive order placed between P24 START and P25 START, although the history does not explicitly show it yet). Given this high pipeline inventory relative to the low summer demand, no additional ordering is likely required by the OR backend. I will set the parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime using N=5 to capture the last 5 weeks of summer demand accurately, while maintaining the promised lead time of 2 as the baseline for calculations.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/05). Historical demand for this 'Push Up Jegging' SKU has stabilized at a summer floor. Since Period 21, demand has been consistently low: 34, 37, 34, 14, and 17 units (average of 27.2 over the last 5 periods). We are currently at zero on-hand inventory. There are 289 units in-transit, which is significantly more than our total expected demand for the next several periods (estimated base stock for L=2 would be ~82 units). This in-transit level is likely a carry-over from earlier calculations or systemic orders that haven't arrived yet; however, we do not need to order more units. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent summer demand floor (N=6) to ensure the OR backend recognizes the lower demand regime and prevents further overstocking while we wait for the existing in-transit units to arrive.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has been in a summer low since June (averaging ~25-30 units/period). However, Period 26 saw a sudden spike to 100 units, likely signaling a typical 'Back to School' transition as August begins. The current on-hand inventory is 0. There are 289 units in-transit, but these represent old, potentially lost orders (P1, P3, etc.) or significantly delayed shipments that have not concluded. Given the recent spike, I must ensure inventory covers the transition from summer lows back to higher seasonal demand. I will use a recent_N of 7 for demand (covering the low summer period plus the recent spike) to capture this shift without over-reacting to a single point, while using the promised lead time of 2 as the baseline since recent successful arrivals (P18, P11) clustered around 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Potential 'Back to School' seasonal demand shift detected. Period 26 demand spiked to 100 units after 6 weeks of averaging ~25 units/period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late August (Period 28: 2019/8/19), a peak period for 'Back to School' shopping, which significantly impacts denim products like jeggings. Demand has spiked dramatically: Period 26 was 100 units and Period 27 was 166 units, compared to the summer floor of ~30. This confirms a new high-demand regime. Average demand for the last two periods is 133 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to stockouts. In-transit inventory is 289 units (likely from orders placed in Period 26/27, though those sessions are not explicitly listed in history, 'In-transit' reflects them). To capture this seasonal surge and replenish stock, I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 high-demand samples (N=2) to reflect the new mean of ~133/period. Since lead time has historically fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, I will stick with the promised L=2. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to account for high volatility seen during regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand spike confirmed: Mean demand jumped from ~30 to 133 units/period (+340%) starting Period 26 (August).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand period likely driven by 'Back to School' seasonality (late August). Demand has surged from a summer floor of ~30 units to an average of 133 units over the last three periods (P26: 100, P27: 166, P28: 133). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 442 units in-transit (P28 order of 153 plus older potentially lost or severely delayed orders). The 'Back-to-School' spike appears to be the new regime, so I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this high-volume period (average ~133). While the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2, but several orders (P1, P3) were lost. I will stick with the default lead time of 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering given the significant in-transit volume, but ensure the OR backend uses the updated high-demand statistics to maintain service levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand period (Back-to-School season) which began around Period 26 (August). Demand for the last 4 periods (P26-P29) has been 100, 166, 133, and 105, averaging 126 units/period. The current date is 2019/9/2, suggesting we are still in the early fall peak. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 448 units in-transit (orders from P28 and P29, and possibly older ones that the OR backend manages). Since we are in a clear high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current spike average (~126). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the volatility in this new regime. For Lead Time (L), I will use 'calculate' to rely on the backend's average of observed lead times (typically 1-2 periods), as supply chain variance has been a recurring theme in the carry-over insights.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a high-demand period likely driven by the 'Back-to-School' season. Demand significantly shifted at Period 26, increasing from a summer floor of ~30 to an average of ~133 over the last 5 periods (100, 166, 133, 105, 167). The current inventory is 0 on-hand with 295 units in-transit (orders from Period 29 and 30). The Period 28 order of 153 units arrived in Period 30 (lead time = 2), confirming the supply chain is currently functioning within promised parameters. However, on-hand inventory was completely depleted by the high demand in Period 30. To maintain a high service level during this sustained peak, I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current demand avg of ~134 units/period, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this spike. L is set to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peak sustained: Avg demand for Periods 26-30 is 134.2 units/period, compared to ~30 in July.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in the midst of a sustained 'Back-to-School' demand surge that began in early August (Period 26). Demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31) has averaged 141.5 units/period (100, 166, 133, 105, 167, 178), reflecting a major regime shift from the summer floor of ~30. In-transit inventory consists of 450 units (P29: 6, P31: 155, and seemingly P32's calculated base-stock targets). Note: P29's order of 6 units is 1 period overdue but likely insignificant. The P31 order is expected in P33. Since current on-hand is 0 and we are in a high-demand peak, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this surge while maintaining a high sigma_hat to account for recent volatility (std dev ~33 units). Lead time remains at the default (promised 2), as recent arrivals (P28 order) have adhered to this.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Mean increased from ~30 to ~141 units/period (+370%) due to Back-to-School seasonality.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a 'Back-to-School' high-demand phase which started around Period 26 (August). Demand mean has shifted from ~30 units to ~141 units per period since that time. We are currently at Period 33 (late September). Recent demand for Periods 28-32 was: 133, 105, 167, 178, 138 (Mean: 144.2). The lead time remains variable, with Period 31 arriving in 1 period, but Period 28 taking 2. Total in-transit is 319 (likely including recent orders from P31 and P32), and on-hand is 17. To maintain service levels during this high-demand period while accounting for observed lead time volatility, I will use a 7-period window (N=7) for demand and variance to capture the full extent of the August/September spike. This calculates the base stock based on the ~144 unit/period regime.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand regime (Period 26-32) average confirmed at 141.0 units/period. Lead time volatility persists (1-2 periods).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand surged to 213 units, significantly higher than the previous 'Back-to-School' average of ~141. This represents a potential late-September seasonal peak or a shift in the demand regime. The current on-hand inventory is 0. There are 452 units in-transit (Orders from P29, P32, and P33, plus earlier suspected lost orders from P1/P3 which are effectively removed from backend logic calculations because they exceed the observation window). Looking at recent arrivals, the lead time has been fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (Observed: P28 arrived in 2, P31 arrived in 1). To ensure sufficient stock for this heightened demand while managing holding costs, I will use a conservative demand estimate based on the most recent 8 periods (covering the entire 'Back-to-School' window) which averages approximately 143 units/period. However, given the most recent jump to 213, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects a blend of the recent surge and the sustained high level, targeting roughly 450 units for the (L+1) window (3 periods * ~150 units). Sigma_hat will be set to a higher explicit value to account for the increased volatility seen in the last two weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at Period 33: Demand reached 213 units, up from the ~141 units average of the Period 26-32 regime (+50% increase). Monitoring for a new higher plateau or a seasonal peak exhaustion.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a 'Back-to-School' seasonal peak. After a significant spike to 213 units in Period 33, demand in Period 34 returned to 123 units, suggesting the extreme peak may have passed, but demand remains high compared to the summer floor. The average demand for the current regime (since Period 26) is 141.6 units/period. Lead times recently observed are 1 and 2 periods, suggesting the promised lead time of 2 is a reliable upper bound for successful arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 561 units in-transit (orders from P29, P32, P33, and P34). The OR engine needs to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand to mitigate the risk of stockouts during this high-demand period. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the start of the seasonal shift in P26) to capture the current mean and volatility while excluding the summer floor.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: Following the extreme spike of 213 (P33), demand stabilized back to 123 (P34). The Back-to-School regime average (P26-P34) is 141.6 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, demand decreased to 91 units, continuing a trend of deceleration from the Back-to-School seasonal peak (213 in P33, 123 in P34). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 537 units in transit. High lead time volatility is confirmed by the Period 32 order arriving in Period 35 (L=3), despite a promised lead time of 2. For Period 36, I am adjusting demand parameters to reflect this recent deceleration while maintaining a buffer for supply chain delays. I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-volume Back-to-School regime (mean ~140) while allowing the most recent lower observations (123, 91) to begin pulling the forecast down. I set L to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed 3-period delay into the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility increased: Period 32 order arrived after 3 periods (expected 2). Demand is decelerating from the 200+ unit peak seen in late September (P33), with Period 35 demand at 91 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030001' (Ladies Denim Jeggings) is currently transitioning out of the high-demand 'Back to School' season. Demand peaked at 213 units in Period 33 and has since declined to 123, 91, and now 70 units in Period 36. This pattern suggests a return to a lower baseline as the autumn peak subsides. Lead times have also fluctuated, with the last two recorded arrivals (P32 and P33 orders) taking 3 periods to arrive instead of the promised 2. Currently, there are 63 units on hand and 109 units in-transit (ordered P34). Given the observed deceleration, I will shift the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the most recent regime (last 3 periods: 123, 91, 70), which averages ~95 units/period. For lead time, while recent cycles took 3 periods, the backend's promised lead time is 2; I will use 'calculate' to let the OR engine factor in the historical average while I adjust mu_hat to ensure coverage for the current trend. Use of recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the downward slope without reacting too aggressively to a single data point.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed post-Back-to-School peak: Avg demand decreased from ~141 (P26-P32) to 94.7 (P34-P36). Lead time variability persists with recent orders (P32, P33) arriving in 3 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030001' (Push Up Jegging) has moved past its 'Back-to-School' seasonal peak. Demand spiked at 213 (P33) and has since decelerated to a lower plateau, with common values now in the 70-90 range. Over the last 4 periods (P34-P37), average demand is 89.25 units. This is a significant drop from the ~141 avg seen during the peak. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this deceleration. On the supply side, lead times have destabilized, with the last two arrivals (P35, P36) taking 3 periods instead of the promised 2. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for this delay and prevent stockouts during this transitional period. There are 404 units in-transit (orders from P29, P31, P34), which should cover future demand once received, given the current on-hand inventory is 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand deceleration confirmed: Average demand for Periods 34-37 is 89.3 units, down from the peak regime of ~141. Lead time has shifted from 1-2 periods to a more consistent 3 periods based on P32 and P33 order arrivals.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the early November period (P39), where demand has definitively decelerated from the Back-to-School/Late-September peak (~141 units/period). The most recent demand regime (P34-P38) shows a stable mean of approximately 86.2 units (123, 91, 70, 73, 74). While we have 404 units in-transit (P34: 109, and others), current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead times have shifted from are 1-2 periods to a more frequent 3 periods (observed in P35 and P36 concludes). To avoid the frequent stockouts seen recently, I will set 'L' to 3 periods to better reflect actual supply chain performance. For demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (P34-P38) to capture the post-peak floor while ignoring the outlier spike of 213 (P33). This targets an arrival of units to meet the current ~85 units/period demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand floor confirmed: Avg demand for Periods 34-38 is 86.2 units. Actual lead time has shifted to 3 periods (observed P32 and P33 arrivals).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 658030001 (Push Up Jegging) has stabilized into a post-Back-to-School floor. Since Period 34, demand has consistently stayed below 100 units, with the last three periods (P37-P39) averaging 71.3 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 (covering P34-P39) to capture this lower mean (~86 units). Lead time (L) is explicitly set to 3. Although the promised lead time is 2, the most recent arrivals (P32 and P33 orders) both had a lead time of 3 periods, and currently, orders from P34 (109 units) and later are still in transit (3 periods elapsed for P34). Pipeline inventory is high (404 units), so the OR backend with L=3 and a lower mu_hat will likely suppress ordering until this inventory clears or arrives, protecting against overstocking while acknowledging the longer delivery window.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 41 (mid-November). Analysis of historical demand shows that the intense 'Back-to-School' peak (averaging ~141 units in Periods 26-32) has subsided. Since Period 34, demand has decelerated and stabilized into a post-peak plateau, with an average of 77.4 units over the last 7 periods (P34-P40). Lead times have also shifted; while the promised lead time is 2, the most recent successful arrivals (P32 and P33 orders) both took 3 periods, and the order from P34 is currently at its 7th period without arrival, matching the pattern of lost shipments seen earlier in the game (P1, P3). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and pipeline inventory (404 units) appears inflated by these likely lost shipments. To prevent over-ordering due to phantom pipeline stock while accounting for the recent demand stabilization, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=7 to capture the late Autumn regime). I will set L to 3 periods to reflect the actually observed lead time before the most recent disruptions.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory likely contains lost shipments: P34 order (109 units) is 7 periods overdue; P29 order (6 units) is 12 periods overdue. Only P31/P32/P33 arrivals have been consistent with a 3-period lead time.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are navigating a post-peak demand environment for the Push Up Jegging L.W. Following the 'Back-to-School' surge (P26-P34), demand has decelerated and appears to be stabilizing at a lower level. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P37-P41) is 64.8 units/period, down from the peak's ~141. Lead time has also shifted; while the promised lead time is 2 periods, recent successful arrivals (P32, P33) took 3 periods, and there are significant delays elsewhere. The in-transit inventory of 404 units is very high relative to current demand, but it contains likely lost or severely overdue shipments: Period 29 (6 units, 13 periods ago) and Period 34 (109 units, 8 periods ago) are almost certainly lost. Excluding these, the effective pipeline is roughly 289 units. Given the transition towards the winter season (late November) and current demand trends, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed slowdown in deliveries. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand deceleration (averaging ~65 units) without being skewed by the previous months' high-volume spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration plateau confirmed: Average demand for P37-P41 (Nov) has settled at 64.8 units/period. Period 34 shipment (109 units) is now 8 periods overdue and likely lost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-12-02. We are entering the winter season. Demand for this SKU has stabilized at a lower level following the Back-to-School peak. For the last 6 periods (P37-P42), the average demand is 62.0 units per period, showing a clear plateau compared to the previous ~90 unit level. Lead time has been volatile but recently settled at 3 periods (observed in P35 and P36). Regarding inventory, the on-hand balance is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 404 units is misleading because it likely includes several lost or severely overdue shipments: Period 1 (178), Period 3 (111), Period 29 (6), and Period 34 (109). Removing these likely lost units from the pipeline (178+111+6+109 = 404) reveals an effective pipeline inventory of 0. Because effective inventory is zero and we have a 3-period lead time, we need to re-establish stock. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) based on the most recent successful arrivals. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current stabilized demand of ~62 units/period. sigma_hat also uses N=6 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory is 0: In-transit units (404) are entirely comprised of lost/severely overdue orders from P1, P3, P29, and P34. Demand regime for late Q4 (Nov-Dec) has settled at ~62 units/period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/9. Demand has reached a significant seasonal low, with Period 43 demand at only 17 units. The average demand for the last five periods (P39-P43) is 48.4 units, but the most recent two weeks show a sharper decline (48 and 17). I am treating the pipeline inventory (404 units) as entirely lost based on the 'Carry-over Insights' which confirm that orders from P1, P3, P29, and P34 are significantly past any reasonable lead time. With on-hand inventory at 0 and no reliable arrivals expected, an order is necessary to maintain service levels. I will set the lead time (L) to 3, as this was the most recent stable observation before shipments began failing. For mu_hat, I'll use a recent_N of 5 to capture the late-year deceleration while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N 5 to reflect the current lower demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: Demand has dropped significantly below the Nov-Dec plateau of ~62, reaching a floor of 17 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late Q4 period (mid-December). Demand has undergone a significant regime shift, dropping from a November plateau of ~62 units to a low-consumption phase averaging ~22 units over the last two periods (P43-P44). This aligns with a post-peak holiday lull for this specific denim SKU. On-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory of 404 units is entirely composed of lost or severely overdue shipments from P1, P3, P29, and P34 (all >10 periods overdue), meaning effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. Recent actual lead times converged to 3 periods (P32, P33) before shipments ceased to arrive. I will set L to 3 to account for this observed shift from the promised 2. For demand (mu_hat), I will use an explicit forecast reflecting the new low-demand regime (~22 units/period) across the (L+1) horizon to avoid over-ordering during this seasonal trough. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the reduced volatility of this new plateau.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: Mean demand has dropped to ~22 units/period (P43-P44 average), signaling the end of the Q4/Autumn cycle. Pipeline inventory remains functionally zero due to historical lost shipments.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. Demand has shifted to a significantly lower year-end regime, averaging approximately 19.7 units/period over the last 3 periods (P43-P45). Historical analysis shows the pipeline inventory (404 units) is entirely comprised of lost or severely overdue shipments from P1, P3, P29, and P34, and should be treated as functionally zero. With on-hand inventory also at 0, new orders are required to meet this low-volume demand regime. Although lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods, the recent lack of arrivals makes it prudent to use the promised lead time of 2 as a baseline for the OR backend, while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current stable low-demand window (N=3) to avoid over-ordering during this seasonal trough.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030001' (Push Up Jegging) has transitioned from its high-demand Back-to-School and Autumn periods into a significant winter trough. Since Period 43 (early December), demand has stabilized at a much lower regime, averaging 18.75 units per period (P43-P46). Inventory management is currently hindered by 'phantom' pipeline inventory; the 'In-transit' figure of 404 units is entirely composed of severely overdue shipments from Periods 1, 3, 29, and 34, which are now considered lost. My strategy is to reset the forecast to the current low-demand winter regime to prevent over-ordering while maintaining enough stock to cover the actual lead time, which has historically fluctuated between 1-3 periods. I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture only the recent post-peak data (P43-P46). I set L to 3 periods to account for the most recent successful arrival lead times (P32 and P33 arrived in 3 periods), ensuring the base stock formula (L+1) accounts for the current supply chain speed.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor confirmed: Avg demand for Periods 43-46 is 18.75 units/period, a ~70% drop from the November plateau.
