Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim TRS', a high-waisted denim trouser. Looking at the historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4), there is a clear upward trend: 0, 24, 29, 37, 41. This suggests a post-holiday build-up or a seasonal shift as we approach spring. The mean of these 5 samples is 26.2, but the most recent 2-3 weeks show a higher regime (avg ~39). Given the trend, I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent growth without over-extrapolating. For L, I will use the default promised lead time (2) as no history is yet available to suggest otherwise. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect current volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a pair of high-waisted skinny jeans. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend (0, 24, 29, 37, 41, 37), suggesting growing interest as we head into the spring season. In Period 1, we ordered 46 units with a promised lead time (L) of 2. However, because on-hand inventory was 0 at the start of Period 1, we lost 37 units of demand. Current on-hand is 0, with 46 units in transit. Since L=2, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. To bridge this gap and account for the increasing demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the higher recent average (around 36 units/period). I will use explicit L=2 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the 2-period wait plus the current period demand (L+1 total periods of coverage).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Feb 25, 2019. The product is a staple denim item ('Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim TRS'). Demands for the first two periods were 37 and 58, following the seed data (0, 24, 29, 37, 41). There is a clear upward trend in demand. Inventory is currently 0, with 91 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since promised lead time is 2, the P1 order (46 units) is expected to arrive during P3. The OR backend needs to cover demand for Period 3 (current) and the lead time periods (P4, P5), totaling 1+L = 3 periods of risk. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 (covering the last 4 available demand points excluding the zero) to capture the recent growth trend (29, 37, 41, 37, 58). This results in a higher mu_hat to account for the increasing demand trend and stockout situation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th, 2019. This product is 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim', a high-waisted skinny jean in the Divided collection. Demand has shifted upwards from the initial historical samples (mean ~26) to a higher regime in the last three periods (37, 58, 51; mean = 48.6). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 145 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible now, but the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 3. However, following the 'Critical Timing Example', an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 arrives during Period 3 and is visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message which I am reading now. The 'arrived=0' in Period 3 conclude suggests the Period 1 order (46 units) is either delayed or the actual lead time is >2. Given the stockout and the recent demand spike likely driven by spring fashion cycles (late Feb/early March), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for potential delays and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: avg demand increased from ~26 to ~49 (+88%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a high-waisted skinny denim jean, which generally sees steady or growing demand as spring fashion trends emerge. Demand history shows a clear regime shift: the average demand in the first 5 samples provided (0 to 41) was ~26.2, while the most recent 4 periods observed during the game (37, 58, 51, 57) have averaged 50.75. This confirms the previously noted ~88% increase. Regarding lead time, the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2), confirming the promised lead time of 2 periods is currently accurate. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 167 in-transit. The order from Period 1 (46 units) is still missing and technically 'overdue' if we strictly compare it to the Period 2 arrival, but given the sequence, it may be lost or delayed. To ensure we capture the higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to focus on the ~51 units/week average. With L=2, mu_hat (1+L)*demand should be around 153. Given the stockout situation (sold only 45 of 57 demand last period), the OR controller needs to replenish based on this higher mean and volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. Demand for these high-waisted skinny jeans has remained elevated, with a recent 5-period average of approximately 49.4 units (37, 58, 51, 57, 44), confirming the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 4 arrival of 45 units was immediately sold out, and the Period 1 order (46 units) appears lost as it is now 3 periods overdue beyond the promised lead time of 2. Specifically, Period 3, 4, and 5 concludes showed no sign of the P1 order. Period 5 also saw a missed sales opportunity of 44 units. To recover, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and use the 'calculate' method for L to see if the OR backend can better estimate lead time based on the one successful arrival (P4 arriving P2 order). This should set a base stock level sufficient to cover the 3-period lead+review window.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed loss of Period 1 shipment (46 units); order is 3 periods past promised lead time with no arrival recorded in concludes.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/25. The product is skinny denim trousers with a shift in demand starting in early February. Historical mean demand since Period 1 has been ~49 units (37, 58, 51, 57, 44, 58). On-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout caused by the confirmed loss of the Period 1 order (46 units). The Period 2 order arrived as scheduled in Period 4 (lead time = 2). The Period 3 order (54 units) and Period 4 order (67 units) are in-transit; P3 should have arrived in Period 5 and P4 in Period 6 based on promised lead time. Since they have not arrived, lead time is either drifting or these shipments are also lost. I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delay. Demand remains stable around the new mean, so I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the higher demand regime. mu_hat will cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand. This aggressive ordering helps replenish stock and account for pipeline uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability: Period 3 and Period 4 orders are now 2 and 1 periods overdue respectively, suggesting actual lead time \u2265 3 or high shipment loss rate.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for SKU 621381012 in Period 8 (2019/4/1) shows a severe stockout. On-hand inventory is 0. While demand has stabilized in a high regime (mean ~52 over the last 7 periods), the supply chain is highly unreliable. Historical 'concludes' show only one successful arrival (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Orders from Period 1 (46 units), Period 3 (54 units), and Period 4 (67 units) are significantly overdue (5, 2, and 1 periods past promised lead time respectively). Period 1 is confirmed lost. Given that Period 3 and 4 orders haven't arrived, the actual lead time is likely \u2265 4 periods, or we are experiencing a high loss rate. I will set the lead time to 4 to reflect this delay and ensure the 'base_stock' calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand, I'll use recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher demand regime that began in mid-February. Because of the heavy stockouts and the specific bottleneck in arrival, I need to ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order despite the 218 units technically 'in-transit', although some are likely lost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed \u2265 4 periods (Period 3 order of 54 units placed Feb 25 still not arrived by April 1). Severe stockouts persisting since Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing significant supply chain issues. We have identified a demand shift (avg ~55 since P2) and severe lead time volatility. The Period 1 order (46 units) is lost. Orders from Period 3 (54 units) and Period 4 (67 units) are substantially overdue (P3 is now 6 periods since ordering vs. promised 2). Surprisingly, the Period 7 order arrived in just 1 period (P8 conclude), which suggests that earlier orders are likely lost rather than just delayed. On-hand is currently 0. Demand remains strong at approx 55-60 units per period. Given the loss of older shipments, I will treat the Period 3 and 4 orders as lost to prevent the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic from under-ordering. To signal this, I will use 'explicit' L=2 but adjust 'mu_hat' to cover the gap. However, since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (223 units!), if I don't increase mu_hat significantly, it won't order. I will assume a mean demand of 56 and a lead time of 2. I set mu_hat to cover current and lead time demand (3 periods total), and inflate it slightly to account for the stockout risk and the likely reality that the 223 in-transit units include lost items.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: High probability that P3 (54) and P4 (67) orders are lost (6 and 5 periods since order, respectively, while P7 arrived in 1 period). Effective pipeline inventory is likely only 56 units (from P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the system is facing severe stockouts. Analysis of arrival history confirms significant shipment reliability issues: P1 (ordered 46), P3 (ordered 54), and P4 (ordered 67) are now 9, 7, and 6 periods overdue respectively, and are almost certainly lost. Only P2 (arrived P4) and P7 (arrived P8) successfully delivered. The backend's 'In-transit' figure of 223 units includes these 167 lost units (46+54+67), leaving an effective pipeline of only 56 units (from P8). Demand has stabilized in a high regime since mid-February, averaging approximately 53 units/period over the last 8 weeks. To compensate for the lost stock and high delivery risk, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 4 to force the OR engine to calculate a higher base stock level, effectively ignoring the phantom 'in-transit' units that will never arrive. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained high demand regime while sigma_hat is set to default to provide adequate safety stock for the high volatility seen.

Carry-over insight: Shipment loss rate is roughly 60% (3 out of 5 orders placed between P1-P7). Effective pipeline is significantly lower than reported In-transit units due to confirmed losses of P1, P3, and P4 orders.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for skinny denim has stabilized at a higher level compared to the start of the year, although Period 10 showed a lower figure (23), likely due to post-Easter stabilization. Looking at the last 6 periods (P5-P10), the average demand is approximately 47 units per period. Regarding shipments, P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 167 units) are officially considered lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 240 includes these 167 dead units, meaning the actual effective pipeline is only 73 units (from P10). The OR engine's formula [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] uses the nominal 240 units, which would cause it to under-order by 167 units. To force the backend to place an adequate order, I must increase mu_hat significantly to compensate for the 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, I need to add ~167 units to the base stock calculation. With L=2 (meaning base stock covers 3 periods), I set mu_hat to 300. This is derived from (Expected Mean 50 * 3 periods) + ~150 units of gap compensation. Sigma_hat is set to a higher value (60) to account for the instability of both demand and arrival reliability.

Carry-over insight: Actual Pipeline inventory is only 73 units (P10 order); 167 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed losses (P1, P3, P4). Demand mean since Period 5 is ~47 units/period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is skinny denim trousers. Current date is 2019-04-29. Demand has shifted slightly lower over the last two weeks (23, 34) compared to the March peak (~50-60), but remains significant. The primary challenge is shipment loss and lead time volatility. In-transit shows 318 units, but history confirms P1 (46), P3 (54), and P4 (67) orders are lost (total 167 units). The effective pipeline consists of P10 (73), P11 (78), and now P12. Stockouts occurred in Period 11 due to zero arrivals. I will use a recent_N demand window (N=7) to capture both the peak and the recent dip (avg ~46). For mu_hat, I will set an explicit value that accounts for the promised lead time (2) plus a safety buffer, also ensuring the order size compensates for on-hand being 0. By setting an explicit mu_hat higher than the 'In-transit' phantom inventory, I force the OR backend to place an order despite the 'In-transit' count being inflated by lost units.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed effective pipeline excludes P1, P3, and P4 (167 units total lost). Demand regime since P4 (Date Feb 11) fluctuates between 34-60 units; recent 7-period mean is 46.4 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU is in a state of severe inventory disruption. Analyzing the lead time history: P2 arrived in 2 periods, P7 in 1 period, and P8 in 2 periods. However, P1 (46), P3 (54), and P4 (67) are now 12, 10, and 9 periods overdue respectively, confirming they are lost. The total 'In-transit' figure of 341 includes these 167 lost units. Subtracting these, the effective pipeline consists of P10 (73), P11 (78), and P12 (23), totaling 174 units. Demand has cooled slightly in the last 3 periods (23, 34, 26) compared to the 'high' regime (avg ~50), with a recent 8-period mean of 42.5. To account for the lost stock and high stockout risk, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the effective pipeline gap. I want a base stock around 180-200 units. Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and the OR backend subtracts the 'In-transit' (341) from base_stock, I must artificially inflate mu_hat by the amount of lost stock (167 units) to force an order. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 310 (approx (1+2)*45 + 167) to ensure the system places an order that recognizes the 167 units in 'In-transit' don't actually exist.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: 167 units in 'In-transit' (P1, P3, P4 orders) are confirmed lost and will not arrive; OR parameters must be adjusted to offset this phantom inventory. Recent 3-period demand mean has dropped to 27.7 compared to previous 47.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the on-hand inventory is 46 units. The 'In-transit' count is 263 units, but historical evidence (Carry-over insights) confirms that orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 167 units) are lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline consists of orders from P10 (73) and P12 (23), totaling 96 units. Current effective global inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 46 + 96 = 142 units. The demand has shifted downwards over the last three periods (averaging ~27 units), following a high-demand regime of ~47 units. Given the seasonality of skinny denim trousers, this may be a transition phase. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 (capturing the recent low demand stabilization: 23, 34, 26, 32) to prevent excessive ordering while the system still carries phantom in-transit inventory. To ensure the backend places an order that offsets the 167 lost units (which it still thinks are coming), I must artificially inflate the base stock by using 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Target inventory for (L+1) periods = 3 periods * 35 (conservative forecast) = 105. Subtract effective pipeline (96) = 9 units additional needed. However, the OR backend subtracts the full 263 in-transit from its base stock. To force an order, I set mu_hat = (Target + Phantom) = 105 + 167 = 272.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean has stabilized at a lower level since Period 10, averaging ~29 units/period over the last 4 weeks compared to the previous ~47.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent 5-period demand (since Period 10) shows a mean of ~37.6 units/period (23, 34, 26, 32, 73). However, the spike in Period 14 (73 units) and the product description of 'skinny jeans' suggest volatility. On-hand inventory is 0. Current In-transit is 240 units. Based on game history, Period 1 (46 units), Period 3 (54 units), and Period 4 (67 units) orders are confirmed lost (167 units total). These orders are 10+ weeks old while subsequent orders (P7, P8, P11, P12) arrived in 1-2 weeks. Therefore, the 'effective pipeline' is only 73 units (from Period 10), which should have arrived but hasn't or is potentially lost given P11 and P12 arrived first. Since P11 and P12 orders (arrived P13 and P14) were small or exhausted by high demand (P14 demand = 73), and the P10 order is now late (4 periods since order), the current pipeline is likely empty or severely unreliable. To force an order from the backend despite the 'phantom' 167 units in In-transit, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat set significantly higher than recent demand to overcome (base_stock - pipeline). I set mu_hat to 350 to ensure an order is generated to replenish stock for this high-demand skinny denim item.

Carry-over insight: P10 order (73 units) is overdue (ordered P10, now P15, L=5) while P11 and P12 orders arrived in 2 periods; P10 is likely lost, bringing total confirmed lost units to 240 (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing extreme inventory instability due to a 66% order loss rate (P1, P3, P4, and now P10 are confirmed lost). This has created 240 units of 'phantom' inventory in the in-transit pipeline (P1: 46; P3: 54; P4: 67; P10: 73). While 'In-transit' shows 380, the real effective pipeline is only 140 (the order from P15). Demand has shown high volatility, with a significant spike to 67 units in Period 15, likely signaling a shift away from the low-demand regime seen in Periods 10-13 back towards high demand (~50-60 units). To fix the stockout and the pipeline gap, mu_hat must be set to cover the projected 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) PLUS the 240 lost units. Estimation: recent high demand mean (approx 60) * 3 periods = 180, plus 240 units to neutralize the phantom inventory = 420. Setting mu_hat to 420 via 'explicit' method will force the OR engine to order enough to reach a new base stock level that ignores the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: P10 order (73 units) confirmed lost (Ordered P10, now P16, L=6). Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) equals 240 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Demand has trended back up, with P15 demand at 67.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381012 has a significant loss rate for shipments. Historically, orders from Period 1 (46), P3 (54), P4 (67), and now likely P10 (73) have failed to arrive, totaling 240 units of 'phantom inventory' in the reported 452 units in-transit. The effective pipeline consists of P15 (140 units) and P16 (72 units), totaling 212 units. Recent demand has resurged, with Period 15 and 16 demand at 67 and 52 respectively, averaging ~60 over the last 2 weeks after a dip in May. With current on-hand inventory at 0 and expected arrivals from P15/P16 not due for another period (assuming L=2), we are in a stockout. To compensate for the 240 lost units and the increased demand volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit method to force the OR backend to ignore the phantom inventory. I forecast demand at ~60 units/period; for L=2, the base stock should cover (L+1) periods, i.e., 3 * 60 = 180 units. However, the backend subtracts the reported In-transit (452) from the base stock. To trigger a sufficient order, mu_hat must be set to (180 + 240 lost + buffer) = 450+. Given the backend cap is also tied to mu_hat, I will set mu_hat to 510 and sigma_hat higher to ensure the target service level is met despite the reporting errors.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of P10 order (73 units); total phantom inventory in In-transit equals 240 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Recent demand has rebounded from ~30/week to ~60/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand has increased significantly over the last three periods (67, 52, 92), averaging 70.3 units per period. This confirms a rebound in interest for this SKU (High-waisted denim jeans) entering the summer months. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 370 units, but 240 of these units (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10) are confirmed lost based on historical gaps in arrivals. The true pipeline inventory consists of the order from P17 (130 units). With on-hand inventory at 120 units and an effective pipeline of 130, our total inventory position is 250 units. To satisfy the recent high demand and protect against the high shipment loss rate (~40-50%), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture this new upward regime (N=3, mean ~70). L is set to calculated as recent arrivals have been 1 or 2 periods, even though some are lost. Sigma_hat is set to the recent regime of 3 to reflect the higher volatility observed in the recent demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Average demand increased from ~30 to ~70 (+133%) over the last 3 periods, suggesting a summer seasonal peak for this denim SKU.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17 (summer peak). Demand for this denim SKU has surged, with the last 3 periods averaging 83.7 units (67, 92, 92), confirming a higher demand regime compared to May. Lead times have stabilized for recent orders (P11, 12, 15, 16 all arrived within 1-2 periods), but there is a significant 'phantom' inventory issue: P1, P3, P4, and P10 (total 240 units) are confirmed lost and remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 370 units. This means the actual useful pipeline is only 130 units (the P17 order). To account for this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the base stock calculation, effectively forcing the OR engine to order despite the high reported (but mostly lost) pipeline. I am setting mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~85 units over a 3-period lead cycle (L+1=3), then adding a buffer to offset the 240 lost units. Target base stock = (3 * 85) + 240 = 495. I will set mu_hat to 495 and keep L at default (2) to target this level. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to handle the high volatility seen in the summer shift.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal peak confirmed: Demand mean increased significantly in June, averaging ~84 units over the last 3 periods (P15-P18). Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains at 240 units (P1, P3, P4, P10), which consistently inflates the 'In-transit' figure and must be offset in parameter logic.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a sustained summer seasonal peak. Demand has surged significantly over the last 3 periods (92, 92, 111), averaging 98.3 units per period. This validates the previous carry-over insight of a regime shift. We have 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 510 units. However, 240 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, and P10) are confirmed lost/phantom inventory and will not arrive. The active pipeline consists of P17 (130) and P19 (140), totaling 270 units. To ensure the OR engine places an order to cover the (L+1) demand window (3 periods * ~98 units = 294 units), we must adjust mu_hat to offset the phantom inventory. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (Transit_reported - Lost)', and base_stock is roughly mu_hat, setting mu_hat explicitly to the target demand (294) + phantom (240) = 534 ensures the logic triggers a replenishment of approximately 264 units (534 - 510 + onhand). I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this high-demand, high-uncertainty phase while accounting for the logistical noise.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak intensified: 3-period demand mean is 98.3 (Periods 17-19), confirming seasonal high for denim SKU. Total phantom inventory remains 240 units (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are in a high-demand summer seasonal peak for this denim SKU. Recent demand (Periods 17-20) shows a mean of ~85 units (92, 92, 111, 46 - noting the P20 drop followed a significant stockout/low supply). Cumulative evidence points to a high number of 'Phantom' In-transit units: P1 (46), P3 (54), P4 (67), and P10 (73) are confirmed lost, totaling 240 units of phantom inventory. Subtracting this from the reported 564 units in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 324 units (orders from P15 onwards). The current on-hand is 0. To ensure the base-stock level (covering L+1 periods of demand) is met despite the phantom inventory problem, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' to 360 (covering 3 periods at ~120/period to aggressively capture the peak and overcome the pipeline gap) and L is kept at 'default' (2) to reflect the standard physical lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high volatility during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected; summer seasonal peak remains the dominant demand driver with persistent shipment loss leading to 240 phantom units in in-transit.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a summer seasonal peak, with demand in June and early July (Periods 17-21) averaging approximately 82.6 units per period, despite high volatility. The 'In-transit' figure of 564 units is heavily distorted by known lost shipments (240 units from P1, P3, P4, P10) and potentially more recent delays, as no arrivals occurred in the last four periods (P18-P21). Period 17 saw a dual arrival with lead times of 1 and 2 periods, but the subsequent gap suggests a return to lead time instability or loss. To compensate for the 240 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, mu_hat must be adjusted upward to force an order. Since on-hand is 0 and demand is high, I set mu_hat explicitly to provide a target base stock that ignores the lost units. With an estimated (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~83 units/period (total 249) plus the 240 phantom offset, a target base stock of approximately 490 units is needed to trigger replenishment. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain high service levels during this peak while accounting for the supply chain reliability issues.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Seasonal peak for denim SKU continues into July; demand mean (P17-P21) is ~83 units/period (+176% vs spring low). Phantom inventory remains at at least 240 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. The denim SKU 621381012 is in a high summer seasonal peak. While demand dipped slightly to 67 in Period 22 from previous triple-digit highs, the mean demand over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) is approximately 80 units/period. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 510 units is highly misleading due to 240 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10). Subtracting these phantom units leaves a real pipeline of 270 units (P15 order of 140 arrived in P17, so looking at outstanding: P17 (130), P19 (140), and P20 (54 - arrived in P22). Actual remaining pipeline: 130 + 140 = 270 units). Since base_stock calculation (mu_hat) subtracts pipeline inventory, I must use 'explicit' values to compensate for the 240 lost units that the OR engine incorrectly thinks will arrive. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~80 * 3 = 240) PLUS the 240 phantom units to force an order that bridges the gap, totaling 480. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high summer volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-22, in the middle of a confirmed summer seasonal peak for this denim SKU. Recent demand (Periods 17-23) has been extremely high, averaging 84.8 units/period, despite some fluctuations (e.g., P23 demand was 114). The on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports In-transit as 548 units. However, based on Carry-Over Insights, 313 units are confirmed 'phantom' (lost) shipments: P1 (46), P3 (54), P4 (67), P10 (73), and now potentially P19 (140) which was ordered 5 periods ago (L=2 promised) and hasn't arrived. If we exclude P19, phantom inventory is 313; if we also assume P19 is lost, it's 453. Given the persistent stockouts and the high demand regime, I must set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' where N=7 to capture the summer demand level (~85 units). To compensate for the 313-453 phantom units blocking new orders in the OR backend's inventory-position logic (Base Stock - Pipeline), I will set the Lead Time L to an 'explicit' value of 6. This artificially inflates the target base stock level (Base Stock \u2248 (L+1)*mu), allowing the backend to place orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: P19 order (140 units) is now 5 periods past order date with no arrival, highly likely lost. Total phantom inventory in In-transit is likely 453 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand summer seasonal peak for denim trousers, with demand averaging approximately 81 units per period over the last 8 weeks (Periods 17-24). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 649 units is extremely misleading due to persistent shipment losses. Historical analysis confirms that orders from periods 1 (46), 3 (54), 4 (67), 10 (73), and now almost certainly 19 (140) have not arrived despite the promised 2-period lead time. This creates 380 units of 'phantom' inventory (649 - 380 = 269 real pipeline units: P23=38, P24=101, P17=130? - wait, P17 order of 130 is also now 8 periods old and likely lost). If P17 is also lost, phantom inventory is 510, leaving only P23 and P24 as valid. Given the 60%+ loss rate and high demand (approx 80-100/week), I need to aggressively set mu_hat to ensure the OR engine triggers orders despite the inflated pipeline. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to set a high target of 400 (corresponds to approx 4 periods of demand at 100/unit) to force procurement until stock levels stabilize.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) estimated at 510 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19). These units perpetually inflate the 'In-transit' figure and must be bridged by setting mu_hat significantly higher than actual expected demand or using explicit values to ignore the backend's pipeline calculation logic.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a summer seasonal peak, with demand for these high-waisted denim jeans averaging ~83 units per period over the last 5 periods (P21-P25). However, a major structural issue exists: out of the 649 units reported 'In-transit', approximately 510 units are confirmed lost shipments (P1=46, P3=54, P4=67, P10=73, P17=130, and P19=140). The backend OR engine uses 'In-transit' to reduce new orders (base_stock - pipeline), meaning these 'phantom' units prevent the system from placing necessary new orders, leading to the continuous stockouts observed since Period 19. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom inventory plus the desired base stock. With an expected demand of ~85 units/period and a lead time of 2, the desired base stock is roughly 255. Adding the 510 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 765 to bypass the pipeline deduction and trigger a meaningful restock. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility of the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed total phantom inventory (lost shipments) reached 510 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19). This represents 78% of the 'In-transit' figure, requiring significant upward adjustment of mu_hat to trigger any replenishment orders.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' is experiencing a severe structural issue with lost shipments, creating 'phantom inventory' in the OR backend's pipeline. As of Period 27, the 'In-transit' figure is 760 units, but historical analysis confirms at least 510 units are lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19). The P17 order (130 units) is now 10 periods past its order date, and P19 (140 units) is 8 periods past. These units will never arrive but they prevent the OR backend from ordering because it believes they cover future demand. The current demand regime for this skinny denim product (seasonal peak) averages ~82 units/period (last 10 periods). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and valid pipeline inventory is likely only ~250 units (P24 and P26 orders), I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom inventory (510 units) plus the desired base stock for the current (L+1) horizon. Setting mu_hat to 950 ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation yields a positive order to prevent continued stockouts, effectively 'bridging' the 510 missing units.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 17 order (130 units) is lost, bringing total confirmed phantom inventory to 510 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19). Demand remains high for August, averaging ~82 units/period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 987 units reported as 'In-transit'. However, historical data confirms a severe shipment loss pattern. Specifically, orders from Periods 1 (46), 3 (54), 4 (67), 10 (73), 17 (130), and 19 (140) have never arrived and are well past any reasonable lead time, totaling 510 phantom units. Additionally, the P24 order (101 units) is now at L=4 with no arrival, suggesting it might also be lost, potentially bringing phantom inventory to 611 units. The demand has spiked significantly in August, with Period 27 demand reaching 173 units, confirming a late summer peak for this high-waisted denim SKU. To counter the OR backend's belief that 987 units are available to meet demand, I must set mu_hat extremely high. The goal is to force the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation to remain positive despite the phantom 611+ units. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1100 (covering 3 periods of ~150 demand + 650 phantom units buffer) to trigger necessary replenishment as we approach the end of August.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) estimated at 611 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24). August demand surge confirmed (P27 demand: 173).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant late-summer/back-to-school demand surge in August, with demand jumping to 173 and 194 in the last two periods. On-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is severely compromised by phantom inventory. Confirmed lost shipments include P1(46), P3(54), P4(67), P10(73), P17(130), P19(140), and P24(101), totaling 611 phantom units. Period 24 is now 5 periods old and highly likely lost. The backend currently sees 1227 units in-transit, but only 616 units are actually likely to arrive (from P26, P27, P28). To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 1227 'in-transit' units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat to 1600, which aims to cover (L+1=3) periods of the current high demand surge (approx 190/period) while effectively cancelling out the 611 phantom units in the backend's base-stock calculation (1227 in-transit - 611 phantom = 616 real pipeline; target base stock needs to be ~1200 to cover 3 periods of 200 demand plus safety, plus the 611 'noise' that the backend will subtract). Using L=3 to account for recent arrival delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed (late August), demand increased to ~184 units/period. Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) increased to 611 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' is currently in a high-demand Back-to-School phase, with demand peaking at 184 units in Period 29. Effective pipeline management is the primary challenge due to massive shipping losses. The In-transit figure of 1727 units is heavily inflated by confirmed/suspected lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, and P24. These lost units (totaling ~611 units) are ignored by the OR engine's internal logic, leading to systemic under-ordering if not bridged. Furthermore, P26 (149 units) and P27 (227 units) are now potentially delayed or lost. To ensure any orders are placed during this surge, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' to include both the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon and an offset to cancel out the phantom inventory being counted as supply. Given recent mean demand is ~180, and L=2, base demand is 540. Adding the confirmed 611 lost units creates an target mu_hat of ~1151 to force the backend to clear the phantom inventory hurdle. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to provide a robust safety buffer against the high variance and lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed total phantom inventory (lost shipments) reached at least 611 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24). P26 (149 units) and P27 (227 units) are currently delayed and should be monitored for status as potential additional losses.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current replenishment logic must account for massive 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments) that prevents the OR backend from ordering. Confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26) total 760 units. These stay in 'In-transit' indefinitely. To force an order when on-hand inventory is low and demand is high (back-to-school/seasonal surge), mu_hat must be set to an explicit value that exceeds both the expected demand and the phantom pipeline gap. Current demand is high (~170-195 units). The backend formula is 'base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat'. To trigger an order, base_stock must exceed (on-hand + in-transit). With on-hand=272 and in-transit=1260, we need a base_stock > 1532. Setting mu_hat to 1800 using the 'explicit' method bypasses the standard (1+L)*mean calculation and forces the system to recognize the need for more stock despite the phantom units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the recent variability (2-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) has reached 760 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26). This constitutes ~60% of current In-transit volume. September demand remains elevated near 180-200 units/period. Explicit mu_hat values are required to overcome the pipeline inflation caused by these losses.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand Back-to-School/Autumn transition phase (late August - September), with demand averaging approximately 173 units over the last 5 periods. The primary operational challenge is 'phantom inventory': multiple historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26) have inflated the 'In-transit' figure by 909 units. This phantom inventory misleads the OR backend into under-ordering because it believes a massive supply is incoming. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set to an 'explicit' value that significantly exceeds physical demand, essentially 'tricking' the backend into placing an order by neutralizing the 909 units of lost stock. Total pipeline needed = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Units. Expected demand is ~180. With L=2, (180 * 3) + 909 \u2248 1450. Since on-hand is 116, mu_hat must be around 1450-1500 to trigger a meaningful replenishment. Lead time remains approximately 2-3 periods based on recent P27 and P28 arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) has reached 909 units: P1(46), P3(54), P4(67), P10(73), P17(130), P19(140), P24(101), P26(298 - wait, P26 was 149, P29 was 500). Corrected Lost: P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26 = 760 units. This consistently inflates In-transit, requiring explicit mu_hat adjustments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' is in a high-demand regime, likely driven by the end of summer and back-to-school sales, with demand averaging approximately 170 units over the last 6 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 285 units. In-transit stands at 1260 units, but historical analysis confirms a significant portion of this is 'phantom inventory'\u2014shipments that were lost and never arrived. Specifically, orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, and P26 are confirmed lost, totaling 760 units (46+54+67+73+130+140+101+149). This results in an actual effective pipeline of 500 units (from P29). To ensure the OR engine places necessary replenishment orders, mu_hat must be set explicitly to account for this 760-unit gap in the pipeline calculation. The target base stock (calculated as mu_hat + safety stock) must exceed the total reported 'In-transit' + 'On-hand' to trigger an order. I am setting mu_hat for the (L+1) period (3 weeks) based on the recent surge mean of ~180, plus an explicit offset of 760 to neutralize the phantom inventory, totaling 1300. This ensures we maintain availability during this high-demand period while accounting for systemic shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Current phantom inventory (lost shipments) is 760 units: P1(46), P3(54), P4(67), P10(73), P17(130), P19(140), P24(101), P26(149). This 760-unit inflation of 'In-transit' must be offset in mu_hat calculations to allow the OR engine to order.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' (Denim Trousers) is currently experiencing high demand following a back-to-school/seasonal surge starting in late August. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~170 units over the last 7 periods (P27-P33). However, a major operational challenge persists: a significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory (1260 units) is comprised of lost shipments. Based on history, the confirmed lost orders are P1(46), P3(54), P4(67), P10(73), P17(130), P19(140), P24(101), and P26(149), totaling 760 units. This 'phantom inventory' prevents the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~170 * 3 = 510). To trigger an order from the backend despite the 1260 units in-transit, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - pipeline' results in the desired replenishment. Since pipeline (1260) - lost (760) = 500 real units, and my current on-hand is 66, I need to signal enough demand to cover the lost units. I set mu_hat to 1270, which effectively cancels out the phantom pipeline and targets a base stock that will maintain availability for the high-demand September/October period.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains at 760 units: P1(46), P3(54), P4(67), P10(73), P17(130), P19(140), P24(101), P26(149). This inflation of 'In-transit' requires explicit parameter overrides to ensure the OR engine continues to place orders.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' is experiencing a sustained elevated demand regime, likely due to back-to-school and autumn seasonality for denim. Recent demand has averaged approximately 170 units over the last 5 periods (P30-P34). A critical issue remains the massive inflation of 'In-transit' inventory due to lost shipments. As of P35, there are 1260 units listed in transit. Based on history, at least 760 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26) are confirmed losses. Furthermore, P29 (500 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost, bringing the phantom inventory to approximately 1260 units. This means the 'true' pipeline inventory is nearly zero. To force the OR engine to place a replenishment order despite this massive 'phantom' inventory, I must set mu_hat (which covers L+1 periods) significantly higher than real expected demand. I am setting mu_hat to 2000 to offset the 1260 units of phantom pipeline and target a base stock that triggers an order roughly equivalent to 2-3 weeks of projected demand (175/week).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 29 order (500 units) is lost, bringing total phantom inventory to approximately 1260 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Demand remains high for autumn, averaging ~170 units/period since Period 30.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381012 (Denim Trousers) continues to face a significant shipment loss problem, which is misleading the OR backend's inventory balancing. As of Period 36, the In-transit figure stands at 2070 units. Based on historical conclude messages, we have confirmed losses for orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, and now P29 (500 units), totaling 1260 units of 'phantom inventory'. Subtracting this from the 2070 in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 810 units (the order placed just last period). Since on-hand is 0 and demand is currently high (averaging ~160 units/period since September), the backend will see the massive phantom pipeline and refuse to order. To force a replenishment order that covers the current demand regime and account for the lost stock, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2100. This is calculated to exceed the visible pipeline inventory (~1260 lost + 810 recent) plus a safety buffer for the 2-period lead time. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual variability (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N (N=6)' to capture the high volatility seen in the autumn demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 29 order (500 units) is lost, bringing total phantom inventory to approximately 1260 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Demand has moderated slightly in October (75 units in P35) but the 5-week average remains high at 146 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, on-hand inventory is 741 units following a large arrival of 810 units in Period 36. Demand has notably decelerated in October, with the last two periods showing 75 and 69 units respectively, compared to the 150-200 range seen in August/September. This confirms the passing of the back-to-school peak. There is a massive 'In-transit' figure of 1364 units, but historically, a significant portion of this is phantom (lost) inventory. Confirmed losses from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, and now P29 total 1260 units. Therefore, the true pipeline inventory is roughly 104 units (from P36). With 741 on hand and ~100 in true pipeline, the total stock (~841) covers over 10 periods of current demand (~70-80 units/week). My goal is to prevent the OR engine from ordering more until the current surplus is utilized. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the lower October demand regime, which will result in a lower base stock and prevent unnecessary replenishment given the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: High seasonal peak has ended; demand decreased from ~180 to ~72 (-60%) over the last 3 periods. Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) is confirmed at 1260 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29), which will permanently inflate the In-transit figure.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' (Jade Trash Skinny Denim) is transitioning out of a significant summer/back-to-school peak (P27-P34) where demand averaged ~180 units. Since Period 35 (October), demand has sharply moderated to a 3-period average of ~72 units. The 'In-transit' figure is heavily inflated by 1,260 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). In Period 36, a large order (P35, 810 units) arrived, leaving on-hand inventory at 670 units. Given the new demand regime of ~72 units/period and the current on-hand stock, there is sufficient inventory for approximately 9 weeks. Therefore, the goal is to prevent the OR engine from ordering more until the existing stock is depleted. Because 'In-transit' (1364) contains 1260 phantom units, the effective pipeline is only 104 units (the P36 order). Total effective position is ~774 units. By setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=3) which targets ~216 units (3 periods * 72), the OR engine will naturally see that on-hand (670) + effective pipeline (104) far exceeds requirements and will place no new orders.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) reached 1260 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29), which will permanently inflate the In-transit figure until it is cleared or manually offset.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-260.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early November. Historically, the high summer/back-to-school peak (P27-P34, avg ~170) has ended, with a new regime established since P35 averaging ~74 units/period (75, 69, 71, 82). Current on-hand is 588 units, which covers approximately 8 periods of current demand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1364 is heavily inflated by 1260 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Subtracting these lost units from 1364 leaves an effective pipeline of 104 units (from the order placed in P36). Total effective inventory (On-hand 588 + Effective Pipeline 104) is 692 units. At a demand of ~75/week, this is approximately 9 weeks of stock. Since the inventory is currently high relative to the new lower demand regime and lead time is ~2, no new orders are necessary. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P31, P35) showed shorter L=1, while the overall history is closer to L=2. Mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stable post-peak demand regime of ~74 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 11, 2019. Following the high demand period (August-September, peaks of ~195), demand has shifted to a lower autumn regime, averaging 70 units over the last 5 periods (P35-P39: 75, 69, 71, 82, 53). On-hand inventory is currently high at 639 units due to a large order (810 units) arriving in P36. The 'In-transit' figure of 1260 units is confirmed to be composed entirely of phantom inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1260 units of In-transit from the base stock calculation, it will see a massive 'pipeline' and never order, despite this inventory being lost. To prevent future stockouts once current on-hand is depleted, I must maintain an explicit mu_hat that offsets this 1260-unit phantom inventory. For Period 40, my focus is to avoid unnecessary holding costs while on-hand is high, but prepare for future replenishment. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand level (~70 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak regime: Demand has stabilized at ~70 units/period (average P35-P39) following the late-summer surge.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stabilized post-peak demand regime, averaging ~64 units/period over the last 6 weeks (P35-P40: 75, 69, 71, 82, 53, 54). The current on-hand inventory is 585 units, which provides approximately 9 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1260 units is comprised entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29), meaning it is 'phantom inventory' that the OR engine will mistakenly count toward the base stock. However, since the current on-hand inventory (585) already significantly exceeds the necessary base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (which would be roughly (1+2)*64 = 192 plus safety stock), no new orders are required. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent stabilized demand to allow the system to bleed off the excess on-hand inventory without triggering unnecessary orders.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a post-peak average of ~61 units/period over the last 7 weeks (P35-P41). On-hand inventory is 539 units, which covers approximately 8.8 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' value of 1260 units consists entirely of 'phantom inventory'\u2014confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29) that will never arrive. Because on-hand inventory is currently very high relative to demand, there is no immediate need to order, and the holding cost ($1.00) vs profit ($4.00) suggests a lean inventory posture is better to avoid excessive costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current stabilized demand regime, while keeping L at default. The backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will result in zero orders because the on-hand inventory already exceeds the target, and the phantom in-transit units further suppress ordering, which is acceptable given our current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (Oct-Nov) stabilized at ~61 units/period. Phantom inventory remains 1260 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019. Demand for this denim SKU has transitioned from a high late-summer/back-to-school peak (~180 units/period) to a stabilized post-peak regime averaging approximately 60 units/period over the last 8 weeks (P35-P42 mean = 65.6). On-hand inventory is healthy at 464 units. However, there is a significant 'phantom inventory' issue: the In-transit figure of 1260 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, and P29). Since the OR backend subtracts In-transit from the base stock calculation, it will never place a new order as long as this phantom 1260 units exists, even when on-hand inventory eventually depletes. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that captures both expected demand over the lead time (L=2, so 3 periods of demand) PLUS the 1260 phantom units. 3 periods of demand at ~60 units/period \u2248 180 units. Explicit mu_hat = 180 (forecast) + 1260 (offset) = 1440. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 8-period window to reflect current regime volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381012' is currently in a stable post-peak demand regime, averaging ~61 units/period since Period 35 (the late-summer/back-to-school surge has ended). The current on-hand inventory is 444 units. However, there is a persistent issue with 'phantom' pipeline inventory: 1260 units in the 'In-transit' figure are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, and P29). Because the OR backend's base-stock logic subtracts the total In-transit (1260 units) from the calculated base stock, it will perceive a massive oversupply and never place further orders, even as on-hand inventory depletes. To ensure the backend continues to function correctly, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. This allows me to set a target inventory level that ignores the corrupted pipeline data. Current demand is ~61/week; with a 2-week lead time, (1+L) demand is ~183. Since on-hand is 444, no new order is needed this period, but I will set parameters to reflect the current regime while acknowledging the phantom inventory hurdle.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December (2019-12-16). Analyzing the demand history, we are in a post-peak regime for this skinny denim SKU. Demand has significantly cooled from the late-summer/back-to-school peak of ~180 units/period to a more stable winter level of ~45-50 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P40-P44: 54, 46, 75, 20, 29). The 'In-transit' figure of 1260 units is entirely composed of 'phantom inventory' (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, and P29) which are confirmed lost per long-term tracking. This phantom inventory prevents the OR backend from placing new orders naturally because it believes the pipeline is full. On-hand inventory is currently 415 units, which provides ample cover for about 8 periods at the current consumption rate of ~50 units. While the system doesn't need to order today, I must maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat settings that reflect the current lower demand regime to ensure accurate service levels once on-hand stocks deplete further.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak winter stabilization: Demand has averaged 44.8 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P40-P44), down from the ~180 units/period peak. Phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains stagnant at 1260 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. Demand for this denim SKU has entered a post-peak winter stabilization period. Over the last 5 weeks (P41-P45), demand has averaged 39.2 units per period, a significant decrease from the summer peak of ~180 units. On-hand inventory is currently 389 units, which at the current consumption rate, provides nearly 10 weeks of coverage. The 'In-transit' figure remains at 1260 units, but as documented in carry-over insights, these units represent cumulative lost shipments from periods 1 through 29 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29) and will never arrive. Because on-hand inventory is already high relative to the current low-demand regime, no new orders are necessary. L is set to default (2). mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized winter demand mean of ~39 units (multiplied by 1+L by the backend). sigma_hat is also set using the most recent 5 periods to reflect reduced volatility. The high on-hand inventory will prevent the OR engine from ordering despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The SKU is a high-waisted skinny denim jean, which has transitioned from a high-demand summer/back-to-school peak (averaging ~180 units/period) into a stable post-peak winter regime. For the last 7 periods (P40-P46), demand has averaged 40.3 units per period (54, 46, 75, 20, 29, 26, 27), with the most recent 4 weeks averaging contextually lower at 25.5 units. On-hand inventory is currently 362 units, and the In-transit figure of 1260 units consists entirely of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, and P29). Since current on-hand inventory (362) covers approximately 9-14 weeks of current demand (at ~25-40 units/week), and lead time is ~2 periods, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from ordering (which it wouldn't anyway given high on-hand), and to ensure the most accurate reflecting of the current demand regime, I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the winter stabilization. Lead time L is set to calculate.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak winter stabilization confirmed: Demand averaged 40.3 units/period over the last 7 weeks (P40-P46), a significant decrease from the summer peak. Phantom inventory remains at 1260 units.
