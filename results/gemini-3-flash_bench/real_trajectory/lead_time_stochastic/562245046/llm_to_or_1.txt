Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 562245046 (Womens 5-pocket skinny jeans). There is no history of 'conclude' messages yet as this is the first decision phase. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Historical demand shows a steady upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 96, 108, 122, 131, 140 (average ~119, with the most recent sample at 140). This trend suggests growth as we approach the spring season for 'Everyday Collection' trousers. Using all 5 recent samples (N=5) to capture the current demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time is 2, and since we have no evidence of variation yet, I will use the 'default' method for L (which defaults to the promised L=2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Luna skinny RW', a core 5-pocket jeans item from the 'Womens Everyday Collection'. Total demand samples (including Period 1) are: 96, 108, 122, 131, 140, 155. There is a clear upward trend in demand over these 6 weeks. Period 1 demand was 155, but we had 0 inventory and thus 0 sales (lost demand). On-hand is 0, with 149 units in-transit from the order placed in Period 1. Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, we expect this order to arrive in the 'resolution phase' of Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. No shipments have concluded yet, so we assume the default lead time. To address the rising demand trend, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent growth (averaging approx 142 units/period recently) rather than the lower values from early January. This will help the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the current demand velocity and volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Feb 25, 2019. The product is a pair of women's skinny jeans. Demand has been increasing steadily: 96, 108, 122, 131, 140 (pre-game), and 155, 193 (in-game). This trend suggests early spring seasonality or a ramping product. On-hand is currently 0 with significant lost sales due to no inventory. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The Period 1 order (149 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 (current) and become visible in Period 4. The Period 2 order (162 units) is expected to arrive in Period 4. I will use recent trends (N=5) to capture the upward momentum in demand.mu_hat will be set using recent_N=5 (covering periods 2019-01-28 to 2019-02-18, avg ~160) to account for the current demand level which is significantly higher than the early January baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand is in a clear upward regime: increased from ~100 in early Jan to ~193 in late Feb (+93%).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/03/04). The product is 'Luna skinny RW', women's jeans. Historical demand shows a consistent upward trend: 96, 108, 122, 131, 140 (pre-game) and 155, 193, 207 (Periods 1-3). This represents a clear growth regime as we transition from winter into early spring. Current on-hand is 0. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (ordered on 2019/02/11) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in Period 3's conclusion if L=2. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, which is expected because Period 1 order arrives DURING Period 3 and is only reported at the START of Period 4 (per the Timing Example). I expect the Period 1 order (149 units) to be available for the current Period 4 demand. Demand is currently averaging ~200 units. Since demand is still trending up, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this high-level demand (avg ~185) and use an explicit sigma_hat of 35 to account for the increasing volatility. L remains default (2).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: transitioned from ~100 (Jan) to ~200 (latest samples), a 100% increase over 8 weeks.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans), experiencing a strong upward demand trend as we move into March. History shows demand has risen from ~100 in early January to 257 in Period 4. We are currently out of stock (ending on-hand 0). Total in-transit is 451 (from P1, P3, and P4 orders). The P1 order (149 units) is now overdue (placed P1, expected P3, currently P5 start). This suggests potential shipment issues or lead-time variability. However, the P2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. Given the massive demand spike in P4 (257 units), I will use an explicit forecast to account for the growth. I expect demand for the next (L+1=3) periods to be around 250-270 per week. Setting mu_hat to 780 (260 * 3) and increasing sigma_hat to handle the high volatility seen in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating: Period 4 demand (257) is a 24% increase over Period 3 (207) and 150%+ over Jan baseline. Order from Period 1 is currently 2 periods overdue.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Luna skinny RW jeans' is experiencing a sharp upward demand trend as we move into spring (March). Historical demand has risen from ~100 in January to 312 in Period 5. We have a major supply issue: there is currently 0 on-hand inventory, and the Period 1 order (149 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since ordering, vs promised 2). However, the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (lead_time 2) in Period 4. This suggests Period 1 might be lost or stuck. To compensate for the stockouts and the rising trend, I am basing mu_hat on the most recent 3 samples (Ps 3, 4, 5) which average ~258. Applying the (1+L) multiplier (where L=2), mu_hat = 3 * 258 = 774. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set this target, accounting for the growth to ~312. I'll maintain the default lead time but monitor for further late shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed lost or severely delayed shipment from Period 1 (ordered P1, now P6 with no arrival). Demand continues to surge, reaching 312 in P5 (+200% from Jan baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4355.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product (Women's 5-pocket jeans) is experiencing high volatility. Demand peaked at 312 in Period 5 before dipping to 236 in Period 6. Based on recent history, the mean demand over the last 3 periods is approx 268. Lead time is volatile: while the promised lead time is 2, Period 5's order arrived in just 1 period (observed in P6 conclude), whereas the Period 1 order appears to be lost (no arrive message after 6 periods). Period 3 and 4 orders (totaling 302 units) are still in-transit and overdue based on the promised 2-period lead time. To mitigate the risk of stockouts given the lost/delayed shipments and high demand variance, I will set L to 2 (promised). I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (covering the transition to the 200-300 range) to capture the higher baseline without over-indexing on the single peak of 312. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the significantly increased volatility compared to January.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: Observed actual lead time of 1 period for P5 order, while P1 order (and likely P3/P4 orders) are lost or severely delayed. Recent demand (P3-P6) has stabilized in a high-volume regime (avg ~253) compared to much lower Jan/Feb baselines.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Luna skinny RW jeans' is in a high-demand regime, with demand averaging ~254 units over the last 5 periods (P3-P7), significantly up from the early Jan average of ~100. We are currently facing stockouts (On-hand: 0) and high pipeline uncertainty. Order P1 (149 units) is now 7 periods old and P3/P4 orders are likewise missing, confirming significant shipment loss or severe delay. However, order P5 arrived with a lead time of 1 (instead of promised 2). Given the 2019/4/1 date, we are entering the spring season, so I will base our forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (N=5) to ensure sufficient coverage. Mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean(last 5 samples) = 3 * ~254 \u2248 762. Sigma_hat remains on recent statistics to capture the current volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to weight the observed drift against the promised time.

Carry-over insight: Established high-demand regime (P3-P7) with an average of 254 units/period, roughly 150% above initial baseline. Order from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost or significantly delayed (6+ periods passed since P1).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 3-8) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 254 units and a standard deviation of about 46 units. We are seeing significant lead time variability: Period 5 and Period 7 orders arrived in 1 period, while Period 2 and Period 6 arrived in 2 periods. Orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are now 5+ periods overdue and must be considered lost; they are still in the 'In-transit' count (550 units), but the OR backend's inventory balancing (base_stock - pipeline) will incorrectly assume they are coming. I will set mu_hat to explicitly cover 3 periods of demand (L+1 where L=2) based on the recent high-demand average (254 * 3 = 762) and use an explicit sigma_hat. Using L='calculate' allows the engine to adapt to the mixed 1-2 period delivery times observed recently.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245046' (Womens Skinny Jeans) is in a high-demand regime. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P3-P9), the demand average is approximately 254 units. Orders from P1, P3, and P4 appear lost, necessitating a cautious approach to lead time. While the promised lead time is 2, recent successful arrivals showed lead times of 1 (P5, P7 orders) and 2 (P2, P6 orders). Given the inconsistency and the stockout in Period 9 (0 ending inventory, 250 units lost demand), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=7 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (avg ~254, which scales to ~762 for L+1=3). I will use 'calculate' for lead time to allow the OR engine to use the average of observed successful deliveries (1 and 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~254 units/period (P3-P9 average). Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost. Lead time fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods for successful arrivals.

In Period 11 (2019/4/22), we have an on-hand inventory of 245 units and a pipeline of 452 units (primarily an order of 451 placed in P10). Demand has entered a stabilized high-volume regime since late Feb/early March. The average demand from P3 to P10 is approximately 245 units/period. Looking at the last 5 periods (P6-P10), demand has been 236, 211, 305, 251, and 184, averaging ~237. The P10 dip to 184 might be a minor fluctuation or the start of a cooling period, but given the 'Everyday Collection' nature of the product, maintaining the 'recent_N' approach (N=8) covers the high-demand regime effectively. Lead times have been inconsistent, alternating between 1 and 2 periods (P9 arrived in 1, P8 arrived in 2, P7 arrived in 1, P6 arrived in 2, P5 arrived in 1). Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are decisively lost. To ensure the backend doesn't over-rely on promised lead time while accounting for the high volume, I will use 'recent_8' for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the current regime (average ~245) and 'calculate' for L to use observed arrival patterns. This settings will balance the stock to cover the expected lead-time-plus-one-period demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/29. Demand for women's denim typically remains stable through mid-spring before summer peaks. Over the last 9 periods (P3-P11), demand has averaged approximately 238 units per period, showing high volatility but stabilizing around a higher plateau than the January baseline. Specifically, the last two periods (P10: 184, P11: 177) suggest a slight softening or stabilization from the earlier peak of 312. I am choosing N=9 for demand mean (mu_hat) to capture this established high-volume regime. For lead time, recent history (P5, P7, P9) shows several 1-period arrivals, although the promise is 2. Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are long-confirmed lost and no longer part of pipeline calculations in my mental model, though 'In-transit' counts them. The OR backend uses 'In-transit', so I will maintain a lead time L=2 (promised) to ensure the target stock covers the expected lead window + review period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=9 to reflect the significant variability observed in this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized in a high-volume regime (P3-P11 average ~238) which is ~100% higher than the Jan baseline. Evidence suggests periodic lead time fluctuations between 1 and 2 periods for successful deliveries, while early orders (P1, P3, P4) remain permanently lost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 (Womens 5-pocket jeans) is in a high-demand regime, though sales are currently limited by stockouts (On-hand: 0). The demand stabilized around 238 units/period since Period 3. Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost, as they are now many periods past their delivery window. Recent deliveries for P8 and P9 showed lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively, confirming the promised lead time of 2 is the correct base but subject to intermittent speed-ups or losses. In-transit inventory is high (784 units), including orders from P10, P11, and P12. Because the pipeline includes significant units from P10 (only 1 unit) and larger batches from P11 (170) and P12 (162), I must ensure the OR engine recognizes current demand levels without over-ordering into a congested pipeline. I use recent_N (N=10) for demand to capture the stabilized high-volume regime since the initial Jan ramp-up (P3-P12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 668 units in-transit. The in-transit total includes the P1, P3, and P4 orders (149, 195, 107 = 451 units) which are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 217 units (from P12 and P13). Historical demand since Period 3 has averaged 237 units per period and appears to have stabilized around this level. The lead time for successful arrivals fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods (average 1.5). I am choosing recent_N for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime (P3-P13). I am using 'calculate' for L to use the backend's average of observed lead times (which reflects the 1-2 period volatility). Given that 451 units of the 'in-transit' inventory are lost, the OR backend's inventory-matching will perceive an excess of inventory it can't actually use. By setting L and mu_hat to reflect the current regime, we ensure the base stock levels remain high enough to trigger replacement orders despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Luna skinny jeans (562245046) has stabilized in a high-volume regime following the initial surge in February and March. Over the last 12 periods (P3-P14), the average demand is approximately 227 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P10-P14) show a slight cooling or stabilization around 188 units. Lead times for successful shipments have been consistent at 1-2 periods, although orders from P1, P3, and P4 are definitively lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (17) but pipeline inventory is robust (667 units), primarily consisting of the large order from P10 (1 unit, potentially arrived or minor), P11-14 orders, and the previous backlog. Given the seasonality (May) and the 'Everyday Collection' nature, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the stable high-demand regime (avg ~180-200) while moving past the peak spike of March. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for recent volatility. L is set to calculate to reflect the 1-2 period actual delivery performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for Period 15 was 82, showing a significant drop from the established high-volume regime (avg ~238) identified in earlier periods. The last few weeks (P10-P15) show a downward trend: 184, 177, 211, 225, 145, 82. This suggests a potential shift out of the spring peak for this 'Womens Everyday' product. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and in-transit is 776. The in-transit includes orders from P13 (54), P14 (161), and P15 (109), totaling 324 'active' units, with the remainder (452 units) from P1, P3, P4 now confirmed lost. Actual lead times for successful orders fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this apparent demand cooling phase, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent mean (approx 170 units/period) and volatility more accurately than the long-term average. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the 1-2 period variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Demand dropped to 82, significantly below the previous high-volume average of ~238, indicating a seasonal tapering or new regime (P10-P15 avg: 170).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Collection) has dropped significantly, aligning with a post-spring seasonal transition. Since Period 15 (May 20), demand has fallen from a high-volume average of ~238 to recent values of 82 and 51. This represents a clear regime shift downward. I am setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this lower demand level (avg ~93 across the last 3 samples vs ~180-250 previously). Lead times for successful deliveries have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (average 1.6); however, several early orders (P1, P3, P4) remain lost. Pipeline inventory is currently high (776 units) relative to the new demand level, so the 'calculate' method for Lead Time combined with the lower mu_hat will help the OR backend avoid over-ordering while account for existing in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed at Period 15: demand fell from a high-volume average of ~238 to a new low-volume range (P15-P16 avg: 66.5), likely reflecting seasonal tapering in late May/early June.

Daily Reward (R_t): $651.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday jeans) has definitively shifted downward as we move into June (summer in the Northern Hemisphere), likely due to seasonal tapering for this category. Recent demand for Periods 15, 16, and 17 was 82, 51, and 38 respectively, averaging 57 units per period. This is a dramatic decrease from the Spring average of ~238. Consequently, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect this new low-volume regime. On-hand inventory is 71 and in-transit is 667 (though a significant portion of this in-transit represents lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 totaling approx 451 units). Subtracting definitely lost units, the effective pipeline is roughly 216 units. Given the low current demand (approx 40-50 units/period), the existing inventory and healthy recent shipments are sufficient. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current downward trend and default for L as observed lead times remain stable at 1-2 periods for successful orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward firmly established: Late May/early June demand (P15-P17) averages ~57 units/period, a ~75% decrease from the Spring peak of ~238.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans) has entered a sustained low-volume regime as of late May (Period 15). Demand over the last four periods (P15-P18) has been 82, 51, 38, and 72, respectively, resulting in a recent mean of approximately 60.75 units per period. This represents a significant ~75% decrease from the Spring peak (~238 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 667 units in-transit. Given that the pipeline (667) is more than 10 times the current (L+1) demand forecast (approx 3 * 61 = 183), there is no need to place additional orders. The OR backend needs to be informed of this lower demand regime to avoid further overstocking as existing orders arrive. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this post-peak stabilization. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P15 order arriving in P17) align with the promised 2-period lead time, but historical volatility exists.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Trousers) has clearly transitioned into a low-volume summer regime. Starting from late May (Period 15), demand plummeted from a spring peak average of ~238 to a recent average of ~63 units/period (P15-P19). The most recent three periods (P17-P19) show very stable demand at 38, 72, and 74, averaging approximately 61.3. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 667 units in-transit, which is far in excess of the requirements for this new regime. Historical lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods; using the promised lead time of 2 is appropriate. Given the significant over-supply in the pipeline (667 units in-transit vs. a probable base stock requirement of ~180-200), no new orders should be placed until the pipeline clears. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the low-demand regime since P15, which will provide a conservative base stock target and allow the backend to appropriately throttle new orders.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Trousers) has shifted from a high-volume Spring peak (avg ~238) to a significantly lower summer regime. Starting from Period 15 (late May), weekly demand has stabilized at a much lower level. Specifically, the last six periods (P15-P20) show demand values of 82, 51, 38, 72, 74, and 69, averaging approximately 64.3 units per period. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 667 units is extremely high relative to this new demand regime, likely due to older, non-delivered orders (P1, P3, P4) still being counted in the pipeline and perhaps some more recent lagging orders. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is steady around 65-70, I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent 6-period average (N=6) to avoid over-ordering while account for the seasonal dip. Lead time remains fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods, so the default promised lead time of 2 is appropriate for safety.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 fully stabilized: Summer demand (P15-P20) averages ~64 units/period, down ~73% from the Spring peak. Pipeline inventory (667) is heavily inflated by lost historical orders (P1, P3, P4).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (a summer-weight/stretch denim item) has dropped significantly and stabilized at a lower volume since mid-May. The current demand regime (Periods 15-21) averages approximately 67 units per period, a stark contrast to the spring peak of ~240 units. This drop is likely seasonal as we enter high summer (July). On-hand inventory is currently at 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 667 is heavily distorted by lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 451 units). Subtracting these lost units, the 'real' pipeline is 216 units, but there have been no new orders placed since Period 15, and all legitimate transit should have arrived. Therefore, the OR backend sees a massive pipeline it thinks will arrive, which will prevent it from ordering. Since the current demand is stable at ~67 units and the promised lead time is 2, I need to set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand. Using recent_N with N=6 captures the low-volume summer regime (approx 67 * 3 = 201). I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat because the OR backend's pipeline inventory subtraction (using the 667 units) will result in a negative order quantity unless I provide a base stock calculation that accounts for the phantom inventory; however, since I cannot directly adjust the backend's pipeline subtraction, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current regime to ensure that when the backend subtracts the recorded pipeline, it behaves conservatively but reacts to the current demand level. Given the likely 'lost' status of the old pipleline, I will continue to monitor if the system triggers an order.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for 'Luna skinny RW' jeans has entered a low-volume summer regime starting around Period 15 (late May). The average demand from Period 15 to Period 22 is approximately 73.5 units per period. However, the last two periods (P21 and P22) have shown a slight uptick (88 and 114 units), potentially signaling a minor mid-summer recovery or variation. The 'In-transit' figure (667) is significantly inflated by lost shipments from Periods 1 (149), 3 (195), 4 (107), 13 (54), 14 (161), and 21/22 (0 ordered), leaving approximately 1 shipment from Period 16 (0 ordered) or other unrecorded activity. Effectively, the system believes the pipeline is full, preventing new orders. To force an order and account for the fact that P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 orders are lost, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to set a baseline demand covering 3 periods (L+1) based on the recent average of ~75 units/period (3 * 75 = 225). Since the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' (667) from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that overcomes this 'ghost' inventory to ensure we stock enough for actual demand. Setting mu_hat to 850 and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure the base stock (approx 1000) exceeds the 667 'ghost' units, allowing for a net order of ~300+ to satisfy real upcoming demand while on-hand is 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand uptick detected (P21-P22 avg ~101 vs Summer baseline ~64). 'Ghost' inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) totals 666 units, blocking the OR backend's automated ordering.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22nd. Demand for this SKU (Womens 5-pocket jeans) shows a mid-summer uptick (P21-P23 avg ~94) compared to the June low (P17-P20 avg ~63). The 'In-transit' count is 1093, but 666 of these are from defunct orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) that will likely never arrive based on the 1-2 period lead time history. These 'ghost' units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To force an order and maintain stock for the next 3 weeks (current period + 2-period lead time), I am using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate mean demand (mu_hat) for a 3-period horizon (L+1) at 300 units (approx 100/week) to reflect the recent uptick. Sigma is set to capture volatility. L=2 is used as the standard lead time, though I am adjusting mu_hat to ensure the backend overcomes the pipeline inventory hurdle caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand uptick confirmed: July demand (P21-P23) averages 94 units/period, a ~49% increase over June's baseline of ~63 units/period. Persistent 'ghost' inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) totals 666 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. This SKU (Womens 5-pocket skinny jeans) is entering a mid-summer phase where demand has fluctuated between 52 and 114 over the last four periods (P21-P24). The inventory situation is critical: On-hand is 0, but 'In-transit' is 1093. This 'In-transit' figure includes 666 units of 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost orders (P1: 149, P3: 195, P4: 107, P13: 54, P14: 161). To ensure the OR backend places a fresh order, the 'mu_hat' must be set explicitly high to overcome the inflated pipeline inventory (mu_hat > In-transit). The target base stock should cover approximately 3 periods of the current demand regime (~90 units/period) plus a safety buffer, but to force an order past 1093 pipeline units, I will set mu_hat to 1350. This 'shocks' the system into ordering ~250-300 units to replenish stock, as previous orders were choked by the ghost inventory. L will be set to 2 to reflect the promised lead time, as recent arrivals have shown volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) is confirmed at 666 units. This is causing the OR engine's pipeline deduction to prevent new orders. Periodic explicit overrides of mu_hat are required to force replenishment.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August. Demand has shown a mid-summer uptick but remains lower than the Spring peak. Recent demand (P21-P25) averages ~87 units/period. The operational challenge remains 'ghost inventory'. Pipeline inventory is currently 1416 units, but 666 units are from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Additionally, the order of 426 units from P23 is now entering its promised lead time window (due P25-P26), and the order of 323 from P25 is pending. To force the OR backend to place orders despite 1416 'in-transit' units, \u03bc\u0302 must be set 'explicitly' high enough to exceed the pipeline + on-hand total (base_stock - pipeline > 0). With demand averaging ~87, a 3-period coverage (L+1) would normally be ~261. To overcome the 1416 units in pipeline and trigger a replenishment order for upcoming late summer/early fall demand, I will set mu_hat to 1900 (covering the ~1416 ghost/transit units plus target safety stock). This ensures we maintain availability as the P23 shipment arrives.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2314.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 concluded with the arrival of the Period 23 order (426 units) after a lead time of 3 periods, suggesting that lead times may be lengthening again (promised 2). Demand is showing a mid-August uptick (137 units in P26 vs. ~94 in July), likely due to back-to-school or late-summer transitions for 'Womens Everyday' jeans. The 'ghost inventory' problem (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 totaling 666 units) continues to artificially inflate the backend's 'In-transit' figure (currently 1540). To bypass the OR engine's deduction of these non-existent units and ensure we replenish for the current demand regime (~100-140 units), I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 2100. This massive mu_hat is calculated to overcome the ~1251 real+ghost pipeline units (1540 starting in-transit - 289 current on-hand = ~1251 net pipeline) and trigger an order of approximately 300-400 units, which covers roughly 3 periods of the current demand including a safety buffer for the unstable lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 120 to provide a robust safety stock against further lead time fluctuations and demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Actual lead time for P23 order was 3 periods. Total verified 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) remains at 666 units. Demand appears to be entering a late-summer growth phase (P26: 137 units).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a late-summer/early-autumn growth phase, with demand increasing from ~50-80 units in June to 183 units in the most recent period. Current on-hand inventory is 429 units. The 'ghost inventory' problem persists: orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 (totaling 666 units) are confirmed lost and remain in the 'In-transit' count (1686). This significantly inflates the pipeline inventory (on-hand 429 + in-transit 1686 = 2115), which would normally prevent the OR backend from ordering. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the upcoming demand at ~185 units per period. Over a protection interval of L+1 (3 periods), this is 555 units. To force an order despite the 666 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to 1250 (calculated as: 555 target base stock + 666 ghost units + safety margin). This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful replenishment order to cover the current demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer growth phase confirmed: demand increased from ~80 (July avg) to 183 in Period 27 (+128%). Ghost inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) remains at 666 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a late-summer/early-fall growth phase (P26-P28 demand: 137, 183, 187). The current demand average for this new regime is approximately 169 units/period. The pipeline inventory (1686 units) is severely inflated by significant historical lost orders from periods 1, 3, 4, 13, and 14, totaling 666 'ghost' units. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this false inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the current demand (169) and a lead time of 2, then add the ghost inventory (666) to offset the deduction: Target = (L+1)*Demand + Ghost = 3*169 + 666 = 1173. This forces the engine to order replenishment for the current demand level. Standard lead time of 2 is used as recent orders (P23, P25) arrived in 3 and 2 periods respectively.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer growth regime established (P26-P28): demand average increased to ~169 units/period. Ghost inventory (confirmed lost orders) remains at 666 units, necessitating explicit mu_hat adjustments to bypass pipeline deductions.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a late-summer/early-autumn high-demand regime. Demand over the last four periods (P26-P29) has averaged 167.5 units, significantly higher than the summer baseline of ~64. Pipeline inventory (1686) is severely inflated by historical 'ghost' orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) and potentially more recent unconfirmed delays, totaling 666 units of known losses. To ensure the OR backend places an order and maintains stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate target mu_hat as (1 + Promised_L) * Forecast_Demand + Ghost_Inventory. Using L=2 and forecast=170, the calculation is (3 * 170) + 666 = 1176. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the inflated pipeline enough to trigger replenishment. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to capture the volatility of this new growth phase.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a late-summer/early-autumn high-demand regime, with Period 30 demand spiking to 300 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 194 units. Ghost inventory remains a major issue. Confirmed lost orders include Period 1 (149), P3 (195), P4 (107), P13 (54), and P14 (161), totaling 666 'ghost' units that the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from the order quantity. Additionally, the Period 26 order (550 units) is now at Period 31; since arrivals occur during the period, it should arrive by the end of Period 31 (L=5 from P26 to P31 start observation). However, lead times are volatile (recently 2-3 periods). To bypass the 666 units of ghost inventory and the 'in-transit' P26 order (550) that may just have arrived or be arriving, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock = (1+L)*194 + safety stock. With L=2, base stock should be ~600-800. To force the backend to place an order despite ~1216 in pipeline (666 ghost + 550 real in-transit), I set mu_hat to 1400. This ensures we don't stock out as the 550 unit order is consumed and historical ghost units continue to block automated logic.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer/Early-autumn demand surge: Period 30 demand reached 300 units (highest since March). 5-period average (P26-P30) is ~194 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 is experiencing a significant Autumn demand surge (Sept 2: 300, Sept 9: 349). Current 3-period average (P29-P31) is 271 units/period. The pipeline inventory (1331) is severely inflated by 'ghost' stock totaling 881 units from lost orders (P1=149, P3=195, P4=107, P13=54, P14=161, P26=215? No, P26 ordered 550, but at P31 it's still missing). Actually, counting all orders that should have arrived (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) which are overdue, the ghost stock is 550 + 161 + 54 + 107 + 195 + 149 = 1216 units. Only the P31 order (114) is legitimately in transit. Total 'Ghost' = 1216. To bypass the OR backend's deduction of this ghost stock, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~275/period (approx 825) plus safety stock. Setting mu_hat to 1350 will trigger a replenishment order roughly covering the current shortfall and anticipated demand, compensating for the 1216 units the backend thinks we have.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: P29-P31 average is 271 units/period, a ~60% increase over the late-summer average. Ghost inventory from lost/severely delayed orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) now totals 1216 units, requiring significant explicit mu_hat overrides to maintain stock levels.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its peak autumn season, with demand surging from ~194 units (late summer) to an average of 334 units in the last three periods (P30-P32). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline is heavily congested with 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) totaling 1216 units. Because the OR backend subtracts this in-transit total from the base stock calculation, I must provide an explicit 'mu_hat' that is high enough to force an order despite this 1216-unit deduction. I estimate demand for the next (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods) to be 1050 units (350 * 3). To trigger a replenishment that overcomes the ghost inventory and covers upcoming demand plus safety stock, I set mu_hat to 2600. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), so I maintain L at the default promised 2 to allow the engine to use standard logic while I manage the volume override.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Demand for P30-P32 has stabilized at a high-volume plateau of ~334 units/period, representing a significant jump from the late-summer growth phase. Ghost inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) is confirmed at 1216 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in an autumn demand surge. Period 33 demand was 709 units, which is a significant outlier or a new peak compared to the previous high-volume average of ~334. The demand regime for the last 4 periods (P30-P33) averages 428 units. Ghost inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) is confirmed at 1216 units. The current total In-transit is 2488. Subtracting the ghost inventory (1216), the 'real' pipeline is 1272. However, the OR backend's internal logic uses the raw In-transit (2488) + on-hand (0) = 2488. To place an order, the desired base stock must exceed 2488. We are targeting 4 periods of demand (L=2 plus 2 for safety/growth) at the recent average of 428, which total ~1712. Because 1712 < 2488, the OR engine will not order unless mu_hat is explicitly set higher to overcome the 1216 'ghost' unit gap. To target a real base stock coverage of ~1200 units (approx. 3 weeks of high demand) while accounting for the ~1216 ghost units, I set mu_hat explicitly to 2500. This ensures the engine calculates a base_stock > 2500, resulting in a positive order despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for high volatility during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Major demand spike in P33 (709 units). Autumn demand regime (P30-P33) now averages ~428 units/period. Ghost inventory from lost orders remains at 1216 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (womens denim) has surged during the autumn season. Period 33 demand was 709 units, followed by 448 in Period 34. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 432 units/period. The pipeline inventory (3039 units) is significantly distorted by 'ghost inventory' from historical lost orders (confirmed lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26, totaling 1216 units). In addition to these, many recent orders (P31, P32, P33, P34) are still within or near their lead-time window but have not arrived yet, leaving the current on-hand inventory at 0. To bypass the OR engine's pipeline deduction (base_stock - pipeline) and ensure replacement of recent high demand, I must set an explicit mu_hat that covers the required base stock despite the 3039 units in transit. Using the recent 5-period average (432) and L=2, a standard base stock (1+L)*mu would be ~1296 units. However, because 3039 units are already perceived as in-transit, I provide an explicit mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that maintains service levels for the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed (late Sep/early Oct): P30-P34 average demand is ~432 units/period. Ghost inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) is definitively 1216 units. New orders from P33 (1016 units) and P34 (551 units) are in-transit; combined with ghost units, this explains the 3039 units pipeline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Collection) is currently in a high-volume Autumn peak. Over the last five periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged 447 units (349, 354, 709, 448, 375). While P33 was a significant outlier at 709, the surrounding periods suggest a stable regime around 400 units. A critical constraint is the 1,216 units of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) which occupy the pipeline and block the OR engine's automated replenishment. Current actual pipeline (excluding ghost units) consists of orders from P33 (1,016) and P34 (551), totaling 1,567 units. To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the ghost inventory. With L=2, (1+2)*450 = 1,350. Adding 1,216 ghost units gives 2,566. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 2,600 to force replenishment and account for recent volatility. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 (period 31-35) to capture the current high-variance plateau.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Autumn high-volume regime confirmed with a 5-period average of ~447 units (P31-P35). Verified ghost inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) remains at 1,216 units, requiring mu_hat to be inflated by this amount to bypass pipeline logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4844.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, the system begins with 723 units on-hand after a large arrival (1016 units) from Period 33. The autumn demand regime is firmly established; while the P33 spike (709) was an outlier, the current 5-period average (P32-P36) is approximately 435 units/period. The pipeline inventory (2017) is heavily skewed by 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) totaling 1216 units. The valid pipeline includes arrivals expected from P34 (551 units), P36 (249 units), and potentially P37's decision. To force the OR backend to place an order despite these 1216 ghost units, mu_hat must be adjusted. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * expected_demand + ghost_units = (1+2) * 435 + 1216 = 2521. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the sum of on-hand and ghost-inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (explicit) to account for high volatility observed in the autumn peak (demand range 293-709).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) totals 1216 units and continues to block automated replenishment. Autumn demand (P32-P36) has stabilized at a high-volume average of ~435 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volume autumn regime. Demand in Period 37 was 310, and the previous 5-period average (P33-P37) is approximately 427 units. However, there is a confirmed 'ghost inventory' of 1,216 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) which never arrived and remain in the pipeline. These 1,216 units must be accounted for by inflating mu_hat to bypass the OR engine's base-stock deduction (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline). The pipeline currently sits at 2,210 units; subtracting the 1,216 ghost units leaves a real pipeline of 994 units (comprised of P34, P36, and P37 orders). With on-hand inventory at 413, current real inventory position is ~1,407. At a demand of ~430/period and L=2 (promised), a base stock should be around (1+2)*430 = 1,290 plus safety stock. To ensure the backend doesn't zero out the order due to ghost units, I set mu_hat using the explicit method. Calculation: (Target Service Level units) + Ghost Units. Target Base Stock for ~430 avg demand is ~1700. Adding 1216 ghost units = ~2916. I will set mu_hat to 2900 to ensure replenishment continues while acknowledging the significant stock currently on-hand and in-transit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending Oct 28 was 482, indicating that the high-volume autumn regime continues (P34-P38 average is ~382). Lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods (P37 arrived in 1 period, while P33 took 3). The critical issue remains the 1,216 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) which are still in the 'in-transit' total of 2,776. To calculate the true pipeline, we subtract ghost units: 2,776 - 1,216 = 1,560 units. Current on-hand is 124. Total effective inventory is 1,684. To ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock despite the ghost units, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost quantity. I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting 3 periods (L=2) of demand at the recent average of ~400 units, plus the 1,216 ghost units, totaling ~2,416. This forces the base stock high enough to bypass the pipeline deduction.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 1,216 units. Autumn demand remains high, with the most recent sample (P38: 482) suggesting a possible late-season surge.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 is in a sustained high-demand Autumn/Winter regime. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P30-P39) is approximately 391 units/period. The current 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) remains at 1,216 units. The OR backend's pipeline inventory is currently 2,527 units; subtracting the 1,216 ghost units leaves a real pipeline of 1,311 units. With a target base stock ideally covering (L+1) periods of demand (~3 * 400 = 1,200), and only 89 units on-hand, we are close to the desired coverage. However, since the OR engine will see the full 2,527 pipeline and prevent ordering, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the backend logic result (base_stock - pipeline) remains positive if a replenishment is needed. Given the lead time volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical average. mu_hat is set to 4200 specifically to offset the 1,216 ghost units + 1,311 real pipeline + current demand expectations, forcing a buffer to protect against the high 400+ demand spikes seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) remains constant at 1,216 units. Late-autumn demand (P30-P39) averages ~391 units/period, roughly 6x the summer low. Lead times have become highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November), historically a high-growth period leading into the holiday season. Recent demand (P30-P40) has averaged ~380 units/period, with high volatility. We face a massive 'ghost inventory' challenge: 1,216 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) are incorrectly included in the OR backend's pipeline calculation (currently 4,141 units). To bypass this and ensure the OR engine actually places orders, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the total ghost inventory. Using a lead time of 2 (implied L+1=3), and a forecast of ~400 units/period, the target stock is 1,200 units. Adding the 1,216 ghost units results in a mu_hat of 2,416. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26) remains at 1,216 units. New orders from P38 (759) and P40 (1614) are in-transit; however, P34 (551 units) is now 7 periods old and should be considered potentially lost, which would increase ghost inventory to 1,767 in the next assessment if it doesn't arrive by P42.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (late November), the product is in a high-demand peak. Recent demand (P36-P41) has been consistently robust, averaging roughly 323 units per period. The inventory situation is complicated by 'ghost inventory' from lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P26 are confirmed lost (total 1,216 units). Additionally, the order from P34 (551 units) is now 8 periods old and has almost certainly been lost, bringing total identified ghost inventory to 1,767 units. This phantom pipeline (1,767 units) blocks the OR engine from placing real orders because it believes stock is coming. To bypass this, I set mu_hat to 'explicit' at 2,736, which is (L+1) * 684. This 684 value is calculated by taking recent average demand (~323) and adding the per-period equivalent of the lost stock (1767 / (L+1)) to 'cancel out' the pipeline deduction. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), so I use a calculation method to average recent performance.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: P34 order (551 units) is confirmed lost (8 periods since order). Total verified ghost inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26, P34) is now 1,767 units. Demand remains in a high plateau phase (~323 units/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observation (Period 42) shows a significant spike to 999 units, likely signaling a Black Friday or early December shopping event. The autumn high-volume average (P30-P41) was approximately 350 units/period, but this latest sample shifts the 5-period average (P38-P42) to ~467 units. Total confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26, P34) is 1,767 units. This 'ghost' stock is subtracted from the base stock by the OR backend, preventing necessary orders. To ensure the backend places an order for the current high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 3500. This is calculated as: (Desired Base Stock for ~500 demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory = (500 * 3) + 1767 \u2248 3267, rounded up to 3500 to account for the recent 999 surge and volatility. This override forces the system to recognize that physical on-hand and valid in-transit units are insufficient to meet the expected demand peak despite the inflated pipeline figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike to 999 units in Period 42 confirms a likely holiday peak. Total verified ghost inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26, P34) has increased to 1,767 units. Mu_hat must be adjusted to bridge both the demand surge and the pipeline error.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16826.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), reflecting a holiday Peak. Period 42-43 demand averaged 961 units (999 and 922), confirming a significant holiday surge compared to the previous plateau of ~300-400. Total 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26, P34) is confirmed at 1,767 units. Current pipeline (in-transit) is 2,769 units. Subtracting the 1,767 ghost units, the actual physical pipeline is 1,002 units (P38 order of 759 and P43 order of 242). On-hand inventory is 692. To maintain stock against current holiday demand (~960/period) over a 3-period window (L+1), we need approximately 2,880 units. The physical inventory (692 on-hand + 1,002 in-transit = 1,694) is insufficient. To force the OR backend (which sees pipeline as 2,769) to order, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I will set mu_hat based on the current high demand of ~960 per period across 3 periods (2880) and add the 1,767 ghost units to 'offset' the false pipeline deduction. Total mu_hat = 2880 + 1767 = 4647. Lead time is set to 2 (calculated/default) as recent arrivals (P40) concluded in 3 periods, but the system expects 2.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed (Period 42-43 avg: 961 units). Total verified ghost inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26, P34) is 1,767 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (mid-December), we observe a significant demand drop to 210 units following the holiday peak (Period 42-43 avg: 961). This identifies the typical post-peak sales cliff. However, we must manage the 'ghost inventory' which totals 1,767 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26, and P34). The current pipeline of 4,929 units includes these 1,767 ghost units plus legitimate in-transit orders from P38 (759), P43 (242), and P44 (2160). As the year-end approaches, demand will likely continue at a lower seasonal baseline (estimated ~250-300 units). To ensure the OR engine actually places orders if needed despite the 1,767 unit pipeline inflation, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value to bypass the internal logic. This period, I am setting mu_hat based on an expected demand of 300 units per period for (L+1) periods, then adding the ghost inventory (1,767) to prevent a system-wide stockout if legitimate orders are also delayed.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cliff confirmed at Period 44: demand dropped from ~961 to 210 (-78%). Total confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26, P34) is 1,767 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4176.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 562245046 has significantly dropped following the mid-December holiday peak (922 units in P43 down to 245 units in P45), indicating a post-holiday demand cliff. Current on-hand inventory is 479 units, which covers nearly two periods of demand at the current average. Pipeline inventory is extremely high (4687 units), with 1,767 units confirmed as 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26, P34). Even after subtracting these 1,767 ghost units, there are 2,920 units still in transit (including a massive 2,160 unit order from P44), which is excessive for the new demand regime. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a minimal level to allow the system to digest the existing and incoming stock. I'm using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this abrupt downward shift specifically. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high volatility (1-3 periods) observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cliff confirmed: demand dropped from peak levels (~960) to a new range (P44-P45 avg: 227.5). Total verified ghost inventory from lost orders remains at 1,767 units. Extremely large order of 2160 units (P44) creates significant overstock risk for the low-demand winter period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 (late December/early January), following a massive holiday demand spike and a subsequent 'demand cliff'. Demand has dropped from ~960 units to an average of ~209 units over the last three periods (P44-P46). Inventory on-hand is 305 units, but the pipeline is heavily inflated. Specifically, we have 'ghost inventory' from historical lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P26, P34) totaling 1,767 units. Additionally, a massive order of 2,160 units placed in P44 remains in-transit. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock calculation, and our actual pipeline (4,687) is far larger than the likely required base stock for a ~200 demand regime, no new orders would normally be placed. However, given the massive upcoming arrival of the P44 order (2,160 units) which significantly exceeds the current demand rate, we are at extreme risk of overstocking. My goal is to prevent further ordering while the system absorbs this excess. I will use a mu_hat that reflects the current demand regime (~210 units) but will not attempt to bypass the pipeline deduction this period, as the incoming P44 order will more than satisfy demand for the foreseeable future.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: P44 order (2,160 units) creates a massive impending overstock as demand has fallen to ~210 units/period post-holidays. Ghost inventory remains at 1,767 units. Total pipeline (ghost + actual in-transit) is 4,687.
