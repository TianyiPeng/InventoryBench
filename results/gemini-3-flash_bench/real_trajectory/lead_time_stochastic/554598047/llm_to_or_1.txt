Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), a staple garment. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend from late January into early February (9, 23, 26 units). This likely represents a seasonal transition towards spring/summer essentials in the retail calendar. Since we have no on-hand inventory or in-transit orders, we must establish a base stock. The recent demand regime (last 3 weeks) has an average of 19.33 units per week, significantly higher than the zero starts in early January. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this momentum. For the standard deviation, the recent variance is also relevant to buffer against the volatility seen in the jump from 9 to 23. The promised lead time is 2 periods; I will stick with the default to start. The parameters ensure that the OR engine orders enough to cover (2 + 1) periods of demand at the current trend while balancing high holding costs ($1) against profit ($1), resulting in a target service level of 50% (q = 1 / (1 + 1)).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 0, 0, 9, 23, 26, culminating in a spike of 54 in Period 1 (last week). This suggests the product has recently exited its launch phase or is entering a seasonal spring/summer climb. The promised lead time is 2, so the Period 1 order (35 units) is expected to arrive in Period 3. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we lost 54 units of sales in Period 1 due to a stockout. I need to set parameters that catch up with this accelerating demand. I will use the last 3 samples (23, 26, 54) to calculate the mean demand, as the early zeros are no longer relevant. Mean of {23, 26, 54} is approx 34.3. Given L=2, mu_hat should reflect (1+L)*34.3 = 103. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent regime shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) managing the 'Nora T-shirt', an everyday basic. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend (0, 0, 9, 23, 26, 54, 90). The last two weeks (54 and 90) represent a clear regime shift compared to the initial weeks. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to stockouts in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0 and the lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (35 units) and P2 (63 units) are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in P3 and P4 respectively (concluded signals for these will appear in P4 and P5 starts). Given the strong growth in demand for this basic item as we move towards spring, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the upward momentum (avg of 26, 54, 90 is 56.7). L is set to default (2). Since holding cost equals profit ($1/unit), the OR backend will target a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1)), which is conservative; however, the capped order logic and a higher volatility estimate (sigma_hat) will help buffer against the high variance observed (std of 26, 54, 90 is ~32).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: Significant increase from single/double digits to 54 and 90 units per week.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing a significant demand regime shift as we enter March, moving away from the zero/low demand seen in January. Demand for the last three periods has been 54, 90, and 55 (avg ~66.3). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 170 units in transit (ordered in Periods 1, 2, and 3). Given a promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 (35 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 4. The order from Period 2 (63 units) should arrive in Period 5. To stabilize the forecast and avoid over-reacting to the peak of 90 while acknowledging the new baseline, I will use a recent_N of 3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this 'Womens Everyday Basics' spring ramp-up. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the higher volatility of this new regime. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 2 periods as we are only now reaching the first expected arrival window.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a women's basic T-shirt. Historical demand was low in January but spiked significantly in February (54, 90, 55, 29). The 'recent_N' for demand since the spike is N=4 (average 57). However, the most recent demand was 29, suggesting the initial spike might be stabilizing. Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Current on-hand is 34, with 136 in-transit (orders from P1, P3, and P4). We need to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using N=4 for mu_hat captures the recent high-demand regime while including the recent dip to 29 to avoid over-ordering, as holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a staple 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant shift from initial low values to a regime averaging ~56 units/week (last 5 periods: 54, 90, 55, 29, 54). However, inventory management has been poor due to stockouts; ending on-hand is currently 0 with 137 units in-transit. A lead time of 2 periods was confirmed in Period 4 (P2 order arrived). We observe that the P1 order (35 units) has not been mentioned as arriving in any 'conclude' message yet, which is concerning but not certain of loss yet (P3, P4, P5 did not show P1 arrival). Because current on-hand is 0 and we are entering spring (March), demand for t-shirts is likely to remain steady or increase. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach to capture the updated demand mean (averaging ~57 units excluding the 90 outlier) to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. Using N=4 focuses on the stable data since the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~56 units/week since 2019-02-11. Lead time confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order). P1 order (35 units) remains unconfirmed/arrived as of Period 6.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is in a seasonally strong period for Women's Everyday Basics. Current demand has stabilized at a higher regime compared to the early samples, with an average of approximately 57.7 units over the last 6 periods (54, 90, 55, 29, 54, 64). As of Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0. The order from Period 1 (35 units) is likely lost as it is now 6 periods since it was placed (L=2 promised). The order from Period 3 (72 units) should have arrived during Period 5 given a 2-period lead time, but did not, suggesting it is either delayed or lost. Order P4 (29 units) was expected in Period 6. The 1 unit that arrived in Period 6 was from P5 (L=1). Since inventory is depleted and shipments are irregular, I am setting L=2 (promised) but monitoring for sustained delays. To capture the higher demand regime, I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will boost the base stock to cover around 173 units (3 periods of ~57.7 demand), ensuring the OR engine triggers an order to replenish the safety stock given the current 170 units in pipeline are suspect.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Possible shipment losses or significant delays for orders from Period 1 (35 units) and Period 3 (72 units). Demand variance is high: range 29-90 units/week.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is in a clear high-demand regime compared to the initial samples (avg ~53/week vs single digits). In Period 8, on-hand inventory is 0. History shows significant delivery issues: Period 1 (35 units) and Period 3 (72 units) have not arrived, while Period 5 arrived early (L=1). Because P1 and P3 are essentially lost (P1 is now 5 periods overdue), the pipeline inventory of 173 is misleadingly inflated. I am setting L=2 (promised) but will use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for (L+1) periods of demand (~160 units). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (173) from base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order to cover the immediate stockout, effectively discounting the 'ghost' units in-transit. Mean demand since Feb 11 is 53.1 units; I'll use 55 as the basis for mu_hat calculation (3 * 55 = 165).

Carry-over insight: Shipment loss confirmed: Period 1 (35 units) and Period 3 (72 units) have exceeded double the promised lead time with no 'conclude' message. In-transit numbers are inflated by 107 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' has been volatile lately, with the last period recording the highest demand yet at 92 units (2019-04-01). The confirmed demand mean since the regime shift in mid-February is approximately 58 units/week (last 8 samples). Regarding inventory, we have 0 on-hand. The 'In-transit' figure of 136 is misleading because it includes 107 units from Period 1 (35) and Period 3 (72) which are confirmed lost (passed 2x the promised lead time). The actual replenishing pipeline consists only of the Period 4 order (29 units) which is now 5 periods old and likely lost as well, despite not being officially confirmed until next period. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods for successful deliveries. To prevent stockouts against high demand (92 units last week), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the 8-week regime to account for the higher mean (~58), and 'explicit' for L to signal the OR engine that shipments are taking longer/hitting issues. I will set L=3 as a buffer to increase the base stock calculation, effectively discounting the 'ghost' pipeline and targeting a higher safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 4 order (29 units) is now 5 periods old with no arrival, likely lost. Real pipeline inventory is near 0. Demand volatility increased with a peak of 92 units on 2019-04-01.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598047' (Nora T-shirt) is exhibiting a sustained high-demand regime, with the last two periods showing peaks of 92 and 102 units. Current inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0, and historical data confirms significant shipment losses. Specifically, orders from P1 (35), P3 (72), and P4 (29) are considered lost (total 136 units), as they are far beyond the promised lead time of 2. The OR engine perceives an in-transit inventory of 232, but 136 of those are 'ghost' units, meaning the real pipeline is only 96 units (from the Period 9 order). To force the backend to place an order that covers the current demand surge despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value. This value (300) represents 3 periods of demand at ~100 units/period, minus the legitimate 96 units in transit, essentially overriding the ghost inventory impact. This ensures we attempt to restock to meet the observed 100+ units/week demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified: Last 2 periods (P8, P9) averaged 97 units/week, up from the previous average of ~56. Total confirmed lost shipments: 136 units (P1, P3, P4).

LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing a massive demand surge as we enter late April (Spring/Summer seasonality for basics), with Period 10 demand hitting 138 units. The last three periods (P8, P9, P10) show a mean demand of 110.6 units, a sharp increase from the previous regime. Lead times are volatile, oscillating between 1 and 2 periods (P9 arrived in 1 period, while others took 2). Crucially, 136 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 204 is deceptive. The real pipeline is only 68 units (from Period 10). To prevent stockouts during this high-growth seasonal phase, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods (L+1) at a projected 130 units/week (390 total), and sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility observed in recent weeks (std ~23 over the last 5 periods, scaled by sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~56 to ~110 units/week starting P8 (2019-04-01), likely due to Spring seasonality for jersey t-shirts. Total lost inventory confirmed at 136 units (P1:35, P3:72, P4:29).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU '554598047' (Nora T-shirt) is in a high-demand regime, likely driven by spring seasonality. Recent demand over the last 4 periods (P8-P11) has averaged 111 units/week (92, 102, 138, 112). I am targeting a base stock that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the review period (total 3 periods), which at the current mean requires approximately 333 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 372 is heavily inflated by 136 units from confirmed lost shipments (P1: 35, P3: 72, P4: 29) which have not arrived despite nearly 10 weeks passing. Actual reliable pipeline inventory consists of the P10 order (68 units) and P11 order (168 units), totaling 236 units. With 0 on-hand, we are currently under-stocked relative to recent demand. To signal this to the OR backend, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to reflect the current 110+ unit/week demand trend and an 'explicit' L of 2. Sigma remains high due to recent variability (range 92-138).

Carry-over insight: Significant stockouts are occurring despite high in-transit numbers; 136 units (P1, P3, P4) are definitively lost. Functional pipeline is 236 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598047 (Nora T-shirt) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime, likely driven by spring seasonality as documented in previous carry-over insights. Since Period 8 (2019-04-01), demand has been consistently high: 92, 102, 138, 112, and 127 units (Mean ~114 units/week). Despite this, we are facing extreme stockouts because three historic orders (P1, P3, P4) totaling 136 units are confirmed lost, which artificially inflates the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR backend. As of Period 13 START, On-hand is 0. The total 'In-transit' is 372. Subtracting the 136 lost units, the functional pipeline is 236 units (consisting of P10: 68 units and P11: 168 units). The P10 order is now in its 3rd period and should ideally arrive this period (P13). Given the stockout state and high demand (~114/week), we need to ensure the policy targets around (L+1) * 114 units, where L=2. To overcome the OR engine's inability to see lost orders, I am using 'explicit' L alongside 'recent_N' for demand to ensure the base stock calculation remains high enough to trigger new orders if the functional pipeline is below the target (~342 units).

Carry-over insight: Functional pipeline inventory corrected to 236 units as of P13 (excluding 136 lost units). Mean demand since P8 (Spring regime) is 114.2 units/week (+104% shift from previous ~56 avg).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598047' (Nora Jersey T-shirt) is in a high-demand Spring/Early Summer regime. Since Period 8 (2019-04-01), demand has shifted significantly upwards, averaging 111.1 units per week (periods 8-13: 92, 102, 138, 112, 127, 96). The current on-hand inventory is 72 units. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 204 units, but historically confirmed losses (P1: 35, P3: 72, P4: 29) total 136 units. This leaves a functional pipeline of only 68 units (the order from P10). However, the order from P10 is now 4 periods old (promised lead time 2), suggesting it might also be lost. If P10 is lost, the functional pipeline is 0. To protect against stockouts during this high-demand period and account for the high probability of lost shipments, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I estimate demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the review period (1) as (1+2) * 115 = 345 units. By using an explicit mu_hat and keeping L at 'default' (2), the OR backend will calculate a base stock. Given the functional pipeline is significantly lower than the 204 units the backend sees, the explicit mu_hat is raised to compensate for the 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Order from Period 10 (68 units) is likely lost (4 periods elapsed without arrival). Total suspected lost inventory is now 204 units (P1, P3, P4, P10), equal to the total reported In-transit. Practical pipeline is effectively zero.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Nora T-shirt', which is showing strong seasonal demand in May. A clear demand regime shift was detected starting Period 8 (April), with demand averaging approximately 107 units per week over the last 7 periods (P8-P14). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 273 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms significant shipment losses: Period 1 (35), Period 3 (72), Period 4 (29), and Period 10 (68). Total lost inventory is 204 units. Therefore, the functional pipeline is only 69 units (from the order placed in Period 14). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the current demand regime of ~107 units/week despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating mu_hat (target pipeline inventory) as (1+L) * mean_demand = (1+2) * 107 = 321. However, since the OR engine subtracts the full (inflated) in-transit of 273, I must adjust the mu_hat value upward by the 204 lost units to 'trick' the backend into placing a correct order. Adjusted target: 321 + 204 = 525. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of the recent high-demand regime (~20) scaled by sqrt(1+L), approximately 35.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed/highly likely lost inventory reached 204 units as of Period 15 (P1:35, P3:72, P4:29, P10:68). Current demand regime (P8-P14) mean is 107.1 units/week.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is in a high-demand Spring/Early Summer regime (P8-P15), averaging 105.5 units/week. Significant supply chain issues persist, with 204 units confirmed as lost (P1: 35, P3: 72, P4: 29, P10: 68). The current 'In-transit' figure is 482 units, but only 278 units are realistically in the pipeline (482 - 204 lost). Specifically, the orders from P14 (69 units) and P15 (209 units) are within the lead time window. As of P16 START, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have faced repetitive stockouts. To secure stock for the continued high demand and offset the impact of lost shipments, I am holding L at 2 and using recent_N (N=8) to capture the elevated Spring demand mean (~110-115 per week) while allowing the OR backend to calculate volatility based on this specific regime's high variance (ranging from 82 to 138 units).

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P8-P15) mean remains high at 105.5 units/week. Reliable pipeline inventory is 278 units; cumulative lost/failed shipments remain at 204 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598047' (Nora T-shirt) is exhibiting a sustained high-demand regime consistent with Spring/Summer seasonality. Since Period 8 (2019-04-01), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 104.2 units per week. The system currently reports 'In-transit' as 482 units; however, historical analysis confirms that 204 units from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 are almost certainly lost (exceeding double the promised lead time without arriving). Consequently, the functional pipeline is 278 units (orders from P14, P15). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time of 2 periods, we need to maintain a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1). A mean demand of ~104 units/week equates to 312 units for mu_hat. Given the persistent stockouts and high reported (but non-functional) pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment order that compensates for the lost 204 units and meets the current demand regime. Sigma_hat is calculated based on the recent high-volatility period (N=9, since P8) to ensure a sufficient safety stock buffer for this basic apparel item.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P8-P16) mean is 104.2 units/week (+104% vs early period). Total confirmed lost inventory remains 204 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Functional pipeline consists of P14 (69) and P15 (209) totaling 278 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a women's jersey t-shirt, which is in its high-season 'Spring/Summer' regime. Since Period 8 (April 1st), demand has shifted significantly upward. The mean demand for the period from P8 to P17 is approximately 104.3 units per week. In Period 17, 209 units arrived (from Period 15 order), leaving 96 units on-hand. Examining the 'In-transit' status: The history shows confirmed lost orders from P1 (35), P3 (72), P4 (29), and P10 (68), totaling 204 units. The reported 'In-transit' is 273 units. Subtracting the 204 lost units leaves 69 units (from Period 14) as the only viable pipeline inventory. Given that the P14 order is now 4 periods old (promised lead time 2), it is highly likely to be lost as well. Therefore, I assume the functional pipeline is 0. I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand Spring regime (P8-P17). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the volatility observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Order from Period 14 (69 units) is now 4 periods old without arrival; added to confirmed lost inventory. Total suspected lost units: 273 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14), matching current In-transit. Practical pipeline is zero.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/06/17), we are in the peak summer season for t-shirts. The demand in Period 18 spiked to 160 units, significantly above the regime average of ~105. The mean demand since Period 8 is 109.1 units/week. Inventory management is severely complicated by persistent shipment losses. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Periods 1 (35), 3 (72), 4 (29), 10 (68), and now 14 (69) are lost, as they have exceeded double the promised lead time without arrival. This totals 273 units, which exactly matches the current 'In-transit' figure, meaning the functional pipeline is currently zero. We are starting Period 19 with 0 on-hand inventory. To recover from stockouts and meet upcoming high seasonal demand (averaging ~110, peaking at 160), I will set L to 2 (promised) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 350. This value accounts for (L+1) periods of demand at approximately 116 units/week, providing a slight buffer for the recent upward trend. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for the high volatility (SD in this regime is approx 24, so sqrt(3)*24 ~ 42, but I am increasing this to ensure the OR backend places a sufficiently large order to overcome the lost units in the pipeline and meet the 160+ peaks).

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Order from Period 14 (69 units) confirmed lost. Total lost inventory is 273 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14), which accounts for 100% of the currently reported In-transit inventory. High summer demand peak of 160 units observed in P18.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). We are in a high-demand summer regime for the Nora T-shirt. Demand since Period 8 has averaged approximately 110 units per week, with a recent spike to 160. Inventory management is severely complicated by persistent shipment losses. Analysis of In-transit shows 350 units: Period 1 (35), P3 (72), P4 (29), P10 (68), P14 (69) are highly likely lost as they are all at least 6 periods old (Promised L=2). This accounts for 273 lost units. The functional pipeline consists of orders from Period 19 (77 units). Order from P15 (209 units) arrived in P17. On-hand is zero and we have experienced stockouts in 14 out of 19 periods. Given the high stockout frequency and the unreliable pipeline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent evidence (N=12, covering the Spring/Summer regime since P8). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the frequent delays/losses and ensure the base stock calculation targets a safer inventory level to mitigate these failures.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified lost shipments total 273 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). Demand remains in high-regime (Avg ~110 units/week since P8). High risk of stockouts due to narrow supply-demand gap and zero on-hand inventory.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are managing a Nora T-shirt SKU in a high-demand summer regime. The primary challenge remains the severe reliability issue with pipeline inventory. As of Period 20, 273 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) were confirmed/highly likely lost. The current In-transit total is 438 units. This reflects: [P15: 209 (arrived P17, but likely hasn't updated in 'current' total if there's lag, or more likely we subtract arrived from transit), P19: 77, P20: 88, plus the 273 lost units.] Specifically: 438 (Total In-Transit) - 273 (Confirmed Lost) = 165 units. This 165 units perfectly matches the orders from P19 (77) and P20 (88). Consequently, the functional pipeline is exactly these 165 units. Demand since the 'Spring/Summer regime' shift (P8, 2019-04-01) has averaged 110.7 units/week with a recent peak of 160. Given on-hand is 0, we must maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average 1.8-period arrival time of successful shipments. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering the period since P8) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (~110 units/week). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=13 to account for the high variance (range 82-160) observed in this season.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 21, the functional pipeline is 165 units (orders from P19 and P20). The reported In-transit of 438 units includes 273 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). Summer demand regime (start P8) mean is ~111 units/week.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019, which is peak summer for a jersey t-shirt. Period 21 results confirm a high demand regime (mean of ~111 since P8). The system reports 438 units in-transit, but 273 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). The functional pipeline consists solely of orders from P19 (77 units) and P20 (88 units), totaling 165 units. Promising lead time is 2 periods; P19's order is expected to arrive during P21/P22, and P20's during P22/P23. Since on-hand is 0 and recent demand significantly exceeds functional supply, I must adjust the OR parameters to account for the lost inventory. I will set the lead time parameter to 'explicit' at 2 to reflect the reliable mode of successful deliveries while using 'recent_N' for demand (N=14) to capture the high summer regime since April (P8). This will signal the OR backend to order sufficiently to cover the 3-period window (L+1) without over-relying on the phantom 'lost' inventory.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. The SKU is a 'Nora T-shirt' (womens jersey basic), which has been in a high-demand regime since April (Period 8), averaging ~111 units/week. Recent demand has cooled slightly (82 and 59 in the last two periods), suggesting we might be exiting the peak summer season, but historical variance remains high. 

Inventory Analysis: On-hand is 29. The OR engine sees 'In-transit' as 350. However, 273 units from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) are confirmed lost because they are significantly past their promised lead time. Additionally, the order from P19 (77 units) is now 4 periods old (placed June 17, today is July 15) without arriving, making its loss highly likely. If P19 is lost, the total lost units are 350 (273 + 77), which exactly matches the system's 'In-transit' count. This means the practical pipeline is ZERO. 

Parameter Strategy: To trigger the OR engine to order despite it 'seeing' a full pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the phantom pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 (covering the high regime) to maintain a base stock level that reflects the ~105-110 average demand. I will set L to 'explicit' value 2 to align with the promised and most common successful lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=15) to capture the significant volatility observed (range 59-160) during the high regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Order from Period 19 (77 units) is confirmed lost (4 periods elapsed). Total confirmed lost inventory is now 350 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19), which accounts for 100% of the currently reported In-transit inventory. Practical pipeline is zero. Seasonality shows a slight cooling from peak summer levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (2019-07-22), the product continues to experience high loss rates in the supply chain. The reported 'In-transit' quantity of 350 units matches exactly the sum of confirmed/highly likely lost shipments: P1 (35), P3 (72), P4 (29), P10 (68), P14 (69), and P19 (77). Consequently, the practical pipeline inventory is essentially zero units, and on-hand inventory is also zero following the depletion in Period 23. This is a critical stockout situation. Demand shifted to a higher regime in early April (Period 8) coinciding with Spring/Summer seasonality for this jersey T-shirt. The mean demand since Period 8 is approximately 107 units/week, though recent weeks (P21-P23) suggest a slight cooling as summer peaks pass (82, 59, 101 units). To address the lost shipments and zero functional inventory, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure we account for the promised lead time, and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=16 (covering the high-demand regime since P8) to ensure the target base stock reflects the current consumption rate plus the necessary buffer to overcome the defunct pipeline inventory. The backend OR logic will attempt to order up to the base stock, but since it is unaware that the 350 in-transit units are lost, I must set the mu_hat and sigma_hat high enough to trigger an order or rely on the fact that 'In-transit' is normally subtracted. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline, and the pipeline is 'inflated' by lost units, I am using a higher sigma_hat and an explicit L to force a higher base stock level to compensate for the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Order from Period 19 (77 units) confirmed lost. Total lost inventory is 350 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19), which accounts for 100% of the currently reported In-transit inventory. Demand since P8 (Spring/Summer regime) maintains an average of ~107 units/week.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25, the reported In-transit inventory for SKU 554598047 is 350 units. Based on historical data, these 350 units correspond to older, undelivered orders from periods 1 (35), 3 (72), 4 (29), 10 (68), 14 (69), and 19 (77). Every order placed since Period 20 has either arrived (Period 20 arrived in P22) or wasn't placed (P21-P24). Therefore, the functional pipeline is currently zero units, as all reported in-transit units are confirmed or highly likely to be lost. The demand regime since Period 8 remains strong, characterized as a 'Spring/Summer' regime with an average demand of approximately 107 units per week. Recent demand in Period 24 spiked to 152 units, suggesting that while some cooling was expected, demand remains volatile and high. To address the zero on-hand and zero functional pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat to 'explicit' at 321 units to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at the regime average (~107), and using an 'explicit' L of 2 to match the promised lead time. This will signal the OR backend to place an order that restores the base stock, ignoring the 350 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: All 350 in-transit units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) are confirmed lost/undeliverable. Functional pipeline is 0. Demand regime since P8 maintains an average of ~107 units/week despite a spike to 152 in P24.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598047 (Nora T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand Summer regime which began around April (Period 8). The average demand since Period 8 has been approximately 107.8 units per week, significantly higher than the early-year levels. In Period 24, a peak of 152 units was observed, followed by 93 units in Period 25. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory. The reported in-transit inventory of 350 units is composed entirely of orders that are confirmed lost or significantly overdue beyond any reasonable lead time (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19). Consequently, the functional pipeline is zero. To trigger an order that accounts for the lost inventory while maintaining a high service level for the current demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the regime from P8 to P25). To handle the lost inventory reporting issue, I am using an 'explicit' L value of 1. By setting L to 1 (lower than the promised 2) while the functional pipeline is effectively 0, the OR engine's base-stock calculation (which uses pipeline inventory) will perceive a massive deficit and place a large order to replenish the stock, effectively clearing the 'ghost' units from the planning logic.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P8-P25) mean demand remains stable at ~108 units/week. All 350 in-transit units are confirmed lost/undeliverable as of Period 25.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019-08-12. The product is a soft jersey T-shirt, which has been in a high-demand regime since April (Period 8, Spring/Summer seasonality). The mean demand since Period 8 is approximately 107.5 units per week, with a standard deviation of roughly 24 units. Currently, the system reports 350 units In-transit. Based on the history of 'conclude' messages, these 350 units correspond to orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 14, and 19, all of which are significantly past their promised lead time of 2 periods and have effectively been confirmed lost. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 0 units, and on-hand inventory is 0. To prevent further stockouts, I need the OR backend to place an order. By setting L explicitly to 2 and using a high mu_hat based on the recent 19-period regime (N=19), I am signaling that the 'In-transit' quantity should be ignored by the policy (since base_stock - 0 will trigger an order). mu_hat is set to (1+L)*107.5 = 322.5 to cover the review and lead time periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P8-P26) mean demand remains stable at ~108 units/week. All 350 in-transit units are confirmed lost/undeliverable as of Period 26.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598047' (Nora T-shirt) is in a high-demand regime that began in Period 8 (Spring/Summer seasonality). The mean demand from Period 8 to Period 27 is approximately 107.8 units per week. However, the system is severely handicapped by lost shipments. The current In-transit inventory of 350 units is composed entirely of orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 14, and 19, all of which are significantly past their delivery window and are confirmed/presumed lost. Consequently, the practical pipeline inventory is 0. With On-hand also at 0, the OR engine needs to trigger a significant re-order. To bypass the 'pipeline' constraint (where the OR engine subtracts in-transit from base stock), I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat that covers both the projected demand for the (L+1) period and compensates for the ghost inventory in the pipeline. Since Profit (1.0) equals Holding Cost (1.0), the target service level is 50% (z=0), meaning the base stock target is roughly (1+L) * mu. For L=2, target stock is 3 * 107.8 = 323 units. Given the OR engine will subtract 350 in-transit units, I must set an explicit mu_hat that results in a base stock above 350 to generate an order. I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the expected demand and clear the pipeline deficit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the SKU 554598047 (Nora T-shirt) remains in a state of high demand volatility and significant inventory loss. Historical data confirms that 350 units (from orders in Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 14, and 19) are permanently lost, as they are now far beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods. The current 'In-transit' of 450 units includes these 350 lost units plus the 100 units ordered in Period 28. Therefore, the functional pipeline is only 100 units. Demand since the Spring/Summer regime shift (Period 8) has averaged approximately 107 units/week, though recent periods (P27: 51, P28: 63) suggest a potential seasonal cooling as we move towards September. However, given the zero on-hand inventory and the unreliability of the pipeline, I will maintain a high mu_hat based on the late-season average to prevent stockouts while the OR backend uses the conservative capping mechanism. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime while allowing the recent lower values to slightly temper the forecast. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to reflect high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Functional pipeline is 100 units (Period 28 order); 350 units are definitively lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19). Recent demand (P27: 51, P28: 63) indicates a seasonal slowdown from the previous ~107 units/week average.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019-09-02), the product (Nora T-shirt) is entering a late-summer/early-fall cooling phase. Demand shifted from a high-summer average of ~110 units/week to a lower average of ~63 units/week over the last three periods (P27: 51, P28: 63, P29: 68). The reported in-transit inventory of 450 units is largely composed of lost shipments (350 units confirmed lost: P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19). The only functional pipeline inventory is the 100 units ordered in Period 28, which is expected to arrive in Period 30 or 31. To account for the confirmed lost shipments (which the OR backend incorrectly views as valid pipeline inventory), mu_hat is set using an 'explicit' value. This value is calculated as the forecast for the lead-time window (L+1 = 3 periods) based on the recent cooling average (~65) plus the 350 units of lost inventory. This forces the backend to place an order despite the phantom pipeline. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect historical arrival patterns, and sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime confirmed starting P27: mean demand dropped from ~110 to ~63 units/week (-43%) as summer ends. Total confirmed lost shipments remain at 350 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the demand for the Nora T-shirt has entered a seasonal cooling phase. Since Period 27 (Aug 12), demand has averaged 55.5 units/week (51, 63, 68, 40), down significantly from the peak summer average of ~110 units/week. This aligns with late-summer/early-autumn retail patterns for basic jersey t-shirts. The reported in-transit of 445 units is misleading due to substantial accumulated losses: P1(35), P3(72), P4(29), P10(68), P14(69), and P19(77) total 350 lost units. The functional pipeline consists only of the order placed in P30 (95 units). With 60 units currently on-hand and an expected arrival of 95 units prochainly, the current stock covers the cooling demand regime. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 to capture the seasonal slowdown, while maintaining base lead time assumptions.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime confirmed starting Period 27 (2019-08-12): mean demand decreased to ~56 units/week from previous ~108. Total confirmed lost shipments now 350 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (2019-09-16), the product (Nora T-shirt) is in a post-summer cooling regime. The mean demand since Period 27 has dropped significantly to approximately 51 units/week (P27-P31), compared to the prior summer average of ~108. The In-transit total of 445 units is highly misleading: 350 units are confirmed lost from previous periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19). The valid functional pipeline only consists of the order from Period 30 (95 units). Since on-hand is 28 and expected arrival (Period 30 order) is likely next period (L=2), I will set mu_hat to reflect the current cooling trend. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*51 \u2248 153 to cover the review and lead time periods at the lower demand rate. Sigma_hat is calculated based on recent volatility in this cooling regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime confirmed starting Period 27 (2019-08-12): mean demand dropped to ~51 units/week (observed 51, 63, 68, 40, 32). Total confirmed lost shipments remain at 350 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19). functional pipeline is 95 units (P30).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in a confirmed post-summer cooling regime for the Nora T-shirt, which started around August 12 (Period 27). The mean demand has shifted from ~108 units/week during the peak Spring/Summer season to approximately 47 units/week over the last 6 periods (P27-P32). The latest demand observation was 28 units, continuing the downward seasonal trend as we move further into autumn. Total reported in-transit remains 350 units, but based on extensive historical tracking, these units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) are confirmed lost/undeliverable. Current functional pipeline is zero as the P30 order arrived in P32. On-hand inventory is 95 units. To prevent overstocking in a cooling market while maintaining a buffer, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6), capturing the lower demand regime while accounting for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime mean demand updated: ~47 units/week (P27-P32). Functional pipeline is currently 0, with 350 units confirmed lost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598047 (Womens soft jersey T-shirt) has transitioned from the high summer demand regime (~108 units/week) into a cooling post-summer regime starting Period 27. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P27-P33) is approximately 47 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 49 units, which covers approximately one week of demand. The reported In-transit of 350 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) and should be treated as zero for planning purposes. To maintain availability without overstocking during this cooling period, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent demand average of ~47 units/week using the last 7 periods (P27-P33). Sigma_hat is set using the same window to capture the reduced volatility of the current regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 2 periods for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime mean demand stabilized at ~47 units/week from P27 (2019-08-12) to P33. Previous summer regime (P8-P26) mean was ~108 units/week. Total confirmed lost shipments remain at 350 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19), accounting for all stale In-transit entries.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 554598047 (Nora T-shirt) has transitioned from its high summer regime (avg ~108) into a cooler autumn regime starting Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent weekly demand samples (51, 63, 68, 40, 32, 28, 46, 22) reflect this downward trend as seasonal demand for basic short-sleeved jerseys wanes. Using the last 8 samples (since P27) gives a mean of 43.75 units/week. Lead times are consistently 2 periods when shipments actually arrive. Note that the 350 units in-transit are confirmed lost from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P19; since the OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, keeping L at 'default' or 'calculate' while the 'in-transit' remains high will result in zero orders. However, since Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level. With 27 units on hand and a mean demand of ~44, the current stock is sufficient for the immediate period and part of the next. I will use 'recent_N' for mu and sigma (N=8) to capture the cooling trend while allowing the OR engine to recalculate based on the current lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime mean demand is ~44 units/week (P27-P34). Total confirmed lost shipments remain at 350 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19), keeping reported In-transit artificially high.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a post-summer cooling regime which began around Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand samples (P27 to P35) are: 51, 63, 68, 40, 32, 28, 46, 22, 23. The mean demand for this 'recent_N' where N=9 is approximately 41.4 units/week, a significant drop from the summer peak of ~108. The 'In-transit' figure of 350 is confirmed as 100% lost shipments from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19), meaning the functional pipeline is currently 0. On-hand inventory is 4 units. To maintain appropriate stock for the current demand level and accounting for the promised lead time of 2 (target inventory window of L+1 = 3 weeks), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples to capture the stabilized lower demand. Transitioning to recent_N allows the OR backend to recalculate based on this specific autumnal regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime (started P27) has stabilized. Average demand from P27-P35 is ~41 units/week, down from ~108 (+160% seasonal reduction).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-10-21. We are in a 'post-summer cooling' demand regime that began around Period 27 (mid-August). Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the summer peak. The average demand from Period 27 to Period 36 is 39.4 units/week. Recent periods (P34-P36) show even lower demand (22, 23, 21), suggesting a potential further dip as we move deeper into autumn. On-hand inventory is now 0. Regarding Lead Time and Pipeline: The promised lead time is 2, and recent successful arrivals (P28 order, P30 order) adhered to this. However, 350 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19), meaning the reported In-transit of 350 units is effectively zero functional inventory. To prevent stockouts during this cooling phase while avoiding excessive holding costs (Profits=Holding Cost=1.0), I will set mu_hat based on the recent N=10 samples (P27-P36) to capture the cooling regime (mean ~39). I'll use explicit L=2 as it is the most reliable observation despite the historical losses.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime mean demand from P27-P36 is 39.4 units/week, a ~64% reduction from the summer average of 108.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 38 (late October 2019). The demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt has transitioned from a high summer regime (avg ~108 units) to a post-summer cooling regime starting around Period 27 (mid-August). The mean demand for this cooling period (P27-P37) is approximately 41 units with a standard deviation of roughly 16. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the reported In-transit value of 350 units is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19), meaning the functional pipeline is currently zero. To prevent stockouts during this lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N approach (N=11) to capture the dynamics of this current cooling phase without being influenced by the summer peaks. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed delivery performance.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 554598047 (Nora T-shirt) has entered a stable low-demand regime following the summer peak. Since Period 27 (2019-08-12), demand has averaged approximately 39.4 units per week, with recent observations showing a further decline (P36: 21, P37: 34, P38: 18). The current reported 'In-transit' of 350 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19), meaning the functional pipeline is currently zero. With 0 on-hand inventory and a 2-period lead time, we must order to cover the (L+1) period window. Based on the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38), the average demand is ~22.6 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the post-summer cooling trend accurately while maintaining a buffer against the variance observed in this lower regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime mean demand from P27-P38 is 35.8 units/week. Recent 5-period average (P34-P38) is 22.6 units/week, indicating a potential secondary seasonal drop as winter approaches.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product (Nora T-shirt) has entered a distinct low-demand regime as winter approaches. Since Period 34 (late September), the weekly demand has consistently stayed below 25 units, with an average of 19.3 units/week over the last 3 periods. This follows a significant drop from the summer peak (~108/week) and the initial autumn cooling (~45/week). The reported In-transit of 350 units remains entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19), meaning the functional pipeline is currently zero and the on-hand inventory is empty. Lead times for successful shipments have consistently been 2 periods (except for a few 1-period arrivals earlier). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase while addressing the current stockout, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6, covering the stable winter-entry demand) to reflect the current mean of ~23 units/week. This will trigger a small order to rebuild a lean stock level suitable for the current seasonal trough.

Carry-over insight: Secondary seasonal demand drop confirmed starting Period 34 (2019-09-30): mean demand has decreased from ~45 to ~21 units/week as winter approaches. Functional pipeline remains zero as the 350 units in transit are confirmed lost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019). The demand for Nora T-shirts has entered a secondary seasonal decline (winter regime) starting approximately Period 34 (late September), with demand dropping from an average of ~45 to ~21 units/week. The most recent demand samples (P38: 18, P39: 19, P40: 10) suggest this decline is persisting. The reported 'In-transit' of 350 units is confirmed lost (historical orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P19 remain undelivered), meaning functional pipeline inventory is zero. With zero on-hand and zero functional pipeline, we must place an order to cover the (L+1) horizon. We use N=7 for mu_hat (P34-P40) to capture the current winter low-demand regime, yielding an average of ~21 units/week. L is set to 'default' as recent successful deliveries (P28, P30) adhered to the promised 2-period lead time.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a late-autumn/winter seasonal low. Since Period 34 (2019-09-30), demand has dropped significantly. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P34-P41) is approximately 18.9 units/week (22, 23, 21, 34, 18, 19, 10, 14). The most recent 3 periods (P39-P41) average even lower at 14.3 units/week. As of Period 42, on-hand inventory is 0 and the functional in-transit inventory is 0 (the 350 units in-transit are confirmed lost from periods P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P19). To avoid further stockouts while accounting for the seasonal decline, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this 'winter regime'. Sigma_hat will also use N=8 to reflect the reduced volatility in this period. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 2, as recent successful deliveries (P28, P30) adhered to this.

Carry-over insight: Winter secondary demand regime confirmed: Mean demand from P34-P41 is ~19 units/week, down from the early-autumn average of ~45. Total confirmed lost shipments remain 350 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598047 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a stable winter low-demand regime. Average demand from Period 34 to Period 42 is 18.2 units per week. The reported In-transit of 350 units remains entirely composed of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19), meaning the functional pipeline is currently zero. With 0 on-hand inventory, the system is consistently stocking out, but the absolute magnitude of lost sales is low due to the seasonal drop. I will set the demand parameters using recent_N (N=9, covering the regime since P34) to capture this low-volume state. I will use the 'explicit' lead time method set to 2 to bypass the inflation caused by lost shipments not 'concluding'. This configuration will initiate a small replenishment order that respects the low seasonal demand while ignoring the fictitious pipeline inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598047 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a secondary winter 'low-demand' regime that began around Period 34 (2019-09-30). Since Period 34, demand has averaged approximately 18.2 units per week (samples: 22, 23, 21, 34, 18, 19, 10, 14, 25, 10). The most recent 5 periods show an even lower average of 15.6 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0 and the current 'In-transit' of 350 units is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19), meaning the functional pipeline is 0. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P44 to P47), I need to re-establish inventory to meet this lower demand level without over-ordering. I will set L to 'recent_N' with N=5 (consistent with recent typical 2-period lead times) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the sustained winter low-demand regime (approx. 18.2 units/week). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=10) to reflect the current lower volatility. This should trigger an order of approximately 50-60 units to cover the remaining periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598047 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a secondary winter seasonal demand drop. Average demand since the secondary regime shift at Period 34 (2019-09-30) is approximately 17 units/week, with the most recent 3 periods (P42, P43, P44) showing 25, 10, and 7 units respectively (averaging 14). The product is out of stock (on-hand = 0). While the In-transit figure is reported as 350 units, historical analysis confirms these shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) are permanently lost. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 0. With only 2 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46) and a promised lead time of 2 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) will arrive during Period 47. Since demand resolution in P47 happens AFTER the final arrival resolution, this order can still satisfy final period demand. I will set mu_hat to target the recent winter average (~17/week) and use recent_N (N=11, covering P34-P44) for sigma_hat to capture the low winter volatility.

Carry-over insight: Secondary seasonal demand drop (Winter regime) confirmed starting Period 34 (2019-09-30): mean demand declined from ~45 to current ~17 units/week.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable Winter demand regime that began around Period 34 (late September). The mean demand for the last 12 periods (P34-P45) is approximately 18.2 units/week, which is a significant drop from the Summer peak (~108) and the early Autumn transition (~45). The current date is December 23, 2019, indicating deep winter seasonality where demand for basic jersey t-shirts remains low. The reported In-transit inventory of 350 units remains entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) and should be treated as zero for planning purposes. On-hand inventory is also zero. Given the lost shipments and the seasonal low, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture the current Winter regime's statistics. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the estimated demand while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0) and moderate profit margin ($1.0), which suggests a targeted service level of 50%.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the final period. Demand remains in the low 'Winter' regime that started around Period 34 (2019-09-30). Since Period 34, the average demand has been approximately 17 units/period, with the most recent five periods (P42-P46) averaging ~14 units. Reported 'In-transit' remains at 350 units, but as documented extensively in carry-over insights, these 350 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P19) are definitively lost as they are many months overdue. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 0. However, because this is the final period of the game (Period 47 of 47), any order placed now will arrive after the game concludes (given the minimum 1-2 period lead time). Ordering now would incur holding costs on future inventory that cannot be sold within the game's timeframe. Thus, the objective is to minimize final inventory and holding costs by ordering nothing.
