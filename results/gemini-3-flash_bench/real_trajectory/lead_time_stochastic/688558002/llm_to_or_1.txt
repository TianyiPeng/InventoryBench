Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of the simulation (Period 1, 2019/2/11). The SKU 688558002 is a fitted, long-sleeved jersey top (Jersey Basic). Historical demand shows a sharp upward trend over the last four weeks: 6, 11, 48, 72, and 90. This indicates either a late winter/early spring seasonal ramp-up or a product launch lifecycle. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the base stock must cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand. The most recent demand (90) is significantly higher than the overall mean (~45). To avoid immediate stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent growth (averaging 70, 48, 90) rather than the lower early samples. For L, I will use the default promised lead time of 2 until empirical evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Brittany LS', a fitted long-sleeved top, which is seasonally appropriate for late winter/early spring. Historical demand (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) showed a clear upward trend (6, 11, 48, 72, 90). In Period 1 (Feb 11), demand was 67. The average demand of the last 4 periods (including P1) is approximately 69.25 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 105 units; these are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (concluded in P4). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we lost sales in Period 1, the OR backend needs to establish a base stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Given the strong upward trend followed by a slight stabilization, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current demand level (~70/period).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a 'Jersey Basic' top, which typically shows steady or rising demand moving into Spring. Historical demand from Jan/Feb shows a clear upward trend: 6, 11, 48, 72, 90, followed by game start demand of 67 (P1) and 128 (P2). The mean demand over the last 3 samples is 95. Lead time is promised at 2 periods. The order from P1 (105 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase (making it visible in P4's start). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 203 in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since demand is scaling up rapidly (from ~70 to ~130), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest growth. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the current momentum while the pipeline catches up to the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Historical demand was low (<50) in Jan, but scaled significantly in Feb (avg ~95 over last 3 samples), suggesting Spring seasonality for this jersey top.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a 'Brittany LS' fitted jersey top, which is seeing a significant upward demand trend as we enter Spring (Feb demand: 90, 67, 128, 123). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 330 units in-transit. Based on the history: Period 1 order (105 units) was placed with a promised lead time of 2. It should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 4 start (the 'Period 3 conclude' message). However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed. Since we have zero on-hand and have lost all demand recorded so far (sold=0), we must aggressively increase the base stock. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat, the last 3 periods show an average demand of 106. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this high-growth regime, which for L=3 translates to a forecast of (1+3)*106 = 424 units. This will bridge the gap between our zero stock and the current demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is at least 3 periods (Period 1 order of 105 units did not arrive by end of Period 3). Demand regime remains high for Spring, averaging ~106 units/period over the last 3 weeks.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a jersey top showing Spring seasonality. Demand analysis: Last 5 samples (67, 128, 123, 75, plus pre-history 90) suggest an average demand around 95-100. The most recent demand (75) was lower than P2/P3, but significantly higher than Jan levels. Lead-time analysis: The Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2). However, the Period 1 order (105 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived; this order is likely lost. The Period 3 order (127 units) has not arrived yet (expected this period, visible next). On-hand is low (23), and the pipeline (384) includes a likely lost order of 105. To compensate for the lost shipment and ensure stock against Spring demand, I am using L=2 (promised/verified) but setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*110 = 330 to provide a buffer against the missing inventory, while sigma_hat reflects recent volatility (recent_N=4).

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Shipment from Period 1 (105 units) confirmed lost (exceeded lead time by 2+ periods). Inventory calculations should discount these units from in-transit totals.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/03/18), the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units. Demand for the Brittany LS top (Spring seasonal item) has stabilized at a high level, although slightly lower in the last two weeks (75 and 74 units) compared to the February peak of ~125. Regarding lead times: the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (actual lead time = 2), but the Period 1 order is confirmed lost (per Carry-over insights). The Period 3 order (127 units) should arrive during Period 5's resolution and be visible in Period 6's opening, yet the 'conclude' message for Period 5 shows 0 arrived, which suggests the Period 3 order is delayed or possibly lost. However, the system shows 384 units in-transit (P1: 105 [lost], P2: 98 [arrived], P3: 127, P4: 152, P5: 0). Corrected in-transit excludes P1 and P2, leaving 279 units (P3 and P4). To ensure adequate stock for the (L+1) horizon amid lead-time uncertainty, I'll set L to 3 (explicit) to account for delays and target a mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture the Spring demand baseline (~93 units/period, multiplied by 1+L).

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Lead time uncertainty increased as Period 3 order (127 units) did not arrive by end of Period 5 (L > 2). Demand regime for March has softened slightly to ~75 units/period compared to February's ~125.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the SKU is currently out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows significant logistical disruption: the Period 1 order (105 units) is confirmed lost, and the Period 3 order (127 units), placed on Feb 25, has not arrived by the end of Period 6 (March 18), confirming that lead time is now at least 3 periods. The only successful delivery was the Period 2 order which arrived in Period 4 (L=2). Demand has stabilized after the February spike; the last three weeks (Periods 4-6) show demand of 75, 74, and 82 (average ~77). Given the stockout and the unreliability of arrivals, I am setting the lead time 'L' to an explicit 3 to account for the observed delays. Since we need to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand, and the current regime is ~77 units/period, mu_hat is set to 308 (4 * 77) and sigma_hat is set to 10 (sqrt(4) * ~5) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains unstable: Period 3 order (127 units) has exceeded the promised 2-period lead time and has not arrived by end of Period 6 (Actual L > 3). Demand regime for March has settled at ~77 units/period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), we are facing a critical inventory shortage. The on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of the history shows: (1) Order P1 (105 units) is confirmed lost. (2) Order P2 arrived as expected (L=2). (3) Order P3 (127 units), placed in P3, should have arrived in P5 (L=2) or P6 (L=3) but still has not arrived by the end of P7 (L=4+). It must be considered lost or severely delayed. (4) Order P4 (152 units), placed in P4, is now due (L=4). If L=4 is the new reality, it should arrive now. Demand has stabilized into a March/April regime of ~77 units/period (average of P4-P7 demand: 75, 74, 82, 75). With P1 and P3 likely lost, the 'In-transit' figure of 424 is misleading. The effective pipeline to reach us soon is likely only the orders from P4 (152), P6 (40), and any order placed in P7 (0). I will use L=3 to account for the observed delivery delays and set mu_hat to cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand at the 77 units/period rate (77*4=308). Sigma_hat is set to recent volatility levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for orders placed in P3 and P4 has exceeded 4 periods, suggesting a systemic logistics delay or higher loss rate compared to the promised L=2. March-April demand regime confirmed stable at ~77 units/period.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are managing a jersey top with a clear logistics issue. Period 8's conclude message shows that the order from Period 6 arrived on time (L=2), however, the large orders from Period 3 (127 units) and Period 4 (152 units) are now extremely overdue (6 and 5 periods respectively). Based on the Period 5 discovery that the Period 1 order was lost, it is highly probable that the Period 3 and 4 orders are also lost. The OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation (384 units) includes these likely lost units (127 from P3 + 152 from P4 + 105 from P1 [which may still be in the 'In-transit' count despite the discovery]). This creates a dangerous under-ordering situation because the backend thinks we have ample supply arriving, while in reality, on-hand is 0. Demand for the March-April period (Spring) has stabilized around 75-80 units/period (latest sample 92). To compensate for the 'ghost' pipeline inventory and protect against stockouts, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high. Target inventory should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand plus safety stock. Since the backend subtracts pipeline (384) from base stock, I will set mu_hat to a level that forces an order despite the inflated pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Systemic risk of lost shipments confirmed: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 have all failed to arrive within 2x the promised lead time, while P2 and P6 arrived normally. This suggests high variance in fulfillment reliability rather than just a lead-time extension.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), the demand for the seasonal long-sleeved jersey top has dropped to 39 units, indicating that the 'Spring' peak is ending. The historical data and carry-over insights confirm that shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 384 units) are almost certainly lost, as they are 3+ periods beyond the promised lead time. Only orders from P9 (178 units) are currently active in-transit with a high probability of arriving. On-hand inventory is 0. My goal is to reset the inventory target to match the lower demand regime (approx. 40-50 units/period) while accounting for the high shipment loss rate. I will use the last 3 samples to capture this recent downward trend in demand (mu_hat) and maintain the lead time at the promised 2 periods, as calculate/recent methods might be skewed by the lost shipments that never 'conclude'.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: Period 9 demand fell to 39 units (-50% from March avg), signaling the end of the Spring peak for this SKU. High shipment loss rate persists: 384 units from P1, P3, P4 are confirmed lost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/22. Demand has significantly cooled off following the Spring peak, with the last two periods showing 39 and 31 units respectively, confirming a regime shift identified in Period 10. The 178-unit order from Period 9 arrived in just 1 period (actual L=1), providing a healthy on-hand stock of 147 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 384 units consists of orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (105+127+152=384), which are now more than 6 weeks overdue and are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the target base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target, effectively masking these phantom units and allowing the system to maintain a real stock level. I will set the per-period demand forecast to 35 units based on recent low demand. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+L)*35 = 105. However, to offset the 384 phantom units, mu_hat must be 105 + 384 = 489. This ensures the backend (Target - 384) yields the desired 105 base stock. sigma_hat is set to 20 over 3 periods (sqrt(3)*11.5) to handle the variance in this lower regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-Spring demand regime (late April) stable at ~35 units/period. Logistics reliability remains binary: orders either arrive in 1-2 periods or are lost entirely (Current lost total: 384 units from P1, P3, P4).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 29, 2019. The 'Brittany LS' jersey top demand has shifted from a Spring high (avg ~100-125 in Feb/March) to a lower, stable post-peak regime (avg ~39 over the last 3 periods). Logistics reliability remains the primary challenge: orders from P1 (105), P3 (127), and P4 (152) are confirmed lost as they have exceeded their lead times by 7+ periods. The current 'In-transit' of 384 units consists entirely of these lost shipments. Consequently, they provide zero pipeline cover. On-hand inventory is 99 units, which covers roughly 2.5 periods of the current demand (avg ~40). To account for the lost pipeline while minimizing excess inventory during this lower demand phase, I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure the OR engine targets a (L+1)=3 period window. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent downshift (approx 40 units/period), and sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and demand for this jersey top has stabilized at a lower post-Spring regime (avg ~40 units/period over the last 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 56, which covers over one period of demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 384 units is comprised entirely of lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (105+127+152), which were ordered in February/March and have significantly exceeded promised lead times. Since these are lost, the OR engine's internal 'pipeline_inventory' calculation would normally prevent new ordering. By setting L to 'explicit' at the promised 2 periods, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=4), I am targeting a base stock level that reflects the current demand (approx 120 units for L+1). Because the OR backend subtracts in-transit (384) from base stock (approx 120), no new order will be placed this period, which is appropriate given the 56 units on hand and the lowering demand trend. I will use the last 4 periods to define the current mu and sigma.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). Demand for this 'Brittany LS' (long-sleeved jersey top) has significantly cooled down following the Spring peak. Over the last four periods (P10-P13), weekly demand has averaged 37.5 units (31, 48, 43, 28), which is a sharp decline from the ~77-125 units seen in Feb-March. On-hand inventory is 28 units. Regarding logistics, the 'In-transit' figure of 384 units is misleading as it comprises orders from P1 (105), P3 (127), and P4 (152) which are all confirmed lost (over 9 periods overdue). The backend OR engine, however, sees these 384 units as 'pipeline inventory'. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to determine orders, it will likely order 0 unless I compensate. However, given the current low demand regime and the residual 28 units on-hand, we have nearly one full week of coverage. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand (using N=4 for the stable post-peak period) and set the lead time to its promised 'default' of 2 as recent successful arrivals (P6, P9) were within 1-2 periods. I will not use an explicit value to force an order yet because 28 on-hand units are sufficient to cover the next immediate period of ~30-40 demand while awaiting the next cycle.

Carry-over insight: Post-Spring demand regime (May) settled at ~38 units/period, down from peak of ~100+. Logistics reliability remains unstable: P1, P3, P4 shipments (384 units total) are permanently lost and must be manually accounted for in inventory strategy.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. This SKU (long-sleeved jersey top) has fully transitioned out of its Spring peak (Feb-March, ~100+ units/period) into a lower late-Spring/early-Summer regime. Consumption over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has averaged approximately 36.4 units per period (31, 48, 43, 28, 32). On-hand inventory is now 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 384 units is misleading as it consists entirely of shipments from P1 (105), P3 (127), and P4 (152) which are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from the base stock calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock to offset these ghost units. Calculating mu_hat: Targeted base_stock = (L+1) * Expected_Demand. With promised L=2 and expected demand ~37, base_stock should be ~111. To force an order of ~111 when the backend thinks pipeline is 384, mu_hat would normally need to be very high. However, the OR backend also applies a cap: mu_hat/(1+L) + z*sigma_hat/sqrt(1+L). By setting mu_hat explicitly to the current regime average (~37 * (1+L)) and keeping L as default (2), the backend will likely order nothing if it still sees the 384 units. To bypass the 'ghost' pipeline units, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that equals (37 * (1+2)) + 384 = 495. This forces the base_stock calculation to account for the lost inventory. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the current regime's stability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-27, transitioning from late Spring to early Summer. Historically, this SKU (Jersey Basic Top) saw a demand peak in Feb/Mar (~100 units/period) and has now stabilized in a lower regime of ~35-40 units/period (average demand over the last 6 periods is 34.6 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 508 units is misleading due to confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (105), Period 3 (127), and Period 4 (152), totaling 384 units that will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline consists of the P15 order (124 units). Lead time is binary: shipments either arrive exactly in 1-2 periods or are lost. I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 35 units/period) and setting L to 2 to cover the promised lead time and current period. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for ~105 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the 'in-transit' total (508) from the base stock, and 508 > 105, it won't trigger a new order unless I adjust parameters. However, given the P15 order of 124 is likely to arrive in P16 or P17, no immediate new order is necessary to prevent excess inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. This SKU (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) has exited its Spring peak (Feb-March demand avg ~100) and settled into a stable late-Spring/early-Summer floor. Demand over the last 7 periods (P10-P16) has averaged 33.3 units/period, with the most recent two weeks showing 26 and 25 units respectively. I estimate the current demand regime at ~30 units/period. Regarding logistics, we have 508 units in transit, but 384 of these (orders from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost as they are now 12+ periods overdue. The only active, viable shipment is the P15 order of 124 units, which is expected to arrive soon (promised L=2). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is ~30, we have an immediate stockout. To correct for the OR backend's inability to 'realize' the 384 lost units, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average successful lead time (which has been 1-2 periods) and use an 'explicit' mu_hat to cover the current period plus the lead time (1+2=3 periods) at the current demand rate (~30 * 3 = 90). Using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=7 effectively covers the post-peak stability) will ensure the backend calculates a safety stock appropriate for the current lower volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which saw a significant demand peak in February/March (averaging ~100 units) and has since stabilized in a lower summer regime. Over the last 8 periods (since P10), demand has averaged approximately 34 units per period, with relatively low volatility. The 'in-transit' figure of 384 units is composed entirely of orders from P1, P3, and P4 which are confirmed lost according to historical carry-over. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. The order from P15 arrived in P17 (L=2), confirming that current logistics are functioning closer to the promised lead time of 2 periods. To maintain sufficient stock for the (L+1)=3 periods of demand against the current on-hand of 94 units, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent stable demand of ~34 units per period across the lead time window. Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this steady post-peak regime while ignoring the high-volume Spring outliers.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The SKU 688558002 (long-sleeved jersey top) has successfully transitioned into a stable post-Spring demand regime. Demand over the last 9 periods (since mid-April) has averaged 33.0 units per period (range 24-48), with the most recent four periods consistently near or below 30. The 'In-transit' figure of 384 units is comprised of three shipments (P1: 105, P3: 127, P4: 152) that are now over 14 periods old and are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base_stock calculation, the presence of these 'ghost units' will prevent the system from placing new orders if mu_hat is set too low. However, we have 70 units on-hand, which covers approximately 2 periods of current demand. To manage this safely, I will set mu_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture the current stable demand level (~33 * 3 = 99), and sigma_hat using the same N to reflect the lowered volatility. I am setting L to 2 (promised) as recent successful deliveries (P9, P15) arrived within 1-2 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for this jersey top has significantly cooled following the Spring peak, with the last 5 periods showing a stable mean of approximately 25 units/period (26, 25, 30, 24, 15). The logistics history reveals a pattern where shipments either arrive within 1-2 periods or are lost entirely. Currently, there are 384 units listed as 'In-transit' originating from Periods 1, 3, and 4; historical data and carry-over insights confirm these are lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is zero. With 55 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~25 per period, we have approximately 2 periods of coverage. Given the promised lead time (L=2) and current inventory, a small replenishment order is likely needed to ensure availability for Period 22/23. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable low-demand regime (avg ~26) and 'default' for lead time and sigma.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift significantly sustained: May-June avg is ~26 units/period compared to April's ~40 and Feb/Mar peak of ~100. Effective pipeline is zero as all 384 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1-4.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01. Demand has significantly declined from the Spring peak (~100+ units) to a stable summer low (~20-25 units/period over the last 5 weeks). The observed demand for P20 was only 12 units. The 'In-transit' count of 384 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4; thus, the real pipeline inventory is 0. Currently, 43 units are on-hand, which covers roughly 2 periods of current demand. Given a promised lead time of 2 and an actual lead time mostly around 2 for successful shipments, the base stock should targets enough inventory to cover the review period plus lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Using recent_N=5 captures the sustained lower demand regime while filtering out the volatile Spring peaks. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods to reflect this lower summer baseline.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed stable at ~21 units/period (average of P16-P20). Pre-existing lost shipment total (384 units) from P1-P4 remains stagnant in 'In-transit' and must be accounted for as zero effective pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The demand for product 688558002 (Jersey Top) has stabilized in a 'Summer low' regime. Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand has averaged 19.6 units per period, with a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 12. The on-hand inventory is 26 units, and the 384 units listed as 'In-transit' are the accumulated lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling exactly 384 units). These should be treated as non-existent for planning purposes. Because the existing 26 units cover roughly 1.3 periods of current demand and the lead time is 2 periods, an order is necessary to maintain service levels. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the low-demand summer baseline (~21 units/period) while ensuring mu_hat reflects the (1+L) periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low volatility.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688558002' (long-sleeved jersey top) is in a summer demand trough, with recent demand averaging ~21 units/period since Period 16. The most recent demand (P22) was 32 units, but the overall trend remains low. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 384 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4; because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline from the target base stock, it will not place a new order if it believes these units are still coming. To force an order and replenish the stock, I will use 'explicit' values. I set L=2 (promised). For mu_hat, I use (1+L) * average demand (~25), which equals 75. For sigma_hat, I provide a conservative estimate based on recent volatility. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to overcome the 'fake' 384-unit pipeline and place a replenishment order for the current 0 on-hand situation.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The SKU is a long-sleeved jersey top, which experienced peak demand in Feb/Mar (~100 units/period) and has since transitioned into a stable summer demand regime averaging ~21 units/period (P16-P23 avg is ~22). The 'In-transit' total of 481 units is misleading: 384 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. The actual pipeline contains only the 97 units ordered in Period 23. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Given the lead time fluctuates (P9 arrived in 1, P15 in 2), I will use the promised lead time of 2 for L. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the stable low-demand summer regime (P16-P23), ensuring the base stock calculation reflects current ~20 units/period levels rather than historical peaks or the stockouts in early July. This configuration allows the OR backend to properly size an order to replenish stock after the recent stockout while accounting for the small valid pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/29. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is currently in its low Summer demand regime. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 20 units/period (12, 17, 32, 20, 17). There are 481 units currently 'In-transit', but historical evidence starting from Period 5 confirms that 384 units (from orders in P1, P3, and P4) are permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 97 units (ordered in P23). With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the P23 order is expected to arrive during the current period (P25) and become visible in P26. Since on-hand is 0 and demand is stable at ~20 units, I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of this current regime. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the steady Summer sales and ignore the high-variance Spring peak. Lead time defaults to the promised 2 periods, as recent successful shipments (P9, P15) delivered in 1-2 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2018 (Period 26). The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is entering its seasonal trough during the summer. Historical demand has consistently declined from a peak of ~100 units/period in Feb/March to an average of ~18 units/period over the last five weeks (P21-P25). Most importantly, the logistics monitoring shows a systemic failure: shipments from P1 (105), P3 (127), and P4 (152) never arrived and are confirmed lost (totaling 384 units). Additionally, the order placed in P23 (97 units) has now exceeded its promised 2-period lead time (P23 order should have arrived in P25 arrival phase, visible in P26 START), suggesting it too may be lost or significantly delayed. The current 'In-transit' of 481 exactly matches the sum of these missing shipments (384 + 97). Consequently, effective pipeline inventory is zero. Since on-hand inventory is also 0, we must order to cover the current low-demand regime (~18 units/period). I will set mu_hat to reflect this current regime and an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the reliability issues, effectively triggering an order despite the phantom in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed total of 481 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P23) are effectively lost or non-responsive, as all have exceeded promised lead times significantly. Summer demand regime (July-August) remains low, averaging ~18 units/period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in a stable Summer demand regime for this long-sleeved jersey top, which is currently out of season. Demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) has averaged ~21.4 units/period, consistent with previous observations. Regarding logistics, the order from Period 23 arrived in Period 26 (actual lead time = 3), slightly longer than the promised 2 periods. The 'In-transit' count of 384 units consists entirely of lost shipments from early periods (P1, P3, P4) and should be treated as zero effective pipeline. Our current on-hand inventory is 70 units, which covers approximately 3.2 periods of current demand. With a lead time of 2-3 periods, we are currently adequately stocked. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed delivery times and use a 'recent_N' of 10 for demand to capture the stable post-Spring trend while excluding the high-demand February/March peaks.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August, approaching the Fall season for this long-sleeved jersey top. Recent demand in Period 27 spiked to 56 units, more than double the Summer average (~18-20 units), suggesting the start of an Autumn regime shift. On-hand inventory is 14. The 'In-transit' quantity of 384 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (105+127+152), which are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. With a promised lead time of 2 and an actual lead time recently observed as 3 (Period 23 order), I must account for this volatility. To prevent stockouts during this emerging demand spike, I am using an explicit mu_hat based on the most recent demand (56 units) and a lead time of 2 (conservative, but backend handles safety stock). I will set mu_hat to (1+2)*56 = 168 and sigma_hat explicitly to handle the regime transition volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 27: Late August demand increased from ~18 to 56 (+200%), signaling the start of Fall seasonality for this long-sleeved product.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 29 (late August/early September). Demand for this long-sleeved jersey top has spiked from a summer low of ~18 units/period to an average of 54 units/period over the last two weeks (56 and 52 respectively), signaling the start of the Fall seasonal regime. Historically, this product saw its highest demand in Feb/March (~100 units), and we expect a similar upward trend as the weather cools. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 384 units consists entirely of orders from P1, P3, and P4 which were confirmed lost months ago; therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. Logistics are typically 2 periods but show high variance. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture this new Fall uptick while remaining cautious of over-ordering before further confirmation. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to account for historical variance.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonality confirmed: Demand increased to ~54 units/period in late August (P27-P28), up from ~18 in July. Note that the 384 units in-transit are confirmed lost from P1-P4 and should be treated as zero when considering inventory coverage.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is entering its Fall seasonal peak as of late August (Period 27). Demand surged from a Summer low of ~18 units/period to an average of ~47 units over the last three periods (P27-P29). We are currently at zero on-hand inventory and out of stock. The 384 units in-transit are verified lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (Feb/March) and must be treated as zero pipeline inventory to trigger a new order. For Period 30, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 165 units to cover (L+1)=3 periods of the new Fall demand regime (approx 55 units/period), and an explicit sigma_hat to account for historical variance during seasonal transitions. Lead time is set to default (2), but I will monitor for the binary 'arrive or lost' behavior seen previously.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonality confirmed: Demand increased to ~47 units/period avg (P27-P29), up from ~18 in July. In-transit balance of 384 units consists of confirmed lost orders from P1-P4 and should be considered zero when calculating pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Brittany LS' (long-sleeved top) has entered a clear Fall seasonal upturn starting around Period 27. Demand in Periods 27-30 averaged 55 units/period (56, 52, 32, 80), significantly higher than the Summer average of ~18. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' balance of 384 units consists entirely of orders from P1, P3, and P4 which are confirmed lost (as noted in long-standing carry-over insights); therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. To satisfy the new demand regime and rebuild inventory, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the Fall trend. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 2, as recent successful deliveries (P9, P15, P23) arrived within 1-3 periods, while the 'lost' shipments appear to be a binary failure mode rather than a shift in mean lead time.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/16. The demand history confirms a significant Fall seasonality shift for this 'Fitted, long-sleeved top'. Demand has surged from a July-August summer average of ~18 units/period to 80 units in Period 30 and 152 units in Period 31. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P29-P31) is 88 units. This strongly mirrors the Spring peak observed in Feb/Mar, which reached levels over 100 units. Regarding logistics, on-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit total of 384 units corresponds to orders from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost; they have been in-transit for over 25 periods. I will set the Lead Time (L) to 'calculate' to capture the variability between 1-3 periods seen in successful deliveries (P9, P15, P23). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to specifically weight the late-August/September surge (approx 88 units/period), as 'default' or larger N would be diluted by the summer lull. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' for N=5 to capture the high volatility associated with the seasonal onset.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonality fully confirmed at Period 31: Demand spiked to 152 units, following a trend of 52, 32, 80 (avg P28-P31 = 79), signaling a high-demand regime for long-sleeved products in September.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688558002' (long-sleeved jersey top) has entered a high-demand Fall seasonality phase as of early September. Demand has surged significantly: Period 31 (152) and Period 32 (153) show a massive increase compared to the August average (~50) and July average (~18). We are currently at zero on-hand inventory and have missed substantial sales in the last two periods. The 'In-transit' balance of 384 units is comprised of orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4, which are long-confirmed lost (as noted in multiple carry-over insights); thus, the effective pipeline is zero. To capture the current Fall regime and account for the high cost of stockouts relative to holding cost (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5: Periods 28-32) which capture the ramp-up from 52 to 153. This results in a mean of ~94 units per period. With L=2, mu_hat becomes (1+2)*94 = 282. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this seasonal spike. Lead time is kept at 'calculate' to use historical arrival data while acknowledging the binary risk of loss.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-demand regime confirmed: September demand averaged ~152 units/period (P31-P32), a +200% increase over late August (~50). Effective pipeline remains zero despite 'In-transit' reflecting 384 lost units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the long-sleeved jersey top (SKU 688558002) has exploded in September, with Period 33 demand reaching 522 units. This represents a massive seasonal peak for the Fall season, following an already high trend (152, 153). I am currently at zero on-hand inventory and the 'In-transit' balance of 384 units is comprised entirely of confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 to Period 4. Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. To address this massive demand spike and the stockout situation, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value based on the most recent high-demand observations (averaging P31-P33 gives ~275 units/period, but targeting the high end of 350 to ensure coverage given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio). I keep L at the promised 2 periods as recent successful arrivals (P23) occurred within close range (L=3), while older shipments were binary losses rather than just delayed. I use an explicit sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility seen in the jump from ~150 to ~500 units.

Carry-over insight: Massive Fall seasonal peak confirmed: September demand spiked to 522 units at Period 33, increasing the recent 3-period average to ~275 units/period. The 384 units in-transit are confirmed lost from early periods and must continue to be ignored in ordering calculations.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak Fall season for long-sleeved tops (October). Historical data shows demand spiked dramatically from ~50 (late August) to over 500 (late September), with the most recent sample at 192 indicating the peak remains active. The recent 4-period average (P31-P34) is approximately 255 units/period. Logistics reliability is a major concern: orders from P1, P3, and P4 (384 units total) are confirmed lost, as are likely any units older than lead time + 3. Currently, 635 units were ordered in P34 and are in-transit; however, given the on-hand is 0 and demand is high, we must ensure parameters cover the current demand regime. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the high-demand Fall regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default L (2) as recent successfully delivered orders (P9, P15, P23) arrived within 1-3 periods. The OR engine will subtract the 1019 in-transit units from the base stock. Note that 384 of these are confirmed lost, which effectively lowers the pipeline, but since 635 units were just ordered in P34, the system should still maintain a healthy order flow once those 635 units are discounted from the base stock calculation.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the middle of a massive Fall seasonality peak for 'Brittany LS' (long-sleeved jersey top). Demand spiked from late August (~50 units) to a peak of 522 units in September (Period 33), and has since begun to stabilize/descend slightly (192 in P34, 130 in P35). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 229.8 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1026 units includes 384 units from P1-P4 and 97 units from P23 that are definitively lost or unfulfillable, totaling 481 lost units. The effective pipeline consists only of the P34 order (635 units) and the P35 order (7 units), totaling 642 units. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the P34 order (635 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P36), which will satisfy the zero on-hand situation. To maintain service levels during this high-demand but volatile regime, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (approx 230 units) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in September. Lead time is set to default (2) as recent fulfillments (P9, P15, P23) suggest variability around the 1-3 period mark, but no consistent extension.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonality peak peaked in Period 33 (522 units); current demand regime (P31-P35) averages ~230 units/period. Total of 481 units in-transit from P1-P23 are confirmed lost and must be ignored for pipeline calculations.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in the Fall high-demand regime for this long-sleeved jersey top. Recent demand (P31-P36) has been extremely high: 152, 153, 522, 192, 130, 105. Excluding the P33 outlier (522), the average is approximately 146 units/period. The 'In-transit' balance of 1019 units is largely misleading: 481 units are confirmed lost from P1-P23. The remaining 538 units consist of an order from P34 (635 units) minus the 97 units that arrived in P26. We expect the 635 units from P34 to arrive soon (it's been 2 periods). To maintain stock for the next (L+1) periods, I will set mu_hat based on the recent average demand of ~146 units/period. Over (2+1) periods, this is 438 units. Since on-hand is 0 and effective pipeline is only the 635 from P34 (which is already above our target of 438), the OR engine should technically not order more, but given the high loss rate, I will use recent demand trends to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to trigger replenishment if more shipments are lost.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (Sep-Oct) stabilized at ~146 units/period (excluding P33 spike). Logistics reliability remains very low with ~47% of historical 'In-transit' units confirmed lost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688558002' (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) is in its Fall high-demand regime. Demand since Period 34 (excluding the P33 spike) has stabilized between 105-192 units. Specifically, the last three periods (P35-P37) show demand of 130, 105, and 123, averaging 119.3 units. In-transit inventory is high (1019 units), but history shows significant delivery risks. Specifically, 481 units from P1-P23 are confirmed lost. The 635 units ordered in P34 (4 periods ago) have not yet arrived, exceeding the promised L=2, but it is too early to declare them lost given recent observed lead times of 1-3 periods. I will treat the P34 order (635 units) as the active pipeline to avoid massive over-ordering while ignoring the 481 historical lost units. For mu_hat, I use recent_N=4 to capture the post-spike Fall stabilization (avg ~137.5). For sigma_hat, recent_N=4 reflects current volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to account for historical variability in arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (post-September spike) stabilized at ~119 units/period (avg P35-P37). Delivery reliability remains the primary constraint: P34 order (635 units) is now overdue (L > 3).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are in the late Fall season for this long-sleeved jersey top. Demand has stabilized post-September peak (522 units), with the last three periods (P36-P38) averaging ~128 units/period (105, 123, 156). Inventory is currently zero on-hand. The total 'In-transit' of 1019 units is critically unreliable: 481 units (from P1, P3, P4, P23) are confirmed lost, and the large P34 order of 635 units is now overdue (ordered P34, today is P39 START, so it has exceeded L=4). However, the P35 order of 7 units arrived with L=1, indicating that while large shipments are failing or delayed, the logistics channel is not completely closed. Given the high demand and zero stock, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the current Fall regime (~128 units/period) and L=2 to encourage the OR engine to place a recovery order despite the 'phantom' pipeline. This will help bridge the gap created by the likely lost or severely delayed P34 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-demand regime (post-September spike) confirmed stable at ~128 units/period (avg P36-P38). Logistics reliability remains critical: P34 order (635 units) is now overdue (L > 4) and joins the 481 units from P1-P23 as potentially lost pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the middle of November (Period 40). Historical data for this long-sleeved jersey top (688558002) indicates a Significant Fall seasonality peak in September and October. The current demand regime (P34-P39) averages approximately 131 units per period, showing relative stability after the massive September 23rd spike. Logistics reliability remains the primary challenge: the 'In-transit' balance of 1019 units is largely comprised of confirmed lost orders (481 units from P1-P23) and a highly suspect overdue order from P34 (635 units), which has now exceeded the promised lead time by 3 periods (L=5). Since actual effective pipeline is zero and on-hand is zero, we must order to cover the current demand regime. I am setting L to the promised 2 periods (as recent arrivals P35-P36 came in 1 period, suggesting some stability for small orders), and mu_hat to 393 units (based on a 3nd-period demand average of ~131 * (1+L)) to attempt to capture remaining Fall demand while accounting for the high risk of stockouts during this delivery crisis.

Carry-over insight: P34 order (635 units) is now 3 periods overdue (L > 5), making it highly likely to be lost alongside the 481 units from P1-P23. Total estimated lost pipeline: 1116 units. Only small orders (P35 for 7 units) are currently arriving reliably.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688558002' (long-sleeved jersey top) is in its Fall/Early Winter high-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 111 units/period over the last four periods (P37-P40: 123, 156, 79, 96). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the In-transit balance of 1,019 units is composed entirely of shipments that are significantly overdue and likely lost (P1, P3, P4 total 384; P23 total 97; P34 total 635 - ordered in Sep, now 7 periods ago). Since the OR backend uses a pipeline inventory deduction logic (base_stock - pipeline), including these lost units prevents the system from placing new orders. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (1+L=3) while also 'adding back' the volume of the lost 1,019 units. This ensures the backend's calculation (base_stock - 1019) results in a meaningful replenishment order. I am using L=2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering, as reliability is binary (either arrives fast or not at all). mu_hat calculation: (3 periods * 115 units/period) + 1019 lost = 1364.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Lost shipment total updated to 1,116 units (P1-P23: 481 units; P34: 635 units), as P34 has now exceeded promised lead time by 5+ periods. Effective pipeline is zero.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. This SKU (long-sleeved jersey top) is in its Fall/Holiday demand regime. While there was a massive spike in September (Period 33 demand: 522), the recent demand (P37-P41) has stabilized around an average of ~105 units per period. The supply chain remains highly unreliable; the 'In-transit' balance of 1407 units is primarily composed of confirmed or highly likely lost shipments (P1: 105, P3: 127, P4: 152, P34: 635), totaling 1019 units. Subtracting these from the 1407 'In-transit' leaves an effective pipeline of 388 units (the order placed in P41). To ensure we meet stabilized Fall demand and account for the high loss rate, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the post-spike stabilization) and using an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the frequent delays observed in the history, even though the promised lead time is 2.

Carry-over insight: Stabilized Fall demand regime confirmed (P37-P41): average ~105 units/period. Effective pipeline risk: 1019 units in-transit are likely lost (P1, P3, P4, P34).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/02. We are in the late Fall/early Winter demand regime. Recent demand has shown significant volatility: P42 saw a massive spike to 310 units, whereas the previous 5 periods (P37-P41) averaged ~105 units. This spike suggests a pre-holiday surge. The logistics situation remains critical: 'In-transit' shows 1407 units, but analysis of history confirms that 1019 of these (P1, P3, P4, P34) are almost certainly lost. Only the P41 order of 388 units is realistically expected. Given the P42 spike (310), the 388 units in the 'real' pipeline (plus any new order) must cover the lead time (L=2) plus the review period. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 450 to account for potentially sustained high demand and to compensate for the fact that the backend OR engine sees the 1019 lost units as 'valid' pipeline, which would otherwise prevent it from ordering enough. By using an explicit mu_hat and keeping L=2, I aim to force a base stock high enough to trigger an order that offsets the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand surged to 310 units, a ~200% increase over the previous 5-period average (~105), signaling the start of December holiday shopping. Effective lost inventory is now 1,019 units (P1, P3, P4, P34).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 310 units, while Period 43 was 49 units. This indicates high volatility typical of December. I am forecasting based on the recent holiday regime (P42-P43 average ~180 units/period). Regarding logistics, out of 1019 units 'In-transit', 384 units (P1, P3, P4) and 635 units (P34) are confirmed lost, as they have exceeded promised lead times by 10+ and 5+ periods respectively. The only reliable recent shipment arrived in 2 periods (P41 order). To account for the 1019 phantom units in the OR engine's pipeline calculation (which would otherwise prevent it from ordering), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or explicitly manage the gap. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base_stock, and the pipeline is artificially inflated by 1019 lost units, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate (1+L) periods of demand at ~180/period plus a buffer for the 1019 lost units. Target base stock = (3 periods * 180) + 1019 lost units \u2248 1559. Setting mu_hat to 1559 ensures the engine sees enough 'demand' to cover both the upcoming periods and the inventory hole left by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (Dec) shows high volatility: P42 (310) vs P43 (49). Average demand for peak season estimated at 180 units/period. Total lost shipment count confirmed at 1019 units (P1, P3, P4, P34), which must be manually offset in base_stock parameters to counter the 'In-transit' figure.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing holiday-driven demand for this long-sleeved jersey top. Recent demand has shown volatility (P42: 310, P43: 49, P44: 58). I set mu_hat based on the average since the late-August Fall shift (P27 onwards, skipping the extreme P33 outlier), which aligns with the observed demand of ~115 units/period. Logistics remain the primary challenge. The 'In-transit' figure of 1431 units is highly misleading: 1019 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P34), and the P44 order of 412 units is newly placed. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet current demand without being suppressed by phantom 'In-transit' inventory, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. This value (960) is calculated to cover approximately 3 periods of demand (L+1) plus an buffer of ~615 units to neutralize the 'ghost' pipeline from P34 (635 units), which the backend otherwise subtracts from the order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (Dec) average demand including baseline and surges is approximately 115 units/period. Total phantom pipeline (confirmed lost but still in-transit) is 1,019 units (P1, P3, P4, P34).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late December holiday period (Period 46). Recent demand has stabilized significantly after the late November/early December volatility, with the last 3 periods averaging 54 units (55, 58, 49). This is a sharp downshift from the early December peak (310), reflecting typical post-peak stabilization for apparel. Logistics reliability remains a major concern: out of the 1431 units 'in-transit', 1019 units are confirmed lost (from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 34) as they are 5+ periods overdue. The only valid pipeline units are from the Period 44 order (412 units), which are expected for Period 46 or 47 resolution. To account for the 1019 'phantom' units that the OR backend incorrectly sees as incoming stock, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that adds this lost volume to the required base stock. Current estimated demand (mu) for (1+L=3 periods) is ~162 units (54 * 3). Adding the 1019 lost units to the base stock target ensures the OR motor places an order despite the inflated in-transit figure. Formula: (Recent Average * (1+L)) + Lost Units = (54 * 3) + 1019 = 1181. Sigma_hat is set to cover the high variance of the holiday month.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Late Dec demand settled at ~54 units/period (P43-P45), significantly lower than the P42 spike. Total phantom pipeline (confirmed lost) remains 1,019 units (P1, P3, P4, P34).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), the holiday peak has subsided. Demand over the last three periods (P44-P46) has stabilized at an average of 49.3 units/period (58, 55, 35), signaling a post-holiday trough. Logistics remain characterized by a 'binary' failure/success pattern: 1116 units (from P1, P3, P4, P34) are confirmed lost, and an additional 127 units from P3 (part of the 1116) are clearly gone. Comparing the current 'In-transit' of 1431 units against known lost shipments (1116) plus the recent P44 order (412), we see the pipeline is largely artificial. Specifically: 1431 (In-transit) - 412 (P44 order) = 1019 units, which matches the carry-over total for lost units from P1-P34. Therefore, the ONLY valid pipeline inventory is the 412 units ordered in P44. With 191 units on hand and 412 in transit, coverage is ~603 units, which is roughly 12 periods of demand at current rates (49.3/wk). I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 250 (approx 5 periods of demand) to ensure no new orders are placed until the current glut is cleared, effectively ignoring the phantom 'In-transit' mass while acknowledging we have plenty of physical stock for the Jan/Feb low season.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand downshift: Late Dec demand (P44-P46) averaged ~49 units/period. Continuous monitoring of 1019 units of phantom pipeline (P1, P3, P4, P34) is required as they remain in 'In-transit' indefinitely.
