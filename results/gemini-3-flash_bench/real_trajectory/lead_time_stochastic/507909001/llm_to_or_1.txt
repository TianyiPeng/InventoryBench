Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a women's tailored shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows values: 80, 144, 194, 176, 129. This suggests a mean of ~144.6 and a standard deviation of ~45. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since there is no on-hand or in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock to cover demand during the review period plus lead time (1+L = 3 periods). Given the seasonal context (approaching spring), demand for blouses/shirts often stabilizes or increases slightly. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current demand regime. L is set to 'default' (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period (2019-02-11) showed a demand of 250 units, which significantly exceeds the initial historical samples (mean ~145). The product is a women's tailored shirt, and mid-February often marks the start of the spring transition in retail. The initial order of 218 units placed in Period 1 is in-transit (promised L=2), and on-hand is currently 0. Since we have a stockout and a demand spike, I need to adjust the forecast. Given the historical samples (80, 144, 194, 176, 129) plus the recent Period 1 demand (250), there is a clear upward trend. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this shift towards 200+ units per week while acknowledging the variance. Lead time is kept at 'default' as we haven't seen any arrivals to suggest a deviation from the promised 2 periods yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's tailored blouse. Historical data from Jan/Feb shows demand rising (80 to 194). In Period 1 and 2, demand spiked significantly (250 and 454), likely due to seasonal spring fashion trends or workwear demand. Promised lead time is 2, so the Period 1 order (218 units) should arrive in Period 3 (current) and the Period 2 order (286 units) should arrive in Period 4. Total in-transit is 504. Current on-hand is 0, meaning we have stocked out for two periods with 704 units of lost sales. I am using recent_N=3 for the demand forecast to capture this recent spike (average demand ~359). I'll use the default promised lead time of 2. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: Mean weekly demand increased from ~145 to ~350 (+140%) likely due to spring seasonality for women's blouses.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 1 (2019-02-11), with weekly demand values of 250, 454, and 312 (avg ~338), compared to the pre-game average of ~145. This matches the 'spring seasonality' insight for women's blouses. Regarding lead time: the promised lead time (L) is 2. The order from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) is expected to arrive during Period 3 (Feb 25) and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Consequently, I am increasing L to 3 to account for this delay and using a recent 3-period window (N=3) for demand to capture the current high-demand regime. The large in-transit balance (1052 units) includes the orders from P1, P2, and P3; adjusting L to 3 prevents the OR engine from over-ordering while waiting for these arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time delay observed: Period 1 order (promised L=2) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude, suggesting actual L >= 3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The historical data shows a demand surge starting in Period 1 (late Feb), aligning with spring seasonality for women's blouses. Demand for the last 4 periods averaged 307.5, which is significantly higher than the pre-Feb mean of 145. In Period 4 conclude, we received confirmation that the Period 2 order arrived with Lead Time = 2 (standard). However, the Period 1 order is now significantly overdue (placed in P1, should have arrived in P3, still not arrived in P5). This suggests the P1 shipment (218 units) may be lost. For safety, I will assume L=2 for new orders but set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current high-demand regime (~310/week) over the (L+1)=3 week horizon. I will use a conservative sigma_hat based on recent volatility to prevent further stockouts while waiting for the large pipeline (1245 units) to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Shipping anomaly confirmed. Order placed in Period 1 (218 units) is officially 2 periods overdue and likely lost, while the Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019-03-18), inventory is critical (0 on-hand). Historical analysis shows a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 2 (mean ~280 units/week), while pre-game historical samples were much lower (~145 units/week). The Period 1 order (218 units) is now 3 periods overdue and highly likely lost; however, the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2), suggesting the lead time remains 2 but logistics are unreliable. Current 'In-transit' of 1245 units includes Period 3 (548) and Period 4 (479) orders plus the presumed lost Period 1 order. To prevent stockouts during this spring season for blouses, I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand forecast to capture the higher mean observed since Period 2. I will stick to the promised Lead Time (L=2) as 'default' since Period 2 arrived on time, but use a slightly higher mu_hat to ensure the base stock is robust against the lost Period 1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 1 shipment (218 units) lost; In-transit counts are inflated. Weekly demand mean since Feb 18 settled at ~290 per week, significantly above earlier levels.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand history since the regime shift on Feb 18 (Date: 2019/2/18) consists of 454, 312, 214, 190, and 173 units. The mean demand for these 5 periods is approximately 268 units/week, though there is a clear downward trend from the initial spike. We will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this post-shift behavior for mu_hat. The lead time analysis confirms L=2 for the only successful delivery (Period 2 order), while the Period 1 order is definitively lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 1245, but this includes the 218 lost units and the 548 units ordered in Period 3 (which are now L=4 periods from order date and potentially delayed or lost as they should have arrived in Period 5 or 6). To protect against stockouts given the zero on-hand balance and questionable pipeline, we maintain L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods to ensure the base stock calculation is responsive to the current seasonal volume (Spring blouses).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high following the Feb shift; the last 5 periods (mean 268) suggest the initial spike is tapering but remains 80% higher than Jan levels. Period 3 order (548 units) is now overdue (L=4 vs promised L=2).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), we are managing a stretch cotton blouse. Demand spiked in Feb/March (mean ~250-450) but has stabilized recently. Mean demand of the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is ~208 units, which is lower than the initial spike but significantly higher than Jan. Current on-hand is 0, and we have a critical supply chain issue: In-transit is 1245 units, but history suggests major disruptions. Specifically: P1 order (218) is long-lost; P3 order (548) is now 3 periods overdue (L=5+). P4 order (479) is also overdue (L=4 vs promised 2). Only P2 arrived correctly at L=2. Because the OR backend uses 'in-transit' to calculate orders (order = base_stock - in-transit), the 1245 units in-transit (which likely includes at least 766 lost/severely delayed units) will prevent the system from ordering. I will use 'explicit' L=5 to reflect the current supply reality and 'explicit' mu_hat based on the recent stable mean (~210) across the 5-period lead time window to force a higher base stock. Since the OR engine's 'cap' and 'order' logic subtracts the full pipeline, and 1245 is very high, I must ensure mu_hat represents the total inventory needed to cover the extended lead time effectively, even if the backend is blinded to lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: Period 3 order (548 units) and Period 4 order (479 units) are both significantly overdue (L=5 and L=4 respectively), following the confirmed loss of the Period 1 shipment. Mean demand since early March has stabilized around 210 units/week.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the SKU remains out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. The supply chain is experiencing significant disruptions: the P1 order (218 units) is lost, while the P3 (548 units) and P4 (479 units) orders are severely delayed at L=6 and L=5 respectively (promised L=2). Since only the P2 order arrived on schedule, the 'calculate' or 'recent_N' methods for lead time would be skewed by the missing data. I am setting L=4 explicitly to reflect this increased risk and to force the OR backend to increase the coverage window. Demand remains highly volatile but elevated compared to January; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is approximately 237 units/week. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this recent average (forecasted over L+1 periods) and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the high variance (ranging from 173 to 354 in that window). The high in-transit number (1375) includes the lost P1 order and the heavily delayed P3/P4 orders, which the OR engine will subtract from the base stock. By increasing L to 4, I increase the base stock target to ensure that once shipments resume, the order quantity is sufficient to cover the extended lead time and refill the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Period 3 and Period 4 orders are now substantially overdue (L=6 and L=5 respectively), indicating a shift in reliable lead time from 2 to 4+ periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507909001' (Womens Blouse) is in a high-demand spring regime with significant supply chain disruptions. The Period 1 order (218) is lost. Orders from Period 3 (548 units) and Period 4 (479 units) are now overdue by 5 and 4 periods respectively (promised L=2), confirming that the actual lead time is currently at least 4-5 periods, or those shipments are also lost. Demand since Feb 11 (the spring shift) has averaged ~264 units/week, though recent weeks show high volatility (354 in P8 vs 147 in P9). Since we are at '0' on-hand inventory and the 'in-transit' figure of 1375 includes known overdue/likely lost shipments (218 from P1, and potentially P3/P4), the OR engine must be steered to place orders assuming a longer lead time. I am setting L to 4 to account for the observed delays and using recent_N for demand to capture the stabilized spring average of the last 9 periods (post-January base).

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: multiple orders (P3, P4) are now overdue by 3+ periods relative to promise, suggesting actual L is 5 or shipments are being lost sequentially.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Product: Women's Blouse. The supply chain for this SKU is highly unreliable. Current status: On-hand is 0. Period 10 conclude confirms that the Period 8 order arrived with L=2, but critically, orders from Period 3 (548 units) and Period 4 (479 units) have still not arrived and are now 8 and 7 periods overdue respectively. These are almost certainly lost given that more recent orders have arrived. The OR backend's Pipeline Inventory includes these 'ghost' units, which prevents it from ordering new stock. Since on-hand is 0 and we are missing demand, I must force L to a higher value to account for the risk and set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the 'In-transit' bloat. Demand mean over the last 5 periods is approximately 230. Since we are in the middle of spring (peak season for blouses), I will set mu_hat to (L+1) * 230 to ensure the backend attempts to restore inventory despite the stale pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Sequential shipment failure confirmed: Period 3 and Period 4 orders (1027 units total) are 7+ periods overdue and confirmed lost, as the Period 8 order arrived successfully with L=2.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/4/29), we face a significant inventory shortage (on-hand = 0). History shows a pattern of lost shipments: Period 1, Period 3 (548 units), and Period 4 (479 units) are all confirmed lost or 7+ periods overdue, given that orders from Period 2 and Period 8 arrived exactly on time (L=2). This indicates that while the reliability of delivery is poor, the 'promised' L=2 remains the actual lead time for successful shipments. My goal is to replenish stock while accounting for these lost units which the OR backend still counts in 'pipeline inventory'. Since the OR engine subtracts 'in-transit' (currently 1360, but ~1027 are lost from P3 and P4), I must set an 'explicit' mu_hat that is high enough to offset these 'phantom' units and trigger a new order. Demand has stabilized post-spike, with the last 4 periods averaging ~214 units. I will use a conservative mu_hat based on L=2 (meaning demand for 3 periods) at a rate of 250 units/period (750 total) plus the ~1000 lost units to force the OR backend to order replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Sequential shipment loss confirmed for P3 and P4 (1027 units total); the pipeline inventory remains artificially high as these will never arrive. Lead time for successful deliveries remains stable at L=2.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/5/6), the SKU 507909001 (Women's blouse) remains out of stock (on-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory (1979) is heavily distorted by lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 1245 units) which haven't arrived despite much later orders (P2, P8) arriving with a standard lead time of L=2. The OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation will subtract these ghost units, preventing new orders unless parameters are adjusted. Lead time for successful shipments is confirmed at L=2 (Promised), but I will use L=explicit (2) to stabilize the logic. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5-week mean (P8-P12) is ~199 units/week, down from the February peak. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-peak demand regime. To bypass the 'pipeline_inventory' issue caused by lost shipments, mu_hat must be set to cover the desired base stock plus the volume of lost shipments (~1300 units), but since I cannot directly subtract from pipeline in this interface, I use an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as: [(1+L) * mean_demand] + lost_units = [3 * 200] + 1245 \u2248 1845. This ensures the OR engine places a meaningful order despite the phantom inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's blouse (stretch cotton blend shirt). We are currently in mid-May (2019/5/13). Historically, demand spiked in late Feb/early March (peaking at 454) but has since cooled. Demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has averaged 141 units/week (147, 218, 140, 148, 112). This indicates the seasonal peak has passed. Regarding the supply chain, orders from P1 (218), P3 (548), and P4 (479) are confirmed lost (total 1,245 units), as subsequent orders from P2 and P8 arrived with the promised lead time of L=2. The current 'In-transit' of 1979 units is severely inflated by these 1,245 lost units; the 'true' pipeline is approximately 734 units (P10=115 + P12=619). Since the OR backend cannot distinguish between lost and active shipments, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to force an order that compensates for the inventory deficit while the pipeline inventory is high. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat targets (1+L)=3 periods of demand. Using the recent mean of ~145 units/week, 3 * 145 = 435 units. However, because the backend subtracts 1979 (pipeline) from the base stock, a standard formula will result in 0 orders. Note: In-hand is 0. I will set mu_hat to a value that overrides the phantom pipeline to ensure we replenishment based on an expected demand of ~145.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), the demand for this women's tailored blouse has significantly cooled from the spring peak (~350 units in Feb) to a more stable pre-summer average (~115 units over the last 3 periods). The supply chain situation is critical: shipments from Period 1 (218 units), Period 3 (548 units), and Period 4 (479 units) are significantly overdue (L=14, L=12, L=11 respectively) and are confirmed lost based on the successful arrival of the Period 12 order on time (L=2). These lost shipments (totaling 1,245 units) are incorrectly inflating 'In-transit' inventory to 1,839 units. The actual active pipeline is only the Period 14 order (479 units) and the new order from Period 10 (115 units, though this may have arrived but hasn't updated in the view yet). With on-hand inventory at 533 units and demand dropping, the priority is to stop ordering to clear existing stock and ignore the phantom pipeline inventory. I will set L to 2 (stable for successful shipments) and use recent_N (N=4) to capture the lower demand regime (avg ~120), where (1+L) * 120 = 360 for mu_hat. This will result in no new orders as the OR backend will see 'In-transit' (1839) + 'On-hand' (533) far exceeding the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Demand cooled significantly from previous highs to ~115 units/week. Lead time is confirmed L=2 for successful deliveries, despite legacy 'In-transit' units representing confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 1,245 units).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/27. Demand has significantly cooled since mid-May, with the last three periods showing 112, 86, and 97 units (mean ~98). This suggests a post-spring stabilization regime. Lead time for successful deliveries remains stable at L=2. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 1839 is misleading because 1,245 units from Period 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost (as documented in Carry-over Insights). Subtracting these lost units, the effective pipeline is 594 units (479 units from Period 14 arriving next period, and 115 from Period 10 that arrived/concluded previously but likely includes smaller recent orders). On-hand inventory is 436 units. With a demand forecast of ~100 units/week and a lead time of 2, we need to cover (2+1)=3 periods of demand (~300 units). As on-hand inventory (436) already exceeds this, no new order is needed. I will set L to 'default' (2) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=3) to reflect the cooled demand regime, allowing the OR engine to naturally hold ordering until inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at Period 16: Mean weekly demand for 'Gently tailored shirt' has settled at ~100 units (down from ~250-300 in spring).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507909001 (Gently tailored shirt) has stabilized as we approach the summer months, with a clear cooling trend since mid-May. The current demand regime (last 3 periods) shows a mean of approximately 82 units (86, 97, 64), reaching a significantly lower level than the spring peak of ~250-300. Lead time remains confirmed at L=2 for reachable inventory, as proven by the on-time arrivals of orders from Periods 8 and 12. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 1839 units is misleading; it includes 1,245 confirmed lost units from Periods 1, 3, and 4, and 479 units from Period 14 which are expected to arrive in Period 17's arrival phase (after this decision). With 372 units on-hand and 479 units arriving shortly, our available stock (851 units) is more than sufficient to cover 10+ weeks of the current 82-unit weekly demand. My objective is to prevent further accumulation of stock and minimize holding costs while demand is low. By setting L to explicit 2 and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=3), the OR backend will calculate a base stock level well below our current physical plus valid in-transit inventory, resulting in no new order being placed.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for the 'Gently tailored shirt' has stabilized into a lower summer regime following a spring peak. Recent demand samples (Periods 14-17) are 86, 97, 64, and 189, yielding an average of ~109 units. While the Period 17 demand of 189 is an uptick, it follows a very low 64, suggesting typical retail volatility rather than a structural regime shift back to spring levels (~250+). Lead time for successfully delivered orders (P8, P12) is consistent at L=2. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1839 units is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (218), Period 3 (548), Period 4 (479), and now likely Period 14 (479), which is overdue (ordered P14, promised for P16 conclude, currently P18 start with no arrival). This totals 1,724 lost units. I will use 'explicit' L=2 to ignore these ghosts and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand level while accounting for the recent P17 volatility. On-hand inventory (183) provides about 1.5 weeks of coverage, necessitating a small replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Shipment from Period 14 (479 units) is confirmed lost/overdue (L=4 vs promised L=2); total cumulative lost 'In-transit' units reach 1,724. Demand remains in the stabilized summer regime (~110 units/week).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Gently tailored shirt' has stabilized into a lower summer regime. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 14-18), demand has averaged 122 units/week (86, 97, 64, 189, 176). The spike in the most recent two periods (189, 176) suggests a slight uptick but remains well below the spring peaks of 300+. The 'In-transit' count of 1839 is extremely inflated due to confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1 (218), 3 (548), 4 (479), and now 14 (479), totaling 1,724 lost units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 115 units (ordered Period 10, arrived Period 10; actually the current in-transit is likely 1839 - 1724 = 115 if we assume those are the Period 10 units that somehow stayed in transit, or more likely, the system is tracking ghost units). To force the OR backend to order despite these ghost units, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. Promised lead time is 2, and successful deliveries (P2, P8, P12) consistently show L=2. I will set mu_hat based on the recent average of ~130 units/week across the review + lead time (1+L=3 periods), totaling 390. This will ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that ignores the 1,700+ units that will never arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stabilized summer regime. Recent demand (last 6 periods) has averaged ~150 units per week (86, 97, 64, 189, 176, 277). While there was a spike to 277 in the most recent period, the overall trend since May suggests a lower level than the spring peak. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (1839 units) is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 14 (totaling 1,724 units). Real pipeline inventory is close to 115 units, but the OR engine subtracts the full 1839 units, which would result in zero orders. To force an order and maintain stock for the current demand level (~150/week) and promised lead time (L=2), I set mu_hat explicitly to offset the phantom pipeline. Based on L=2, the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand (Period 20, 21, 22). To counteract the ~1724 units of 'lost' in-transit inventory and cover current demand (~450 units for 3 weeks), mu_hat is set to a value that ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the corrupted in-transit figure. Setting mu_hat to 2200 units (explicit) targets a base stock that triggers a replenishment order sufficient to restore on-hand availability for July demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Ghost pipeline inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14) now totals 1724 units, requiring explicit mu_hat adjustments to bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are managing a 'Gently tailored shirt'. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The demand profile has shifted from the high-spring peak (~250-300 units) to a stabilized summer regime, though recent weeks (P17-P20) show a bounce in volatility with demand between 176 and 277 units. The supply chain is highly unreliable: 1724 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14) are confirmed lost/ghost inventory as later orders (P8, P12) arrived exactly on the promised L=2 timeline. A new order of 594 units was placed in P20, bringing the 'In-transit' total to 2318. To ensure the backend places an order, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the subtraction of this ghost pipeline (2318 units). Since mu_hat is used to compute base_stock where base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and the OR logic calculates order = max(0, base_stock - pipeline), I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate (1+L) period demand (3 weeks) to be ~450 units based on recent averages (~150/week), then add the 1724 lost units to neutralize them in the backend calculation. Total mu_hat = 450 + 1724 = 2174.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed ghost pipeline (lost shipments) rose to 1724 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P14). Explicit mu_hat or sigma_hat adjustments are required to bypass the OR engine's pipeline inventory subtraction until these units are cleared or offset.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-risk state with 0 on-hand inventory and a heavily distorted pipeline. There are 2,318 units 'In-transit', but the majority are confirmed legacy lost shipments: P1 (218), P3 (548), P4 (479), and P14 (479), totaling 1,724 units. The remaining 594 units in the pipeline consist of the P20 order (479) and the P10 order (115), with P10 likely lost as it is 12 periods overdue (ordered P8, arrived; then ordered P10, never arrived). This leaves only 479 units (from P20) expected to arrive in Period 22. Demand in the current regime (last 5 periods) has averaged 209 units per week, significantly higher than the previous summer low of ~110. To force the OR engine to order despite the 2,318 'ghost' units in-transit, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat = (Pipeline Inventory) + (Target Base Stock). Target Base Stock = (1+L)*\u03bc + z*\u03c3. With L=2, \u03bc=210, z\u22480.84 (for 80% service level), and \u03c3\u224850, Target Base Stock \u2248 800. Therefore, mu_hat = 2318 + 800 = 3118. This ensures the backend calculates (3118 - 2318) = 800 as the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean weekly demand for 'Gently tailored shirt' increased to ~210 units (up from summer low of ~110). Lost shipments (ghost pipeline) confirmed at 1,839 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we are facing a massive 'ghost inventory' challenge. The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' units (2711) from its base stock calculation to determine the order size. However, 1,839 of these units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. If we use default logic, the engine will see 2711 in-transit and 301 on-hand, conclude we are overstocked, and order zero, leading to stockouts. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I estimate the current demand regime at ~210 units/week based on the July shift. For a lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage: review + L), required base stock is roughly 3 * 210 = 630. To force the engine to place an order when it thinks we have 3012 units (301 + 2711), I set mu_hat to 3500. This ensures the base stock > pipeline_inventory, triggering a replenishment. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatility of the new July demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Ghost pipeline (lost shipments) remains at 1,839 units. Current demand regime since Period 20 has stabilized at approximately 210 units/week (+90% vs summer lows).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-648.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Gently tailored shirt' has shown high volatility but seems to be stabilizing around a mean of 200-210 units/period since Period 20 (July). Current on-hand inventory is 1,068 units, which is high relative to this demand level. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 2,387 units is heavily distorted by 1,839 units of cumulative 'ghost' pipeline (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 14). Specifically, total In-transit (2,387) = Ghost (1,839) + Real Pipeline (P23 order of 548). The OR engine subtracts all In-transit units from its base stock calculation. To prevent the engine from ordering zero due to this phantom stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a current demand mean of ~200. For L=2, base stock needs to cover 3 periods (~600 units). Since actual on-hand (1,068) already exceeds this, no new order is required this period. I will set parameters to ensure the OR engine recognizes we are overstocked and avoids further ordering while we bleed off the excess on-hand inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/07/29), we have 951 units on hand. The 'In-transit' figure of 2387 units is heavily distorted by 1,839 units of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 14. Real pipeline inventory consists only of the Period 23 order (548 units). Demand recently peaked around 210 units/week but the last two periods have dropped to ~110 units/week, suggesting a potential return to the summer regime or temporary fluctuation. Lead time for successful deliveries remains stable at L=2, with a recent arrival at L=1 showing variability. To override the OR engine's tendency to subtract the 'ghost' pipeline (which would prevent any new orders from being placed for many weeks), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat exceptionally high. This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to exceed the distorted pipeline, ensuring the system can maintain adequate on-hand stock for actual demand. I assume a mean demand of ~160 (averaging recent regimes) for the target, with high sigma to protect against late-summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Pipeline distortion remains severe. Corrected real in-transit inventory is 548 units (Period 23 order). Ghost inventory from lost shipments is 1,839 units. Demand volatility is high (200 down to 110).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Gently tailored shirt' is currently in a high-on-hand state (859 units) following recent deliveries. Analysis of the history indicates a severe pipeline distortion: 'In-transit' is reported as 2486 units, but carry-over insights and historical reconciliation confirm that 1839 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) are lost and will never arrive. The true physical pipeline consists only of orders from Period 23 (548 units) and Period 25 (99 units), totaling 647 units. Current demand has stabilized after a recent cooling; the last 3 periods (P23, P24, P25) show demand of 105, 117, and 92 respectively (mean ~105). Given on-hand inventory (859) already covers ~8 weeks of current demand, no new orders are needed. However, to prevent the OR engine from seeing a massive surplus (due to the 1839 lost units still in the pipeline) and potentially refusing to order in much later periods, I am maintaining parameters that reflect the TRUE demand state. I set L=2 (confirmed lead time for successful deliveries) and mu_hat explicitly to bypass the OR engine's dependency on the corrupted pipeline stock. Mu_hat is set to (1+L)*105 = 315 to reflect the current stabilized regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019-08-12), the SKU is in a post-summer recovery phase where demand has fluctuated between 100-200 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,938 units is heavily distorted by 1,839 units from confirmed lost or multi-period overdue shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). The effective pipeline inventory is actually only 99 units (from Order P25). Because the OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (1,938) when calculating orders, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to force the base stock level. I target a base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand. Current average demand is ~125 units/week. I will set mu_hat to 1,938 (to offset the phantom pipeline) + 375 (3 weeks of demand) = 2,313. This ensures the backend calculates an order that maintains sufficient on-hand safety stock despite the ghost pipeline. Lead time 'calculate' is used as recent deliveries range from 1-3 periods, averaging near the promise of 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Effective pipeline inventory is only 99 units (P25); the remaining 1,839 units in the in-transit display are long-term lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) that will not arrive.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (2019-08-19), the 'Gently tailored shirt' is in a high-inventory state with 1,150 units on-hand. Recent demand (Periods 25-27) has been 92, 144, and 212 units respectively, averaging ~150 units/week. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1,839 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 14 as established in previous insights. These 'ghost' units will never arrive but the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will subtract them from any proposed order, effectively blocking new orders. Since the current on-hand inventory (1,150) is sufficient to cover approximately 7.6 periods of demand (1,150 / 150), no new orders are needed right now. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the most recent regime) to capture the current mean demand of ~134 units/week and volatility, ensuring that once inventory drops, the system correctly recalibrates. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent successful deliveries (P22, P23, P25) arrived with L=2, L=1, and L=2 respectively, showing the service has stabilized.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 29 (late August). Demand has shown a recent uptick, with the last two periods at 212 and 232 units, following a summer regime that averaged closer to 110-150. I am centering my forecast on the recent N=5 average (~159 units/week) to capture the late-summer lift while remaining cautious about volatility. Inventory management remains complicated by the 1,839 'ghost' units in-transit (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14) that will never arrive. The OR engine subtracts Pipeline Inventory from the Base Stock calculation (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline). Since Pipeline = 1,839 but actual arriving units are 0, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force the backend to place an order if needed. However, current On-hand is 918, which covers ~5.7 periods of demand at current levels (918/159). With L=2, the total coverage required is roughly (L+1) * 159 = 477 units. Since 918 > 477, no new order is required this period. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N for N=5 to reflect the current demand trend, acknowledging that the OR engine will likely output 0 orders due to the high on-hand and ghost pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30 (Sep 2, 2019), the shirt SKU is in a stable late-summer/early-fall demand regime. Weekly demand over the last four periods has averaged 211 units (144, 212, 232, 255), showing a steady upward trend as fall approaches. Currently, on-hand inventory is 663 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1839 is entirely composed of confirmed 'ghost' pipeline inventory (lost orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 14) that will never arrive. The OR backend's logic subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock, which would normally result in zero orders. To prevent stockouts, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to set a value that overrides the pipeline inventory distraction. The target base stock (calculated as roughly 3 weeks of demand plus safety stock) should be approximately 850 units. To achieve this, I set mu_hat to 2689 (base_stock + ghost_pipeline), ensuring the backend places an order if appropriate, though with 663 on-hand and 211 demand, we are safe for ~3 periods. I am setting L to 2 as recent successful deliveries (P22, P25) confirm the promised lead time remains the most reliable estimate for new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increasing: Average demand over the last 3 periods is 233 units (+10% vs P20-P25 average). Ghost pipeline remains at 1839 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a period of high demand (average 277 over the last 3 periods), likely driven by back-to-school or early autumn seasonality for blouses. On-hand inventory is 319, which is just enough to cover one period. The critical issue remains the 'ghost pipeline' of 1,839 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) that are confirmed lost but stay in the OR engine's 'in-transit' calculation. To force the OR engine to order despite this fake pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat to be greater than (on-hand + actual in-transit + lost units). Actual in-transit is 286 (from P30). Total inventory including lost units is 319 (on-hand) + 286 (real) + 1839 (lost) = 2444. I want to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus a safety margin. With mean demand ~275 and L=2, the target base stock should be ~1000. To bypass the 1839 lost units, mu_hat must be set explicitly to (Target Base Stock + 1839). Target Base Stock = (3 periods * 280) + Safety (~200) = ~1040. Total explicit mu_hat = 1040 + 1839 = 2879.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Autumn demand spike detected (mean 277 units/week, +20%). Ghost pipeline (lost shipments) remains stagnant at 1,839 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Gently tailored shirt' has entered an autumn spike, with the last two periods showing 344 and 329 units respectively (mean ~336). This follows a summer regime of ~210. Current on-hand is 0. The 'In-transit' display of 2771 units is heavily distorted by historical 'ghost' pipeline units (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14 totaling 1839 units). Subtracting these from the 2771 total leaves 932 'real' units in transit (P30: 286 units, P31: 646 units). The OR engine will subtract the full 2771 from its base stock calculation, leading to massive under-ordering. To force the correct order, I calculate the desired base stock and provide it via the 'explicit' mu_hat method, effectively bypassing the pipeline logic. Desired base stock = (L+1) * Expected Demand + Buffer. With L=2, and expected weekly demand ~336, Base Stock = 3 * 336 + 1.28 * (sqrt(3) * 50) \u2248 1008 + 110 \u2248 1118. To make the OR engine reach this target while it thinks it has 2771 units in pipeline, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that compensates for this distortion.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand spike confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~210 to ~335 units/week since Period 30 (+60%). Ghost pipeline (lost shipments) remains stagnant at 1,839 units, continuing to distort automated replenishment logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $763.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is in an autumn demand surge, with demand averaging ~337 units/week over the last three periods (P30: 344, P31: 329, P32: 339). The inventory situation is complicated by a significant 'ghost' pipeline of 1,839 units from lost historical shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). In Period 32, we received 932 units (P30 and P31 orders), leaving an ending on-hand of 593 units. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 2,954. Subtracting the 1,839 known ghost units leaves an effective pipeline of 1,115 units (this is the order from Period 31/32). Because the OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (2,954) from the base stock calculation, it will stop ordering entirely unless we use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to offset this distortion. To maintain a safety stock for the current 337 units/week demand and a lead time of 2, I need a target base stock of (L+1)*Demand + Safety \u2248 3*337 + 1*std \u2248 1200+ units. Since current effective inventory (on-hand 593 + actual in-transit 1115) is already 1,708, we are well-covered for the immediate future. I will set mu_hat explicitly to ensure the engine recognizes the high demand but accounts for the massive ghost pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Gently tailored shirt' has entered an autumn peak, with the last 4 periods showing a mean of 347.5 units/week. This represents a significant upward shift from the previous regime (~210 units). Lead time remains volatile but averages around L=2 for successful deliveries. A critical constraint is the 'ghost pipeline' of 1,839 units (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14) which the OR backend subtracts from the base stock calculation, preventing necessary ordering. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the ghost inventory. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Expected Demand + safety stock. With L=2, and demand ~350, Base Stock needs to be roughly 1400. To offset the 1,839 units being subtracted by the OR engine, I set mu_hat to an explicit value (2954 + 1100 = ~4054) to ensure the backend places an order to maintain inventory for the current high-demand regime. Specifically, the in-transit display is 2954, but only 1115 (from P32) is real. To ensure we order enough to cover approximately 350 demand/week for the next 3 weeks (L+1), accounting for on-hand 215, I use an explicit mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: Period 30-33 mean demand is 347.5 units/week (+65% over summer regime). Ghost pipeline (lost shipments) remains at 1,839 units, requiring explicit mu_hat overrides to ensure replenishment functions.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in an autumn demand peak with a current mean demand of approx. 320-350 units/week (Periods 30-34 mean = 319, though P34 saw a dip). Lead time remains reliably 2 periods for successful orders. The critical issue is the 'ghost pipeline' of 1,839 units (lost from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) which the OR engine subtracts from the base stock. Total In-transit is currently 3,952. Real In-transit is P32 order (1,115) + P34 order (998) = 2,113. Ghost In-transit = 3,952 - 2,113 = 1,839 units. To force the OR engine to order, I must set mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+Review)) + Ghost Pipeline. Expected Demand * (L+1) = 330 * 3 = 990. Adjusted mu_hat = 990 + 1,839 = 2,829. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers actual demand plus the inventory it incorrectly believes is coming.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/14. We are in Period 36. Recent demand context: After an autumn spike averaging ~340 units (P31-P33), demand has dropped significantly to 208 (P34) and 128 (P35). This suggests the peak has passed. My current on-hand inventory is 994 units. Supply chain context: The in-transit inventory is listed as 2837 units, but 1839 of these are 'ghost' units from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). The true pipeline inventory consists of the Period 34 order of 998 units. Adding true pipeline (998) to on-hand (994) gives 1992 units. At a current demand of ~130-200 units, I have ~10-15 weeks of supply, making a new order unnecessary. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1839 ghost units and under-ordering in the future, I must continue to monitor but for this specific period, with high inventory, I will set mu_hat to 'explicit' at a very low value (1) to ensure the engine doesn't trigger an order, though the cap logic likely won't order anyway given the high coverage. For lead time, I will use 'default' as recent successful deliveries (P30, P31, P32) arrived with L=1-3, averaging near the promised L=2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease: Post-autumn spike demand has dropped from ~340 to ~168 units/week (last 2 periods). Ghost pipeline remains constant at 1839 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Gently tailored shirt' has significantly cooled following the autumn peak (which saw demand >340 units/week). The last three periods (P34-P36) show demand of 208, 128, and 127 units respectively, indicating a new lower regime of ~150 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 867 units. However, the system's 'In-transit' count (2837 units) is heavily distorted by 1839 units of historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). The effective in-transit inventory is actually 998 units (from Period 34). Total effective stock (On-hand 867 + Real In-transit 998) is 1865 units, which covers over 10 weeks of the current demand regime. With L=2, we need (L+1)=3 weeks of coverage (approx 450 units). Since current effective inventory (1865) is much higher than needed, no new order is required. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously blocking future orders due to the 'ghost' pipeline once stock levels drop, I use an explicit mu_hat that offsets the 1839 lost units. Specifically, mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Pipeline = (150 * 3) + 1839 = 2289. This ensures the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic recognizes the need for stock once on-hand levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn demand regime shift confirmed at Period 36: Mean demand decreased to ~150 units/week (-55% vs peak). Ghost pipeline remains constant at 1839 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Gently tailored shirt' has shifted from the autumn peak (approx. 340 units/week) to a lower post-peak regime. The mean demand for the last three periods (P35-P37) is 137.7 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 709 units. The 'In-transit' display shows 2837 units, but 1839 of these are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 14 that will never arrive (ghost pipeline). The actual real pipeline consists of the P34 order (998 units). Total effective availability (on-hand + real in-transit) is 1707 units. Given the current demand (approx. 140/week), 1707 units covers over 12 weeks of supply. Therefore, no new order is needed. To prevent the OR engine from ordering (since it sees 2837 in-transit), I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent post-peak regime (N=3) to reflect the current lower demand while the high level of inventory naturally suppresses any new ordering.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Gently tailored shirt' has entered a post-autumn cooling phase. Over the last three periods (P36-P38), demand has averaged approximately 130 units/week (127, 158, 106), a significant drop from the autumn peak of ~340 units. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 603 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 2837 units is extremely distorted. It includes 1839 units confirmed lost from historical periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) and 998 units ordered in Period 34 which are currently overdue (L=5 if they arrive now). Given this item's history of sequential shipment failures, the 998 units from P34 are treated as highly uncertain. To prevent the OR engine from seeing the 2837 'ghost' units as upcoming supply and therefore never ordering again, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat to 3500 to offset the pipeline inventory (603 on-hand + 2837 in-transit = 3440 total) and ensure the base stock calculation triggers a small replenishment or maintains a net long position, as current inventory will drift below safety levels within 4-5 weeks and the pipeline cannot be trusted. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile lead time history (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods).

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from Period 36-38 is 130 units/week (-62% vs autumn peak). Pipeline distortion reached 2837 units, of which 1839 are confirmed legacy losses and 998 (from P34) are currently 3 periods overdue.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a post-autumn lower demand regime (starting Period 36), with demand averaging ~125 units/week over the last four periods (P36-P39). The on-hand inventory is 499 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of the current demand. However, the 'In-transit' figure (2955 units) is heavily distorted by 2,837 units of confirmed lost or significantly overdue shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14 = 1839; P34 = 998). The OR engine subtracts this ghost pipeline from its base stock calculation, which would prevent any new orders from being placed even if on-hand stock were depleted. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a target inventory level that ignores the ghost pipeline. Based on current demand (~125) and L=2, the required coverage for (L+1) periods is roughly 375 units. Since on-hand (499) already exceeds this, no new order is strictly necessary, but I will set mu_hat explicitly to maintain a safe base stock around 550 to ensure the engine doesn't stop ordering once the surplus clears. Lead time remains volatile but generally averages 2-3 for successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed cumulative lost units/ghost pipeline reached 2,837 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and now P34 which is 6 periods overdue). Demand remains stable in the late-autumn regime at ~125 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Gently tailored shirt' has stabilized in a late-autumn regime. Over the last five periods (P36-P40), weekly demand has averaged 118.2 units (127, 158, 106, 104, 96), a significant decrease from the autumn peak. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to reflect this current level (~118 units/week). Regarding inventory, the system reports 2,955 units in-transit. However, based on the Carry-over Insights, 2,837 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 14, and 34). The only potentially 'real' in-transit order is the small order of 118 units from Period 39. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (distorted) in-transit total (2,955) from the calculated base stock, it will never trigger an order naturally. To force replenishment and ensure we cover the 3-period demand window (Lead time 2 + Review 1), I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock as 3 periods * 120 units/week = 360 units, plus a safety buffer. However, the on-hand inventory is currently 403 units, which is sufficient to cover the next ~3.4 weeks of demand at the current rate. Therefore, no immediate order is needed this period, but I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to track the current stable regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507909001' is in a stable late-autumn/winter demand regime with an average weekly demand of approximately 105 units over the last three periods (P39-P41). The primary challenge continues to be the 'ghost pipeline' of 2,837 units, which represents confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 14, and 34. Because the OR backend subtracts this in-transit total from the target base stock, it would normally stop ordering entirely while on-hand inventory depletes. To ensure the backend places orders to maintain stock, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 2 periods (total 3 periods of coverage: demand during current period + lead time). With mean demand at ~110 and a safety factor for volatility, I set mu_hat at 3,300. This value, when the backend subtracts the 2,837 units of ghost pipeline, will result in an effective target of ~463 units, which aligns with current on-hand levels (416) and will trigger small replenishment orders as on-hand inventory drops further.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507909001 (Women's tailored shirt) has stabilized in a late-autumn/winter regime. The mean demand over the last 7 periods (P36-P42) is approximately 121 units/week. While P42 saw a slight uptick to 150, the overall trend remains low compared to the autumn peak. The 'In-transit' figure of 2,918 units is heavily distorted by legacy lost shipments totaling 2,837 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P34). The only 'live' order is the 81 units from Period 42. Because the backend OR engine subtracts Pipeline Inventory (In-transit) from its calculated Base Stock, and the ghost inventory (2,837) vastly exceeds any reasonable Base Stock, the automated system would never place an order. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target Base Stock for a 3-period horizon (L+1=3) at ~125 units/week: (3 * 125) = 375. To force the backend to place an order when on-hand inventory (266) plus real in-transit (81) drops below the safety level, I set mu_hat to 3,300. This value, when the ghost pipeline (2,837) is subtracted, results in an effective base stock that covers our actual needs. Sigma_hat is set to a moderate level reflecting the recent consistency.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Gently tailored shirt' has stabilized in a winter regime averaging approximately 100 units per week (Period 43 demand was 50, but we've seen 104, 96, 105, 150 recently). The main challenge remains the extreme 'ghost pipeline' inventory. Total In-transit is reported at 3,085 units, but history confirms that 2,837 of these (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 14, and 34) are lost and will never arrive. The only valid orders in transit are from Period 42 (81 units) and Period 43 (167 units), totaling 248 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 3,085 'in-transit' units, \u03bc\u0302 must be set explicitly high to overcome the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation. I want a target base stock of roughly 350-400 units (covering 3-4 weeks of ~100 demand). To achieve this while the engine subtracts 3,085 units, I will set \u03bc\u0302 to approximately 3,450 to ensure a non-zero order if needed, however, since current On-hand (216) + Real In-transit (248) = 464, which is sufficient for the current regime, I will set parameters to maintain stability and avoid over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (Period 47). Lead time is stable at L=2 for delivered orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Confirmed ghost pipeline (lost shipments) remains at 2,837 units. Real pipeline is only 248 units. Demand regime is stable at ~100-110 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909001 ('Gently tailored shirt') is currently in a stable late-autumn/winter demand regime following the autumn peak. Since Period 36 (mid-October), demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 110 units per week. Specifically, the last three periods (P42-P44) show demand of 150, 50, and 103, averaging 101 units/week. The severe pipeline distortion persists: the reported 'In-transit' of 3,085 units contains 2,837 units of confirmed legacy lost shipments (ghost inventory from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P34). The real pipeline consists of only 248 units (P42 order of 81 and P43 order of 167). With 113 units on-hand, the total 'real' inventory (on-hand + actual pipeline) is 361 units. To maintain a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1 with L=2) at ~110 units/week plus a safety buffer, we need ~400 units. However, because the OR engine subtracts the full 3,085 'In-transit' units from its calculation, it will never place an order unless we provide an explicit mu_hat that offsets this artifact. I am setting mu_hat to 1350 using the 'explicit' method: (1+L=3) * (Actual Mean 110) + Ghost Pipeline/3 (approx 945) \u2248 1275-1350. This forces the engine to recognize the need for replenishment despite the ghost inventory. L is set to 'default' as successful deliveries continue to arrive with a 2-period lead time.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507909001' is in a stable late-autumn/winter regime with a mean demand of approximately 105 units/week. Over the last five periods (P41-P45), demand was 105, 150, 50, 103, and 114, averaging 104.4. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this stability. The pipeline inventory continues to be severely distorted by 2,837 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P34). Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit amount from the base stock calculation, a base stock policy using standard parameters would never place an order as long as the ghost inventory remains in-transit. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-week window (L+1=3) at ~315 units (105 * 3), then add the 2,837 ghost units to it. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation results in a meaningful replenishment order. Lead time for successful deliveries remains consistent at L=2.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. Demand for the 'Gently tailored shirt' has stabilized in a low-volume winter regime (mean ~100 units/week) following the autumn spike. Specifically, the last 4 periods show demand of [50, 103, 114, 69], with an average of 84. The OR engine's decision-making is heavily distorted by 2,837 units of 'ghost pipeline' inventory (confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 14, and 34). Because the backend subtracts this in-transit total (currently 2,958 units) from the base stock, it will not place any new orders unless I manually override \u03bc\u0302 to offset this massive negative balance. Real pipeline units are only 121 (from Period 46). To achieve a target base stock of approximately 300 units (covering 2-3 weeks of demand plus safety stock) while bypassing the -2,958 pipeline subtraction, I set mu_hat explicitly to (2958 + 300) = 3258. This ensures the backend calculates an order sufficient to maintain physical stock despite the phantom inventory. I maintain L at method 'calculate' as recent successful deliveries (P42, P43) arrived in 3 and 2 periods respectively, confirming the promosed L=2 remains the baseline for non-lost orders.
