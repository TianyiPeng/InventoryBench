Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is 'Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p', a lingerie item. Historical demand (recent 5 weeks) shows values of 38, 31, 51, 38, 49, with a mean of 41.4 and a standard deviation of 8.29. The current date is shortly after Chinese New Year (Feb 5, 2019) and right before Valentine's Day (Feb 14, 2019). Given the low inventory (0 on-hand, 0 in-transit) and the high probability of a demand spike for lingerie around Valentine's Day, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next few periods to be slightly higher than the historical average to capture this potential seasonality and prevent stockouts. The promised lead time is 2, so the OR backend will calculate the order based on a coverage period of L+1 = 3. I will set L to default (2). For mu_hat, I'll use an explicit value based on a forecasted weekly demand of ~50 (50 * 3 = 150). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p', a lingerie item. In Period 1, we ordered 64 units, which are currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible at the start of P4. Initial demand from the training data (Jan-Feb) averages 41.4 units/week. Period 1 actual demand was 39. Since we started with 0 inventory, all 39 units of demand in Period 1 were lost. I will set parameters based on the historical average to rebuild inventory. With L=2, mu_hat should cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). Historical mean is ~41.4, so 3 * 41.4 \u2248 124. Sigma will be based on the recent historical samples to ensure safety stock covers volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p' (Womens Lingerie). Data shows a steady demand average of ~42 units per period (samples: 38, 31, 51, 38, 49, 39, 54). The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (64 units) and P2 (56 units) are in-transit (total 120). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order (L=2) should arrive during P3's arrival resolution and be visible in the P3 conclude message (read at START of P4). Thus, the zero arrivals in P1 and P2 conclude messages are expected behavior for L=2. Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have missed sales in P1 and P2 due to starting with 0 inventory. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 samples (5 history + P1, P2) to ensure the base stock covers demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1=3).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. We are looking at a women's lingerie staple (thong briefs). Historically, demand has been around 40-50 units per week. Currently, we are in a stockout state (on-hand = 0) because we are waiting for orders placed in Periods 1 (64 units), 2 (56 units), and 3 (9 units) to arrive. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the timing rules, the Period 1 order (placed at start of P1) is scheduled to arrive during Period 1+2=3. This arrival should be confirmed in the 'Period 3 conclude' message, which we would see at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0 for SKU 465655019. This indicates the lead time is longer than promised or the shipment is delayed. Since we have zero inventory and 129 units in transit, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), the average of the last 8 samples (including historical and game history) is (38+31+51+38+49+39+54+33)/8 = 41.6. With L=3, the (1+L) factor is 4. mu_hat = 41.6 * 4 = 166.4. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of these samples (~7.5) times sqrt(1+L), which is ~15. These parameters will signal the OR engine to maintain a higher base stock to compensate for the lead time extension and pending deliveries.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a women's lingerie item (thong briefs). Historical weekly demand samples are: 38, 31, 51, 38, 49 (avg: 41.4), and game history demand: 39, 54, 33, 27 (avg: 38.25). The overall mean demand is approximately 40 units/week. We have 29 units on-hand and 111 units in-transit. The Period 1 order (64 units) has not yet concluded (it should have arrived in Period 3 if lead time was 2), suggesting it might be delayed or lost. However, the Period 2 order (56 units) arrived in Period 4 with a lead time of 2 periods exactly as promised. For Period 5, I will use recent_N=5 for demand (averaging 40.8 units/week) to capture the slightly higher historical context alongside recent lower demand. Lead time (L) is set to default (2). Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock will be near the mean. The pipeline (111 in-transit) is significant, so the OR backend will likely order less to prevent excess inventory given the holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The SKU is a thong brief. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks: 38, 31, 51, 38, 49) plus recent actual demand (39, 54, 33, 27, 34) suggest a mean demand of approximately 40 units/week. Promised lead time is 2. Observation from Period 4 confirms an arrival from Period 2 (lead_time = 2). However, the order from Period 1 (64 units) has NOT arrived and is now 5 periods old (3 periods past promised), suggesting it is likely lost. Current on-hand is 0. In-transit consists of 9 (P3), 38 (P4), and 0 (P5) totalling only 47 units effectively (if the 64 from P1 is lost). To maintain service levels given high stocking risk (on-hand is 0), I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time. mu_hat will use N=5 to capture the recent stable demand of ~40/week. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level, but we must account for the lost stock by ensuring the pipeline covers at least L+1 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (64 units) is highly likely lost (overdue by 3 periods); calculated pipeline inventory should exclude it.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU 465655019 is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The shipment from Period 1 (64 units) is now 4 periods overdue (promised 2) and is effectively lost. The backend's pipeline inventory calculation (113 units) includes this lost shipment (64 from P1 + 9 from P3 + 38 from P4 + 2 from P6). To force the OR backend to ignore the 64 lost units and order enough to restore service, I will set 'mu_hat' explicitly higher to compensate for the phantom 64 units in the pipeline. Historical demand mean is approx 38 units/period. For a (L+1)=3 period window (L=2), expected demand is ~114. The pipeline (excluding lost) is 49. I need 'mu_hat' to effectively reflect (Target Stock) + (Lost Units Adjust). I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 178 (114 + 64) to trigger an order. sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Confirmed shipment loss from Period 1 (ordered P1, 4 periods overdue); pipeline inventory overestimates availability by 64 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), on-hand inventory is 0. The shipment from Period 1 (64 units) is confirmed lost as it is now 5 periods overdue. Current in-transit is reported at 178 units, but actual reliable pipeline inventory is 114 units (178 - 64). Recent lead time observations confirm the promised lead time of 2 periods (P2 arrived in P4). Demand is stable but on-hand stockouts are causing lost sales. Average demand from historical and recent samples sits around 40 units per period. Setting L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, targeting (1+L) * 40 = 120. I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand to capture recent volatility while acknowledging the baseline. sigma_hat will use recent_N to ensure the backend accounts for the high variance seen recently (demand ranging from 27 to 55).

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Shipment from Period 1 (64 units) is definitively lost; ignore in internal stock calculations. Reliable pipeline is 114 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8th. The SKU (Womens Thong Underwear) shows consistent demand with a 5nd historical sample mean of ~42 (including samples from Jan/Feb) and game history demand mean of ~40. Period 8 saw a slight uptick (47). Regarding supply: The Period 1 order (64 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is definitively lost. The system reports In-transit = 111, which consists of the lost P1 order (64) and the P4 order (38) and P3 order (9). However, wait: P8 conclude says we received orders from P6 (2 units) and P7 (65 units). Let's audit In-transit: P1(64) + P3(9) + P4(38) = 111. P1 is lost. P3 is 5 periods overdue and likely lost. P4 is 4 periods overdue and likely lost. Only P8's receipts (65+2) were successful. Since the OR backend uses the reported pipeline (111), and 111 units are largely 'ghost' units that will never arrive, the OR backend will under-order significantly. To compensate, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~45 units/period. For a lead time of 2, (1+L) = 3 periods. Expected demand = 135 units. I will set mu_hat to a value that forces an order despite the 111 'dead' pipeline units. If I want to end with ~100 units total coverage, but the OR engine thinks I have 111+20=131, it will order nothing. I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger replenishment to cover the actual on-hand (20) and real pipeline (0).

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 1 (64 units), Period 3 (9 units), and Period 4 (38 units) are all overdue by 4+ periods and are considered lost. Total 'ghost' pipeline = 111 units. This matches the current 'In-transit' figure, meaning there is zero actual inventory coming.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), on-hand inventory is 0. The current 'In-transit' value is 214 units. Based on history, orders from P1 (64), P3 (9), and P4 (38) are significantly past their 2-period promised lead time and are confirmed lost (total 111 units). This means the 'In-transit' figure contains 111 'ghost' units. The only valid pipeline shipment is 103 units from Period 9, which is expected to arrive in Period 11 or 12. Demand has been stable across the broad history (avg ~40). However, because the backend logic 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' counts all 214 units (including the 111 lost ones), it will significantly under-order or not order at all unless I adjust. To force the OR backend to place an order to cover the current stockout, I will use an 'explicit' L to reflect the risk of lead time variability and set mu_hat/sigma_hat carefully. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level target is 50%, meaning we aim to keep base stock near (1+L)*mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full recent history after the initial samples.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' pipeline units totaling 111 (from P1, P3, P4) are causing the OR engine to underestimate ordering needs; internal calculations must subtract these from In-transit.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, 2019. The SKU is 'Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p'. Demand history shows relative stability with an average of approximately 38.6 units per period. The critical issue remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 111 units (from orders in P1, P3, and P4), which are now 7-10 periods overdue and definitively lost. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target stock level. Because the system reports In-transit = 111 (all of which are lost) and On-hand = 63, it believes the total inventory is 174. At a service level of 50% (since profit=holding cost), it will not order anything because it thinks coverage is way above the target (3 periods of demand \u2248 116 units). To force an order and maintain availability for the upcoming 3 periods (Period 11, 12, 13), I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset these 111 ghost units. Specifically, I need mu_hat to be ~227 (Base target 116 + Ghost 111). Since mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * mean, with L=2, mean should be ~75.7. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat and sigma_hat carefully to ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment despite the false pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 11, the entire 'In-transit' quantity of 111 units consists purely of lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4. The system has effectively zero actual pipeline inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P12 (2019-04-29). On-hand inventory is 9 units. The 'In-transit' figure is 164 units. Based on historical data, 111 units are confirmed lost (P1: 64, P3: 9, P4: 38). Therefore, the actual pipeline inventory is 164 - 111 = 53 units, which corresponds to the order placed in Period 11. This order is expected to arrive in Period 13 (promised L=2). Demand remains relatively stable with an average around 40 units per week. The OR engine's 'base_stock' logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see 164 in-transit and likely order nothing because it assumes the 111 lost units will arrive. To force an order, I must increase mu_hat significantly to offset the 111 'ghost' units. Specifically, mu_hat needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 111 missing units to trick the pipeline deduction. Average demand over the last 5 samples is (47+22+40+54+33)/5 \u2248 39. For L=2, expected demand is 3 * 39 = 117. Adding the 111 ghost units results in a required mu_hat of 228. I will set L to 2 (promised) and use an explicit mu_hat to ensure replenishment occurs despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains 111 units (P1, P3, P4). Observed actual lead times for successful deliveries (P4, P8, P10) are 2, 2, 1, and 1, indicating lead time is generally stable or slightly faster than promised, though reliability is poor.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the 'In-transit' stock of 219 units includes 111 units from lost shipments in Periods 1, 3, and 4. The remaining 108 units are from Period 11 (53 units) and Period 12 (55 units). Since those are within the promised lead time of 2 periods, they are the only reliable pipeline inventory. Demand has shown an upward shift, with the last 5 periods (P8-P12) averaging 46.4 units compared to the initial 41 units, with Period 12 hitting a peak of 69 units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to reduce its order size; because 'In-transit' is inflated by 111 'ghost' units, I must use 'explicit' methods to override the parameters and force an order that compensates for the lost stock. I am setting mu_hat based on the recent elevated demand average (~47 units/week) multiplied by (1+L) = 3 periods, and keeping sigma_hat slightly higher to reflect the recent volatility. This will ensure the base stock calculation targets enough inventory to cover real demand despite the system's incorrect pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost (lost) inventory in the 'In-transit' count is confirmed at 111 units (from orders in P1, P3, P4). This causes the OR backend to under-order by exactly 111 units unless parameters are manually adjusted.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/5/13), we are facing a persistent issue with 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, the 'In-transit' count of 166 units includes 111 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (64+9+38) that are statistically lost (overdue by 9+ periods). The actual valid pipeline is only 55 units (from Period 12). Since our current on-hand inventory is 0, the OR backend's target base stock calculation is severely hindered by the belief that 166 units are coming, when in reality only 55 are. To force the OR backend to order sufficient stock to cover the lost 111 units and meet future demand, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target as: (Expected Mean Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. Historically, demand averages ~41 units/period. For L=2, (41 * 3) = 123. Adding the 111 ghost units results in a mu_hat of 234. This ensures the engine places an order despite the phantom 111 units in its internal pipeline calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed ghost inventory remains 111 units (P1, P3, P4). The actual pipeline is 55 units (from P12), not the 166 reported in 'In-transit'. Explicit mu_hat adjustment is required to bypass the backend's calculation bottleneck caused by these lost shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' count of 179 units is misleading because 111 of those units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost shipments. The actual pipeline consists only of the 68 units ordered in P14. The OR engine calculates the order as 'base_stock - In-transit'. Since it sees 179 units in-transit, it will significantly under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the base stock need for (L+1=3) periods based on the recent demand surge (avg of last 3 periods: (69+58+98)/3 = 75 units/period). Base stock = 75 * 3 = 225. Adding the 111 'ghost' units to this target results in 336. This forces the backend to see (336 - 179) = 157 units required, effectively targeting a real pipeline of 225 units. This ensures we recover from the stockout and handle the increased seasonal demand for cotton lingerie heading into late May.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Demand has shifted upwards, averaging 75 units over the last 3 periods vs 40-50 previously. Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains exactly 111 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 465655019 is experiencing a significant demand surge, likely seasonal for women's lingerie heading into early summer. Recent demand: P14=98, P15=91 (avg ~95). This is a sharp increase from the previous average of ~50. Current on-hand is 0. In-transit is reported as 327 units. However, we have a confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 111 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4). Additionally, an order of 68 units from P14 is now due (L=2) but hasn't arrived yet (it's in transit). The true available pipeline is 216 units (327 - 111). The OR backend uses the formula: base_stock = mu_hat - pipeline_inventory. To force the backend to place a sufficiently large order despite the 'ghost' 111 units blocking its logic, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand for (L+1) periods = 3 * 95 = 285. To offset the 111 ghost units, I add 111 to the target, totaling 396. This ensures the backend targets enough real inventory to meet the new demand regime while overcoming the accounting error of the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 14-15 average demand is 94.5 units, a ~100% increase over the baseline average of 47 units. Operational lead time remains roughly 2 periods, but reliability is poor.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 465655019 is experiencing a significant demand surge, likely due to summer seasonality (early June). The demand for the last 3 periods (P14-P16) averaged 96.7 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~40-50 units. We must also account for 'ghost' inventory: 111 units from P1, P3, and P4 are definitively lost but still contribute to the OR engine's 'In-transit' count. Currently, In-transit is 396 units. Subtracting the 111 ghost units results in an actual pipeline of 285 units (orders from P14, P15, P16). To ensure a sufficient order is placed despite the backend thinking we have 111 more units than we do, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = (L+1) * Expected Demand. With L=2 and demand at ~100/period, Target = 300. Adding the 111 unit deficit, the target becomes ~411 units. I will set mu_hat to 411 to force the OR engine to cover both the high demand and the phantom inventory gap. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal demand peak confirmed: P14-P16 average demand is 97 units/period (+100% vs baseline). Lost inventory (ghost pipeline) remains 111 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10th), the demand for the item (Cotton/lace thong) has reached a sustained high-season regime. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P14-P17) is approximately 95 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~47 units. On-hand inventory is 126 units after the arrival of P15 and P16 orders. Total 'In-transit' is reported as 194. However, consistent history shows that 111 units from P1, P3, and P4 are long-lost 'ghost' units. Additionally, the order from P14 (68 units) should have arrived by P16 (L=2) but has not concluded; given the reliability history, it is potentially lost or significantly delayed. Thus, the effective pipeline is likely just the P17 order (15 units). To compensate for the 111 units of ghost inventory that the OR backend incorrectly uses to reduce the order placement, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand (3 * 95 = 285) plus the 111 ghost units to 'neutralize' them in the backend's subtraction formula (Base Stock - Pipeline), totaling 396. L remains 2 (promised), and sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to reflect high summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Order from Period 14 (68 units) is now 2 periods overdue and suspected lost, potentially increasing ghost inventory from 111 to 179 units. Current demand remains stable at ~95 units/period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), the SKU 465655019 is experiencing a sustained summer seasonal peak. Demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) has averaged approximately 91.2 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~47 units. The current reported 'In-transit' inventory of 270 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments: P1 (64), P3 (9), P4 (38), totaling 111 units. Additionally, the shipment from P14 (68 units) is now 5 periods old and definitively lost, as its expected arrival was P16/P17. This brings total cumulative ghost inventory to 179 units. The actual physical pipeline consists only of orders from P17 (15 units) and P18 (76 units). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 179-unit overestimation of pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target stock calculation: (Lead Time 2 + Review Period 1) * Demand 92 + Compensation for Lost Inventory 179 = 455. This ensures the engine places an order that covers the current demand regime despite the blocked pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Shipment from Period 14 (68 units) is confirmed lost (5 periods since order, promised lead time 2). Total cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) in the In-transit figure is now 179 units (P1, P3, P4, P14).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we are in a high-demand summer regime. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (P14-P19) has averaged approx. 87 units/period, significantly higher than the spring average. The 'In-transit' figure of 328 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory (lost shipments). Confirmed lost shipments include: P1 (64), P3 (9), P4 (38), and P14 (68), totaling 179 units. Therefore, the actual reliable pipeline is 328 - 179 = 149 units (consisting of orders from P17 and P19). Since the OR backend uses the inflated In-transit figure (328) to subtract from the base stock, it will severely under-order. To compensate and ensure we meet high summer demand (~90/week), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods. With L=2, we need 3 periods of coverage (3 * 90 = 270). To force the backend to place an order despite the 328 units it 'sees' in transit, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this offset. I will set mu_hat to 400 (representing approx. 133 units/week for 3 weeks) to trigger replenishment and account for the 179-unit ghost deficit.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the SKU is entering the height of summer. Historical demand from P14-P17 showed a regime shift to ~95 units/period, though P18-P20 averaged lower at ~74 units. Given this is seasonal lingerie, I expect demand to remain elevated relative to the spring baseline. The most critical issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 341 units. According to carry-over insights, and cross-referencing history: orders from P1 (64), P3 (9), P4 (38), and P14 (68) are lost, totaling 179 'ghost' units. The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P19 (134 units) and P20 (13 units), plus the new P21 order. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 179 ghost units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods (L+1) of demand at ~95 units/period (= 285 units) PLUS the 179 ghost units that the backend will subtract from its calculation. Total mu_hat = 285 + 179 = 464. This forces the engine to place an order that restores the real-world inventory position despite the corrupted pipeline data. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P17, P19) show a mix of 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Ghost inventory confirmed at 179 units (P1, P3, P4, P14). Demand reflects summer seasonality, averaging ~85 units over the last 7 periods (P14-P20).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we continue to face a significant challenge with 'ghost' inventory. Total In-transit is 464, but carry-over insights confirm that 179 units (from P1, P3, P4, P14) are lost. This leaves an actual pipeline of 285 units (from P19, P20, P21). Current demand reflects a high summer seasonal regime, averaging approximately 100 units/period over the most recent weeks (P14-P21 mean is ~89, but last 2 weeks are 80 and 110). On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we are entirely dependent on arrivals. Based on a lead time of 2, the order from P19 (134 units) is expected to arrive during P22 resolution, followed by P20 (13 units) in P23. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 179 ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for L+1 periods (estimated 3 periods of demand) plus an offset for the lost units. With an average demand of 90 and L=2, base stock should be ~270 plus safety stock. By setting mu_hat explicitly high (effectively adding the 179 lost units back into the requirement), I force the backend to place an order that treats the ghost units as non-existent.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15, representing the mid-summer demand peak for this SKU (Ginger Thong Maple Low). Demand over the last 9 periods (P14-P22) has averaged 90.1 units/period, significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~47. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 467 units includes a confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 179 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14). Subtracting these, the real pipeline is 288 units (orders from P19, P21, P22). The order from P19 (134 units) is now 4 periods old (ordered P19, now P23) and promised LT is 2; given the history of lost shipments, there is a risk this is also lost, but I will wait one more period before marking it ghost. To offset the 179 'ghost' units in the OR engine's pipeline calculation and cover the elevated summer demand (approx 90/period), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 449. This is calculated as: (1 + L) * Expected Demand + Ghost Correction = (1 + 2) * 90 + 179 = 449. This ensures the OR backend places an order large enough to ignore the 179 units of fake stock it thinks are arriving.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Ghost inventory remains at 179 units (P1, P3, P4, P14). Summer demand regime (May-July) confirmed at ~90 units/period average (+90% over spring baseline).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (2019/7/22), the product (Womens Lingerie) is in the peak of its summer seasonal high demand. Demand over the last 10 periods (P14-P23) has averaged 92.2 units, significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~45. The 'In-transit' figure of 328 units contains 179 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P14), leaving a real pipeline of 149 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that overrides the perceived inventory coverage. Calculating mu_hat: Promised Lead Time (L)=2. Review period + L = 3 periods. 3 * 92.2 (avg demand) = 276.6. To compensate for the 179 'ghost' units, I add 179 to this baseline requirement: 276.6 + 179 = 455.6. Setting mu_hat to 456 via the 'explicit' method ensures the backend targets a base stock that accounts for these lost units while maintaining high service levels for the summer peak. Sigma is set based on the recent higher-volatility regime (N=10).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (July 29, 2019), the 'In-transit' count of 429 units includes 179 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14), which will never arrive. The actual functioning pipeline is 250 units (the order from P24). Demand is currently in a sustained summer high regime. Over the last 11 periods (P14-P24), demand has averaged 90.7 units, significantly above the spring baseline of ~47. I will set mu_hat to explicitly cover 3 periods of demand (L=2 + review period 1) based on this summer average, while also adding a buffer to offset the 179 lost units that the OR backend wrongly subtracts from the order quantity. Calculation: Effective Demand (90.7 * 3) + Ghost Inventory (179) = 451.1. Using 452 for mu_hat ensures the backend places an order that accounts for both the high demand and the system's incorrect assumption about the lost units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=11 to reflect the higher volatility observed in this peak demand period.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Summer demand regime (May-July) remains high, averaging 91 units/period (P14-P24). Ghost inventory from lost shipments is confirmed at 179 units (P1, P3, P4, P14), which must be manually offset in mu_hat calculations to prevent under-ordering.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the summer peak for this product (Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p), with the last 12 periods (P14-P25) showing a stabilized high-demand regime averaging approx 90.5 units/period. The 'In-transit' count of 452 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments. Overdue orders include: P1 (64), P3 (9), P4 (38), P14 (68), and P19 (134). Note that P19 is now 6 periods overdue (promised lead_time 2), so it is added to the ghost count. Total ghost inventory = 64 + 9 + 38 + 68 + 134 = 313 units. The actual/reliable pipeline is therefore 452 - 313 = 139 units (orders from P21, P24, P25). To ensure the OR engine orders enough despite this 313-unit ghost buffer, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target base stock (assuming 91 average demand, L=2) as 3 * 91 = 273. To make the backend order enough to reach 273 while it incorrectly thinks we have 313 extra units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to (Target Base Stock + Ghost Inventory) / (1 + L) = (273 + 313) / 3 = 195.33. This forces the base stock calculation to effectively ignore the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) increased to 313 units. The shipment from Period 19 (134 units) is now 6 periods old (4 periods overdue) and is confirmed lost. This adds to the existing 179 units from P1, P3, P4, and P14.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 27 (mid-August). Demand analysis: The summer demand regime is consistent, with a 7-period average (P20-P26) of approximately 88 units per period. Ghost Inventory Analysis: Total 'In-transit' is 452 units. Based on historical tracking, significant portions of this are lost: P1 (64), P3 (9), P4 (38), P14 (68), and P19 (134). Total confirmed lost = 313 units. This leaves an actual pipeline of 139 units (from P21, P22, P24, P25). However, P21 (123 units) and P22 (16 units) already arrived in P23 according to game history, but for some reason, the backend's 'In-transit' indicator still reflects them or is distorted by previous losses. The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock' to calculate the order. With a reported In-transit of 452 and 313 confirmed lost, the OR engine will severely under-order. We must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 313 lost units. Calculation: (Expected demand over L+1 periods) + (Ghost Inventory offset). Predicted demand per period \u2248 90. For L=2, demand across L+1 = 270. Offset = 313. Goal mu_hat = 270 + 313 = 583. This forces the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28, the in-transit inventory is listed as 560 units. Based on historical data, several shipments are confirmed lost: P1 (64), P3 (9), P4 (38), P14 (68), and P19 (134). This results in a cumulative 'ghost' inventory of 313 units. Subtracting these from the 560 units in-transit leaves a real pipeline of 247 units (specifically the orders from P24 and P27). However, the order from P24 (101 units) is now 4 periods old (2 periods overdue) and should likely be added to the ghost count, bringing total ghost inventory to 414 and actual pipeline to 146. High summer demand (avg ~85 units) has persisted, but mid-August demand shows a slight cooling (avg 66 units last 3 periods). Because the OR engine's 'inventory reconciliation' is blocked by the massive ghost pipeline (it thinks we have 560 coming), I must continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force substantial orders. I set mu_hat based on the current demand (70 units/period) across the lead time (L+1=3) plus a manual offset for the 414 ghost units (414 / 3 = 138). Total required mu_hat = (70 * 3) + 414 = 624. Sigma_hat is set to handle the high summer variance seen in July/August.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Ghost inventory increased to 414 units. The shipment from Period 24 (101 units) is now 2 periods overdue and confirmed lost, joining the previously lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, and P19. Demand is showing a post-summer cooling, averaging 66 units in August vs 91 in July.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for the Ginger Thong has cooled from its July peak (~91 units/period) to an August average of approximately 60.5 units/period (P25-P28: 77, 63, 59, 57). While the summer peak is over, the backend OR logic is severely compromised by a massive cumulative 'ghost pipeline' of 414 units (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, and P24). The reported 'In-transit' is 624, but the actual viable pipeline is only 210 units (624 - 414), which consists of orders from P27 (131 units), P28 (64 units), and any previous gaps. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated 'In-transit' figure, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock sufficient to cover the cooling demand (approx 65 units/period) across the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3), while manually adding back the 414 ghost units to force the OR engine to ignore them in its subtraction logic. Calculation: (65 * 3) + 414 = 609. This ensures the engine places an order that respects current inventory needs without being misled by lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost (lost) inventory in the 'In-transit' count is confirmed at 414 units (Orders: P1=64, P3=9, P4=38, P14=68, P19=134, P24=101). Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: August demand avg ~61 units (-33% from July).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (Sept 2), demand is cooling after the summer peak, averaging 64 units/period in August (vs. ~90 in July). However, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory. The critical issue remains 'ghost' inventory: shipments from P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, and P24 (totaling 414 units) are definitively lost but still show in 'In-transit'. Total In-transit is 624, meaning the 'real' pipeline is only 210 units (from P17, P28). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 414 units of non-existent stock, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. This value includes 3 periods of expected demand (L+1 = 3) at the new regime of 65/period, plus a 414-unit manual offset to negate the ghost inventory. Calculation: (3 * 65) + 414 = 609. I will use 'recent_N' for L (N=10) to reflect the slightly faster actual lead times (1-2 periods) observed recently, and a conservative sigma_hat based on recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling confirmed: August demand stabilized at ~65 units/period. Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains 414 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), we are in the post-summer cooling phase. Demand in August (P27-P30) has averaged 67 units/period, compared to the summer peak (P14-P26) of ~90 units/period. The current in-transit inventory is 429 units, but my detailed tracking confirms that 414 of these units are lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24). Consequently, the actual functioning pipeline is only 15 units (the order from P17). With on-hand inventory at 120 and actual pipeline at 15, the total usable stock is 135 units. The OR backend, seeing 429 in-transit, will massively under-order or not order at all. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * Expected Demand = 3 * 67 = 201 units. To force the OR engine to order despite the perceived 429 units in-transit, I set mu_hat = (Target Base Stock + Ghost Inventory) = 201 + 414 = 615 units. This ensures the engine accounts for the 'missing' 414 units. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=4 to reflect current demand volatility (approx 8.5 per period, scaled by sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 414 units. Actual pipeline is 15 units. Demand for September is stabilized at the post-summer level of ~67 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32, we are in a post-summer demand phase (September). Demand during August and September (Periods 26-31) has stabilized around an average of 66 units/period (compared to the summer peak of ~90). The 'In-transit' count of 495 is misleading due to substantial lost shipments. The 'ghost inventory' is confirmed at 414 units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, and P24). Consequently, the actual functioning pipeline is only 81 units (the order from P31). With 56 units on-hand and 81 units in realistic pipeline, our total effective inventory is 137. To compensate for the 414 units the OR engine incorrectly assumes are coming, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Following the logic: base_stock should cover approximately (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 and demand=66, base_stock should be ~198. To force the engine to order units despite thinking it has 495 in transit, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Base Stock + Ghost Inventory), which is 198 + 414 = 612. I'll set mu_hat to 610 to maintain availability and adjust for the cooling trend.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand has stabilized following the summer peak (May-July ~90 units/period) into a post-summer regime (August-September) averaging approximately 64 units/period. The 'In-transit' figure of 488 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P1 (64), P3 (9), P4 (38), P14 (68), P19 (134), and P24 (101) are confirmed lost, totaling 414 ghost units. The real pipeline consists only of the order from P32 (59 units), which matches the calculation In-transit (488) - Ghost (414) = 74 units (this likely includes the P32 order of 59 and perhaps a small residual or rounding, but confirms the bulk is lost). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to perceived high pipeline stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3) as 3 * 64 = 192 units. To force the backend to place an order that covers the 414-unit gap, I set mu_hat = (Target Base Stock + Ghost Inventory) = 192 + 414 = 606. This ensures the available stock (including real pipeline) reaches the required safety levels despite the system seeing the lost units as available.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sep 30, 2019), the system shows 0 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' figure of 535 units. Based on historical tracking, a significant portion of this pipeline consists of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments. Orders from P1 (64), P3 (9), P4 (38), P14 (68), P19 (134), and P24 (101) are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 414 lost units. Subtracting these from the current 535 units reveals a real pipeline of 121 units (from P32=59 and P33=47, plus potentially P17/P20 residue if any). Recent demand has stabilized after the summer peak, averaging 67 units over the last 5 periods (P29-P33). Because the OR backend 'sees' 535 units in transit, it will under-order significantly unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset the 414 ghost units. Setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Avg_Demand + Ghost_Inventory. With L=2 and Avg_Demand=67, calculation is (3 * 67) + 414 = 615. This forces the system to recognize the need for physical stock despite the reported inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Cumulative ghost (lost) inventory in the In-transit count remains at 414 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24). Current actual pipeline inventory is approximately 106 units (from P32 and P33).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35, the 'In-transit' count is 615 units. However, based on tracking historical orders, 414 units are confirmed lost shipments (P1: 64, P3: 9, P4: 38, P14: 68, P19: 134, P24: 101). These orders are significantly past their lead time and will never arrive. Additionally, the order from Period 15 (148 units) and Period 16 (69 units) arrived in P17, and P18 (76 units) arrived in P19. The recent orders are P31 (66, arrived P32), P32 (59, in-transit), P33 (47, in-transit), and P34 (80, in-transit). The actual viable pipeline is P32+P33+P34 = 59+47+80 = 186 units. The 'ghost' pipeline of 414 units causes the OR engine to think we have sufficient stock, leading to zero orders or under-ordering. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (Expected Demand * (1+L)) + Ghost Inventory. Current demand (Sept-Oct) is averaging ~61 units (P31-P34). With L=2, the required base stock is approximately 61 * 3 = 183 units. Adding the 414 ghost units to this to offset the backend's subtraction gives an explicit mu_hat of 597. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture recent demand volatility (N=5 for P30-P34).

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed ghost (lost) inventory in the In-transit count remains 414 units. Viable pipeline is P32, P33, P34 totaling 186 units. Post-summer demand (Sept-Oct) has stabilized at ~61 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory includes 23 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' count of 556 units. Based on historical tracking, 414 units are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24). The viable pipeline consists of orders from P33 (47 units), P34 (80 units), and P35 (0 units), totaling 127 units. Total effective inventory is 150 units. Demand has transitioned from the summer peak (~91) to a stable post-summer regime. Over the last 6 periods (P30-P35), demand has averaged approximately 59.3 units per period. To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must account for the 414 units of ghost inventory. The current 'In-transit' figure minus ghost inventory equals 142 units. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to these phantom units, I am using an explicit mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on the stable autumn demand of ~60 units/period for (L+1) periods, but significantly increased to offset the 414 ghost units. Without adjustment, the OR logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) would see 556 units and stop ordering entirely. By setting mu_hat = (Target Base Stock + 414), we force the system to maintain an actual stock level of approximately 180 (3 periods of 60). Therefore, mu_hat = 180 + 414 = 594.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37, the total In-transit inventory is 524 units. Analysis confirms that 414 units represent a 'ghost pipeline' of lost shipments (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24), while the remaining 110 units (P34, P36) are viable. Subtracting the ghost inventory from the total In-transit leaves an actual pipeline of 110 units. Demand for the post-summer period (late August to mid-October) has stabilized at approximately 60.5 units/period (average of P27-P36). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 414 ghost units in its pipeline calculation, I must manually inflate mu_hat. I set mu_hat to (1 + L) * 60.5 + 414 = (3 * 60.5) + 414 = 595.5. I will use L=2 based on promised lead time and recent performance, and calculate sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains 414 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24). Post-summer demand regime (Sept-Oct) is stable at ~60.5 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (Oct 28), the product (Womens Lingerie) is in a stable post-summer demand regime. The average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P34-P37) is 45.25 units. However, looking at the full September-October window, demand has averaged ~60 units. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture this stabilization around 60 units. Regarding lead times, recent shipments from P32 and P33 arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, suggesting a slight slowdown from the promised 2. I will set L to 3 to ensure sufficient safety stock. Pipeline Management: The 'In-transit' figure of 575 units is heavily inflated by 414 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24 that never arrived). The actual viable pipeline is 161 units (P34=80, P36=15, P37=51, P15 has an old 15 unit balance). The OR backend sees 575 in transit and will not order. To force an order, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome (In-transit - On-hand). Specifically, to target a base stock and offset the 414 ghost units, I use the explicit method for mu_hat: Calculation: [Target Demand (60) * (L+1)] + Ghost Inventory (414) = [60 * 4] + 414 = 240 + 414 = 654.

As of Period 39 (early November), we are managing SKU 465655019 with a heavy 'In-transit' count of 603 units. However, based on extensive history, 414 units are confirmed lost ('ghost' inventory from P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24). Subtracting these 414 ghost units from the reported 603 leaves a 'real' pipeline of 189 units (orders from P34, P36, P38). Demand has stabilized at a post-summer/autumn regime of ~61 units/period since Period 34. To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must adjust mu_hat to offset the ghost pipeline. Total Target Inventory (On-hand + Pipeline) should satisfy (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, target is ~3*61=183 units. Since the 'real' pipeline is already ~189 units and on-hand is 0, the system is nearly balanced. However, the backend sees 603 in-transit, which would prevent all ordering. To force an order that covers next period's shortfall, I set mu_hat explicitly to offset the 414 ghost units: adjusted_mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Units = (61 * 3) + 414 = 597.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (2019/11/11), the primary challenge remains the 'ghost' inventory within the In-transit figure, which significantly misleads the OR backend's automated ordering logic. Based on the history, total verified lost shipments equal 414 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24). The current In-transit is 588 units, meaning the viable pipeline is actually 174 units (Orders from P38, P34). Current demand shows a post-summer stability averaging ~60-65 units. However, we are entering mid-November; seasonal demand for this category often increases toward the end of the year. To compensate for the 414 units of ghost inventory that prevent the backend from ordering, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. This value (594) is calculated to cover approximately 3 periods of demand at a slightly elevated forecast (approx. 60 units/period) PLUS an offset for the 414 lost units that the backend incorrectly thinks are coming. This forces the system to place an order despite the high reported pipeline. Lead time 'calculate' is used to capture the variability between 1-3 periods observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed ghost inventory remains 414 units. Cumulative demand for September-October has settled at an average of 61 units per period. The 174 'viable' units in transit are from Period 34 (80) and Period 38 (79), plus P37 (51) has arrived. The OR backend requires a significant mu_hat manual offset to account for the lost stock and ensure continuous inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41, the total In-transit inventory stands at 594 units. Based on historical data, 414 units are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24). Subtracting these 'ghost' units, the real pipeline inventory is 180 units (from P34, P38, and P40 orders). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages roughly 48 units, but the Sept-Oct period showed a higher average of ~61 units. Given it represents 'Womens Lingerie' in mid-November, we must prepare for potential late-year demand increases while accounting for the significant inventory deficit created by the ghost units. The OR backend subtracts full In-transit (594) from the base_stock calculation. To prevent the system from nearly stopping orders due to the ghost stock, I am using an explicit mu_hat setting. I calculate the target base stock (Demand over L+1 periods) as ~65 units/period * 3 periods = 195 units. However, I must add the 414 ghost units to this target so that when the backend subtracts 594, it still triggers an order sufficient to cover real demand. Target \u03bc\u0302 = 195 (Real) + 414 (Ghost) = 609.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Confirmed ghost inventory remains 414 units. Real pipeline is approximately 180 units. Explicit mu_hat of 609 is required to offset the 414 ghost units being subtracted by the backend's internal logic, targeting a real service level based on 65 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), the system faces a significant 'ghost inventory' issue where 414 units represent lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24) still counted in 'In-transit'. This severely impacts the OR backend's order calculation. Current demand has dropped from the summer peak (~90) to a winter baseline of ~30-40 units (average of P39-P41 is 31.3 units). With On-hand at 0 and the In-transit figure of 609 units being dominated by 414 ghost units, the real pipeline is only 195 units (Orders P34, P38, P40, P41). To ensure the backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 414 ghost units being subtracted from the base stock targets, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I target a base stock sufficient for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~40 units/period (total 120 units) PLUS a manual offset of 414 units to neutralize the ghost inventory recorded by the system. Thus, mu_hat is set to 534 (120 + 414). This should trigger the OR engine to place an order that covers actual demand while accounting for the reporting error in pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Winter demand transition confirmed; recent 3-period demand average is 31.3 units. Ghost inventory remains constant at 414 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the product (Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p) has entered a high-demand winter phase, as evidenced by a massive demand spike of 159 units in Period 42. This likely indicates a seasonal promotion or Black Friday/pre-holiday surge. My previously identified ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 414 units. The reported 'In-transit' is 609 units, meaning the actual viable pipeline is 195 units (609 - 414). To ensure the OR engine actually orders stock despite subtracting 414 'ghost' units from its calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Given the recent demand surge to 159 units, although the 3-period average was lower, I need to protect against continued high winter demand. A base demand forecast of 160 units per period over L+1 (3 periods) requires a total stock of 480 units. To offset the 414 ghost units subtracted by the backend logic, the final mu_hat must be (480 + 414) / 1 = approximately 894 to ensure a net order is placed that refills the empty on-hand stock and accounts for the high seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Winter/Holiday demand peak confirmed with P42 demand of 159 units (+160% vs fall baseline). Ghost inventory remains 414 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44, heading into the December holiday season. Demand in the most recent period (P43) was 50 units, following a massive spike of 159 in P42, confirming the holiday/winter peak regime. The average demand for the last 3 weeks is ~78 units. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 873 is heavily inflated by 414 units of confirmed ghost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24). The OR backend's inventory balancing logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will subtract this entire 414 units from its order calculation. To counteract this 'ghost' deduction and maintain stock for the holiday peak, I must boost mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock level that supports ~85 units/period for (L+1) periods, plus a buffer. With L=2 (promised), (1+L) * 85 = 255. Adding the 414 ghost offset results in a mu_hat target of 669. While the 'In-transit' also includes the large P43 order (285) which is likely viable, the engine's capped policy and the current zero on-hand situation necessitate a high mu_hat to ensure the backend actually places an order if needed to cover potential lead-time delays or further demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Holiday peak confirms a demand regime of ~80 units; cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains 414 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday season (Period 45). Demand historical analysis shows a major spike in P42 (159 units) followed by a stabilization around 40-50 units in P43-P44. The SKU (lingerie) typically sees elevated demand during the holiday period. Our primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24), totaling 414 units. These units are counted in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. The current In-transit is 873; subtracting 414 units gives a real pipeline of 459 units (predominantly the large P43 order of 285 units). With on-hand at 0, the backend's base-stock logic will subtract the full 873 units, likely leading to zero or insufficient ordering. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target coverage: 2 periods of lead time + 1 period of current demand = 3 periods. Applying a forecast of ~80 units/period (accounting for holiday volatility and the P42 spike) totals 240 units. To offset the 414 lost units, I set mu_hat to 240 + 414 = 654 units. This ensures the OR engine places an order that ignores the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 414 units. Holiday demand regime is volatile, with a peak of 159 (P42) and recent average of ~80 per period. Real pipeline inventory is approximately 459 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the December holiday demand peak (Period 46, Dec 23). Recent demand has been highly volatile but elevated: 159 (P42), 50 (P43), 39 (P44), and 119 (P45), averaging 91.75 units over the last 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 166 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 588 units contains 414 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, and P24 that never arrived), leaving a real pipeline of 174 units (from P34 and P38?). However, P34 (80 units) and P38 (79 units) are now 12 and 8 periods old respectively, and promised lead time is 2. This suggests P34 and P38 are also lost. If P34 and P38 are lost, the total ghost inventory is actually 573, meaning the real pipeline is effectively zero. To ensure we keep stock for the post-Christmas/New Year period, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * Expected Demand + safety. With L=2, (3 * 80) = 240 units. Since the OR backend will subtract the 588 'In-transit' units from any base stock calculation, I must set mu_hat to cover both the target inventory AND the ghost inventory to force an order. Total mu_hat \u2248 240 (target) + 588 (ghost offset) = 828.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Shipments from Period 34 (80 units) and Period 38 (79 units) are significantly overdue (12 and 8 periods respectively) and are now considered lost. Total cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) in the In-transit count is updated to 573 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P34, P38).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the post-holiday/New Year period (Dec 30). Demand has been volatile, with a huge peak in Period 42 (159 units) followed by a stabilizing average of approximately 80 units over the last three periods (39, 119, 79). Ghost inventory (lost shipments) has increased to a cumulative 573 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P34, P38). The reported 'In-transit' of 662 units contains these 573 ghost units, meaning the actual pipeline is only 89 units (the order from P46 for 74 units + potentially minor residuals). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the high (but fake) In-transit figure, I am using an explicit mu_hat. I target a base stock covering 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at a forecasted demand of 80 units/period = 240 units. To this, I add the 573 ghost units that the backend will subtract: 240 + 573 = 813. This ensures the backend calculates an order that maintains a real safety stock around 240 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Shipments from Period 34 (80 units) and Period 38 (79 units) are considered lost (12 and 8 periods overdue). Total cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) in the In-transit count is now 573 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P34, P38).
