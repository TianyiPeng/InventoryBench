Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 682550001 (Uno Hood). The product is a jersey basic hoodie. Analyzing the historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4), we see a significant spike on 2019-01-21 (110 units), while other weeks range from 34 to 50. The average demand across these 5 weeks is 56.8 units/period with a standard deviation of 30.6. There aren't enough samples to confirm a sustained regime change yet, but the promised lead time is 2 periods. Therefore, the target horizon (1+L) is 3 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L to respect the promised lead time of 2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture all available history while allowing for future flexibility. The OR backend will compute a base stock to cover expected demand and a safety buffer based on the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), aiming for a 50% service level offset by the 'cap' logic.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a staple hoodie. In Period 1, we ordered 107 units with a promised lead time of 2. This order is in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). In Period 1, demand was 37 (historical mean is approx 57), but we had zero on-hand inventory, resulting in 0 sales. Current inventory is 0 on-hand, 107 in-transit. For Period 2, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Historical samples: 45, 45, 110, 34, 50, and most recently 37 in Period 1. The average demand is approximately 53.5. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat should be around (1+2)*53.5 = 160.5. Given we only have 107 in-transit and 0 on-hand, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock level. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include all available weekly data points including the latest observation of 37.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history shows a mean of approximately 54 units/period (samples: 45, 45, 110, 34, 50, 37, 47), though there was a significant spike of 110 in mid-January. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals from orders in Period 1 and 2 (L=2) are expected in Period 3 and Period 4 respectively, based on the promised lead time. Since L=2, the OR logic needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Using the mean demand of ~54, 3 periods of demand is ~162. Our pipeline (in-transit) is 161, which is almost exactly at the base stock level required for a 3-period horizon. For parameters: L will remain 'default' (2). I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand statistics from the provided history and game play, ensuring the OR backend maintains a stock level that accounts for the observed volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a basic hoodie (Uno Hood), which typically sees stable demand but can be sensitive to early spring season shifts. Historical demand samples (45, 45, 110, 34, 50) and recent game history (37, 47, 49) show a relatively stable mean around 50 units/period, with the exception of one spike. The promised lead time is 2 periods. We ordered 107 units in Period 1. Based on a lead time of 2, these units are expected to arrive during Period 3's Arrival Resolution phase and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests either a delay (lead time > 2) or a misunderstood arrival sequence. Following the strict timing rules: an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives in P3 and is seen in the P4 decision. Therefore, we should see the P1 order (107 units) in the next update (Period 4 conclude). Currently, on-hand is 0 and we have missed sales for 3 periods. I will maintain the base stock logic to cover the lead time + review period (3 periods of demand). Using recent_N=3 for demand captures the recent stability (avg ~44). L is kept at default (2).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic zip-up hoodie. The current date is March 11, 2019. Historically, demand has been relatively stable around 40-50 units per week (except for one spike to 110 in late January). The current on-hand inventory is low (14 units) due to a stock-out in the first three periods caused by lead time. Period 4 concluded with an arrival from a Period 2 order (lead_time = 2, as promised). However, the Period 1 order (107 units) is still missing. Since Period 4 conclude showed a Period 2 arrival, and nothing about the Period 1 order, the Period 1 order is likely lost or significantly delayed. To compensate for this potential loss and ensure inventory levels recover, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (P-1 to P4) to capture current demand levels (average ~44 units/period), but I will use the 'explicit' method for L to ensure the backend projects coverage for the promised 2-period lead time plus the review period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P6 (2019-03-18). Examining history: P1 order (107 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods elapsed, promised L=2), suggesting a lost shipment. Only the P2 order arrived (at P4, L=2). The product 'Uno Hood' is a jersey/sweatshirt basic. Demand history (samples + P1-P5) shows: 45, 45, 110, 34, 50 (samples), then 37, 47, 49, 40, 34 (realized). The spike of 110 in late January was likely an outlier. Average realized demand is ~41.4 units/period. The pipeline only contains the P5 order (13 units) because the P1 order is likely lost; however, the 'In-transit' count (120) still includes the lost P1 units (107 + 13 = 120). To ensure the OR backend ignores the 'phantom' 107 units and places a significant replenishment, mu_hat needs to be set high or L adjusted. Since the backend calculates 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)', and pipeline_inventory is inflated by 107 units, I will use 'explicit' values to force a higher base_stock and replenish the current zero on-hand status. I'll estimate mu_hat based on (1+L)*mean demand \u2248 3 * 45 = 135, but add a buffer to offset the lost 107 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (107 units) suspected lost: 5 periods elapsed with no arrival vs promised lead time of 2.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU 682550001 is a hoodie. Historical demand averages ~51 units/period with a slight uptick in the last week (63 units). Lead time is volatile: P1 order (107 units) is definitely lost (6 periods elapsed vs promised 2), while the P5 order arrived in 1 period, and the P2 order arrived in 2. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 192 units (P6 order of 92 units + the lost P1 units of 100 which the OR backend still counts). Since the OR backend calculates 'pipeline_inventory' as 'total in-transit', the lost P1 units are causing it to under-order. To compensate, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for (1+L) periods of demand plus the 'missing' 107 units. Estimated mean demand is ~50. For L=2, mu_hat should ideally be (1+2)*50 = 150. To offset the 107 units the OR thinks we have but don't, I'll set mu_hat to 257. This forces the backend to place an order despite the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set to a recent window to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: P1 order of 107 units is confirmed lost (6 periods since order, no arrival). OR backend 'pipeline_inventory' is inflated by 107 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/01. Demand for the Uno Hood is steady, averaging 44.7 units over 7 periods. However, stockouts have occurred because the Period 1 order (107 units) is confirmed lost, which the OR backend still counts in 'pipeline_inventory'. Currently, the OR engine sees 257 in-transit units, but 107 of those will never arrive, meaning the true pipeline is 150 units. To force the OR backend to order more and compensate for this 107-unit shortfall, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Calculation: Target weekly demand is ~45. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the decision window is L+1 = 3 weeks. Expected demand over 3 weeks is 135 units. To offset the 107 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 135 + 107 = 242. This ensures the base stock (mu_hat + safety stock) is high enough that 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' results in a positive order. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility in arrival times (observed lead times of 1 and 2 periods).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019-04-08), we observe an on-hand inventory of 74 units. The historical demand for this hoodie (Uno Hood) shows significant volatility with recent spikes (last 5 periods avg: 51.2, but P8 was 76). The critical issue is the 'In-transit' quantity of 107 units, which corresponds to the Period 1 order confirmed lost in carry-over insights. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to determine order size. Since 107 units are 'phantom' stock, the OR backend thinks we are overstocked and will not order, leading to stockouts. To fix this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods at a conservative recent mean of ~57 units (reflecting the upward trend), plus a safety buffer for volatility. Total target = 3 * 57 + buffer \u2248 210. To force the backend to place an order despite the 107 phantom units and 74 on-hand units, mu_hat must be set high enough so that (mu_hat - [74 + 107]) produces the desired replenishment. Setting mu_hat to 260 ensures the backend attempts to bridge the gap created by the lost shipment. L remains 'calculate' to reflect the observed average lead time (recently 1-2 periods).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/04/15). The SKU is a 'Divided Basics' Hoodie. Historical demand samples (before P1) were around 45-50 with one spike of 110. From P1-P9, demand has averaged 49.7 units per week, showing relative stability despite some fluctuations (min 34, max 76). The P1 order of 107 units is definitively lost, confirmed by 8 periods of non-arrival. This is critical because the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes all unarrived orders. With 'In-transit' currently at 186 (79 from P9 + 107 lost from P1), the backend will underestimate the required order by exactly 107 units if left to its own devices. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Mean demand = ~50. L=2 (promised). Required base stock level (mu_hat) normally = (1+L)*demand = 3*50 = 150. To offset the 107-unit phantom pipeline, I set mu_hat = 150 + 107 = 257. This forces the OR backend to place an order that ignores the lost 107 units. For L, I use 'calculate' as lead times have varied between 1 and 2. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=9) to capture the standard deviation of the current game's demand history.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/04/22), we observe that the hoodie (SKU 682550001) has a current on-hand inventory of 72. The in-transit inventory of 159 includes 107 units from Period 1 that are confirmed lost (ordered 10 periods ago, promised lead time 2). This means the true pipeline inventory is actually 52 units (ordered in Period 10). Because the OR backend 'pipeline_inventory' includes the lost 107 units, it will under-order unless we compensate. To fix this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that factors in the lost units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (63, 43, 76, 55, 26) is 52.6. With an effective lead time (L) of approximately 1.5 (mix of 1s and 2s), we need to cover (1+L) = 2.5 periods of demand, which is ~132 units. To prevent the backend from seeing 159 units and ordering zero, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high (239) to 'trick' the logic: (239 - 159) = 80 units desired net position. This ensures the OR backend places a small order to keep stock flowing while accounting for the 'ghost' inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a basic hoodie. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized around an average of 47.6 units, down from a peak of 76 in Period 8. The Period 1 order (107 units) is definitely lost, which inflates the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation by 107 units. To correct for this, I must set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My target base stock is (1+L)*mean + z*sigma. With L=2 (promised), z is approximately 0 (since profit=holding_cost=1.0, q=0.5, and \u03a6\u22121(0.5)=0), so base stock \u2248 3 * 47.6 = 142.8. However, the OR backend sees 167 (In-transit) + 34 (On-hand) = 201 units. To force an order despite the phantom 107 units, I will set mu_hat to (142.8 + 107) = 249.8. This ensures the backend calculates (249.8 - (167+34)) = 48.8 as the needed order, rather than ordering nothing. I use L=2 and recent demand N=5 for sigma_hat.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a core sweatshirt/hoodie (Uno Hood). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 48.2 units over the 12 periods (history) and 51.4 over the 5 pre-game samples. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is 49.8. I am using recent_N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 to capture this stability. The pipeline inventory is currently 216 units, but 107 units from Period 1 are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (216) from the base_stock, it will under-order. To compensate for the 107 phantom units in the backend's calculation, I am using 'explicit' L and \u03bc\u0302. I set L=2 (promised) and \u03bc\u0302 = (1+L) * Forecast + LostUnits = (1+2)*50 + 107 = 257. This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to ignore the lost 107 units. \u03c3\u0302 is set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 682550001 (Uno Hood) is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline inventory of 249 units. However, 107 units from Period 1 reflect a confirmed lost shipment that the OR backend still considers part of the 'pipeline_inventory'. This effectively reduces our real pipeline to 142 units (orders from P12 and P13). At the current date (May 13), demand has been relatively stable, averaging 46.5 units over the last 13 periods; the recent 3-period average is 44. Since the OR backend subtracts the (inflated) pipeline from the base stock calculation, I will use 'explicit' values for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to compensate. I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) plus the 107 lost units to ensure the OR backend places an order that bridges the actual inventory gap. Demand: mean ~46, std ~20. Target mu_hat = (3 * 46) + 107 = 245. Target sigma_hat = (sqrt(3) * 20) = 35.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a basic hoodie with consistent but slightly seasonal demand. Analysis of recent history shows demand for the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has averaged around 38 units. Inventory is currently tight with only 17 on-hand. Crucially, the P1 order of 107 units is confirmed lost (now 14 periods elapsed), which causes the OR backend to over-calculate 'pipeline_inventory' and under-order. To compensate for this 107-unit phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating required stock for (L+1=3) periods: 3 periods * 38 units/period = 114 units. To offset the 107-unit deficit caused by the lost shipment, I set mu_hat to 114 + 107 = 221. Lead time (L) remains 2 periods based on 'calculate' logic. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect current volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Uno Hood' has remained relatively stable (mean ~44 units/period), with no significant seasonal spike observed in the spring months. The primary issue is the phantom 'in-transit' inventory. As noted in the carry-over insights, the 107 units ordered in Period 1 were never received and are confirmed lost. However, the OR backend logic still counts these units in the 'pipeline_inventory' (total in-transit is 204, but actual expected units are 204 - 107 = 97). This inflation causes the OR engine to under-order. To compensate and ensure we satisfy demand for the Review + Lead periods (3 periods total), I am using 'explicit' L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. I set mu_hat to (1+L)*mean + lost_units (3 * 44 + 107 = 239) and sigma_hat to a slightly elevated value (30) to provide a safety buffer against the stockouts observed in periods 12, 13, and 15.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. The product is a hoodie, which typically experiences stable demand during late spring/early summer, though Period 16 saw a spike to 82 units. The P1 order of 107 units is confirmed lost, inflating the pipeline inventory by 107 units in the OR backend's calculation. To compensate for this ghost inventory and ensure the system actually orders, mu_hat must be adjusted upwards. I will set mu_hat to be 'explicit' with a value that covers (1 + lead_time) periods of demand plus the lost 107 units. Estimated mean demand is ~47 units/period (average of last 5: 50.2). With a lead time of 2, (1+2)*47 = 141. Adding the lost 107 units gives a mu_hat of ~248. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility. Lead time calculation is stable around 1.5-2 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a hoodie, and we are moving away from peak spring demand towards a flatter summer period, though demand spiked to 82 units recently (Period 16). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'in-transit' count is 209 units, but 107 of these (from Period 1) are confirmed lost, meaning the effective pipeline is only 102 units (orders from P13, P14, P17 are not yet concluded but P14 was actually order=0, and P13 was 41 units). However, the OR backend sees the full 209 in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation. To force the OR backend to order sufficiently despite this 107-unit phantom inflation, I must set mu_hat (target inventory) significantly higher. Historical demand mean is approximately 45. Promised lead time is 2, so usually mu_hat would be (1+2)*45 = 135. Adding the lost 107 units to this target results in ~242. To be safe against stockouts given the recent demand volatility and the lead time variability (which fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods), I will set mu_hat to 260 and maintain a higher volatility estimate (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Lead time variability continues (P15=2 days, P16=1 day). Phantom pipeline inventory remains +107 units due to the lost P1 order.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a lightweight hoodie ('Uno Hood'), which generally sees stable demand heading into summer but remains a 'Divided Basics' staple. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has averaged approximately 46.5 units per period over the last 10 periods, though it varies between 26 and 82. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. Critically, the Period 1 order (107 units) is confirmed lost, yet it remains in the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory'. This 'phantom inventory' prevents the backend from ordering sufficient stock. To override this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock level of (L+1) * Mean + Z * Sigma. With L=2, a mean of 47, and assuming a z-score for 50% service level (since profit=holding cost), the target base stock is ~141. However, since the backend subtracts 107 phantom units and the current active pipeline (P17, P18 orders) is 60 units (9 + 51), the OR backend sees 167 in transit. To force an order that replenishes the stock despite the phantom units, I must set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat - 167) results in a meaningful order. I will set mu_hat to 260 to ensure enough units are ordered to cover current demand and recover from the stockout caused by the lost shipment.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a basic hoodie, which typically sees stable demand but may vary with weather or sales events. The primary issue is the phantom 'in-transit' inventory of 107 units from Period 1 that never arrived. The system currently shows 209 in-transit, but 107 of that is the lost shipment, meaning the actual pipeline is only 102 (P13: 41, P17: 9, P18: 52 - wait, P18 arrived in P19. Let's re-calculate pipeline: P13 = 41, P17 = 9, P19 = 0. Total physical pipeline = 41 + 9 = 50). The OR backend sees 209 (the 107 lost + 41 + 9 + 52 + 0 ... actual current in-transit including recent orders). To compensate for the 107 units that the backend *thinks* are coming but aren't, I will increase the 'mu_hat' value explicitly. Historical mean demand is approx 47 units/period. With L=2, the base stock targets (1+L)=3 periods of demand (~141 units). Since the backend subtracts the phantom 107 from its order, I will set mu_hat to cover the actual expected demand PLUS the lost 107 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) avg: (43+82+43+39+32)/5 = 47.8. Target mu_hat = (3 * 47.8) + 107 = 250.4. Using N=5 for sigma to capture recent volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-01. The product 'Uno Hood' is a basic hoodie. Recent demand (P17-P20) shows a slight dip (avg ~35) compared to earlier spring patterns, though it remains relatively stable around the global mean (~45). The major issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory: the P1 order of 107 units is confirmed lost, but the OR engine still counts it in 'pipeline_inventory'. Consequently, the engine's calculation of 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' will under-order by exactly 107 units unless mu_hat is artificially inflated. At Period 21, on-hand is 0 and visible in-transit is 232 (which includes the 107 lost units). To compensate for the 107 lost units and meet a cycle demand of approximately 135 units (3 periods * 45 units/period), I am setting mu_hat to 242 (135 target + 107 offset). Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect the promised 2-period horizon despite recent 1-period arrivals, providing a safety buffer for the base stock calculation. Sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent variance (root(3)*std of recent demand).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 682550001 (Uno Hood) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Period 21 concluded with 0 on-hand and 54 demand units lost. The date is July 8th; demand remains fairly stable (mean ~44 units/period), with no significant seasonal spike observed in early July. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods. A critical issue remains: the 107 units ordered in Period 1 were confirmed lost as of Period 7, but they still artificially inflate the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory'. Consequently, the OR engine under-orders because it believes those units are coming. To counteract this 'phantom' inventory and prevent stockouts, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat to (1+L) * mean_demand + 107. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 44) + 107 = 239. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + z*sigma) covers the missing 107 units so the actual order placed by the backend is sufficient.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-July (Period 23). The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic Hoodie'. Demand remains relatively stable with the last 5 periods averaging 41 units (39, 32, 25, 54, 55). The 'In-transit' figure of 219 units is severely inflated by the lost Period 1 order (107 units), which the OR backend still counts because it has not 'concluded.' Specifically, the current OR pipeline inventory comprises: 107 (P1, lost) + 41 (P13, overdue?) + 9 (P17, overdue?) + 51 (P18... wait, P18 arrived in P19) + 10 (P21) + 2 units. Looking at history: P13 (41 units) and P17 (9 units) should have arrived by now (lead times vary 1-2). If they are lost, the functional pipeline is even lower. Total current 'In-transit' 219 - 107 (P1 lost) - 41 (P13 likely lost) - 9 (P17 likely lost) = 62 units actually expected. To force the OR backend to order despite the 'phantom' 107+41+9=157 units, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the (L+1) demand PLUS the phantom inventory. Estimated (L+1) demand is 3 * 41 = 123. mu_hat = 123 + 157 = 280. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Period 13 (41 units) and Period 17 (9 units) are now also suspected lost/delayed as they are 10+ and 6 periods past order date respectively. Total phantom pipeline inventory is now 157 units (107 + 41 + 9).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 682550001 (Uno Hood) has remained stable around a mean of 47.7 units over the last 23 weeks, with no clear evidence of seasonal shifts during summer. A major issue is the 'phantom' pipeline inventory: three orders (Period 1: 107 units, Period 13: 41 units, Period 17: 9 units) are now effectively confirmed lost, totaling 157 units. These units are counted as 'in-transit' by the OR backend but will never arrive, leading to severe under-ordering. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat and sigma_hat significantly to force a higher base stock that accounts for this 157-unit deficit. The total in-transit is 270, but real in-transit is only 113. Setting mu_hat using 'explicit' allows me to manually inflate the target inventory levels to offset these lost units and ensure the OR engine places an order despite the fake pipeline visibility.

Carry-over insight: P1, P13, and P17 orders (157 units total) are definitively lost. Real In-Transit is only 113 units (270 total - 157 lost). Policy must compensate for 157 unit deficit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for the 'Uno Hood' remains relatively stable around 44 units/period (mean of last 10 periods is 45.2). The primary challenge is the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Orders from Period 1 (107 units), Period 13 (41 units), and Period 17 (9 units) totaling 157 units are confirmed lost, but the OR backend still sees them in the 'pipeline_inventory'. Consequently, the order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will be 157 units lower than intended. To force the engine to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat. With a promised Lead Time (L) of 2, the backend uses (1+L) * mean. To compensate for a 157-unit deficit when L=2, I need to add approximately 52 units (157 / 3) to the forecasted mean demand. The recent mean demand is ~45; thus, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (45 + 52) * 3 = 291. For sigma_hat, I'll use the recent variation (std dev of last 10 periods \u2248 16) scaled by sqrt(1+L), which is approximately 16 * 1.73 = 28.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 26 (August 5). The product is a hoodie (H&M Divided Basics), typically seeing a demand increase in late Q3/Q4 as autumn approaches. Current demand remains stable at approximately 41 units/period (mean of last 5 periods). A significant issue persists with 'phantom' pipeline inventory: orders from P1 (107), P13 (41), and P17 (9) are definitively lost, totaling 157 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 310 units includes these 157 lost units, meaning the real pipeline is only 153 units (310 - 157). Since the backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' to subtract from the base stock, an inflated pipeline leads to under-ordering. To compensate, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Predicted mean demand = 41. L=2. Normal mu_hat = (1+2)*41 = 123. To offset the 157 units the backend thinks we have (but don't), I add 157 to the mu_hat. Adjusted mu_hat = 123 + 157 = 280. This forces the OR backend to place an order that covers the physical deficit. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility while ignoring the large phantom lead-time outliers.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 682550001 (Uno Hood) is a sweatshirt/jacket. Current date is mid-August (2019/8/12). Historically, demand for this item has been relatively stable with a mean around 45 units per week, but variability is observed. The key challenge is 'phantom inventory'. We have 157 units across Periods 1 (107), 13 (41), and 17 (9) that are confirmed/highly likely lost but still count towards the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory'. The system reports 249 units in-transit, but the usable in-transit is only 92 (249 - 157). Also, Period 23's order just arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, indicating actual lead time is drifting higher than the promised 2. To force the OR backend to ignore the 157 phantom units and place a fresh order, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. Forecast is ~45 units. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 45 + 157 = 292. This informs the backend that we need 292 units for the system to consider the pipeline 'filled', effectively neutralizing the 157 'ghost' units and securing enough stock for the next 3 weeks of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time drift confirmed: P23 order arrived at P26 (LT=3). Pipeline inventory still contains 157 units of lost stock (P1, P13, P17).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 682550001 (Uno Hood) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The primary operational challenge is a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 157 units (orders from P1, P13, and P17) which the OR backend still considers 'In-transit' but have been confirmed lost according to history and carry-over insights. Total In-transit is 259, but effective In-transit is only 102 (259 - 157). To compensate for this 157-unit deficit and prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 41 units. With a lead time L=2 (plus the review period), expected demand across (L+1) periods is ~123 units. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 280 (123 + 157), I bridge the gap caused by the lost units. I am setting L to 'calculate' to account for recent lead-time drift (P23 arrived with LT=3) and maintaining sigma_hat using 'recent_N' to capture the current volatility of roughly 12-15 units per period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August, approaching the back-to-school season which typically sees increased demand for basics like hoodies. Demand has been relatively consistent, averaging around 42 units per period over the last 10 samples. The primary concern continues to be 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Orders from Period 1 (107 units), Period 13 (41 units), and Period 17 (9 units) totaling 157 units are confirmed lost, as they are significantly past both the promised (2) and recently observed (3) lead times. The OR backend sees 280 units in-transit, but only 123 are 'real' (orders from P24, P27, P28). To compensate for this 157-unit deficit and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a forecast of 45 units/period for (L+1) periods, then add 157 to offset the internal pipeline error. L is set to 3 to reflect the most recent arrival (P23 arrived at P26). Target Base Stock = (45 * 4) + (z * sigma * sqrt(4)). With Profit=Holding=$1, the target service level q=0.5 (z=0). Thus, Base Stock = 180 + 157 = 337.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. The product is a zipper hoodie, which typically sees demand growth as autumn approaches in September. Historical demand is currently stable around a mean of 42. Based on 'Carry-over Insights', there are 157 units (107 from P1, 41 from P13, 9 from P17) in the pipeline inventory that are confirmed lost. The OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock target; therefore, to compensate for these phantom units and prevent under-ordering, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (1+L) plus the 157 lost units. With promised L=2, (1+L)=3 periods. Mean demand is ~42. Base mu_hat = 3 * 42 = 126. Total mu_hat = 126 + 157 = 283. For L, although one shipment took 3 periods, most arrive in 1-2; I'll use 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the average observed performance. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' as demand volatility remains within normal bounds for this SKU.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the SKU 682550001 (Hoodie) is entering the fall/winter peak season. Historical demand shows a mean of ~44 units/period, but recent volatility and the product type (Sweatshirt/Hoodie) suggest demand will likely scale upwards as temperatures drop in September/October. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods (e.g., P27 arrived in 3 periods). More critically, there is a cumulative 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 157 units from lost orders (P1: 107, P13: 41, P17: 9). The OR backend sees 306 units in-transit, but only 149 units are actually expected (306 - 157 = 149). To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on (L+1) periods of demand plus the 157 unit deficit. Calculation: Expected demand (L+1) = 3 * 50 = 150. Target base stock = 150 + 157 (deficit) = 307. This ensures the backend places an order to cover current demand despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma is set high (recent_N=10) to account for high volatility (0 sales due to stockouts).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 682550001 (Hoodie) is currently enterening a peak seasonal period (mid-September). Historical demand averages around 43 units/period, but recently spiked to 50 and 59. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture this upward trend while accounting for the lead time L=3. Significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory exists: orders from P1 (107), P13 (41), P17 (9), and P24 (40) are now all beyond reasonable delivery windows (L=2-3) and appear lost, totaling 197 units. The system sees In-transit: 307, but real In-transit is roughly 110 (P29: 57, P31: 1, and the current order). To force the OR backend (which subtracts the full 307) to place an order, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. calculation: Target Base Stock = (1+L)*demand + safety. With L=3, demand=45, Target=~180. To offset the 197 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to Target + 197 = 377. This ensures the policy order = min(377 - 307, cap) results in a meaningful replenishment to prevent continued stockouts.

Carry-over insight: P24 order (40 units) is now 8 periods overdue and definitively lost. Total phantom pipeline inventory is 197 units (P1: 107, P13: 41, P17: 9, P24: 40).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are entering a period where demand for hoodies is expected to rise as autumn progresses. Historical demand for the last few periods (P30-P32) has shown an increasing trend (50, 59, 94), with the last period reaching a peak of 94. My primary concern is the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 376 units includes 197 units from lost orders (P1: 107, P13: 41, P17: 9, P24: 40). This leaves an actual effective pipeline of only 179 units. To compensate for this 197-unit deficit and the rising seasonal demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate a forward-looking weekly demand of 80 units (based on recent trends and hoodie seasonality). With an effective lead time (L) of 2, the total required stock for (L+1) periods is 240 units. To neutralize the 197 phantom units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, I must add them to the mu_hat parameter. Thus, mu_hat = 240 + 197 = 437. sigma_hat is set to roughly 25% of the forecasted demand over 3 periods to maintain a high service level during the stock-out phase.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, entering October. The SKU is a hoodie (seasonal autumn/winter item). Demand has surged significantly starting in Period 33 (140 units), alignment with seasonal patterns for sweatshirts. The average demand of the last 5 samples is approx 72 units, but Period 33's spike suggests a standard 40-50 average is now obsolete. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (59, 94, 140) to capture this rise (+/- 97 avg). The total 'phantom' pipeline inventory (lost orders) is 197 units (Periods 1, 13, 17, 24). The OR backend sees 437 in-transit units, but only 240 (437-197) are physically arriving. To compensate for the backend's overestimation of stock, I will use an 'explicit' L of 5 (instead of 2) which effectively increases the base stock target, and 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure we cover the seasonal peak. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, so L=2 remains a fair estimate for arrival, but I use the parameter settings to force higher ordering to offset the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand surge confirmed: Period 33 demand reached 140, more than double the previous 5-period average (approx 51). High seasonal volatility expected for October/November.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a confirmed seasonal demand surge for the 'Uno Hood' hoodie as we enter October (Period 35). Demand peaked at 140 in Period 33 and was 74 in Period 34, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~50. I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on this upward regime, resulting in a forecast of 91 units per period. Regarding the pipeline inventory: the OR backend sees 460 units in-transit, but 197 of these (from Periods 1, 13, 17, and 24) are definitively lost. The true pipeline inventory is 263. To force the OR backend to place an order that accounts for the 197-unit deficit, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Following the logic (1+L) * \u03bc: With L set to 2 (promised), mu_hat should be 3 * 91 = 273. However, I must add the 197 lost units to this target to ensure the backend replenishment logic (base_stock - pipeline) triggers a sufficient order despite the phantom 197 units in the pipeline. Thus, mu_hat = 273 + 197 = 470. I will use 'explicit' sigma_hat = 80 to account for high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand surge for hoodies sustained: average demand for P32-P34 is 102.6 units vs historical ~50.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the product (hoodie) is in a clear seasonal upswing. Demand over the last 4 periods has averaged 97.5 units, significantly higher than the historical baseline of approx 50. I will focus on this recent regime (N=4). Regarding inventory: On-hand is 0. Total In-transit is listed as 400. However, the 'Carry-over Insights' confirm that 197 units of the pipeline are definitively lost (P1, P13, P17, P24). The 'real' pipeline is 203 units (400 - 197). The OR backend is unaware of these losses and 'sees' 400 units in transit, which prevents it from ordering enough to meet the 97.5 mean demand across the (L+1) window. To force the backend to place an order, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. I estimate a lead time of 3 (recent average including P23 and P32 arrivals), requiring a base stock covering 4 periods (3+1) of demand. Calculation: 4 * 97.5 = 390. To compensate for the 197 phantom units the backend thinks I have, I set mu_hat to 390 + 197 = 587. This ensures the backend calculates an order requirement despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility of the current seasonal spike.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 682550001 (zip-up hoodie) is in its peak seasonal demand period as we move into late October. Demand in the last four periods (P33-P36) has averaged 95.7 units (140, 74, 82, 87), which is a significant sustained shift from the previous average of ~50. Lead times have also fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with a recent mode of 3 for larger shipments. A major constraint is the 'phantom' pipeline inventory: orders from P1, P13, P17, and P24 (totaling 197 units) are confirmed lost but still count towards the OR backend's pipeline calculations. Therefore, to ensure the backend actually places an order, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the 197 units of lost stock. For Period 37, I'll use L=3 to be safe given recent delays. Expected demand over (1+3)=4 periods is ~383 units. Adding the 197 lost units gives a target mu_hat of 580. This ensures the backend doesn't prematurely stop ordering due to the 'frozen' in-transit numbers.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand for hoodies confirmed: P33-P36 average is 95.7 units/period (+90% vs early year).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late October, approaching peak seasonal demand for hoodies. The recent demand regime (P33-P37) shows an average of 95.8 units/period, with the most recent sample at 96. This is significantly higher than the early-year average (~50). Additionally, there is a cumulative 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 197 units (Orders P1, P13, P17, P24) which have never arrived and are confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The OR backend sees 580 units in transit, but 197 of those do not exist, meaning real pipeline is 383. To compensate for the 0 on-hand inventory and the backend's belief that we have 197 more units than we actually do, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate demand for the next (L+1) periods (3 periods) to be ~288. To force an order that accounts for the 197-unit deficit and ensures we meet the high seasonal demand (approx 100/week), I set mu_hat = 288 + 197 = 485. Sigma_hat is set to reflect high seasonal volatility (sqrt(3) * ~25). Lead time L is set to 2 (promised), as drift has been inconsistent.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are in a confirmed high-demand seasonal regime for hoodies (Uno Hood). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P33-P38) is 93.7 units, significantly higher than the earlier ~50 units. The OR backend pipeline is significantly inflated by 197 units of lost orders (P1: 107, P13: 41, P17: 9, P24: 40). Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 516. Since total pipeline is 516, the 'real' pipeline is 516 - 197 = 319 units. Lead times have shown variability, with recent arrivals at LT=3 (P32, P33) and LT=1 (P35, P37). Given the current stockout (On-hand 0) and high seasonal demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost inventory deficit and the seasonal demand. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) horizon plus the 197-unit phantom gap, I will use mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 95 + 197 = 482. I will use a high N for sigma_hat to capture the recent seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand for hoodies remains strong through early November; P33-P38 average demand is 93.7 units. Total lost pipeline inventory confirmed at 197 units (P1, P13, P17, P24).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. Demand for this SKU (Hoodie) exhibited a seasonal surge starting Period 33 (late September), but the most recent observation (Period 39) shows a drop to 48 units. The average demand from P33 to P39 is 87.1 units. I will use recent_N=7 to capture this seasonal regime while tempering the forecast slightly for the recent drop. Regarding logistics, we have confirmed cumulative lost inventory of 197 units (P1, P13, P17, P24). The current 'In-transit' of 329 includes these 197 phantom units, meaning the real pipeline is only 132 units. With on-hand inventory at 139, the total real inventory is 271. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the seasonal mean (~87/period) over the (L+1) horizon (approx 3 periods), the base stock should be around 260-300 units. However, because the backend subtracts the inflated 'In-transit' (329), I must set mu_hat explicitly higher to 'force' the order. I will set mu_hat using the recent seasonal mean of ~87 units per period multiplied by (1+L=3), then add the 197 lost units to offset the backend's calculation: (87 * 3) + 197 = 458. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P35, P36, P39) suggest a drift toward 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand softened slightly in P39 (48 units) but remains within the elevated seasonal regime (P33-P39 avg: 87.1). Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 197 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the hoodie is in a high-demand seasonal regime typical for mid-to-late Q4. Demand from P33 to P40 averages ~84 units per period, significantly higher than the early year average of ~45. Although P39 was slightly lower (48), P40 demand returned to 68 units. The primary challenge is 'phantom inventory' in the OR backend's calculation. There are 197 units (P1, P13, P17, P24) confirmed lost that still appear in the 'in-transit' total. Current Pipeline = 329, but Real Pipeline = 329 - 197 = 132. With On-hand=71, total reliable inventory is 203. For a (L+1)=3 period window (given L=2), we need to cover at least 3 * 84 = 252 units. To force the OR backend to order about ~50 units to bridge this 197-unit deficit while maintaining safety stock for high seasonal volatility, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I set mu_hat at 450 (calculated as (1+L) * 150), where 150 represents the elevated seasonal demand (~85) plus a correction factor to offset the 197 phantom units over the lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 40 (approx standard deviation of the seasonal period) to maintain a high service level during this peak period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 42 (late November). Demand for hoodies peaked in October/November (P33-P38 avg: 93.7) and is now softening (P39-P41 avg: 49.3). The current high 'In-transit' figure of 379 is heavily inflated by 197 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 107, P13: 41, P17: 9, P24: 40). Additionally, the P29 order (57 units) is now 12 periods overdue and should be treated as lost, bringing total 'phantom' inventory to 254 units. Corrected pipeline = 379 - 254 = 125 units. Observed lead times recently show high variability (1 to 3 periods); I will use 'explicit' L=2.5 to buffer for this in the base-stock calculation. mu_hat is set using recent_N=9 to capture the higher seasonal plateau while acknowledging the recent dip. sigma_hat is set to 30 (explicit) to account for high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: P29 order (57 units) confirmed lost (12 periods overdue). Total phantom pipeline inventory updated to 254 units (P1, P13, P17, P24, P29). Demand entering late-winter softening phase.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are dealing with a hoodie SKU ('Uno Hood'), which has seen a significant seasonal demand surge from late September through November. Demand recently peaked and is now showing signs of late-winter softening (Period 41: 32 units, Period 42: 72 units). The primary operational challenge remains the inflated 'In-transit' figure on the OR backend. As per Carry-Over Insights, 254 units are definitively lost (P1, P13, P17, P24, P29), meaning the functional pipeline inventory is only 125 units (379 total - 254 lost). With on-hand inventory at 0 and looking at a promised lead time of 2 (actual lead times vary between 1-3), we must ensure enough stock is ordered to cover the next 3 periods (L+1). I will set L to 'calculate' to account for recent performance. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 (covering the peak and the recent softening) to capture the current mean of ~77 units/period, which helps the OR engine calculate a base stock that offsets the 254 units of 'phantom' inventory it erroneously believes is coming.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand for the 'Uno Hood' has transitioned from a seasonal peak (P33-P38 avg: ~94) to a late-winter softening (P39-P43 avg: ~50). Period 43 demand was 28. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this lower volume (approx 50 units/period) while maintaining responsiveness. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains at 254 units (Orders: P1=107, P13=41, P17=9, P24=40, P29=57). The OR backend sees 329 in-transit, but only 75 are real (329 - 254). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the actual deficit, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since real_pipeline = 75 and on_hand = 22, the backend will calculate (base_stock - 329). To offset the -254 phantom units, I add 254 units to the required base stock. Targeted base stock for late-winter (~50/period for L+1=3) is ~150 plus safety stock. Adjusted mu_hat = (150 + 254) = 404. This forces the system to acknowledge the lost stock as a deficit to be filled.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Hoodie) spiked in late September through October (P32-P38 avg: ~95) and has recently cooled down as winter progresses (P39-P44 avg: ~49). We are currently in a lower demand regime compared to the autumn peak. Pipeline reconciliation: Total In-transit is 382. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 254 units are definitively lost (P1: 107, P13: 41, P17: 9, P24: 40, P29: 57). This results in a 'real' pipeline of 128 units (382 - 254). The OR backend is unaware of these losses and overestimates inventory by 254 units. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My base stock target calculation: Looking at recent demand (avg ~50), I want to cover L+1 periods (2+1=3). Base Stock = 3 periods * 55 units (conservative mean) + safety stock. Total target =~ 220 units. Since the OR engine sees 128 units + 254 phantom units = 382 units, it will not order if it thinks 382 > Target. I must inflate mu_hat by the lost amount (254) plus the actual requirement (~165) to force an order. However, the 'cap' mechanism in the backend limits max orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the recent stable lower demand (~49) while setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the historically variable lead time (avg ~2). To overcome the 254 units of phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 165) plus the phantom offset (254) = 419.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: late autumn peak (avg ~95) has transitioned to a lower winter regime (P39-P44 avg: 49 units). Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 254 units due to cumulative lost orders (P1, P13, P17, P24, P29).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. Demand has transitioned from the late autumn peak (avg ~95) to a lower winter regime. The average demand for the last 7 periods (P39-P45) is approximately 51.1 units. The 'In-transit' count of 419 is highly inflated by 254 units from confirmed lost orders (P1: 107, P13: 41, P17: 9, P24: 40, P29: 57). Corrected pipeline inventory is 165 units (419 - 254). With on-hand inventory at 0 and expected lead time L=2, the base stock should cover 3 periods (~153 units). Since the corrected pipeline (165) exceeds current projected needs, and recent demand is stabilizing around 50, I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to reflect this mid-winter regime. I am setting L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the average of successfully arrived shipments, acknowledging the variability (1-3 periods).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are in a lower demand regime following the autumn hoodie peak. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P39-P46) is approximately 48.1 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 419 units is significantly inflated by 254 units of confirmed lost inventory (P1, P13, P17, P24, P29). Therefore, the 'real' pipeline inventory is 165 units (419 - 254). At the start of Period 47, there is 0 on-hand inventory. The orders in transit that are actually expected to arrive correspond to P44 (53 units) and P45 (37 units), total 90 units, plus any order from P46 (0 units). However, the OR backend sees 419 in-transit. To force the backend to place an order when it thinks the pipeline is full, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Given the current demand (avg ~48) and a target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods, we need ~144 units. Because the backend subtracts the phantom 254 units from its inventory position, I must increase mu_hat by the phantom amount (144 + 254 = 398) to ensure the system maintains availability during this winter period. I will set mu_hat to 398 and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture current volatility.
