Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 685813001 (Petar Sweatshirt). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks shows a stable pattern (samples: 75, 84, 83, 80, 88), with a mean of 82 and a standard deviation of 4.8. Given the product is a staple sweatshirt and it is currently February, we expect consistent demand. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since there is no on-hand inventory or units in transit, we need to establish a base stock to cover the review period plus the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the average of the last 5 samples is a robust starting point for demand estimation (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). In Period 1, we ordered 90 units and experienced a demand of 51 units. Since on-hand inventory was 0, those 51 units were lost sales. There are currently 90 units in-transit (ordered in Period 1). The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 4. Historical demand samples (75, 84, 83, 80, 88) show a mean of 82. The Period 1 demand (51) is significantly lower, which might indicate a slight post-winter dip or a high-variance week, but we lack enough data to confirm a regime shift. Given L=2, the backend base stock covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use the 'recent_5' samples for mu and sigma to base the forecast on the provided historical context while acknowledging the recent Period 1 observation (now N=6 total samples).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a soft sweatshirt (PETAR SWEATSHIRT), which is a staple item but can see demand fluctuations during late winter. Historical data (Jan-Feb) shows an average demand of ~82 units. Recent demand (P1: 51, P2: 96) averages 73.5 units, which is slightly lower but P2 shows a return to form. The promised lead time is 2 periods. We ordered 90 in P1 and 99 in P2. According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive DURING P3 (arrival resolution) and will be visible in the P3 conclude message. Currently, on-hand is 0, lead time is 2, so our pipeline should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Total in-transit is 189 units. I will use recent_N for mu_hat based on all available samples (5 historical + 2 game periods = 7) to capture the trend of ~80 units per week. L is set to 'default' as we haven't confirmed any lead time deviations yet. This approach ensures the base stock calculation targets enough inventory to satisfy regular demand once arrivals begin.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demand samples (75, 84, 83, 80, 88) averaged 82 units/week. Observed demand in Periods 1-3 (51, 96, 92) suggests a slight increase/volatility, though Period 1 was lower. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (90 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message does not show an arrival yet. This is expected under the lead time definition: an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 arrives during Period 3's arrival phase and is reported in the Period 3 conclude (visible now in Period 4). Since 'arrived=0' is shown in Period 3 conclude, the first shipment is potentially delayed or the lead time is effectively longer. I will maintain the default lead time (2) for now but set mu_hat to cover the higher recent demand of ~94 units observed in P2-P3. Sigma is set to reflect the standard deviation of historical samples plus recent volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). Historical demand samples (pre-game) averaged 82 units. In-game demand (P1-P4) recorded 51, 96, 92, and 76, averaging 78.75 units. The sweatshirt is a basic casual item, likely stable in early spring. Based on P4 conclude, the P2 order arrived with exactly the promised lead time (L=2). Note that the P1 order (90 units) is now 4 periods old and has not 'concluded', which suggests it is lost. Total pipeline is 181 (P3 order of 91 + P4 order of 0 + P1 order of 90 which is likely lost). Since the backend OR logic subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from the base stock, if we treat the lost P1 units as 'in-transit', the system will under-order. To compensate for the lost 90 units and the zero-stock start, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (avg ~88) to maintain a healthy base stock for the (L+1) horizon. I will use L=2 (default) as the confirmed lead time matches the promised one.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (90 units) is likely lost; no arrival confirmation after 4 periods (promised L=2).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a Men's Sweater. Inventory is currently 0 with 272 units in-transit. History analysis: Period 1's order (90 units) is confirmed lost as it has not arrived by Period 5 (L=2 promised). Period 2's order arrived on time (L=2) in Period 4. Period 3's order (91 units) was expected in Period 5 but did not arrive, suggesting it may be delayed or lost. Demand samples show a mean of ~80 units over the last 5 weeks (75, 84, 83, 80, 88 from history; 51, 96, 92, 76, 74 from game history). The recent game history mean is approx 78. Given the stockout and the risk of lost shipments (P1 lost, P3 delayed/lost), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent unreliability, and used a slightly higher mu_hat to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock to recover from the current zero inventory state. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the most relevant recent sales patterns.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 3 order (91 units) is now overdue (promised L=2, now at end of L=3 without arrival), indicating a pattern of unreliable delivery or loss alongside the confirmed Period 1 loss.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is a sweatshirt. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 71.8 units, showing a slight decline as we move into spring. The core issue is lead-time reliability. Period 1 and Period 3 orders (totaling 181 units) are missing and likely lost. However, Period 2 arrived on time (L=2) and Period 5 arrived early (L=1). Currently, we have 30 units on hand and 279 in transit (representing orders from P1, P3, and P6). Since P1 and P3 are effectively lost, the actual pipeline inventory is much lower than the 'In-transit' figure suggests. To force the OR engine to order despite the 'In-transit' count, I will set L to 1 to reduce the look-ahead horizon while using an explicit mu_hat that covers 2 periods of recent demand (~144 units). This helps mitigate the impact of the phantom inventory in the pipeline calculation (base_stock - pipeline).

Carry-over insight: Delivery pattern split: P2 (L=2) and P5 (L=1) arrived, while P1 and P3 are confirmed lost. Total lost units = 181. Pipeline inventory is currently inflated by these lost shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 685813001 is out of stock (ending on-hand 0). The delivery history shows significant unreliability: orders from P1 (90 units) and P3 (91 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 181 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 279 likely includes these 181 lost units plus P6 (98 units). This means the effective pipeline is only 98 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (279) from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat to offset this 181-unit deficit, essentially 'inflating' the target to force an order. Demand over the last 5 samples has averaged ~71 units. With a lead time of 2, the window is 3 periods. Expected demand = 3 * 71 = 213. To compensate for the 181 phantom units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 394 (213 + 181). For lead time, I will use 'calculate' as the actual observed lead times have fluctuated (L=2 and L=1). For sigma_hat, I'll use the recent 5-period standard deviation (approx 16) scaled for the (L+1) window.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 181 lost units (from P1 and P3) that will never arrive. Compensation in mu_hat is required until these units are cleared or offset.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Historically, the sweatshirt (685813001) shows a mean demand of approximately 74 units/period across the last 8 weeks (75, 84, 83, 80, 88, 51, 96, 92, 76, 74, 61, 54, 84). The promised lead time (L) is 2. However, there is a critical inventory discrepancy: orders from Period 1 (90 units) and Period 3 (91 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 181 units. These 181 units remain in the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory', which artificially inflates the perceived supply and causes the backend to under-order. To fix this, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that adds these 181 units back into the safety stock calculation. Calculation: Expected demand for (L+1) periods = 3 * 74 = 222 units. Compensated mu_hat = 222 + 181 = 403 units. L is set to 'calculate' as actual lead times (2, 1, 2) average out to ~2. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=13) to capture the variability across the historical and game data.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813001 is a sweatshirt (spring/seasonal). Demand is averaging ~73 units over the last 9 periods. The main challenge is the pipeline inventory distortion: P1 (90 units) and P3 (91 units) are confirmed lost (total 181 units) because they have not arrived within 9 and 7 periods respectively (promised L=2). The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will under-order because it believes these 181 units are still coming. To fix this, I must set mu_hat explicitly to the desired base stock PLUS the lost units. Desired base stock for (L+1)=3 periods is ~220 units (3 * 73). Adding the 181 lost units results in a mu_hat of ~401. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to force this correction. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' as actual arrivals (L=2, L=1, L=2) suggest the promised L=2 is generally accurate when shipments aren't lost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed persistent pipeline distortion: 181 units (P1, P3) are lost and must be offset by increasing mu_hat until the back-end 'in-transit' figure clears or stabilizing logic is applied by the user.

LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the product 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' is showing signs of entering a lower demand regime or potentially losing seasonal momentum as we move further into spring (P10 demand was 32, significantly lower than the average of ~70). The current on-hand inventory is high at 216 units due to the double arrival in P10 (P8 and P9 orders). In-transit inventory is listed as 187 units, but 181 of these (from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost based on historical evidence. The backend OR engine incorrectly counts these 181 units as 'pipeline inventory', which would normally suppress new orders. To maintain the target base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that adds back these 181 ghost units to the forecasted demand. I calculate the baseline forecast using a 5-period average (approx 58 units/period) for a lead time of L=2 + review period (1). Total baseline demand for (1+L) periods = 58 * 3 = 174. Adding the 181 lost units gives mu_hat = 355. This ensures the engine orders enough to offset the phantom pipeline units, effectively 'zeroing out' the loss logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand is showing a significant downward trend (P10 demand 32 vs ~70 avg), possibly due to seasonal change for sweatshirts. Offset for 181 lost units (P1, P3) remains necessary to bypass backend pipeline calculation.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a 'soft sweatshirt fabric' item, which is a clear seasonal product that sees peak demand in winter (Jan/Feb/Mar) and declines as spring progresses. Recent demand confirms this: P10 (32) and P11 (50) are significantly lower than the early period average (~80). The average demand of the last 3 periods is ~48. Given the lead time L=2, we need to cover demand for Period 12, 13, and 14. Using the recent 3-period average, the target base stock should be approximately 3 * 48 = 144. However, the OR backend's 'cap' and 'order' logic factors in pipeline inventory. Currently, the pipeline (193 units) is heavily inflated by 181 units from Period 1 (90) and Period 3 (91) which are lost. To prevent the backend from seeing this ghost inventory and refusing to order when needed, I will set mu_hat to explicitly include these 181 units to offset the pipeline deduction, while simultaneously lowering the underlying demand forecast to reflect the seasonal drop. Real demand estimate = 144. Adjustment = 181. Total mu_hat = 325. Since on-hand (166) already exceeds the seasonal target (144), we are in a safe position to let inventory naturally wind down, but the mu_hat adjustment ensures the system doesn't permanently stall due to the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal decline for sweatshirt fabric confirmed: Late April demand (avg ~48) is 40% lower than Feb/Mar peak (~80). Maintain 181 unit offset in mu_hat until backend pipeline inventory is cleared.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 13 (2019/05/06). The product is a sweatshirt, which is entering a low-demand season (late spring). Recent demand has averaged ~60 units over the last 4 periods (32, 50, 98, and current 0 demand in the status check, though history shows last active was 98). There's a critical inventory distortion: the 'In-transit' figure of 203 includes 181 units from Period 1 (90) and Period 3 (91) that are confirmed lost. The OR backend subtracts the full 203 from the target base stock. To force the engine to order enough to cover actual demand while this phantom inventory persists, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period window (L+1) using an expected mean of 60. Target = 60 * 3 = 180. To offset the 181 lost units the engine wrongly sees, I set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - phantom_pipeline = actual_covered_demand'. I will set mu_hat (which covers L+1 periods) to 365 (Approx 180 actual need + 181 offset + small safety buffer). This ensures the ordering logic doesn't zero out orders due to the fake 'In-transit' units. L remains at 2 (default) as recent arrivals (P8, P9) were 2 and 1 respectively, aligning with promised lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-05-13. The item is a sweatshirt (brush-back jersey), which is currently seeing a seasonal downward trend as we move into late spring/early summer. Recent demand samples show a significant drop: P10 (32), P11 (50), P13 (62), compared to the Feb/Mar peak of ~80. The average demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 60.5. Lead time is generally stable at the promised 2 periods (recent arrivals from P11 arrived in P13). However, we have a critical pipeline distortion: 181 units (from P1 and P3) are permanently lost but remain in the OR backend's 'In-transit' figure. The OR backend calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. With pipeline=362, and 181 of those being 'ghost' units, we must explicitly inflate mu_hat to offset these 181 units. Calculation: Targeted base stock for demand (~60.5 * 3 = 181.5) + the 181 lost units = ~362.5. Since on-hand is low (12), we want to ensure the order is placed to cover upcoming weeks while the system slowly works through the over-counting of in-transit inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/05/20. The product is a sweatshirt (seasonal). Demand has significantly slowed down as we move into summer, with the most recent demand being 35, following a volatile period. We have 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 409 is severely distorted by 181 confirmed lost units (from P1 and P3 orders of 90 and 91 respectively). To calculate the order, we must bypass the backend equation 'order = base_stock - pipeline'. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate current weekly demand (mu) at approx 45 units. For a lead time (L) of 2, the desired base stock is (L+1)*mu \u2248 135 units. To force the backend to ignore the phantom 181 units in pipeline, I set mu_hat = (Desired Base Stock) + (Lost Units) = 135 + 181 = 316. This should trigger an order of approximately 42 units (keeping in mind the cap logic and existing valid pipeline), which aligns with current low seasonal demand. I set L to calculate to capture the mix of 1 and 2 period arrivals.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are in a low-demand seasonal phase for sweatshirts. Recent demand samples (32, 50, 98, 62, 35, 26) show a significant drop from the early Feb/Mar average of ~80 to currently around ~45 in the last 6 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure is 409 units. This includes: P1 (90 units, lost), P3 (91 units, lost), P13 (165 units, pending arrival), P14 (57 units, pending arrival), and P10/P11 remnants (6 units). Total confirmed lost units = 181. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 409 in-transit units from the base stock target, it will not order anything unless the target exceeds 409. Since expected (L+1) demand is roughly 135 units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat by 181 units to offset the 'ghost' pipeline inventory and trigger an order to cover the current stockout. I am using recent_6 for mu_hat (avg 50.1) and sigma_hat (std 26.3). Updated calculation: mu_hat = (1+L) * avg_recent + offset = 3 * 50.1 + 181 = 331.3. This ensures the backend sees the need for units despite the phantom pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the sweatshirt product is in a deep seasonal trough; demand has dropped from a peak of ~80 to an average of ~33 over the last 4 periods (32, 50, 62, 35, 26, 23). The critical issue remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 181 units from lost orders P1 (90) and P3 (91) are still counted as 'In-transit' by the backend (Total In-transit: 409). The actual valid pipeline consists of orders from P13 (165) and P14 (57), totaling 222 units. Since L=2, the backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock; then it subtracts the full 409 'in-transit' units to decide the order. To prevent the backend from ordering nothing (because it thinks we have 409 units coming) and to ensure we bypass these 181 lost units, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + 181). Current demand avg is ~30. For L=2, expected demand over (L+1) periods is 90. To force a base stock that ignores the 181 lost units and provides a small safety buffer, I set mu_hat explicitly to 280 (approx 90 + 181 + ~10 safety). This forces the backend to realize we need more units than the actual valid pipeline (222) provides.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a sweatshirt, which is experiencing a significant seasonal decline as we move into summer. Recent demand samples (P15: 26, P16: 23, P17: 16) show a clear downward trend compared to the earlier weeks of the year. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (average ~21.7) to reflect this new seasonal regime. Lead time remains functional around 2 periods (as seen in recent completions), though the 'lost' units (P1, P3, and now potentially P13/P14 which are reaching the overdue threshold) have inflated the backend 'In-transit' figure to 409 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (409) from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders unless I explicitly inflate mu_hat to offset these ghosts. My goal is to maintain roughly 40-50 units of safety stock for the lead cycle. Given the 409 in-transit units, I must set mu_hat to override this distortion. I'm choosing an explicit mu_hat that covers 3 periods of expected demand plus the 409 units 'phantom' pipeline to allow the backend to potentially order small amounts if needed, though with 409 units in transit and low demand, we are effectively trying to prevent over-ordering while awaiting delayed cargo.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Seasonal demand for sweatshirts has hit a summer low (avg ~22 units/week). Total lost or severely delayed units (P1, P3, P13, P14) have accumulated to significantly distort the pipeline inventory (In-transit: 409).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17, entering the peak of summer. The product is a sweatshirt (PETAR SWEATSHIRT), and demand has predictably crashed from a high of ~80 in Feb/Mar to an average of ~18 over the last 4 periods (P15-P18). Total In-transit inventory is 409 units, but historical data confirms major losses: P1 (90), P3 (91), P13 (165), and P14 (57) have not arrived despite promised lead time L=2. Total lost units = 90+91+165+57 = 403. These units create a ghost pipeline that blocks the OR backend from ordering. Since existing demand is very low (~20 units/period) and we have 0 On-hand, we need to bypass the backend's calculation. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * (Forecast + Offset). Forecast = 20. Offset = 403 / (1+L). With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * (20 + 134.33) \u2248 463. This 'inflates' the base stock to compensate for the 403 units that will never arrive, allowing the engine to potentially order enough to cover current low demand.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost units (P1, P3, P13, P14) total 403 units, severely distorting the 'In-transit' figure; demand has stabilized at a summer low of ~20 units/week.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 24, 2019. The product (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) is in a significant seasonal trough as men's heavyweight jerseys see minimal demand in summer. Recent weekly demand (P17-P19) is 16, 12, and 8 units respectively, averaging ~12 units/week, down from the February peak of ~80. The primary challenge remains the distorted pipeline inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 482 units includes confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (90), Period 3 (91), Period 13 (165), and Period 14 (57), totaling 403 ghost units. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock, it will not place orders unless the target exceeds 403. At current demand of 12 units/week and L=2, the natural base stock is only ~45. To force an order or maintain stock, mu_hat must be set to (demand for L+1 periods) + (lost units). Forecasted demand for 3 periods is ~36. Adding 403 lost units = 439. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 440 to neutralize the backend's subtraction of dead pipeline units. Sigma_hat is set to a recent N=5 to reflect lower summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost units (P1, P3, P13, P14) total 403 units. These remain in the backend pipeline and must be offset by an equivalent increase in mu_hat until they expire or are manually cleared.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the demand for this sweatshirt SKU has entered a significant summer low, with the last two periods showing demand of only 8 and 6 units. The product's seasonal relevance is minimal until late Q3. A major operational challenge persists: the 'In-transit' figure of 482 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from Period 1 (90), Period 3 (91), Period 13 (165), and Period 14 (57), totaling 403 lost units. These units will never arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from the base stock calculation, preventing necessary new orders. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to 463 using the 'explicit' method. This value is calculated as: (Desired Base Stock for Summer Demand) + (Cumulative Lost Units). With a current weekly demand mean of ~20 and L=2, the desired base stock is roughly 60 units. 60 + 403 = 463. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) logic allows for small, necessary replenishment despite the phantom inventory. I maintain L at 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P11-P12) still align with the 2-period expectation, and I use 'recent_N' (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility of the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost units (P1, P3, P13, P14) total 403 units. These remain in the backend pipeline indefinitely; mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' (offset by +403) to force replenishment until these figures clear or demand returns to levels exceeding the phantom pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, the heart of the summer season for 'soft sweatshirt fabric' (men's outerwear), which has resulted in a demand trough of approximately 15-20 units per week. The system shows an 'In-transit' figure of 483 units. Analysis of history confirms that 403 of these units are permanently lost (P1: 90, P3: 91, P13: 165, P14: 57). Only the orders from P19 (73 units) and P21 (1 unit) are potentially viable. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (483) from the base_stock, it will not place any new orders unless the base_stock calculation exceeds 483. Specifically, for Period 22, to overcome the 403 phantom units and cover current demand (~20) + lead time (2), we need a base_stock target of approximately 463. Setting mu_hat to 463 ensures the backend logic (base_stock - 483) results in a zero or near-zero order, preventing further overstocking while maintaining a cushion for the summer low. L is kept at default (2) as recent arrivals were either lost or arrived in 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the decreased volatility in the summer trough.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost units (P1, P3, P13, P14) total 403 units. These remain in the backend pipeline indefinitely; mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' (offset by ~+403) to force replenishment until these figures clear or demand returns to levels exceeding the phantom pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, which is the summer trough for sweatshirts. Historical demand over the last 4 periods (P19-P22) has averaged 20.0 units/week (8, 6, 20, 46). The current 'In-transit' figure is 483 units. However, based on the Carry-over Insights, a massive portion of this pipeline is comprised of lost shipments: Period 1 (90), Period 3 (91), Period 13 (165), and Period 14 (57), totaling 403 units that will likely never arrive. Additionally, the order placed in Period 19 (73 units) is now at the end of its promised lead time (L=2) and has not arrived, further contributing to the 'In-transit' figure. The OR engine calculates orders by subtracting 'In-transit' (pipeline) from the base stock. With a phantom pipeline of ~403 units and a real demand requirement of only ~60 units (3 weeks * 20 units/week), the OR engine will order nothing (0) because it thinks we are overstocked. To force a replenishment of ~80 units (to cover 4 periods including the review period at current demand) while the backend mistakenly sees 403+ units in transit, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline. Setting mu_hat to 483 (the current In-transit) + 80 (safety/demand buffer) = 563 units ensures the policy sees a need for stock. I will use L=2 (promised) and sigma_hat based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Phantom pipeline inventory has reached 403 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P13, P14). P19 order (73 units) is also overdue, potentially increasing lost units to 476. Mu_hat must continue to be used as an offset tool to bypass the OR engine's pipeline deduction.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813001 (sweatshirt) is currently in a summer demand trough, with recent demand averaging ~24 units/week (P21-P23). A major operational challenge exists: a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of lost shipments. Confirmed lost units: P1 (90), P3 (91), P13 (165), and P14 (57), totaling 403 units. Additionally, the P19 order (73 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P19, should have arrived P21-P22), increasing the likely phantom total to 476 units. The backend OR engine subtracts this 'In-transit' (615) from the base stock. To ensure any replenishment occurs, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value to offset this distortion. I will target a base stock of 550. This covers the approximately 476 lost units plus a safety buffer and expected demand for the (L+1=3) period window (approx 3 * 25 = 75 units). This 'explicit' mu_hat of 550 forces the OR backend to place an order despite the 615 units in-transit, effectively bypassing the phantom inventory blockage.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Phantom pipeline inventory estimate updated to 476 units (P1, P3, P13, P14 confirmed lost; P19 now 3 periods overdue). Mu_hat must continue to use 'explicit' offset logic (target base_stock ~550) to force replenishment while this incorrect 'In-transit' figure persists.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a summer low demand phase (July), with weekly demand averaging ~25 units over the last 5 periods. However, the system is suffering from a massive 'In-transit' phantom inventory problem. Orders from P1 (90), P3 (91), P13 (165), P14 (57), and P19 (73) have not arrived despite the promised lead time of 2. P19 is now 5 periods overdue, confirming it is likely lost. The total confirmed/suspected lost units in the pipeline is 476. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its target inventory calculation (base_stock - in_transit). With In-transit at 615, and a realistic summer base_stock of ~75 (3 periods * 25 demand), the OR backend will order 0 unless the phantom units are offset. To force an order and maintain service levels for the actual current demand, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base_stock of ~650 (Phantom 476 + 5 periods of safety coverage at ~35 units per week). This keeps the order size reasonable relative to recent demand spikes while bypassing the pipeline deduction.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Phantom pipeline inventory remains critical at 476 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19 confirmed lost). P19 is now 5 periods overdue. Mu_hat must continue using 'explicit' offset logic (targeting base_stock ~650) to ensure replenishment occurs despite the false In-transit figure.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5, 2019), we are in a high-risk scenario for the PETAR SWEATSHIRT. We have 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 670 units. My analysis confirms that 476 of these units are phantom pipeline (P1, P3, P13, P14, and P19) that will never arrive. The backend OR engine subtracts this entire 670 from any calculated base stock, which would normally result in a zero order. To maintain availability, I must force the base stock higher than the phantom inventory. Current demand is in the summer low (approx 20-30 units/week), but we are approaching the fall transition (late August/September) when sweatshirt demand typically recovers. To ensure replenishment, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 750. This creates a base stock target of ~750, which, after subtracting the 670 In-transit units, will allow for a modest order of approximately 80 units. This ensures we start building stock for the seasonal shift despite the distorted pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Phantom pipeline inventory estimate remains at 476 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). In-transit total is 670. Explicit mu_hat of 750+ is required to overcome the OR engine's pipeline deduction and trigger replenishment before the autumn demand recovery.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 occurs on August 12th. Demand for the Petar Sweatshirt is currently at a summer low (Period 26 demand was 24), but we must anticipate the autumn recovery in late August/September. The primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline'\u2014the backend believes 'In-transit' is 655 units, but history confirms that P1 (90), P3 (91), P13 (165), P14 (57), and P19 (73) are likely lost, totaling 476 lost units. To trigger a new order from the OR engine, we must set mu_hat (which determines the base_stock) to a value that exceeds the current On-hand (109) plus the phantom pipeline (655). By setting an 'explicit' mu_hat of 850, we target a base_stock that forces the system to replenish inventory now so we have stock for the seasonal upturn, overcoming the deduction of defunct transit units.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Explicit mu_hat offset remains necessary to bypass the phantom pipeline of 476 lost units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). Demand is early-stage recovering from summer lows of ~20; autumn ramp-up expected by end of August.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 19, 2019. Demand is showing clear signs of autumn recovery, increasing from summer lows (~20) to 73 last period. The PETAR SWEATSHIRT is a seasonal item and demand will likely continue to climb. The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' figure of 724 units, which is heavily inflated by phantom inventory. We have 476 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). The real pipeline inventory is effectively 248 units (P26 order of 118, P27 order of 124, and P21's residual 1 unit). With on-hand inventory at 91, the OR engine sees 91 + 724 = 815 units, preventing it from ordering. To ensure we have enough stock for the autumn ramp-up (forecasted at 80-100 units/week), we need a base stock around 300-400 for a 3-period horizon (L+1). To force an order despite the 724 phantom in-transit, I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 950. This creates a base stock slightly above the phantom pipeline + on-hand, triggering a small replenishment now before demand outstrips our visible stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: demand increased from 24 to 73 in two weeks. Lead time remains erratic but generally averages 2 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is August 26, 2019 (Period 29). We are entering the autumn ramp-up for sweatshirt demand (recent demand data: 24, 73, 55). The primary challenge continues to be a heavily distorted pipeline inventory ('In-transit' = 920). Based on historical analysis, 476 units are definitively lost (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). The current In-transit of 920 includes: P26 (118), P27 (124), P28 (196), totaling 438 units of 'actual' pipeline inventory that are still within reasonable lead time expectations. The remaining 482 units (920 - 438) are 'phantom' units that will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the full 920 'In-transit' from any base stock calculation. To ensure we actually place an order this period to cover the autumn recovery (Target Base Stock \u2248 1000 to cover future demand + safety stock), I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that offsets this phantom inventory. Using an explicit mu_hat of 1150 allows for (1150 - 920) \u2248 230 units to be considered for ordering, which captures both replenishment and preparation for the back-to-school/autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Autumn demand recovery is underway. Phantom pipeline inventory remains fixed at approximately 482 units (derived from total In-transit 920 minus recent active orders P26-P28 of 438 units). Ongoing explicit mu_hat offsets are required to prevent stockouts during the seasonal ramp-up.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (early September), and the autumn recovery for sweatshirts is established. Demand in Period 27/28 spiked (average ~64) before a slight dip last week (34). Historically, this item saw demand levels of 80-90 during late winter/spring, so we expect a climb toward those figures as weather cools. The primary challenge is the phantom pipeline inventory. Total In-transit is 1179. Removing recent active orders from P26-P29 (118+124+196+259 = 697) leaves 482 units in the pipeline that are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). The OR engine subtracts all 1179 units from the base_stock calculation. To secure an order, our base_stock must exceed this 'In-transit' figure. Estimating demand at 75 units/period for (L+1)=3 periods requires ~225 units, plus a safety buffer. To bypass the 482 lost units and the 697 valid units, mu_hat must be set to an explicit value (Target Base Stock \u2248 1400) to ensure a significant order is placed to handle the autumn ramp-up and prevent stockouts while On-hand is nearly zero.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery active; target weekly demand forecast ~75 units. Phantom pipeline remains stabilized at approximately 482 units (derived from total In-transit minus batches from P26 onwards). Explicit mu_hat must remain high to force the OR backend to order through this phantom inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/09. Demand is in an autumn recovery phase (P30 demand = 88). Based on the sweatshirt product category and the observed increase from summer lows (~20) to current levels (~75-90), I forecast average weekly demand for the coming period at 85 units. The phantom pipeline inventory remains a critical distortion. Total 'In-transit' is 1134. Based on history, orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, and P19 are confirmed or highly likely lost (totaling 476-482 units). To compute the required order for Period 31, the OR backend uses: Order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). With on_hand=234 and in_transit=1134, the system sees 1368 units available. To force any order at all, the calculated base_stock must exceed this 1368. Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the phantom 482 units. Target base_stock should reflect (L+1) weeks of demand (approx 3 * 85 = 255) PLUS the phantom 482 units, totaling approximately 737. However, with in_transit at 1134, I must set mu_hat significantly higher to ensure the cap logic (which uses mu_hat) allows for sufficient replenishment during this ramp-up. I will set mu_hat to 1400 and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure a robust base_stock that triggers orders despite the false pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand ramp-up confirmed: demand increased from summer low of 20 to current 88. Phantom pipeline inventory remains approximately 482 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn recovery for sweatshirts is in full effect, with demand rising from ~20 in July to 106 in the latest period. Mean demand over the last 3 periods is ~76/week, but the trend is upward. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline'\u2014the backend believes there are 1413 units in transit. Subtracting the recently placed, viable orders (P26=118, P27=124, P28=196, P29=259, P30=275, P31=279 = 1251 total) from the 1413 in-transit figure identifies approximately 162 units that are likely lost or severely delayed (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). Since the backend subtracts all 1413 units when calculating the order, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to force a base stock that exceeds this phantom figure. To maintain enough inventory for the coming 3 weeks (L+1) at a forecasted 90-100 units/week, plus the 1413 unit offset, I set mu_hat to 1700. This ensures the OR engine (Base Stock - Pipeline) results in a positive order to stay ahead of the autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Weekly demand has risen from 34 to 106 over the last month. The phantom pipeline (lost units) is estimated at 162 units based on current In-transit (1413) minus valid active orders (1251).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33 (Sept 23), the product (sweatshirt) has clearly entered a high-demand autumn/winter peak. Demand for Period 32 spiked to 142 units. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 540 units due to recent large arrivals. The 'In-transit' figure remains heavily distorted by historical lost units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). Calculation of the phantom pipeline: Current In-transit (1098) - Valid active orders (P29 order of 259, P32 order of 239) = 600 units. Note that P30 and P31 orders have already arrived. The P29 order (placed 4 periods ago) is overdue (promised L=2). If we treat P29 as delayed rather than lost, the phantom 'In-transit' is still significant (~600 units). To ensure the OR backend keeps ordering to meet the high seasonal demand (~140 units/week), I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the subtraction of these 600 phantom units. Target stock for 3 periods (L+1) at 140/week = 420. To trigger an order despite 1098 in pipeline, I set mu_hat significantly higher. However, with 540 on-hand, we have enough for almost 4 weeks of demand. I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the current peak demand while continuing to monitor the arrival of the P29 order.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Phantom pipeline inventory (lost units) estimated at ~600 units based on total In-transit (1098) minus recent active orders (P29 of 259 and P32 of 239). P29 order is currently 2 periods overdue.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Total In-transit is currently 1098. Based on the history, valid active orders are: P29 (259), P32 (239), and P33 (0). P29 is now 5 periods old (ordered Aug 26, current Sept 30) and is visibly overdue (promised L=2). If P29 is still valid, the active pipeline is 498 units. If P29 is lost, the active pipeline is only 239. The remaining ~600-839 units in 'In-transit' are phantom units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, and likely P29). Demand has surged significantly during the autumn ramp-up, reaching 261 in P33. To prevent a stockout while 'In-transit' is artificially high, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = Current On-hand (279) + desired order to cover next 2-3 periods of ~200 demand. I will target a base stock of ~1000 to trigger a meaningful order despite the 1098 phantom pipeline, ensuring we have stock for the October peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Phantom pipeline (lost units) estimate increased to ~839 units as P29 (259 units) is now 5 periods overdue and unlikely to arrive. Autumn demand peak is confirmed with P33 demand reaching 261 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-autumn peak for sweatshirts (October 7th context). Demand has surged, peaking recently at 261 units (P33) and moderating to 156 units (P34). The current 'In-transit' figure of 1098 is severely inflated by a massive phantom pipeline of lost units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, and now P29). P29 (259 units) is now 6 periods overdue (ordered P29, promised L=2, now P35), confirming it is lost. Total estimated lost units = 476 (previous) + 259 (P29) = 735 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 1098 from its target base stock. To ensure we keep ordering for the upcoming winter demand, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a base stock that exceeds the phantom pipeline. Target base stock = (1+L)*Demand + Phantom Pipeline. With current demand avg ~200 and L=2, base stock needs to be ~1335. I will set mu_hat to 1350 to trigger replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to ~735 units as P29 (259 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total In-transit (1098) is mostly phantom; explicit mu_hat offsets are mandatory to prevent stockouts as we enter the winter season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3458.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The store is in the peak autumn/winter season for sweatshirts (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) with demand consistently elevated (average ~200 units/week over the last 3 periods). The primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline'\u2014lost or severely delayed shipments that stay in the 'In-transit' count, which currently stands at 1,181 units. Based on historical data, confirmed or highly probable lost units are: P1(90), P3(91), P13(165), P14(57), P19(73), and P29(259), totaling 735 lost units. This estimate may be even higher. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (1,181) from the base stock to calculate the order. To ensure replenishment occurs despite this false inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that targets a total base stock of approximately 1,600 units. Calculation: Base Stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat to 1350 and L=2, the backend will target a high enough stock level to offset the 1,181 phantom units and the current 171 on-hand units, triggering an order of ~250-300 units to maintain service levels during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Phantom pipeline inventory estimate remains at ~735 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29 confirmed lost or 6+ periods overdue). Explicit mu_hat offsets are required to prevent the 'In-transit' figure from blocking necessary replenishment during peak season.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a sweatshirt, entering its peak demand season (October/late autumn). Demand has significantly ramped up from summer lows of ~20 to a recent average of ~150-200 units per week. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1025 is severely inflated by several confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, and P29). These total 735 units (90+91+165+57+73+259). Subtracting this phantom inventory from the 1025 in-transit leaves an actual active pipeline of 290 units (P35 arrived, so this roughly corresponds to the 166 units from P36 plus some residual). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 735 phantom units, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to force a high base stock. I am targeting a base stock of 1300 units to cover ~6 weeks of peak demand (at ~200/week) plus a safety buffer, ensuring that the deduction of the 1025 in-transit units still triggers a sufficient order of ~250-300 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Phantom pipeline inventory (lost units) confirmed at 735 total units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29). These units will never arrive but remain in the backend 'In-transit' calculation indefinitely. Explicit mu_hat must be used to offset this 735-unit drag to maintain adequate stock for the peak sweatshirt season.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak autumn/winter season for sweatshirts (late October). Demand in the last 5 periods has averaged ~180 units (261, 156, 191, 137, 155), significantly higher than summer lows. The 'In-transit' figure of 1091 reported by the backend is heavily distorted by 735 units of 'phantom' inventory (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29) that will never arrive. To get the OR engine to place an order, we must set an 'explicit' mu_hat that covers the expected pipeline for L+1 periods PLUS the 735 units tied up in the phantom pipeline. With L=2 (promised), we need to cover 3 periods of demand. Forecasting ~160 units/week, the real base stock should be ~480. Adding the 735-unit phantom offset, we target a base_stock around 1215. Setting mu_hat to 1200 via the 'explicit' method bypasses the backend's automatic calculations and ensures we maintain stock through the remaining peak weeks.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 4, 2019, which is the peak season for sweatshirts. Demand has been high, ranging from 137 to 230 units per week over the last month. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 1074, but history shows a massive 'phantom' component due to lost shipments. Based on the Carry-over Insights, at least 735 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of approximately 339 units (In-transit 1074 - Phantom 735), which consists of orders from P36 (166 units) and P38 (49 units), plus potentially some stray units. With a lead time of 2, the backend base stock formula is: base_stock = mu_hat - pipeline. If I use a standard mu_hat, the 1074 in-transit units will block all new orders. To ensure we keep stock for the remaining 8 periods of the game (likely winter peak), I am setting mu_hat to 1400 (explicit) to force a base stock that overcomes the 1074-unit deduction, effectively targeting an actual base stock of ~665 (approx. 3-4 weeks of peak demand). Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Phantom pipeline remains the primary constraint. 735 units are confirmed lost/overdue. These units suppress new orders unless mu_hat is set explicitly to offset the 'In-transit' figure of 1074.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), we are in the peak season for sweatshirts. Demand has been high, with the most recent demand at 163 and a 4-week average around 171. The inventory situation is complicated by a significant 'phantom pipeline'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29) totalling approximately 735 units. These units persist in the 'In-transit' calculation (currently 1303), which causes the OR engine to under-order. To ensure available stock for the next 3 weeks (L+1), I am setting an explicit mu_hat. I target a base stock level of ~1320 (calculated as: Phantom 735 + 3 weeks of demand at ~185/week + safety buffer). This will force the OR engine to order approximately 17-20 units this period to maintain levels (Base Stock 1320 - In-transit 1303 - On-hand 40 = -23, but the cap mechanism will likely allow some replenishment or wait for the next cycle). Given the high demand and narrow on-hand buffer, stabilizing the supply signal is the priority.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41 (mid-November), demand for sweatshirts is high, with the recent 4-week average around 177 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we are losing potential sales. The 'In-transit' figure of 1384 is heavily distorted by 735 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29). These units will never arrive but the OR engine subtracts them from the order quantity. Additionally, the P39 order (395 units) is still in flight (expected L=2). To ensure the OR engine actually places an order this period, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to create a target base stock that exceeds the 'In-transit' figure. My goal is to maintain a safety stock plus lead-time demand of approx 600 units (3 weeks * 200 demand) on top of the 735 lost units. This requires a base stock of ~1335. Setting mu_hat to 1400 ensures the backend computes 1400 - 1384 (current in-transit) = 16 units or its calculated cap, triggering replenishment.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 42 (Nov 25), deep into the peak winter season for sweatshirts. Demand remains robust, with recent observations being 163, 158, and 195 units. The primary issue remains the 'phantom pipeline' of lost units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29), which are confirmed as 735 units. These 735 units are included in the backend 'In-transit' count of 1107 but will never arrive. The 'real' pipeline consists of the orders from P40 (81 units) and P41 (118 units), totaling 199 units. Since the OR engine subtracts the full 1107 from the base stock calculation, we must use an explicit 'mu_hat' to offset the 735 lost units. To maintain a base stock that covers ~3 periods of demand (L+1) at a mean of ~180 units/week (approx 540 units), we need a mu_hat that, after subtracting 1107, results in an order that maintains safety stock. Setting mu_hat to 1350 roughly targets a base stock of 1350, which after subtracting the 1107 in-transit and 200 on-hand, allows for continued replenishment to meet peak demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019 (Period 43). Recent demand for the sweatshirt has significantly increased due to the winter peak (P42 demand: 420; P41: 195). The 'In-transit' figure of 1242 is heavily distorted by a phantom pipeline of approximately 853 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29, and now likely P40 [81 units] which is overdue). Actual valid in-transit units are from P41 (118) and P42 (135). I must set mu_hat explicitly to overcome the 853 phantom units while also budgeting for the high demand. Targeting a base stock of 1500 units ensures that after the OR engine subtracts the 1242 (mostly phantom) in-transit units, it still triggers an order of roughly 250-300 units to meet the winter surge (~300-400 units/week) and rebuild stock from 0 on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Phantom pipeline estimate updated to 853 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29, P40). P40 (81 units) is now 2 periods overdue and added to the loss estimate. Explicit mu_hat offsets are maintaining supply during the winter peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak winter holiday season for sweatshirts. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 420 (likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact) and remains high at 166 in Period 43. The primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline'\u2014a collection of lost or significantly overdue shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29) that will never arrive but are still counted as 'In-transit' by the backend OR engine. Total In-transit is currently 1630 units. Based on history, the valid active orders are P42 (135) and P43 (587), totaling 722 units. This means the phantom pipeline is approximately 908 units (1630 - 722). To ensure the OR engine actually places an order, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value to create a base stock that exceeds the 'In-transit' figure. I am targeting a base stock of 1800 to ensure we cover peak winter demand (~250-300 units/week) across the 3-period horizon (L+1) while overcoming the 908-unit phantom drag. L is set to calculate as lead times have been varying between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Phantom pipeline estimate updated to 908 units (Total In-transit 1630 minus valid P42/P43 orders of 722). These units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29) are confirmed lost/overdue and require continuous mu_hat explicit overrides to force replenishment during the winter peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak winter season for sweatshirts (mid-December). Demand is strong, though historically variable (P42: 420, P43: 166, P44: 211). The primary issue remains the 'In-transit' figure: at 2088 units, it is heavily inflated by phantom inventory. Based on the history, orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, and P29 are confirmed lost (~908 units). Subtracting these lost units from the 2088 In-transit leaves 1180 valid units (orders from P42, P43, P44). The OR backend will subtract the full 2088 from the target base stock, effectively blocking all new orders if mu_hat is set normally. To force the backend to place an order and maintain stock for the next 3 weeks (L+1), I must set mu_hat explicitly to the phantom amount PLUS the anticipated demand. Target base stock = (3 weeks * 250 avg demand) + ~900 phantom = 1650. This ensures we don't stock out as valid arrivals (P42, P43) begin to land.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Phantom pipeline estimate remains at approximately 908 units. Total In-transit (2088) is dominated by legacy lost orders and large recent valid batches (P43, P44). High explicit mu_hat required to maintain flow.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak winter season for sweatshirts (Dec 23). Demand has stabilized around 160-210 units per week after the late November spike. On-hand inventory is healthy at 559 units due to the arrival of the large Period 43 order (587 units). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1366 is heavily distorted by legacy lost orders (estimated at 908 units: P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29). These lost units act as a 'phantom pipeline' that prevents the OR backend from ordering. To ensure we maintain stock for the remainder of the winter peak and handle the lead time of 2-3 periods, I continue using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the pipeline deduction. I target a base stock level of approximately 1600 (Base Stock = Total In-transit + Desired Order). Given In-transit is 1366 and I want to see a replenishment of ~250 units to cover future demand, I set mu_hat to 1600. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Phantom pipeline remains estimated at ~908 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29). Total In-transit (1366) includes these lost units plus the Period 44 order (458 units). Continued explicit mu_hat overrides are necessary to force replenishment until the phantom units are cleared or demand significantly exceeds the pipeline volume.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30). Demand has dropped from the winter peak (~200+) to 87 units, indicating the post-holiday slowdown. On-hand inventory is healthy at 472 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1366 units remains heavily distorted by a 'phantom pipeline' of confirmed lost or severely overdue orders (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29, totaling ~908 units). The actual active pipeline is much smaller (primarily the P44 order of 458 units). Because the backend OR engine subtracts the full 1366 from the base stock calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure it doesn't stop ordering entirely if demand were to rise, or to maintain a buffer. Given current demand is 87 and L=2, a standard base stock (L+1=3 weeks) would be ~260-300 units. Adding the 908 phantom offset, I'll set mu_hat explicitly to ~1200 to ensure the backend logic (Base Stock - In Transit) doesn't result in long-term stockouts while the phantom units persist.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand drop confirmed: Period 46 demand (87) is ~50% lower than the Dec average (~180). Phantom pipeline inventory (lost units) remains estimated at ~908 units.
