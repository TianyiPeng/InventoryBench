Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical data shows 5 samples: 0, 0, 14, 47, 29. This SKU (V-neck blouse) is showing an emerging demand trend as we move into February, which aligns with early spring retail seasonality. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use all 5 historical samples to calculate the demand parameters (mean \u2248 18, std \u2248 20). Given the promised lead time of 2, the total horizon for the base stock calculation is (L+1) = 3 periods. I will set L to 'default' (2 periods) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this most recent activity while buffering for the observed volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's V-neck blouse. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 0, 0, 14, 47, 29, and most recently 16 in Period 1. This suggests the product is entering its active selling season. The initial order of 52 units was placed in Period 1 and is in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 52 units in pipeline. Demand in Period 1 was 16. To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the shift from zero-demand to the current active phase (averaging 47, 29, 16, and the upcoming forecast), though the OR backend will calculate based on historical samples. Given the volatility (0 to 47), I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to ensure the base stock accounts for recent fluctuations. Lead time L is set to default (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history shows a clear upward trend (0, 0, 14, 47, 29, 16, 23). The product is a women's blouse, which likely sees increasing demand as we approach spring. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory but 104 units in-transit (52 units ordered in P1, 52 units ordered in P2). With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of this period (P3), becoming visible at the start of Period 4. The P1 demand was 16 and P2 was 23; while these were lost due to stockout, they indicate a rising mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (covering the last 5 samples including preamble results) to capture this rising trend while smoothing volatility. Sigma is set similarly. Lead time remains 'default' at 2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demand samples are [0, 0, 14, 47, 29, 16, 23, 12], showing an upward trend starting late January followed by a stabilization in February. The mean over the last 5 relevant periods (since 2019-01-21) is 24.2. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 116 units in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 (52 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start state, yet 'arrived=0' is noted in Period 3 conclude. However, the game mechanism states we only see confirmation of Period 3 arrivals at the start of Period 4. Since the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows no arrivals for the P1 order, and the P1 order (placed at the start of P1) with L=2 should arrive during P3, this suggests either a lead time delay or a loss. Given it is still early, I will set L=3 via explicit method to account for this delay and use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the active selling period.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). Historical demand samples are [0, 0, 14, 47, 29] followed by observed demand in the game history of [16, 23, 12, 42]. The product is a women's blouse, and we are moving into the spring season, which typically sees a rise in demand for 'airy weave' garments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 10 units with 95 units in-transit (orders from P1, P3, and P4). We observed one arrival from P2 with a lead time of 2 periods, confirming the promised lead time holds for now. However, the order from P1 (52 units) is now overdue (placed in P1, should have arrived in P3, seen in P4). This suggests either a variable lead time or a lost shipment. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend factor in the observed lead time of 2, but I need to ensure mu_hat reflects the recent demand trend. Demand has been volatile but shows a general upward trend compared to the early 'zero' periods. Given the spring seasonality and the recent spike to 42, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the game history demand specifically.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' V-neck blouse. Current date is mid-March, entering the Spring season, which typically sees rising demand for lightweight garments. Historical demand observations (excluding internal software zeros) are: 14, 47, 29 (initial samples), then 16, 23, 12, 42, 45. There is a clear upward trend in the last two periods (42, 45) compared to the preceding weeks (16, 23, 12). Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 98 in-transit (orders from P3: 12, P4: 31, P5: 3, plus an unconfirmed P1 order of 52). If the P1 order is lost, we are under-stocked. I will use recent_N=3 for demand (average ~33) to capture the recent lift while smoothing the spike, resulting in a mu_hat of approx 100 for (1+L)=3 periods. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the high volatility seen in early spring demand swings.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 739953002 (Womens V-neck blouse) is entering the spring season (late March), and demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to early February. Recent demand samples are 42, 45, and 44 (average ~44), which is a significant increase from the initial zero or low double-digit samples. We have experienced a stockout since Period 5, losing significant profit opportunities. Regarding lead times: we observed a 2-period lead time for the Period 2 order (arrived P4) and a 1-period lead time for the Period 5 order (arrived P6). The Period 1 order (52 units) is notably missing/unaccounted for in the 'conclude' messages, suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed. Pipeline inventory is currently 146 units (Orders from P3=12, P4=31, P6=51, plus the likely lost P1=52). To recover and capture the spring demand, I am using a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime (~44/week). For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to average the observed 1 and 2-period lead times, which is more robust than assuming the promised 2 or the fast 1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: weekly demand increased from <20 to ~44 units due to spring seasonality. Period 1 order (52 units) appears lost or significantly delayed (6 periods elapsed).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, coinciding with the peak of the spring season for a 'V-neck blouse in an airy weave'. Demand has consistently sustained at high levels, with an average of approximately 46.75 units over the last 4 periods (42, 45, 44, 56). On-hand inventory is currently 0, largely due to stockouts caused by an inconsistent supply chain. The Period 1 order (52 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is likely lost. The Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2), but the Period 5 order arrived early (L=1 in Period 6). With 146 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 3, 4, 6), and a base lead time of 2, we expect arrivals during Period 8 and 9. To ensure we capture the spring demand peak and mitigate lost volume from the Period 1 shipment, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods of high demand (N=4) to reflect the current regime (~47 units/week). L is set to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variances (L=1 and L=2).

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (52 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Current demand regime (Period 4-7) is 46.75 units/week, up from ~20 units/week prior.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's blouse, which is entering peak spring seasonality. Demand has shown a significant ramp-up, especially in Period 8 where it reached 81 units, though sales were capped by stock availability (51 units). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is 53.6 units, but the most recent observation of 81 suggests a further acceleration into April. The order from Period 1 is still missing and confirmed lost. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P2 order took 2, P5 order took 1, P6 order took 2). Given the stockout in Period 8 and the rising demand trend, I am setting mu_hat to cover higher anticipated demand. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the spring regime shift, but use an explicit mu_hat calculation to target the more recent high demand of ~65 units/week across the lead time plus review period (1+2=3 periods). Pipeline inventory is 108 (orders from P3, P4, P7, P8), but P1, P3, and P4 orders are likely lost given they are 5+ periods old. To ensure the backend orders enough to meet the 80+ unit demand, mu_hat is set to 195 (65 * 3).

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration observed in early April: Period 8 demand reached 81 units, significantly above the previous regime average of 46.75. Orders from Period 1 (52), Period 3 (12), and Period 4 (31) are now considered lost (8, 6, and 5 periods elapsed respectively with no arrival).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's V-neck blouse, entering the peak spring season. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: Period 1-3 (~17/week), Period 4-7 (~47/week), followed by an April surge (P8=81, P9=41). The P8-P9 average is 61 units/week. Lead times are volatile: we have observed 1 period (P5 order) and 2 periods (P2 and P6 orders). Several orders (P1: 52, P3: 12, P4: 31) are now confirmed lost based on elapsed time. On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P4-P9) averages 51 units/week, but the 'airy weave' and 'V-neck' description suggests high demand through May. To ensure safety stock for the current (10) and lead periods (11, 12), I will set mu_hat explicitly to capture the seasonal uplift. Current pipeline is 200 units (P8 order: 13, P9 order: 92, and the previous period's unseen order). I set mu_hat based on an expected demand of 65 units/week across the 3-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed for April: avg demand (P8-P9) increased to 61 units/week. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. Significant inventory loss reaffirmed: orders from P1, P3, and P4 did not arrive.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for this V-neck blouse peaked in early April (81 units) and has since stabilized around 40-41 units over the last two weeks (P9-P10). Average demand over the most recent April regime (P8-P10) is 54 units/week. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (L1 in P6 and P9; L2 in P2, P6, and P8). Shipments from Period 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost, totaling 95 units; I account for this by looking at on-hand (65) and valid in-transit units (39 from P10). The OR backend 'pipeline inventory' likely still includes the lost units (134 total in-transit = 31 [P4] + 13 [P8-already arrived but maybe uncaptured] + 92 [P9-already arrived] + 39 [P10] + others). Since the OR engine's 'pipeline' is likely inflated by lost orders, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the base stock calculation targets the 54 units/week forecast regardless of the backend's potentially incorrect pipeline count. I set L=2 to be conservative against lead time volatility. Mu_hat is set to (1+L)*54 = 162. Sigma_hat is calculated manually based on the April variance (P8-P10: 81, 41, 40), giving a std of ~23, so sigma_hat = sqrt(3)*23 \u2248 40.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in late April at ~40 units/week following an early April spike of 81 units. Average April demand (P8-P10) is 54 units/week.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), we are transitioning out of the high-demand April period into May. Historical demand has settled significantly from the early April peak (81 units) and the mid-April stabilization (40 units) to the most recent sample of 28 units in Period 11. This suggests the spring peak is tapering off. I am choosing N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent deceleration (average 36.3 units/week), while using N=20 (effectively all history) for volatility (sigma_hat) to account for the high variance observed throughout the spring season. Lead time (L) remains centered around the promised 2 periods, despite some 1-period arrivals. We still have significant pipeline inventory (163 units) relative to current demand, so a conservative demand forecast prevents over-ordering during the cooldown. Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are long-lost and no longer affect pipeline math, but the backend is automatically clearing them from pipeline inventory calculation as new orders arrive and define the current window.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering off post-April peak: units dropped from April avg (~54) to 28 units in Period 11.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the product (Womens V-neck blouse) is entering May. Historical demand analysis shows a significant surge in April (peaking at 81 units, averaging ~54), followed by a decline in late April/early May (dropping to ~28 in P11 and 43 in P12). The demand regime for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) averages 46.6 units, reflecting this spring peak and subsequent stabilization. The lead time analysis indicates volatility between 1 and 2 periods, but several earlier orders (P1, P3, P4) remain lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 163 units in-transit (from orders in P10, P11, and P12). Given that the backend base-stock calculation uses (1+L) periods of demand, I will set mu_hat to explicitly cover the recent average of 46.6 units/week across the lead time + review period. Since L=2 is the promised and most frequent actual lead time recently, mu_hat will be set to (1+2)*46.6 = 140. sigma_hat is set to 35 to account for the high volatility seen during the April demand spike.

Carry-over insight: May demand transition: following an April peak (avg 54), demand has stabilized around 40-45 units/week in late April/early May (P11-P12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). Analyzing recent history: Period 11 demand was 28, Period 12 was 43, and Period 13 was 42. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' that demand has stabilized around 40-43 units following the April peak. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P11-P13) is 37.67, but the last two measurements (43, 42) suggest a slightly higher baseline of ~42. Lead times remain consistent at 1-2 periods (most recently 2 periods). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, while 169 units are in-transit (orders from P10, P12, and P13). However, following Carry-over Insights, we suspect orders from P10 (39 units) and earlier may be lost if they haven't arrived within 3-4 periods. The pipeline is heavily loaded with the 0-order from P12 and the 35-unit order from P13. Given the stabilizing demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak stability, and use the default lead time of 2 as recent arrivals have clustered at 1-2 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20th), the item (Womens Blouse) is in steady demand post-April peak. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P11-P14) is 40 units/week (28, 43, 42, 47), indicating a stable regime after the volatile oscillation in early April. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 169 units in-transit. Of these in-transit units, 105 units are from older periods (P1, P3, P4) and are definitely lost. Only the orders from P13 (35 units) and P10 (39 units) are recently placed, but since P10 was 5 periods ago and the average lead time is roughly 1.7 periods, P10 is likely lost too. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period stable average (40 units/week) scaled for lead time. L is set to calculate to reflect the observed 1-2 period delivery speed, though I must remain cautious about high shipping loss rates.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed steady at ~40 units/week in May (P11-P14 average: 40.0). High order loss rate persists: shipments from P1, P3, P4, and now likely P10 (5 periods elapsed) have failed to arrive.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the SKU 'V-neck blouse' is in a steady late-spring demand regime. After an early April peak (81 units), demand has stabilized at approximately 45 units per week (Period 12-15 average: 46 units/week). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline contains 169 units. However, consistent history of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10) suggests the actual pipeline inventory is lower than the nominal 169 units. The P13 order (35 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, further evidence of inconsistent lead times or losses. I will set mu_hat based on the recent stable demand of ~45 units/week. Since the backend's base-stock formula (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean) uses the promised lead time of 2, a value of 135 (3 periods * 45 units) is appropriate to cover the review and lead time. sigma_hat is set based on recent variability to maintain a buffer, while the OR engine manages the high service level (q=0.95) implied by the high profit margin ($19) vs. holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed shipment loss for Period 13 order (35 units) as 3 periods have elapsed beyond promised lead time (now 5 periods total since order). May demand stabilized at ~45 units/week.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 3, 2019 (Period 17), demand for this V-neck blouse has stabilized consistently around 45 units/week during May (P13-P16 average: 46.25). Historically, there has been a significant issue with lost shipments, including orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P13 (ordered 4 periods ago). This consistently depletes on-hand inventory, resulting in missed sales. Despite having 169 units theoretically 'in-transit', the repeated failures suggest that relying on the pipeline inventory is risky. However, given the OR backend's capped policy [final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)], the high 'in-transit' value will likely suppress new orders unless mu_hat is set aggressively or the L parameter is adjusted to reflect the longer effective lead time required to ensure availability. I will set mu_hat based on the stable May demand regime (N=4) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects recent behavior (average ~46), and maintain the default lead time calculation which averages out the 1-2 period actual arrivals observed.

Carry-over insight: June entry: Demand for May (P13-P16) stabilized at a mean of 46.25 units/week. Order from Period 13 (35 units) is confirmed lost/void as it has not arrived after 4 periods (promised 2).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand in late May to early June has seen a slight softening compared to the April peak, with the most recent demand at 27 units, though the May average was approximately 46 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The pipeline contains 169 units in-transit, but historical data confirms a severe reliability issue: orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13 have never arrived and are considered lost. Effectively, the 'In-transit' figure is heavily inflated by these 'ghost' units. To account for this, I must set the OR parameters to ensure new orders are actually placed to cover upcoming demand. I will estimate the effective lead time as 2 periods based on successfully concluded recent deliveries (P11 arrived in 2 periods). For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 periods (P13-P17) show an average of 42.4 units/week. Since the backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L) * mean, and I want to cover a base stock for a 3-week window (current week + 2 lead weeks) at ~45 units/week, I will use recent_N with N=5. This will trigger the OR engine to place orders despite the 'In-transit' noise, effectively treating the lost units as sunk costs that don't satisfy future demand.

Carry-over insight: Significant 'ghost' inventory in pipeline confirmed: orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13 (totaling 167 units) are lost/void. OR parameters must compensate by targeting a higher service level or using explicit forecasts to bypass inflated in-transit values. Early June demand (P17) shows a seasonal dip to 27 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), the SKU 739953002 (V-neck blouse) is in a summer sales phase, with June demand (P17-P18) averaging 35 units/week. A critical challenge exists: the back-end OR engine sees an In-transit pipeline of 169 units, which includes 167 units from orders placed in Period 1 (52), Period 3 (12), Period 4 (31), Period 10 (39), and Period 13 (33) that have never arrived. Since the OR engine calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', these 'ghost' units prevent the system from placing new orders, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). To force the engine to place an order and override these lost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 275, which is roughly equivalent to 8 weeks of demand (35 units * 8 weeks), significantly exceeding the visible pipeline. This high mu_hat will trigger the OR logic to generate a replenishment order despite the 169 units currently marked as in-transit, addressing the stockout immediately. Lead time L is kept at 2.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 167 units (lost/voided shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13) which causes the OR backend to under-order; mid-June demand stabilized at ~35 units/week.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (June 24, 2019), the system faces a massive 'ghost inventory' challenge. There are 277 units in-transit, but 167 of these (ordered in P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13) are effectively lost/void based on significant delays beyond the promised 2-period lead time. This causes the OR backend to severely under-order because it perceives a high pipeline stock that will never arrive. The most recent demand (P17-P19) has stabilized at an average of 33.3 units/week. To force the backend to place necessary orders, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. This value is calculated as (1+L) * Forecast_Demand + Ghost_Inventory. Given L=2 and a week of demand is ~35 units, the target for the next 3 weeks is ~105 units. To offset the 167 units of ghost inventory that are blocking new orders, mu_hat is set to 272 (105 + 167). This ensures the backend sees a required stock level that accounts for the fact that the pipeline is mostly empty of real stock. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 167 units (lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) persists; mu_hat must be set explicitly to override this pipeline inflation and trigger necessary replenishment.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/07/01), the SKU 739953002 is facing a critical inventory stockout (on-hand: 0). The OR backend's inventory calculation is heavily distorted by 167 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13). To force a replenishment order despite this inflated 'In-transit' count (302 units), mu_hat must be set explicitly to a value higher than the current perceived pipeline. Demand for June (P17-P20) has averaged 30.5 units/week, a seasonal decrease from the May average of 46 units. To maintain coverage while the inventory catches up, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 550. This covers the ghost inventory (167) plus a 3-week target buffer (approx 130) and provides enough overhead to clear the pipeline calculation. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent shipments (P8, P9, P11) arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: July entry: June demand (P17-P20) averaged 30.5 units/week, confirming a seasonal dip from May's 46 units/week. Ghost inventory remains constant at 167 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (July 8), we face a critical zero-stock situation with a massive 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 502 units. This includes 167 units confirmed lost from early periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) and recent large orders from P19 (108 units) and P21 (200 units) that have not yet arrived. Our objective is to satisfy current demand, which has entered a July seasonal dip averaging ~30.5 units/week (P17-P21). To force the OR backend to order despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom pipeline. Based on current demand (~31 units/week) and a lead time (L) of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is roughly 93 units. However, to bypass the 502 units currently in transit and account for the high loss rate, I will set mu_hat explicitly high. I'll maintain L=2 and sigma_hat as default to reflect historical volatility while ensuring the replenishment logic triggers.

Carry-over insight: July demand (P17-P21) confirmed at ~30.5 units/week, down from May's 46 units/week. Ghost inventory has ballooned to 502 units due to unreceived shipments from P19 (108 units) and P21 (200 units) adding to the prior 167 lost units; explicit mu_hat overrides are mandatory to maintain stock levels.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-July. Demand has shifted from a May peak of ~46 units/week to a June-July average of approximately 30.5 units/week. A critical issue persists with the 'In-transit' figure: it currently stands at 677 units, but a large portion of this is 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, and possibly P21 (lead time is 2, but P19 is now 4 periods late) are lost/void. Specifically, 167 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) + 108 units (P19) + 200 units (P21) total 475 units likely lost. The OR backend subtracts the full 677 pipeline units from its target inventory calculation, which would result in zero ordering unless mu_hat is set explicitly high to force a replenishment order. With zero on-hand and 30.5 units/week demand, we must ensure new orders are triggered. Setting mu_hat to 780 (approximately demand \xd7 (L+1) + suspected ghost inventory) to bypass the pipeline inflation and secure stock for the coming periods.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory (lost/void shipments) has reached approximately 475-675 units (comprising P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P21, and possibly P22). The OR backend's order calculation is severely suppressed by this inflated pipeline inventory, requiring explicit mu_hat overrides to maintain stock.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (July 22, 2019), demand has stabilized around 30-40 units per week (Period 17-23 average: 31.7 units). The massive influx of 400 units in Period 23 (from Period 21 and 22 orders) has resolved the out-of-stock situation, leaving an on-hand inventory of 358 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 402 units is still heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P19 orders, totaling approximately 277 units) which are confirmed lost. However, with 358 units on-hand against a weekly demand of ~35, there is no immediate risk of stockout. To prevent the OR backend from prematurely halting orders due to the ghost pipeline while simultaneously avoiding over-ordering on top of the current high stock, I am using an explicit mu_hat that reflects the current demand regime (~35 units/week across L+1 periods) and setting a conservative sigma to manage holding costs. L=2 is maintained based on recent successful arrivals from P20 and P21.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from P1 (52), P3 (12), P4 (31), P10 (39), P13 (35), and P19 (108) are confirmed lost, totaling 277 units of permanent 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. Current demand regime (Late June/July) has stabilized at ~32 units/week (+/- 5 units).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late July (2019/7/29). Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 32 units/week (average of P17-P24). The inventory situation has shifted significantly: high stock levels are finally present (on-hand: 334) following the arrival of P21 and P22 orders (400 units total). The pipeline inventory ('In-transit') currently stands at 402 units. Based on established carry-over insights, at least 277 units of this are 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). Additionally, the order from P23 (125 units) hasn't arrived yet; if it arrives in P25, the actual pipeline would drop towards the 'ghost' floor. With an ending on-hand of 334 and weekly demand around 32, we have over 10 periods of supply. The OR backend uses the formula: final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap). To prevent the backend from stopping orders prematurely due to the 277 units of ghost inventory (which it thinks is real stock), but also to avoid over-ordering given the currently high on-hand stock and low demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * 32. With L=2, base stock should be ~96. Since (on-hand 334 + real pipeline) is already much greater than 96, no new orders are needed this period. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the backend logic uses my controlled forecast despite the pipeline noise, though the resulting order will be 0 due to the high stock level.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Continued stabilization of late-summer demand at ~32 units/week. Arrival of P21 (200) and P22 (200) orders in P23 resolved the long-term stockout, but 277 units of 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) remain in the pipeline calculation.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in early August (Period 26). Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 32 units/week (+/- 5 units) throughout late June and July. Specifically, P24 (24 units) and P25 (41 units) maintain this range. The inventory situation has shifted from severe stockouts to a surplus following the arrival of P21 and P22 orders (400 units total) in Period 23. On-hand inventory is currently 293 units, which provides roughly 9 weeks of cover at current demand rates. However, the backend 'In-transit' figure of 402 units is heavily inflated by 277 units of 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P19). While 125 units from P23 are theoretically in-transit (expected around now), the current high on-hand levels mean the risk of stockout is zero for many periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (avg ~31 units/week), and the default lead time (2) as recent arrivals (P20, P21, P22) have been consistent with 1-2 periods. The backend will likely not place a new order due to the high on-hand + inflated in-transit values, which is appropriate given the current excess.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the V-neck blouse has stabilized at a summer average of approximately 39 units/week (Periods 23-26: 42, 24, 41, 61). While the Period 26 demand spiked to 61 units, the overall four-week average is 42 units, and the longer-term late-June/July trend sits around 35 units. The current on-hand inventory is 357 units, which is ample coverage (approx. 9 weeks) for the current demand regime. However, the 'In-transit' figure remains at 277 units due to confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, and 19. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'ghost' pipeline inventory from its target base stock, it would under-order in the future if mu_hat were not set to account for these lost units. For now, since on-hand inventory is high, I will use a conservative mu_hat reflecting the stabilized recent demand and set L to calculate to capture the slightly drifting delivery times (observed LT 1-3 periods lately).

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand (P23-P26) shows a slight uptick but remains averaged around 40 units/week. Ghost inventory of 277 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) is permanent; on-hand inventory is currently high at 357 units, providing sufficient safety buffer despite pipeline inflation.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27 (date 2019/8/12), we observed a significant demand spike to 118 units, the highest in the history of this SKU. This suggests a late summer or pre-season transition increase. Current on-hand inventory is 239 units, which is healthy, but 'ghost' inventory of 277 units (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) remains in the 'In-transit' calculation. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must continue using an explicit mu_hat. Given the recent demand surge (P26: 61, P27: 118), I will set mu_hat to cover a higher forecasted mean of ~60 units/week over (L+1) periods (3 * 60 = 180), ensuring the base stock level remains above the ghost inventory threshold to trigger any necessary orders if demand stays high.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed in Period 27 (118 units), well above the previous 40 units/week average. Permanent ghost inventory of 277 units continues to distort the pipeline inventory calculation.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29 (late August), we observe a recent demand spike in Period 27 (118 units), followed by a return to baseline in Period 28 (39 units). The average demand over the last four periods (P25-P28) is 64.75 units, heavily influenced by that spike. Current on-hand inventory is 200 units, which covers over 3 periods of average demand and 5 periods of forecasted baseline demand. The pipeline inventory remains inflated by 277 units of 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). Since on-hand inventory is healthy (200 units), there is no immediate risk of stockout. I will use an explicit mu_hat to carefully manage the stock level, setting it based on an expected demand of ~50 units per week (balancing the recent spike and historical late-summer baseline) across the review+lead time (1+2=3 periods). This results in mu_hat = 150. This explicit setting bypasses the distortion caused by the 277 units of ghost inventory in the OR backend's order logic, essentially preventing redundant ordering while maintaining a sufficient buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand spike of 118 units in P27 appears transient; P28 returned to 39 units. Ghost inventory remains constant at 277 units. Current stock (200) is sufficient for ~4 weeks.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), the SKU has 139 units on-hand and an inflated 'in-transit' total of 277 units. This in-transit value consists entirely of 'ghost inventory' from historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). Because the OR backend subtracts in-transit from the target base stock, it will not place new orders as long as this ghost inventory persists, unless mu_hat is set explicitly to override the calculation. Recent demand has fluctuated: P27 saw a spike (118), followed by a return to moderate levels (P28: 39, P29: 61). Excluding the extreme outlier of 118, the demand is averaging approximately 50-60 units/week. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 277-unit ghost pipeline, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than 'On-hand (139) + Ghost (277)'. Current stock (139) covers roughly 2.5 weeks of demand. To ensure continuity as we move into September, I will maintain a higher mu_hat to trigger replenishment, effectively clearing the ghost inventory bottleneck.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand has recently stabilized at a higher level, averaging ~63 units/week over the last 4 periods (P27-P30: 118, 39, 61, 67), compared to the previous ~40 units/week. Permanent 'ghost' inventory of 277 units (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) remains in the pipeline, which would normally suppress ordering. However, in-transit is currently 453, meaning 453 - 277 = 176 units are 'clean' in-transit (ordered in P30). On-hand inventory is 72. With a promised lead time of 2, the total 'real' position is 72 + 176 = 248 units. At a demand of ~63 units, this covers roughly 4 weeks, which is appropriate for L+1 coverage. To ensure the backend doesn't halt orders due to the 277 ghost units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly based on the current regime of ~63 units/week multiplied by (1+L).

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift: average demand increased to 63 units/week (P27-P30) from the prior 40 units/week. Permanent ghost inventory remains 277 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we are facing an on-hand stockout (0 units) following a demand spike to 80 units in Period 31. Current demand analysis shows a September regime shift: demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) has averaged 73 units/week (118, 39, 61, 67, 80), significantly up from the summer average of ~40. We must account for the permanent 277 units of 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) which the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculation. If left to 'default' or 'recent_N', the backend would see in-transit '453' units and refuse to order. With a lead time of 2 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 32, 33, and 34. Using our forecasted mean of 73 units, the targeted base stock should be approximately 219 (73 * 3) plus safety stock. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the pipeline inflation, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the total units needed to clear the 'ghost' inventory barrier and achieve the target safety level. Setting mu_hat to 650 targeting roughly 200+ net units.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift confirmed: average demand increased from ~40 to 73 units/week (P27-P31). Ghost inventory remains constant at 277 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the v-neck blouse (739953002) has increased in September, with an average demand of approximately 71 units/week over the last 6 periods (P27-P32: 118, 39, 61, 67, 80, 60). This is a seasonal shift compared to the summer average of 40 units/week. The current on-hand inventory is 116 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 542 units includes 277 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P19 that never arrived). The OR backend uses pipeline inventory (In-transit) to reduce order quantities, so ignoring these 277 lost units would lead to significant under-ordering. To compensate, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock target, effectively bypassing the ghost inventory. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, we need 3 weeks of stock. 3 * 71 = 213 units. To account for the 277 units the backend thinks we have but don't, I set mu_hat = 213 + 277 = 490. This ensures the backend places a replenishment order despite the pipeline distortion. Lead time is stable at 2 periods (P30 order arrived in P32), and sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility (standard deviation ~20-25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2204.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September demand has shown a significant regime shift, with demand rising from a ~40 units/week average to 85.5 units/week over the last 4 periods (P30-P33: 67, 80, 60, 135). The spike to 135 in P33 indicates strong momentum entering October. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'in-transit' figure of 542 is heavily inflated by 277 units of confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory from early periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19), leaving only 265 units (ordered in P32) expected to arrive in P34. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 542 units from the target base stock, it would under-order. To compensate, I am using an explicit mu_hat set to 300 (roughly 100 units/week for 1+L periods, where L=2). This higher mu_hat forces the backend to recognize the need for more stock to satisfy the new demand level and cover both actual demand and the pipeline distortion caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: September demand (P30-P33) confirmed a regime increase to ~85 units/week, with a late September spike to 135 units. Permanent ghost inventory remains at 277 units, continuing to distort the pipeline inventory calculation.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35 (early October), we face a critical stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand in September (P30-P34) surged to an average of 82.4 units/week, significantly higher than the previous 40 units/week regime. The current pipeline inventory shown (542 units) is severely misleading due to 277 units of permanent 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) and the P32 order of 265 units which is expected to arrive this period (P34+2). To ensure the OR backend places a replenishment order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using 'explicit' overrides. L is set to 2 (the reliable promised lead time recently observed). mu_hat is set to 525 (calculated as (1+L) * 175) to account for three periods of high autumn demand + a safety margin to offset the 277 units of 'ghost' inventory that the backend will subtract from its calculation. sigma_hat is set to 60 to protect against the high volatility observed in recent weeks (range 60-135).

Carry-over insight: September/October demand regime confirmed high at ~82 units/week. Permanent ghost inventory of 277 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) continues to require explicit mu_hat increases to bypass backend order suppression.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 36, the focus remains on overcoming the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 277 units (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P19) while accounting for the high autumn demand regime. Recent demand (P30-P35) averages approximately 78.1 units/week, with a peak of 135 and a recent figure of 57. The current on-hand inventory is 208 units, which covers about 2.5 weeks of demand. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 277 units of phantom stock, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock based on (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock. With L=2 (promised), we need to cover 3 periods. 3 * 80 (forecast) = 240 units. Adding a safety buffer for the high variance (std ~30) brings the required inventory level to approximately 300-330. However, because the backend subtracts the pipeline (On-hand 208 + In-transit 359 = 567) from the base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the capped order logic or ensure a positive order. Setting mu_hat to 600 (300 per review+lead period) is used to counteract the 277-unit inflation and maintain a steady flow of fresh inventory as the current high-stock phase from P32's arrival is consumed.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime for the Fall season (late Sept/Oct), with recent demand (P33-P36) averaging 78 units/week. While demand declined slightly to 50 in P36, the broader context of a V-neck blouse in October suggests robust demand will continue. There is a verified 'ghost' pipeline of 277 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) which the OR backend incorrectly counts as incoming stock, suppressing new orders. To maintain a safe on-hand balance and offset this distortion, I am using an explicit mu_hat. I target a weekly forecast of 75 units. For a 2-period lead time (L=2), the coverage requirement is (L+1) * 75 = 225. Adding the 277 'ghost' units to this required level (225 + 277 = 502) ensures the backend sees a 'need' for stock despite the inflated pipeline inventory. I will use recent_N for sigma to account for the heightened volatility observed during the September spikes.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38 (late October), the product is in a stable post-peak demand phase. October demand (P34-P37) has averaged 52.5 units/week, down from the September peak of ~85 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 207 units. The 'ghost' pipeline inventory remains a critical factor: the backend sees 393 units in-transit, but 277 of these are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). This means the 'true' pipeline is only 116 units (the P36 order). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 277-unit inflation, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the base stock requirements for (L+1) periods (3 weeks) using the current 52.5 average, plus the 277 ghost units to 'offset' the pipeline inflation. Calculation: (3 * 52.5) + 277 = 434.5. This ensures the backend calculates an order that maintains availability despite the false pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: October demand stabilized at a lower mean of 52.5 units/week (P34-P37), compared to the September peak of ~85. Ghost inventory remains constant at 277 units, continuing to necessitate explicit mu_hat overrides to avoid stockouts caused by backend pipeline inflation.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand context is Period 39 (early November). Recent demand (P34-P38) has fluctuated with an average of 58.6 units/week. While September saw a peak (~85), October has been lower. The backend logic is chronically suppressed by 277 units of 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P19). In-transit currently shows 393 units, which includes 277 units of ghost inventory plus 116 units ordered in P36. The 116 units from P36 are at L=3 now; since arrivals often take 1-3 periods, they might arrive this period. On-hand is 124 units. Total true pipeline and on-hand (excluding ghosts) is approx 124 + 116 = 240. To ensure we have enough stock for the next (L+1)=3 periods at ~60 units/week (total 180 required) plus safety stock, and to override the OR backend's belief that we have 277 more units than we do, I will use an explicit 'mu_hat' to trigger a replenishment order. Setting mu_hat to 350 to force the backend to account for the missing safety buffer and the ghost inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: November entry: Demand for October (P34-P38) averaged 58.6 units/week, a decrease from the September peak of ~85. Permanent ghost inventory of 277 units continues to distort backend calculations.

September's high-demand peak (avg ~85) has subsided. The permanent 'ghost' inventory of 277 units (from lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) remains in the system's in-transit calculation, which would normally suppress new orders. Current on-hand inventory is 186 units, roughly 3.3 weeks of supply at current rates. To ensure the backend places orders despite the ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 500. This value accounts for (1+L) periods of demand plus an offset to neutralize the 277 units of ghost inventory (Effective Base Stock targets ~460-500). Sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx 45*sqrt(3)) to maintain a sufficient safety buffer.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41 (mid-November), demand for this V-neck blouse has settled into a late-autumn rhythm, averaging 58.6 units/week over the last 5 periods (P36-P40). The primary challenge remains the permanent 'ghost' inventory of 277 units (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). This phantom pipeline volume causes the OR backend to severely under-order because it believes nearly 300 units are arriving soon. To ensure stock through the holiday season, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand (approx. 60 units/week) multiplied by (L+1), plus a significant compensatory factor to negate the 277-unit ghost inventory drag. With On-hand at 144, an explicit mu_hat of 600 (approx. 323 to cover 2-3 periods of demand + 277 to offset ghost inventory) will trigger the necessary replenishment. Lead time (L) is set to 2, consistent with recent arrivals and the promised window.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (late November), the SKU 739953002 continues to be impacted by 277 units of permanent 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). This inflated pipeline inventory causes the OR backend to systematically under-order or stop ordering entirely. Recent demand from October to mid-November (Periods 36-41) has averaged 49.0 units/week, showing a slight cooling from the September peak (~85). To maintain on-hand inventory and bypass the 277-unit distortion, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for lead time demand (3 periods) plus the ghost units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = ((L+1) * Expected Weekly Demand) + Ghost Inventory. With L=2 and Demand=50, targeting approx 150 + 277 = 427 for mu_hat. This ensures the OR engine computes a required order despite the pipeline bias. Currently, there are 113 units on hand and significant in-transit (510), but 277 of that is void, leaving ~233 real in-transit (including P40: 169 and P41: 64).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked significantly to 315 units, indicating a strong Black Friday/Holiday seasonal peak for this blouse SKU. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 510 units, but this includes 277 units of 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). The valid in-transit units are from P40 (169 units) and P41 (64 units), totaling 233 units. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock to cover the holiday demand and bypass the distortion from the ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value. I estimate the upcoming weekly demand at approximately 150 units to account for sustained holiday interest following the 315-unit spike. With a lead time of 2, the 'lead + review' period (L+1) is 3 weeks. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 450 (150 * 3). sigma_hat is increased to 80 to handle the high volatility seen in the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Significant holiday demand spike confirmed in late November (P42: 315 units). Ghost inventory remains at 277 units, continuing to distort pipeline calculations.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak holiday season (mid-December). Period 42 saw a massive spike (315 units), followed by high demand in Period 43 (144 units). Although demand may taper slightly after the pre-holiday rush, we must maintain high availability. The permanent 'ghost' pipeline inventory remains at 277 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19), which causes the OR backend to believe we have sufficient stock when we do not. To trigger an order despite this 277-unit inflation, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for current high demand (projected ~150/week) plus the need to neutralize the ghost inventory. mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost = 3 * 150 + 277 = 727. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds (Pipeline + On-hand) and generates necessary replenishment. Sigma_hat is set high to accommodate Volatility during the holiday peak.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed (P42: 315 units, P43: 144 units). Permanent ghost inventory of 277 units continues to require explicit mu_hat overrides near 700+ to ensure the backend places orders during high-demand periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand in the last three periods has been extremely volatile due to the holiday season (P42: 315, P43: 144, P44: 29). The average demand over these last 3 periods is 162.67 units/week. We must continue to account for the permanent ghost inventory of 277 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) which inflates the pipeline and causes the backend to under-order. With a promised lead time of 2, the backend uses a (L+1)=3 period window. We need the base stock to be enough to cover current holiday demand plus a safety buffer, while offsetting the 277 units of ghost stock. Target base stock = (162.67 * 3) + 277 ghost units + safety buffer \u2248 800. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 800 will trigger the necessary replenishment. Lead time (L) is set to calculate as actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late December (Period 46), currently facing a stockout after a strong mid-December demand of 196 units. Historical data and the item description (V-neck blouse) suggest high volatility and a holiday peak (P42: 315, P43: 144, P45: 196). Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. The most critical issue is the 'ghost' inventory: shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P19 (totaling 277 units) are permanently lost but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count. This inflation causes the OR engine to under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat explicitly to 700 units. Since in-transit is 1019 units and 'ghost' is 277, the effective pipeline is 742 units. Setting mu_hat to 700 targets a replenish-to-stock level that accounts for the L+1 demand window (approx 200 units/week during peak) while attempting to trigger an order despite the pipeline bias. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to manage the high variance observed in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed (P42: 315, P43: 144, P45: 196 units). Permanent ghost inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) remains at 277 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30). The holiday peak (P42: 315, P43: 144, P45: 196) has likely passed, and we expect demand to transition into a lower post-holiday/early-year regime. Looking at the history from earlier in 2019 (P1-P3), demand was substantially lower (~20 units/week). However, for the immediate forecast, we must account for the 277 units of permanent 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) which tricks the OR backend into thinking we have more stock than we do. On-hand is currently 0. We have 1019 units in-transit (Orders from P44: 385 and P45: 357 plus the ghost total), but given the 2-perod promised lead time, the P44 order should have arrived in P46. Its absence suggests it might also be delayed or lost, though it is too early to confirm it as 'ghost'. To ensure we maintain stock for the upcoming weeks despite the 277-unit pipeline distortion, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 500. This value essentially overrides the 277 'ghost' units and targets a realistic base stock for a ~75 units/week demand scenario (a conservative post-peak estimate). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time which has trended closer to 2-3 periods recently.
