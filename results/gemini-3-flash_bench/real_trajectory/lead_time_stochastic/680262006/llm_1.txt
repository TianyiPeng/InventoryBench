Historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a clear upward trend (52 -> 141 units), likely driven by the 'New Year, New Me' fitness season. The most recent demand (Feb 4) was 125, following a peak of 141. Current date is Feb 11. Historically, fitness apparel demand remains strong in Feb but may stabilize after the initial January surge. I will forecast demand around 120-130 units per period. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand starting from Period 1 (ending Period 3), I need approximately 360-390 units. On-hand and in-transit are currently 0. Therefore, I will place an initial order of 380 units to establish inventory and meet this sustained seasonal demand.",

However, the Period 1 order (380 units) is now 2 periods overdue (should have arrived in P3) and remains in transit, suggesting it might be delayed or potentially lost.

Demand analysis: There was a significant regime shift starting in Period 10, where demand dropped from an average of ~140-150 units to a new range of 74-97 units (average ~84). This shift has persisted for 4 periods, likely due to a post-peak spring workout seasonality or market saturation. Lead time analysis: Promised LT is 2. Deliveries for P11 arrived on time in P13 (LT=2). Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 700 units) are confirmed as lost, as they are now 9-12 periods overdue. Inventory status: Ending inventory for P13 is 175 units. In-transit shown is 870, but 700 units are lost, and the only remaining in-transit is the P10 order of 170 units (ordered 4 periods ago, significantly overdue and potentially lost, but even if it arrives, we are overstocked). Pipeline check: Currently on-hand (175) is sufficient to cover approximately 2 periods of demand (approx 84/week). If the P10 order is lost, we will have 175 left; if it arrives, we will have 345. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) vs. profit ($4.0) and the recent demand drop, I will not place an order this period.

The In-transit total of 870 is heavily inflated by lost orders: P1 (380), P3 (150), and P4 (170) account for 700 units. Additionally, the order from P10 (170 units) is now 3 periods past its promised delivery and has likely joined the lost status.

Demand over the last eight periods (P20-P27) has averaged approximately 11 units per period (range 4-20). On-hand inventory is currently 94 units. Given this low demand regime, the 94 units currently on-hand are sufficient to cover approximately 8.5 periods of demand (well into October), assuming demand remains at this floor. While demand for sports leggings typically begins to recover in late August and September as the weather cools and the 'back-to-gym' season commences, the current inventory buffer is substantial enough to absorb the initial phase of any seasonal recovery. The 'In-transit' figure of 970 remains composed of confirmed lost/severely delayed orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17) and should be discounted. No new order is needed this period as we prioritize reducing on-hand inventory to minimize holding costs ($1/unit).",

Period 44 (2019/12/9) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is 'Ladies H&M Sport SUPREME tights', a full-length sports garment. Demand is highly seasonal, with a significant trough during the summer (approx. 8 units/week) and peaks in winter/spring (initial historical demand was 50-140 units). We are currently in early December (Period 44). While Period 42 showed a spike to 30 units, Period 43 dropped back to 3, indicating the 'winter recovery' is currently volatile rather than a smooth upward trend. On-hand inventory is 89 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1120 is mostly comprised of 970 units confirmed lost in previous periods (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17). The active pipeline consists only of the order placed in Period 43 (150 units). Given the lead time of 1-2 periods, the P43 order is expected to arrive in Period 44 or 45. Total reliable inventory (On-hand 89 + P43 order 150) is 239 units. With current demand averaging around 12 units over the last 3 weeks (30, 3, 6 approx), 239 units cover approximately 20 weeks of demand at current rates, or 4-5 weeks if demand suddenly surges back to the historical spring mean of ~50. I will not place an order this period to avoid excessive holding costs while waiting for the P43 shipment to arrive and the demand regime to further clarify.",

Period 45 (2019/12/16) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is SUPREME sports tights (full-length). Demand reflects strong seasonality: high in late winter/spring (140-160 units), dropping in early summer (30 units), hitting a trough in mid-summer/autumn (<10 units), and recovering in late winter. We are currently in mid-December (Period 45). Period 42 showed a spike (30 units), but subsequent weeks (P43-44) returned to very low levels (3-4 units), suggesting the P42 spike might have been an early holiday promotion or outlier, rather than a sustained recovery. Historical data from early Jan 2019 shows demand starting at ~50 and climbing rapidly to >120. We must prepare for this Jan/Feb surge. In-transit calculation: Total in-transit is 1120. However, Carry-over Insights identify 970 units as lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17). This leaves an effective in-transit of 150 (the order from P43). Current on-hand is 85. Our total effective pipeline is 85 (on-hand) + 150 (arriving P45/46) = 235 units. Expected demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1): P45 (~15), P46 (~30), P47 (~50) = ~95 units. Inventory is sufficient to cover the transition into January. I will not order more this period to avoid excessive holding costs, as current stock + arriving 150 units provides ~2.5x coverage of near-term forecast.",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is 'Ladies Sport Tights', which historically exhibit higher demand in late winter/early spring (Jan-April) and a significant trough during summer and autumn. Current date is Dec 23rd (Period 46). We have just seen a demand of 6 units in Period 45 and 4 in Period 44, following a brief spike to 30 in late November. Despite being near the holiday season and entering the typical peak fitness season (January), current inventory (229 units) is substantial given recent demand levels (averaging ~10.5 units over the last 5 periods). Historical demand at the start of January (based on provided seed data) was 52, 69, and 123. If we expect demand to climb to ~70-100 units/period starting in January, the current 229 units on-hand will likely cover the next 2-3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 970 remains a phantom value representing lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17). With an estimated lead time of 1-2 periods, ordering now is not strictly necessary to meet immediate demand, and holding costs ($1/unit) are high relative to profit ($4/unit). I will wait one more period to observe if the January fitness surge begins before committing to more inventory, as 229 units provide a safe buffer.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is 'Ladies Sport Tights', a seasonal item that peaks in late winter/early spring and troughs in summer. Current date is Dec 30, 2019 (Period 47). While a demand spike (30 units) was observed in Period 42 (late November), demand has since fallen back to single digits (P43-P46: 3, 4, 6, 5). Historical data from January/February shows demand levels between 50-140. We are approaching the high-demand season (Jan/Feb). On-hand inventory is 224 units. Forecasted demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) is conservative but prepared for seasonal ramp-up: P47 (~10), P48 (~20), P49 (~40). Total expected demand over the lead time window is ~70 units. With 224 on-hand, we have sufficient cover for the immediate transition into January. The 970 units in-transit are confirmed lost from previous months and should be ignored. No order is required this period as inventory will still be ~150+ units by the time a new order placed in P48 would arrive.",
