  "rationale": "Product 729928001 is a 'Short skater skirt' from the 'Divided' collection. Calendar date 2019-02-11 suggests we are entering mid-late February, which typically sees an uptick in spring fashion demand. Historical data shows demand increasing from 71 to 90 by late January, settling at 80 in early February (average demand ~80 units). The promised lead time is 2 periods. To avoid stockouts while arrivals occur, I need to cover demand for current Period 1, plus lead time (Period 2 and 3). Expected demand per period is ~80 units. Therefore, I need to cover 3 periods (80 * 3 = 240 units). Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will place an order for 240 units to build the initial pipeline. This account for the 2-period delay and the immediate demand in Period 1 that will result in a stockout (since no inventory moves in until Period 3).",

This confirms the previously noted ~60% increase over Jan levels. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2. The P1 order (240 units) was scheduled to arrive in P3 resolution but has not appeared in the P3 conclude message. Based on the rules, P1's order should arrive DURING P3 and be visible at the start of P4. However, the current status still shows On-hand: 0.

In-transit is 600 (P1: 240, P2: 160, P3: 200). e) Order Logic: We need to cover demand for (L+1) periods. Assuming the new mean is ~140 (conservative estimate given the 171 spike) and L=2 (or 3), we need ~560 units in the pipeline. Current pipeline is 600.

I will forecast demand around 100-110 for the next few lead periods (L=2, so looking at P5, P6, P7). c) Lead time analysis: P2 order (160 units) arrived in P4, confirming a lead time of 2 periods. The P1 order (240 units) is now 2 periods overdue and likely lost. The P3 order (200 units) is expected to arrive during P5 (visible in P6). d) Inventory: On-hand is 87 units.

Expected demand for P5+P6+P7 is ~330 units. While 437 units covers the lead time, the stockout in P1-P3 resulted in 373 lost sales.

Mid-March (P6) is entering peak spring shopping. b) Historical weekly demand: Jan (71-90, avg 80), Feb (97-171, avg ~124), early March (73-72). The February spike was likely early-season stocking; recent weeks show a stabilization around 70-75. However, as weather warms in late March/April, demand is expected to remain firm or increase. c) Lead time analysis: P2 order (160) arrived P4 (LT=2). P1 order (240) is confirmed lost. P3 order (200) was placed in P3 with LT=2, meaning it should arrive in P5 and be visible in P6's conclude message.

  "rationale": "Product 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' is a short skater skirt, highly relevant for the spring season starting in March. Historical demand in January averaged ~80. In February (P1-P3), demand spiked significantly (Avg ~124) but has stabilized in March (P4-P6 Avg ~71). On-hand inventory is 68 units. Pipeline analysis: P1 order (240) is lost. P3 order (200, ordered Feb 25) is now overdue (should have arrived P5/P6); given the loss of P1, there is a high probability P3 is also lost. P4 order (150) and P6 order (120) are currently in-transit. Lead time is volatile (P2 took 2 periods, P5 took 1 period). Expected demand for the lead-time horizon (3 periods) and current stabilized March demand is ~215 units. Total pipeline is 710, but subtracting the highly likely lost P3 (200) leaves 510. Even if P3 is lost, we have ample stock arriving (P4 and P6). However, the massive 'In-transit' of 710 vs 'On-hand' 68 suggests a discrepancy. Recalculating: P1(Lost-240), P2(Arrived), P3(Likely Lost-200), P4(150), P5(Arrived), P6(120), P7(Order?). Total in-transit 710 - P4(150) - P6(120) = 440 (matching P1+P3).

In-transit consists of orders from P10 (150), P11 (150), P12 (150), and perhaps overdue units. Reviewing lead times: P2 arrived in 2 periods, P5 in 1, P6 in 2, P7 in 1, P8 in 2, P9 in 1. This suggests a pattern where orders either arrive in 1 or 2 periods. Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost. P10 (ordered 2019/4/15) is now overdue by the 'actual' 1-2 period standard and potentially lost.

I expect demand to continue plateauing or gradually declining as the transition to fall fashion begins. Supply chain reliability has been a significant issue, with roughly 40% of orders historically failing to arrive (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P19 are long past expected delivery and considered lost). Currently, on-hand inventory is 171 units. The in-transit pipeline is extremely heavy at 1,290 units; even assuming a 40% loss rate, approximately 774 units are expected to arrive over the coming periods (Orders from P23 and P24 are notably absent and may arrive shortly or join the lost order list).

(c) Lead Time & Reliability: Actual lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, with a historical order loss rate of approximately 40%. Orders from P19 are long overdue and confirmed lost.

  "rationale": "The SKU 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' is currently in a late-autumn demand phase with significant volatility. Recent demand (P37-P39) has averaged approximately 104 units, contrasting with the lower early-September levels. Supply chain reliability remains a major constraint; the historical loss rate is approximately 43%-50%. Specifically, the order from P34 (150 units) is now 6 periods old and definitively lost, while orders from P35, P37, and P36 arrived with lead times of 1, 1, and 3 periods respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 70 units. The effective 'live' pipeline consists of orders from P38 (150 units) and P39 (150 units). Since we are at Period 40 and the game ends at 47, we have 8 periods remaining. Total expected demand for the rest of the game (assuming ~90/week) is 720 units. On-hand (70) + effective in-transit (300) = 370 units. To cover the remaining 7 weeks of demand while accounting for a ~50% supply loss risk, I need to place an order that ensures availability without excessive holding costs as the game approaches its end. An order of 250 units targets strengthening the pipeline for the final periods.",

  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'short skater skirt', which typically sees peak demand in spring/summer but maintains late-season relevance (likely driven by party/evening wear and indoor events). Current demand (Nov 18) remains steady around 70-80 units, despite a late-season surge to 127 in P38. My lead time analysis shows that the promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual arrival varies from 1 to 3 periods, with a significant loss rate (~40-50%). For P41, I am starting with 0 on-hand inventory. The In-transit pipeline of 1,840 units contains 1,140 units that are over 10 periods old and effectively lost. The 'active' pipeline consists of the orders from P38 (150 units), P39 (150 units), and P40 (250 units). The P38 order (placed Oct 28) should have arrived by P40 conclude (P41 start), but since it didn't (lead time > 2), there is a high probability it is lost or delayed. To ensure coverage for the next 3 periods (P41-P43) at an average demand of ~85 units (allowing for volatility), I need approximately 255 units. Given the high order loss rate, I must continue to order aggressively to secure physical arrivals. I will place an order for 150 units to maintain a continuous inflow despite potential losses.",

  "rationale": "The SKU 729928001 (short skater skirt) is experiencing a dramatic demand surge in late November (P42 demand = 243), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday retail events and the start of the holiday gifting season. This follows a previous high-variance regime spanning October and November (~80-120 units/week). Initial demand was ~80 in early spring and peaked in summer, but current year-end volatility is unprecedented for this SKU. Supply chain reliability remains extremely poor (~40-50% loss rate), with orders from P34, P38, and P40 currently missing or delayed beyond 2 periods. On-hand inventory is 0 after P42's stockout. Given only 5 periods remain (P43-P47), and a 2-period lead time with high loss risk, I must account for the current demand spike (243) and potential maintenance of a high holiday regime (~150/week). Total pipeline required for the remaining life of the game (L=2 plus 3 additional periods) equals roughly 750 units. Current In-transit is nominal (1990) but contains mostly 'zombie' units from earlier in the year that are confirmed lost. Only orders from P40, P41, and P42 (550 units) are potentially viable.

With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47), the primary goal is to minimize holding costs while ensuring enough inventory to cover the remaining demand. On-hand inventory is 170.

Expected demand for the remaining 3 periods is estimated at ~115 units/period (total 345 units). Current on-hand (170) plus the P42 and P43 orders (which have high likelihood of arrival in P45-P46) should comfortably cover this.

On-hand inventory is 500 units, which vastly exceeds the expected demand for the final two periods (estimated at ~70-100 units per period based on current December trends). Furthermore, the 'In-transit' figure of 1,590 is misleadingly high because 1,140 units were confirmed lost months ago (from periods 1-34), and recent active shipments from P44 (150 units) are still in the pipeline. Given the high on-hand stock (500) relative to the remaining time (2 periods) and a holding cost of $1.00/unit vs. a profit of $4.00/unit, any further ordering would only accumulate unnecessary holding costs without providing additional sales benefit.
