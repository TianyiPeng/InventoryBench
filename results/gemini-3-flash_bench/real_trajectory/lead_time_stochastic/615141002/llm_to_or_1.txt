Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Juanos', a women's long-sleeved fitted top. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend from early January (99 units) to late January (148 units), slightly dipping in the first week of February (135 units). This likely represents a transition into early spring fashion or post-holiday restocking. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the review+lead period is 3 periods (L+1). Current on-hand is 0 with no pipeline inventory. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent higher demand regime (averaging approx 130 per week). I'll use 'default' for sigma to ensure adequate safety stock during this initial phase, and 'default' for L as we have no historical lead time feedback yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The SKU is a women's long-sleeved jersey top. Historical data (Jan-early Feb) shows demand averaging around 114 units/week (99, 85, 106, 148, 135). In Period 1 (Feb 11), actual demand was 79, which is slightly lower but within normal variance. We currently have 0 on-hand and 173 in-transit (ordered in P1). Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, we expect this order to arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of P4). We are currently losing sales due to zero stock. I will use a conservative average of historical demand plus the P1 observation to forecast. The mean of samples [99, 85, 106, 148, 135, 79] is approx 108.6. Setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods, roughly 326 units. Given the high holding cost ($1) and low profit ($1), the OR backend's service level target (profit/(profit+holding)) is 0.5, meaning it will aim for the median demand. I'll use recent_N to capture the transition into late Feb/early March.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's long-sleeved fitted top. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 - Feb 4) showed a rising trend (99, 85, 106, 148, 135) with a mean of ~115. Recent period demand (Period 1: 79, Period 2: 84) is lower than the January peak, possibly due to post-winter seasonality or mid-February lull. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 326 units in transit (173 from P1, 153 from P2). With a promised lead time of 2, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3 (visible at start of P4). We are currently losing sales due to stockouts. I will use a recent_N approach for \u03bc\u0302 based on the last 5 samples (P2, P1, and the 3 latest historical samples) to capture the current demand level (~106) while awaiting the pipeline to resolve the stockout.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top. Historical demand data from late Jan/early Feb showed values around 135-148, but the last three actual periods (P1-P3) have shown lower demand: 79, 84, and 71 (average ~78). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (173 units) and P2 (153 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in P3's conclude message (read at P4 start). However, the P3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and the in-transit balance remains 332 (173+153+6). This indicates the P1 order is delayed. Since we have 0 on-hand and have lost all demand so far, we need the OR backend to maintain a target that covers the (L+1) window. I will set L to 'explicit' 3 to account for the observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 3 periods (N=3) show a clear shift from the initial pre-game samples (avg 115) to a lower regime (avg 78). Therefore, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current demand level while the lead-time adjustment helps ensure the order quantity accounts for the longer pipeline.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The historical data shows a massive demand surge in Period 4 (demand=509) compared to previous weeks (avg ~100). This corresponds to seasonal shifts in March for women's tops (spring collection). The Period 1 order (173 units) is overdue (it has been 4 periods since ordering, while promised lead time is 2). The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. The overdue Period 1 order suggests a potential lost shipment or significant delay, but it's too early to confirm a lead-time regime shift. Demand has clearly shifted: the last 5 samples are [99, 85, 106, 148, 135] (pre-game) and [79, 84, 71, 509] (in-game). The Period 4 spike of 509 units is the primary driver. To protect against stockouts during this high-demand phase while accounting for the missing shipment risk, I will use a mu_hat based on recent demand (N=4) to capture the trend change, while maintaining the promised lead time (L=2). The backend will calculate base stock using (1+L) * mean. Mean of last 4: (79+84+71+509)/4 = 185.75. mu_hat = 3 * 185.75 = 557.25.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's ribbed jersey top. A significant demand regime shift occurred starting in Period 4 (March 4th), likely due to a seasonal transition/spring launch. Historical demand (Periods 1-3) averaged ~78, while Periods 4-5 averaged ~552, representing a 600%+ increase. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) with 558 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods; the Period 2 order (153 units) arrived in Period 4 (L=2), but the Period 1 order (173 units) is notably missing/lost. Given the massive demand spike and the need for higher service levels to capture profit while minimizing backorders (even with high holding costs), I am shifting to recent_N (N=2) to capture the high-demand regime. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to account for the confirmed L=2 and observe future arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: weekly demand increased from ~78 to ~552 (+600%) coinciding with March spring seasonality. Order from Period 1 (173 units) appears lost as it is 2 periods past promised arrival.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019/03/25). The garment 'Juanos' (long-sleeved top) is experiencing high spring demand. A major regime shift occurred at Period 4, with average demand jumping from ~80 to ~450+ per week. History shows: P1 order (173 units) is lost (4 periods past promised); P2 order arrived in 2 periods; P5 order arrived in 1 period. Demand has been volatile: 509 (P4), 595 (P5), and 274 (P6). The current on-hand is 105, following the arrival of the P5 order. The P6 order (653 units) is in transit. To stabilize, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the high-demand regime (avg ~459), and L is set to 'calculate' to account for the varying 1-2 period lead times. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock covering (L+1) periods of this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility within the new high-demand regime: Period 4-5 averaged 552, but Period 6 dropped to 274. Lead time is variable (observed 1 and 2 periods). Order from Period 1 is confirmed lost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (women's long-sleeved jersey top) has entered a high-volatility phase. Recent demand history shows a massive spike in Periods 4 and 5 (500-600 units) followed by a significant drop in Periods 6 and 7 (274 and 86 units respectively). This suggests the initial spring surge may be subsiding or erratic. Inventory is critically low (19 units) while 1,273 units are in-transit (orders from Period 6 and 7). The lead time inference shows variability between 1 and 2 periods (P5 order took 1, P2 order took 2). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this variance. For demand (mu_hat), utilizing a recent_N of 4 (Periods 4-7) captures the post-regime-shift mean of approximately 366 per period. To account for the extreme volatility (595 vs 86), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 350 to ensure the base stock is high enough to buffer against another 500+ unit surge while the large pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand stabilization: After the 600% spike in early March, demand has rapidly decelerated (595 \u2192 274 \u2192 86). Current mean is high-variance.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a women's ribbed jersey top. Historical data showed a massive demand spike in early March (P4: 509, P5: 595), followed by a sharp decline in late March/early April (P6: 274, P7: 86, P8: 112). The pre-spike mean was ~85. The localized mean for the last three periods (P6-P8) is approximately 157. Given the 'Womens Everyday Collection' nature, early spring often sees a temporary surge for layering pieces followed by a return to baseline. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (1001 units) due to the arrival of two large orders (ordered in P6 and P7) simultaneously in P8. Total pipeline inventory is 179. The OR backend needs to recognize the downward trend to avoid excessive holding costs (which are equal to profit). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-surge stabilization and specify L as calculate to account for the observed lead time variations (1 and 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Post-spike stabilization confirmed: Demand has settled into a lower regime (avg ~150 over last 3 periods) compared to the March peak (~550). Inventory is currently in surplus due to overlapping arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Juanos' (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) is now in a post-peak spring stabilization phase. After an early March demand spike (~550 units), demand has settled into a significantly lower and more stable regime. The last four demand samples are 274, 86, 112, and 81, averaging 138 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 920 units, which is remarkably high (covering ~6-7 weeks of current demand) due to overlapping arrivals from orders placed in Periods 6 and 7. The holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), meaning the critical ratio (q) is 0.5, leading to a z-score of 0. This results in a target base stock exactly equal to the expected demand (\u03bc\u0302). With 920 on-hand and 179 in-transit, the system is significantly overstocked. To prevent the OR backend from placing more orders and to minimize further holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 samples (N=4) to reflect the recent lower demand trend. No new order will be triggered because the pipeline inventory (1099) far exceeds the calculated base stock for a 2-period lead time (~414 units).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: Demand has reverted to a lower regime (avg ~138 over last 4 periods) following the March surge. High surplus inventory exists (920 on-hand + 179 in-transit).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Jersey Top) has returned to a stable low-regime after a massive surge in March (Periods 4-5). Over the last four periods (7-10), demand has consistently trended downward: 86, 112, 81, and 47 (mean \u2248 81.5). We are currently in a significant overstock position with 873 units on-hand and 179 in-transit, while demand is low. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level is 50%, aiming to keep ending inventory near zero. Because the pipeline (1052 total units) far exceeds the required base stock for a (L+1=3) period window at current demand levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the sustained lower demand regime and allow the OR engine to wind down the surplus. Lead time remains volatile (1-2 periods), so I will use a calculated average. No new orders are expected to be generated by the backend due to the heavy inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-March surge: Period 7-10 weekly mean is ~82 units, significantly lower than the P4-P5 peak of ~550. Inventory surplus (873 on-hand) is now the primary driver for parameter selection to avoid further holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-813.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P7-P11: 86, 112, 81, 47, 30) shows a steady decline following the March peak, settling into a much lower regime with a current 4-period mean of approximately 68 units. With 843 units on-hand and 179 in-transit, current total inventory is 1022 units. Given the most recent demand of 30 units, the on-hand stock alone covers nearly 28 weeks of demand. The primary risk is high holding costs ($1.0/unit/period, equal to potential profit). I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak deceleration. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-2 periods). The high on-hand inventory relative to the calculated base stock will naturally result in zero orders from the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime deceleration confirmed post-March peak: Mean demand has dropped from ~550 (P4-P5) to ~68 units (P8-P11), a decrease of over 85%. Significant surplus inventory (843 units) now poses a dominant holding cost risk.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top (Juanos), which has transitioned out of its early March seasonal peak. Demand has significantly cooled and stabilized over the last 6 periods (P7-P12), averaging approximately 67 units per week [86, 112, 81, 47, 30, 48]. Currently, the system holds 795 units on-hand plus 179 in-transit, totaling 974 units. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the service level q = 0.5, directing the policy toward the median demand. At current consumption rates of ~67 units/week, the existing inventory covers over 14 weeks of demand. To minimize holding costs while the surplus is liquidated, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the post-peak stabilization. This will result in a base stock significantly lower than the current inventory, ensuring no new orders are placed and the OR engine caps any attempt to order due to the high pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Post-peak mean (P7-P12) is ~67 units, a significant drop from the March surge. Inventory surplus (974 total) is the primary constraint.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. Demand for this SKU has fundamentally shifted from a high-surge period in early March (~550 units/week) to a much lower, stable regime. Over the last seven periods (P7-P13), demand has averaged approximately 63 units per week, with a further deceleration observed in the most recent four periods (P10-P13) averaging only 40 units per week. The system currently holds 760 units on-hand plus 179 units in-transit (939 total), which represents over 15 weeks of supply at current demand rates. Because the Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, implying the backend target is roughly the median demand. With a massive surplus, the inventory priority is to minimize holding costs by preventing any further orders until the stock level normalizes. I am using recent_N (N=4) to establish the current low-demand baseline (mean ~40) and will use explicit lead time to match the promised 2 periods, as lead times have stabilized at 1-2. No carry-over insight update is required as the stabilization was previously noted.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for this Jersey Fancy top has stabilized at a low level following the March seasonal spike. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), demand has averaged 39 units per week (30, 48, 35, 43). The stock position is extremely high: there are 717 units on-hand and 179 units in-transit (ordered in Period 7, which arrived in P8, but there's a discrepancy in pipeline reporting or a delayed unit count from previous volatility). Regardless, 717 on-hand units cover nearly 18 weeks of demand at the current rate of ~40 units/week. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), minimizing inventory is the priority to avoid net losses. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the low-demand plateau, ensuring the base stock calculation remains significantly below current inventory levels to prevent the OR engine from ordering more units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late Spring (P11-P14) at a mean of ~40 units/week, down from the peak of ~550 in March. Holding costs are currently the primary risk due to high on-hand surplus.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 (Womens Jersey Fancy top) has exited its peak March demand period (~550 units/week) and has settled into a significant low-demand regime. Analyzing samples from P11 to P15, the average weekly demand is approximately 41.8 units. Current inventory status is extremely high with 664 units on-hand and 179 units in-transit (843 total). Given the current mean demand, this inventory represents over 20 weeks of supply. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend OR engine will target a base stock level corresponding to a 50% service level (z=0). My objective is to prevent any additional orders to minimize the substantial holding cost. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (P11-P15) to reflect the recent low-demand stability (mean ~42, std ~9). With a base stock (reaching ~126 for L=2) far below the current pipeline of 843, the OR backend will correctly place zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late Spring (P11-P15) with a mean of ~42 units/week. Inventory surplus remains critical with >20 weeks of coverage.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top (Womens Everyday Collection). Demand surged in March (P4-P5) but has since stabilized at a much lower level. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand has averaged 40.8 units per week. Currently, there is a massive inventory surplus (On-hand: 628, In-transit: 179) totaling 807 units. With current demand, this inventory covers approximately 20 weeks. Since the Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal (q=0.5), the target service level is 50%, which aligns the base stock closely with the expected demand over the lead time (L+1). Given the inventory glut, the goal is to prevent the OR engine from ordering more until the surplus clears. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the current stable low-demand regime. This will set a mu_hat (~122 for L=2) that is far below the pipeline inventory (807), ensuring no new orders are placed and minimizing further holding costs.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved ribbed jersey top, which experienced a significant demand surge in March (peaking at ~550 units/week) but has since stabilized at a much lower level. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), the mean demand has settled at approximately 39 units/week (30, 48, 35, 43, 53, 36, 27). The SKU is currently in a significant surplus position with 601 units on-hand and 179 units in-transit (ordered in Period 1 but still listed, likely a system artifact or lost shipment). Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), the priority is to avoid placing any new orders until the inventory reduces naturally. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N approach (N=7) to reflect the stabilized lower demand regime and use default lead time and sigma settings. This will result in a base stock level far below the current inventory (approx 39 * 3 = 117), effectively suppressing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late Spring/early Summer (P11-P17) with a mean of ~39 units/week, following the March peak.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved ribbed jersey top, which saw a significant demand surge in March (around 550 units/week) but has since stabilized into a much lower regime. In the most recent periods (P11-P18), demand has averaged approximately 37.5 units/week. Current inventory status: On-hand = 574, In-transit = 179 (total 753 units). Given the current demand mean, this inventory represents approximately 20 weeks of coverage. With the Profit ($1.0) equal to the Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical priority is to avoid further holding costs and deplete the existing surplus. The OR backend will naturally place zero orders as long as on-hand + in-transit > base_stock. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current stable, low-demand regime (P11-P18), and set L to calculate to reflect the variability seen early on, though lead time is currently less impactful given the stock levels.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which has transitioned from a high-demand peak in March (~550 units/week) to a very low, stable demand phase in late spring and early summer. Over the last 9 periods (P11-P19), demand has averaged 36.8 units per week with relatively low volatility. We are currently holding 541 units on-hand with 179 units in-transit (from Period 3, though likely lost or delayed, the system still counts them). Given the current demand rate, the on-hand inventory alone provides over 14 weeks of coverage, while the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, meaning we should target a 50% service level to minimize total cost. To prevent any further ordering from the OR backend and to allow the massive surplus to draw down, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 9 periods of stable demand. This low mu_hat will ensure that base_stock remains far below current inventory levels (on-hand + pipeline), effectively pausing all new replenishment for the foreseeable future.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), the product (Womens Everyday Collection Jersey Top) is in a late-spring/early-summer low-demand phase. Demand has been consistently low for the past 10 periods (P11-P20), averaging approx 34.5 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 528 units, and there are 179 units in-transit (a legacy shipment from Period 3 that appears effectively lost but technically counts in OR backend pipeline inventory calculations). With total pipeline + on-hand inventory around 707 units and weekly demand at ~35, we have ~20 weeks of coverage. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.00), minimizing inventory is the priority to avoid high holding costs while demand is low. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 periods to reflect the stabilized low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P11-P20) at approx 35 units/week. Inventory surplus remains the primary risk ($1.00/unit holding cost).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is for the 'Womens Everyday Collection', specifically a long-sleeved jersey top. We are currently in early July (Period 22). Demand has stabilized at a low level following the March spring surge, with the most recent sample (Period 21) showing only 20 units. The mean demand over the last 11 periods (P11-P21) is approximately 33 units. Since current on-hand inventory is 508 units and there are 179 units in-transit (reaching a total of 687), we have over 20 weeks of coverage at current demand levels. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the target service level is 50%, making inventory minimization the priority to reduce substantial holding costs. I will continue to set parameters that result in zero new orders by focusing on the most recent, lower demand regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is typically a transitional or cooler-weather item. After a significant demand peak in March (reaching 595 units), demand has stabilized in a much lower regime. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P18-P22), demand has averaged approximately 25.4 units per week. The inventory situation remains highly problematic: on-hand inventory (474 units) combined with in-transit inventory (179 units) totals 653 units. At the current demand rate of ~25 units/week, this represents over 26 weeks of coverage. Given the high holding cost ($1.00/unit/period) relative to the profit ($1.00/unit), and the clear oversupply, the objective is to prevent any further ordering. I am setting L to default, mu_hat to a recent average (N=10 to capture the sustained low regime), and sigma_hat to the recent period volatility. This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than current total inventory, ensuring the OR backend places no new orders while we draw down the surplus.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Juanos' (a ribbed jersey long-sleeved top) has entered a stable low-demand phase in the summer heat (July), as the demand for long sleeves naturally declines. The current date is July 22, 2019. Over the last 13 periods (P11-P23), mean demand has stabilized at approximately 33 units per week, significantly lower than the March peak of ~550. With 447 units on-hand and 179 in-transit, we have roughly 19 periods of inventory coverage at the current consumption rate. Since the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, the priority is to avoid ordering any additional units until the massive surplus is cleared. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the recent stable regime (N=13) to prevent the backend from over-estimating demand based on the historical March spike, ensuring the order remains capped at zero.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization (P11-P23): Demand for this long-sleeved ribbed top has remained consistently low throughout early summer with a mean of ~33 units/week (a >90% drop from the March peak).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved ribbed top, which saw a significant demand surge in March (Womens Everyday Collection seasonality) but has since settled into a low-demand summer regime. Current demand (P11-P24) averages approximately 32.5 units per week. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 426 units, which at current demand levels provides over 13 weeks of coverage. An additional 179 units are in-transit (likely the un-concluded P3 order or a reporting lag, though historical carry-over mentions an 'order from Period 1' lost, the in-transit field reflects current pipeline). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the base stock target should ideally match the median demand over the lead time (L+1). Given L=2, demand over 3 periods is ~100 units. Since current on-hand + in-transit (605 units) far exceeds this, no new orders should be placed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (the length of the current stable summer regime) to reflect the low demand and high variance accurately, ensuring the OR backend caps any order to zero due to the massive surplus.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved ribbed top, which saw a significant demand surge in March followed by a sustained low-demand regime throughout the summer. Demand over the last 15 periods (P11-P25) has averaged ~33 units/week. Inventory levels remain very high relative to demand (on-hand 384, in-transit 179), providing approximately 17 weeks of coverage. With a holding cost of $1.00/unit/period, the primary objective remains avoiding unnecessary orders while maintaining a minimal base stock that reflects the current low-demand environment. Historical lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; using the 'calculate' method for L accounts for this history. Calculating mu_hat using the most recent 15 samples (N=15) captures the stable summer demand regime, while sigma_hat is set to 'default' to allow the OR backend to determine volatility over the full history, providing a safer buffer for the low demand period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P11-P25) stabilized at ~33 units/week. Inventory surplus remains very high relative to current demand, requiring a conservative ordering approach to minimize holding costs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 (Long-sleeved, fitted top) is currently in a low-demand summer phase (Period 27, Mid-August), with demand averaging approximately 33 units/week over the last 15 periods. The significant surplus inventory from the March peak has finally been drawn down to 347 units on-hand, but with an additional 179 units in-transit (possibly delayed or confirmed long lead-time orders), the total pipeline of 526 units still covers nearly 16 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the high holding cost ($1.00/unit/period) which equals the unit profit, avoiding excess inventory is the priority. I will use a recent_N (N=16, representing the stable summer regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low mean (~31 units) and low volatility. The backend's base-stock calculation will naturally suppress ordering because on-hand + in-transit (526) far exceed the required safety stock levels for the current demand regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved ribbed top, which experienced a significant demand spike in March (Spring) and has since stabilized at a much lower level. Over the last 17 periods (P11-P27), demand has averaged approximately 34 units per week, with recent demand (P25-P27) showing a slight uptick (43.3 avg) potentially signaling the start of early autumn interest. However, significant inventory surplus remains. On-hand inventory is 296 units and there is a large 'in-transit' balance of 179 units (inherited from P3/P5 logic or potential system carry-over of old lost orders, though the user-specific 'In-transit' field reports 179). Given that 296 on-hand units cover approximately 8-9 weeks of current demand and the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1 (requiring a 50% service level base stock), the priority remains minimizing holding costs. I will set the demand parameters using the stable summer/early-autumn regime (last 10 periods) to avoid triggering new orders while this surplus is cleared.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved ribbed top, which experienced a significant demand surge in March (peaking at ~595/week) but has since stabilized in a low-demand regime. Over the last 10 periods (P19-P28), the mean demand is 30.4 units/week. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 270 units and an in-transit quantity of 179 units, totaling 449 units of pipeline inventory. This covers over 14 weeks of current average demand. Given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, which naturally favors lower inventory levels. The primary objective remains reducing the inventory surplus to minimize holding costs. No new orders should be triggered. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the stable late-summer demand and set L to default (promised 2) as actual lead times have historically fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved ribbed top. Demand has been in a stabilized low regime (Summer regime) since Period 11, with an average demand of approximately 34 units per week over the last 15 periods. Although demand has shown slight fluctuations recently (ranging from 21 to 51), the mean remains consistent. We currently have 225 units on-hand and 179 units in-transit (the 179 is presumably from the very early periods that never technically 'concluded' or were part of a legacy pipeline, though the system notes it as in-transit). Given the current on-hand inventory of 225 and a weekly demand of ~35, we have over 6 weeks of stock. Since the holding cost is high ($1.00/unit), and the target base stock calculation for this SKU (Profit=1, Holding=1 => 50% service level) would likely result in a base stock lower than our current inventory levels, we want to ensure no new orders are triggered. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect the stable low demand, which will result in a base stock significantly lower than current inventory, effectively pausing orders to burn off the surplus and minimize holding costs as we transition towards autumn.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved ribbed top, which saw a significant demand surge in March (Spring) and has since stabilized at a much lower level throughout the summer. As of September 9 (Period 31), demand remains in the low regime, averaging approximately 38 units/week over the last 10 periods (P21-P30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 175 units and there is a legacy in-transit quantity of 179 units (likely the lost Period 1 and 3 orders that haven't concluded, but the OR backend counts all 'in-transit'). With a total pipeline + on-hand inventory of 354 units and a weekly demand mean of ~38, the system already holds approximately 9 weeks of coverage. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the optimal service level is 50%, and the system is significantly overstocked. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=10) to reflect the settled summer/early autumn demand and 'default' for other parameters to allow the backend to suppress ordering while the surplus clears.

Carry-over insight: Early Autumn demand (P27-P30) shows a slight upward trend compared to mid-summer, averaging ~43 units/week vs ~33 units/week previously, possibly reflecting seasonality for long-sleeved items.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 615141002 (long-sleeved ribbed top) is entering its second seasonal peak as Autumn approaches (September). Recent demand (P27-P31: 51, 26, 45, 50, 76) shows a clear uptrend compared to the Summer trough (~33/week). The last observed demand was 76, which is consistent with the product type (long-sleeved) moving into cooler weather. Inventory stands at 99 on-hand and 179 in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($1.00), the goal is to satisfy the seasonal upturn without over-ordering. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this upward trajectory while ignoring the irrelevant Summer lows and the extreme Spring spike. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as history shows arrivals between 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal recovery: Demand is trending upward as of P27 (avg ~50 units/week) from Summer levels (~33 units/week), reflecting seasonality for long-sleeved garments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved ribbed top, which is entering its peak Autumn season (late September). Demand has clearly shifted from a summer low (~33 units/week) to an autumn recovery phase starting around Period 27. The most recent six periods (P27-P32) show demand counts of 51, 26, 45, 50, 76, and 75, resulting in a mean of 53.8 units/week. This confirms the seasonal upward trend noted in the carry-over insights. Currently, the on-hand inventory is very low (24 units), while there is a significant in-transit quantity of 179 units. Given the lead time of 2 periods, the pipeline (24 on-hand + 179 in-transit = 203) must cover roughly 3 periods of demand (P33, P34, P35). At the current rate of ~54-75 units/week, 203 units provides approximately 3 weeks of coverage (67.6 units/week average). However, as we are in the middle of a seasonal ramp-up, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this acceleration while relying on the existing pipeline to prevent stockouts. Lead time remains standard based on recent history.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal demand spike confirmed (P31-P32): Demand increased to ~75 units/week, up from ~45-50 in early Autumn and ~33 in Summer.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 (long-sleeved ribbed top) is currently entering its peak Autumn season. Period 33 demand spiked significantly to 186 units, confirming the upward trend noted in the carry-over insights (P27-P32). This surge completely exhausted the remaining on-hand inventory, leaving 0 units available for Period 34. There are 179 units in-transit (likely from a simulation-initiated order, as no manual orders were placed in recent history), but since these have not yet 'concluded' in the history, they won't arrive until the end of Period 34 at the earliest. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, which targets the mean demand. However, with 0 inventory and a confirmed seasonal spike, we must accurately project demand for the (L+1) horizon. I will use the last 4 periods (P30-P33) to capture the accelerating Autumn demand (50, 76, 75, 186), which yields a mean of 96.75 units per week. Setting mu_hat to approximately 3 weeks of this mean (L=2, so 3*~97 = 291) ensures the OR backend attempts to cover the pipeline requirement while accounting for the 179 units already in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Significant Autumn seasonal demand surge confirmed: Period 33 demand hit 186 units, a 148% increase over the P31-P32 average (~75 units) and nearly 6x the summer mean (~33 units). Inventory surplus is fully depleted as of P34.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '615141002' (long-sleeved ribbed top) is experiencing a significant Autumn seasonal surge. Demand increased from a summer mean of ~33 to 186 in Period 33 and 108 in Period 34. Current on-hand inventory is 0. There is 291 units in-transit (112 ordered in P34, and presumably another order of 179 from a prior period not yet concluded or a backlog in the system's tracking). Given the V-neck and long-sleeved description, this item is highly seasonal for October/November. Based on the Spring peak (P4-P5) hitting ~550 units, the Autumn peak could see similar or higher numbers. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the upward trend in mu_hat while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat). Since lead times have historically fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, I will stick to the promised 'default' lead time (2 periods). The goal is to ensure the pipeline covers approximately 3 weeks of these higher demand levels (~140-150 units/week) to avoid stockouts during this seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal demand spike confirmed: Demand rose from summer lows (~33) to an average of ~147 units/week over P33-P34; On-hand inventory depleted in P33; Product (long-sleeved top) aligns with October seasonal peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved ribbed top, currently entering its peak Autumn season (October). We are in Period 36. Historical data from P33-P35 shows a significant demand surge: 186, 108, and 71 units respectively (averaging ~122 units/week), compared to the summer low of ~33. Although demand dipped to 71 in P35, this is still significantly higher than summer levels and likely represents volatility within the Autumn peak rather than a return to low demand. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 334 units in-transit (ordered in P34 and P35). We need to ensure we maintain a base stock that covers the peak demand period. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (N=3 captures the P33-P35 surge avg of 122) to ensure the OR engine targets this higher regime. Given the high volatility during seasonal shifts, I will use recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to capture the increased standard deviation. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to account for the observed 1-2 period variance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal demand regime (P33-P35) confirmed: mean demand increased to ~122 units/week, up from ~33 in summer and ~50 in early Autumn. On-hand inventory is depleted; lead time remains variable (1-2 periods).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its peak Autumn season (late October). Demand has surged significantly from summer levels (~33) to a recent 4-period average of 113.75 (P33-P36: 186, 108, 71, 90). The 'Period 36 conclude' confirms an order from Period 35 arrived in 1 period, while the Period 34 order (112 units) remains in-transit after 2 periods. This indicates lead time volatility (1-2 periods). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. My goal is to maintain stock for the next (L+1) periods. Since the Autumn peak is active and erratic, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current seasonal regime (avg ~114), and a wider sigma (recent_N=4) to account for recent spikes. I will set the lead time to the promised 2 periods to ensure sufficient pipeline coverage despite the recent 1-period arrival.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal peak confirmed: Demand for the long-sleeved top (P33-P36) is averaging ~114 units/week, a 245% increase from the summer base (~33). Lead time is fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved top in an Autumn seasonal peak (October). Demand has transitioned from a summer low (~33) to a sustained Autumn regime (P33-P37) with a mean demand of approximately 112 units/week (186, 108, 71, 90, 105). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 342 units are in-transit (orders from P34, P36, and P37). The P34 order (112 units) is overdue (promised 2 periods ago), suggesting a potential delay or loss, though subsequent orders from P35 arrived in 1 period. To maintain service levels during this seasonal peak, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the 112 units/week average of the Autumn regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to account for the observed variance between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal regime confirmed (P33-P37): mean demand is 112 units/week. Order from Period 34 (112 units) is currently overdue by 1 period relative to promised lead time.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved ribbed top, which is currently in its peak Autumn seasonal demand (late Oct/early Nov). Current demand (P33-P38) averages ~113 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 322 units, but this includes a 112-unit order from P34 which is now 2 periods overdue (approaching lost status) and a 31-unit order from P36 which is 1 period overdue. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P36 and P38 arrivals were both lead_time=1, while the P34 order is delayed). To ensure stock availability during this seasonal peak while accounting for the high possibility of the P34 order being lost, I will set mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (last 6 periods) and use an explicit lead time of 2 periods to ensure the base stock covers the transit time. The OR backend will subtract the 322 in-transit units from the base stock; if the 112-unit order is indeed lost, the system will eventually reorder. For now, we forecast demand at the current high level to capture remaining seasonal sales.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Order from Period 34 (112 units) is 2 periods past promised arrival and likely lost. Autumn demand regime (P33-P38) remains stable at ~113 units/week.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved ribbed top, currently in the middle of its Autumn seasonal peak (mid-November). Recent demand (P33-P39) has averaged approximately 105 units/week. While demand dropped to 60 units in P39, I expect it to remain elevated for the remainder of the pre-holiday season. Inventory management balance: profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), so we aim for a roughly 50% service level, but given the 0 on-hand status and variable lead times (1-3 periods, with P34 order likely lost), we must ensure enough pipeline to cover the 3-period lead-time horizon (L+1). I am using recent_N=7 to capture the full Autumn regime (P33-P39) for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I'll use the same window to capture the volatility of this seasonal surge. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to account for the recent variability (1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal regime (P33-P39) confirmed with a mean demand of ~105 units/week. Lead time variability increased, with the P36 order taking 3 periods to arrive and the P34 order (112 units) confirmed lost after 5 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Mid-November (Period 41). The Autumn/Winter seasonal peak for this long-sleeved top peaked around P37-P38 (105-119 units) and is now decelerating (P39-P40 demand: 60, 61). Historically, this SKU saw a major crash in demand after its spring peak, and a similar decline is expected heading into the end of the year. Lead times have been unreliable: the P34 order (112 units) is lost, and the P36 order took 3 periods. Current in-transit inventory is 317 units (from orders in P35-P40), which exceeds the likely demand for the remaining 7 periods of the game given the current downward trend. On-hand inventory is 0, but since we are over-indexed in pipeline inventory relative to the decelerating demand, I will set mu_hat to a recent average (N=4) to capture the lower 60-unit range and use the 'calculate' method for lead time to let the OR backend account for recent delays. The goal is to avoid clearing out the remaining profit with holding costs for overstock that won't sell before the game ends.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration from Autumn peak: Mean demand has dropped from ~113 (P33-P38) to ~60 (P39-P40), a 47% decrease. Significant pipeline inventory (317 units) exists against a declining seasonal trend.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The SKU is moving past its Autumn peak (October), with demand decelerating. Over the last 3 periods (P39-P41), demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~62 units/week (60, 61, 66) compared to the October surge (>100 units). On-hand inventory is 0, but there is significant pipeline inventory (299 units), including an order from Period 34 (112 units) which is now 7 periods old and confirmed lost, and an order from P40 (8 units) plus older accumulated undelivered units. Lead times have been variable (1, 2, and 3 periods recently). Given the deceleration in demand and the high pipeline (approx. 4.8 weeks of coverage at the new mean), I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent lower-demand regime (N=3) to prevent over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (P47). The OR backend will naturally reduce orders because pipeline (299) > base_stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration from Autumn peak confirmed: P39-P41 mean is ~62 units, down from ~114 in Oct. Pipeline inventory remains high relative to this new lower demand regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observation (Period 42: 231 units) indicates a significant late-autumn/early-winter spike, possibly related to Black Friday or pre-holiday sales, contrasting with the previous three periods which averaged ~62 units. This item (long-sleeved ribbed top) is highly seasonal. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory with 299 units in-transit (orders from P40 and earlier are still pending or arriving). Given the high demand volatility and the discrepancy between recent stability and the sudden P42 surge, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the trend while being cautious of the extreme P42 value. Sigma_hat is set similarly to account for this heightened volatility. Lead time remains variable (1-3 periods observed recently), so 'calculate' is used to capture the empirical average.

Carry-over insight: Significant late-November demand spike detected (Period 42: 231 units), likely driven by holiday sales, breaking the previous deceleration trend. Inventory remains at zero on-hand despite the Autumn peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 (long-sleeved ribbed top) is currently in a highly volatile demand phase. We observed a significant holiday-related spike in Period 42 (231 units), followed by a reversion toward the late-Autumn mean in Period 43 (62 units). Given the current date (Dec 9), we anticipate sustained high demand due to holiday gift-shopping and winter seasonality for long-sleeved items, though likely not as extreme as the Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak seen in P42. The Period 34 order (112 units) is confirmed lost, leaving a net pipeline of 298 units (306 total in-transit minus 8 units just arrived). Lead times have been unstable, recently varying between 1 and 3 periods (P36: 3, P39: 2, P40: 3). I will use an explicit L of 3 to account for this recent congestion. For demand (mu_hat), use a recent_N of 5 to capture the shift from the October peak through the November spike and current stabilization (Avg P39-P43 \u2248 96 units/week). Setting mu_hat using N=5 will provide a forecast of approx 384 units for the (1+L) period, which aligns with covering the holiday season while accounting for the high pipeline already in play.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected in Period 42 (231 units); Period 43 indicates a return to a high-demand baseline (~60-100 units/week) for December. Lead time remains unstable, with recent arrivals taking 3 periods (P39, P40 orders).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16, mid-December. We are observing the aftermath of a major late-November holiday demand spike (231 units in P42). Demand in P43 and P44 has cooled to ~62 and ~45 units respectively, but history and seasonality for a 'long-sleeved, ribbed jersey top' suggest consistent demand through winter. Lead times have become unstable and extended; recent arrivals took 3 periods (P40 arrived P43), and the P44 order (78 units) which would normally arrive now has not appeared. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 384 units in-transit (though 112 from P34 is lost and some recent orders are delayed). To stabilize availability while being mindful of the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will set L to 3 to reflect recent actual lead times. For demand, I'll use a 4-period average (P41-P44) to capture the post-spike baseline (approx 101 units/week), which prevents over-ordering based on the P42 outlier while ensuring enough stock for the remainder of the cold season.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has increased to 3 periods (confirmed by P39 and P40 orders arriving 3 periods later). Holiday spike in P42 (231 units) followed by a return to a baseline of ~50-60 units in mid-December.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46 (Dec 23), we are approaching the end of the holiday peak for the SKU 615141002 (long-sleeved ribbed top). Historically, after the large late-November/early-December spikes (231 units in P42), demand settles into a lower baseline. The average demand over the last three periods (P43-P45) is approximately 58 units/week. Lead times are currently unstable, fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods (P39: 2, P40: 3, P43: 2). We currently have 369 units in-transit (orders from P44 totaling 78, plus previous large carryovers), and 0 on-hand inventory. Given that the pipeline (369 units) already covers over 6 weeks of demand at the current baseline (~58/week), and the holiday season is concluding, adding more inventory now would lead to high holding costs as demand seasonally dips in January. I will set L to 3 to account for recent shipping delays, mu_hat to a recent average (N=3) to reflect the post-spike baseline, and sigma_hat to a recent average to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: After the late-November peak (P42: 231 units), demand has settled into a baseline of ~58 units/week (P43-P45). Lead time remains unstable, fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are in a post-holiday demand stabilization phase for this long-sleeved top. Following the late-November spike (231 units), demand has settled into a lower baseline, with the most recent sample at 31 units. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P43-P46) is approximately 51.5 units/week. Lead times are unstable, generally fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods (observed 1, 2, 3, 2, 3 over the autumn/winter season). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 369 units in-transit (orders from P44 totaling 78 units, and likely the bulk from the high-ordering periods prior, though P34 is lost). Given the high in-transit volume (369 units) compared to the current demand (51 units), the priority is to avoid over-ordering, as holding costs ($1) equal profit ($1). I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the post-holiday cooling and keep L at the promised 2 (recognizing the backend calculates based on this) to prevent the OR engine from pushing excessive safety stock during a seasonal decline.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration: Demand for the long-sleeved top has decreased from the late-November spike to a mean of ~51 units/week (P43-P46). Pipeline inventory (369 units) is significantly higher than current demand requirements.
