The promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1), I need to account for the current demand level. The last known demand was 24, and the trend is increasing approximately 6-8 units per week. I'll estimate Period 1 demand at ~30, Period 2 at ~38, and Period 3 at ~46. Total expected demand for the pipeline coverage is ~114 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are currently 0, I will order 120 units to build initial stock and meet the rising seasonal demand.",

Period 1 demand was 20 units. Based on this, I expect demand to continue increasing, likely averaging around 25-35 units per week in the near term. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 because the order placed in Period 1 (120 units) is subject to a 2-period lead time.

My pipeline inventory is currently 120 (arriving P3). Current inventory position: On-hand (0) + In-transit (120). I need to cover demand for Periods 2, 3, and 4 to maintain stock when the next order arrives. Expected demand P2-P4: ~30 * 3 = 90 units. The existing 120 units in transit should cover this.

The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (120 units) and P2 (40 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition (P + L arrivals), the P1 order (120 units) is expected to arrive during P3 and will be available for sale in P4. The P2 order (40 units) is expected to arrive during P4 and be available for P5. Currently, I have 0 on-hand inventory and 160 in-transit. Demand is growing rapidly (it more than doubled from P1 to P2). Assuming demand reaches ~75-90 in P3 and continues to climb, I need to ensure that the pipeline covers potential sales for P4 and P5. Total pipeline (160) roughly covers two periods of demand if growth stabilizes, but given the seasonal peak potential for Spring, I will place a conservative order to build a buffer for P6, accounting for the 2-period lead time.",

Lead time analysis: P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2), confirming the promised lead time. The P1 order of 120 units is now 2 periods overdue (should have arrived in P3), and the P3 order of 60 units is 1 period overdue (should have arrived in P5).

Supplier reliability is a major concern: orders from P1 (120), P3 (60), and P4 (170) are missing and presumed lost, confirming a high loss rate (~40%). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 239.

Current demand in November (Periods 39-40) has stabilized at approximately 8 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 226 units, which at the current depletion rate of ~8/period, provides approximately 28 periods of coverage. This far exceeds the remaining 7 periods in the game (ending at Period 47). The system 'In-transit' of 1750 units consists entirely of historical losses (ghost inventory) confirmed through Period 32. Given the significant inventory surplus relative to the forecasted demand for the remainder of the season, no further orders are required. Ordering more would only increase holding costs without increasing sales.",
