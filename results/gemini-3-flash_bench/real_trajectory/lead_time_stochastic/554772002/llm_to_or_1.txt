Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Bob V-neck' women's fitted t-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows an average of ~68.6 units/week (58, 59, 81, 84, 61), with a noticeable increase in late January followed by a slight dip in early February. As this is 'Womens Everyday Basics', demand is relatively stable but can fluctuate with early spring shopping. Promised lead time is 2, meaning we need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 = 3 periods). Given that we start with 0 On-hand and 0 In-transit, we need to establish an initial buffer. Using all 5 historical samples provides a baseline, but the recent variability suggests using a recent window for mu_hat. I will use N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current mean and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. On-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (90 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods. In Period 1, we saw a demand of 83 units, which was unfortunately unmet (sold=0) due to 0 starting inventory. This demand of 83 is consistent with the late January/early February historical samples (81, 84, 61). To set current parameters, L is kept at 'default' (2). Total demand to cover is (L+1) = 3 periods. Historical mean (including Period 1 demand) is approximately 71 units/period. Therefore, mu_hat should reflect 3 * 71 = 213. Since we have a short history of 6 samples (5 historical + P1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent slight upward trend in demand compared to the early January samples.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is a women's V-neck T-shirt. Historical data from early 2019 showed demand between 58-84 units. However, we've observed a significant demand jump in Period 1 (83) and Period 2 (136). This likely signals a seasonal shift as we move toward spring. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 185 units in-transit (90 units from P1, 95 from P2). With a promised lead time of 2, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3 resolution (becoming visible at P4 start). We have suffered lost sales in P1 and P2 due to starting with 0 inventory. My strategy is to use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=2 to capture this upward demand trend (avg ~110/period) and provide enough safety stock using sigma_hat to cover the lead time (L=2) and the current period (total 3 periods of demand).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. We are looking at a women's basic V-neck t-shirt. Historical demand over the last 8 weeks (including the samples provided) shows a clear upward trend: 58, 59, 81, 84, 61, 83, 136, 103. The mean demand for the last 3 periods (Periods 1-3) is 107.3, compared to the initial sample mean of around 68. This suggests a seasonal ramp-up as spring approaches. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 357 units in transit (ordered in P1, P2, and P3). The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the lead time rules, the order from Period 1 (placed P1) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start message. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0', and the status for Period 4 shows 357 units still in transit. This implies the P1 order (90 units) is likely delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3. Given the stockout situation (0 sold for 3 periods), we need to maintain a robust base stock. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand (avg ~107) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. I will keep L at default (2) for now but monitor for a confirmed shift to 3 next period.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5 (2019/3/11), we are managing a women's V-neck T-shirt. Historical demand shows an upward trend (pre-gameavg: ~68, post-gameavg: ~98). Current on-hand inventory is 25, with 268 units in-transit (orders from P1, P3, and P4). We have observed one completion: the P2 order arrived in P4, confirming the promised lead time (L=2). This means the P1 order is now overdue (placed P1, expected P3, currently P5) and potentially lost. However, since the P2 order arrived on time, the supply chain isn't completely broken. Total demand across history (samples + game) is N=10, with the last 4 game periods averaging 98. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the higher 'in-game' demand regime. For L, I will stick to 'default' as one order arrived exactly at L=2. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~294 units), subtract current pipeline (268) and on-hand (25), likely resulting in a small safety order or nothing if the pipeline is considered full enough.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean increased from ~68 (pre-game) to ~98 (+44%) over the first 4 game periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a basic women's V-neck T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant increase from pre-game levels (~68) to an average of ~88 during the game periods (83, 136, 103, 70, 50). The recent drop (70, 50) suggests the initial surge might be stabilizing or reverting. Inventory is currently 0, with 311 units in-transit. Regarding lead time: the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. However, the Period 1 order (90 units) is still missing (it should have arrived in Period 3). I am treating the Period 1 order as potentially lost until it concludes. Since L=2, our coverage window is 3 periods (L+1). Based on the recent 5 samples (avg 88.4), the required pipeline is ~265 units. With 311 in-transit (excluding the likely lost 90 units, leaving 221 valid pipeline), we need to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the in-game behavior while smoothing the recent volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/03/25). Reviewing history, the shipment from Period 1 (90 units) is still missing after 6 periods, suggesting it is lost. The shipment from Period 3 (172 units) is also overdue (promised L=2, now at L=4). However, the Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods and the Period 5 order arrived in only 1 period. This indicates high lead-time volatility or carrier inconsistency. Demand over the last 6 game periods has averaged ~86.5 units, which is higher than the pre-game baseline (~68) but slightly stabilized from the initial spike. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 271 units in-transit (assuming the likely-lost P1 and delayed P3 orders are still technically 'in-transit'). Since stockouts have occurred in 5 out of 6 periods due to delivery gaps, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture the higher mean and the variance in arrivals. Specifically, I'll use N=6 for demand to cover the full game history and calculate for lead time to let the backend average the observed 1 and 2-period arrivals. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly for 3 periods (L=2 + 1) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high demand volatility and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility detected: Observed arrivals at 1 and 2 periods, but also evidence of missing/lost shipments (Period 1 order 90 units) and significantly delayed shipments (Period 3 order 172 units).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: The current date is April 1st. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for Women's Everyday Basics T-shirts (Bob V-neck) remains high and volatile, with the last 7 periods averaging ~90 units/week (well above the pre-game ~68). There is a critical supply issue: Period 1's order (90 units) is likely lost (now 7 periods late vs promised 2), and Period 3's order (172 units) is severely delayed (5 periods late). Conversely, Period 5's order arrived in just 1 period. To compensate for the pipeline uncertainty and the likely loss of the Period 1 shipment, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but will rely on a mu_hat that reflects the current high-demand regime (+90 avg) and higher volatility. Since the OR engine subtracts 'pipeline inventory' (in-transit) from its base stock calculation, and my in-transit includes the likely-lost 90 units and the delayed 172 units (total 303), the engine may under-order if it thinks supply is coming. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high demand spikes (83, 77, 110) while maintaining a high sigma_hat to account for stockout risks caused by shipment unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Supply Chain Instability: Period 1 shipment (90 units) presumed lost. Period 3 shipment (172 units) severely delayed (5+ periods). Supply behavior is bifurcated between very fast (L=1) and extremely delayed/lost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 268 units in transit. The supply chain remains highly unstable: the Period 1 order (90 units) is now 8 periods old and confirmed lost; the Period 3 order (172 units) is 6 periods old and severely delayed. Recent arrivals (Periods 7 and 8) show actual lead times of 1 and 2 periods, but the system is currently stock-out due to the gap left by the lost/delayed large orders. The goal is to rebuild inventory while accounting for high demand volatility. Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged ~90 units (range 50-136). I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to reflect the promised lead time while noting the extreme variance. mu_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~90 per period, so (1+2)*90 = 270). sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to maintain a high safety stock given the frequent stock-outs and supply unpredictability.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation continues: While P6/P7 orders arrived in 1-2 periods, the large P3 order (172 units) is now 6 periods overdue and the P1 order (90 units) is considered lost. Stock-out persists despite arrivals due to missing historical volume.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 remains in a persistent stock-out state (on-hand: 0) due to supply instability. While promised lead time is 2, actual lead times rotate between 1 and 2 periods (L=1 for P5 and P7; L=2 for P2 and P6). Critically, two significant orders (P1 and P3) totaling 262 units have failed to arrive after 9 and 7 periods respectively, confirming them as lost or unusable for immediate planning. This 'missing volume' is causing the OR backend to underestimate the required base stock because the pipeline inventory look-back includes these ghost units. To compensate, I am setting L to 2 (the conservative promised/observed limit) and mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering periods 5-9) to capture the current demand regime which averages ~77 units/period. Because current pipeline inventory includes 172 units likely lost (P3), I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock calculation, effectively forcing an order that ignores the stale in-transit volume. Calculation: (1+L) * avg_demand = 3 * 77 = 231. To offset the 172 unit phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 403 (231 + 172).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a persistent stock-out state due to supply chain instability. The item is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. Demand has shown significant spikes, most recently peaking at 156 units in Period 10 (likely a spring seasonal uptick as we are in mid-April). The supply chain is unreliable: Period 1 (90 units) is lost, and Period 3 (172 units) is now 7 periods overdue and cannot be relied upon for current availability. However, more recent orders (P9) are arriving with a lead time of 1 period. To mitigate the impact of lost/severely delayed historical shipments and capture the rising seasonal demand, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate average weekly demand at 110 units (based on the average of the last 4 active periods: 110, 85, 62, 156). With an expected lead time L=2 (promised), mu_hat is set to (1+2)*110 = 330. I've increased sigma_hat to 120 to provide a higher safety buffer against the high volatility in both demand and lead times, aiming to stay in stock once the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Recent demand (last 4 periods) averages ~103 with a peak of 156, suggesting a seasonal upward trend in April. Lead time reliability remains bifurcated; while recent orders arrive in 1 period, large historical orders (P1, P3) are lost or indefinitely delayed.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Bob V-neck' (womens everyday basic) is showing strong upward volatility as we move into late April (Spring/Summer seasonality), with the most recent demands being 156 and 105. The average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 101, which is significantly higher than the pre-game mean of 68. The supply chain is highly unstable: orders from P1 (90 units) and P3 (172 units) are either lost or extremely delayed (9+ periods), while recent orders (P5, P6, P7, P9) have arrived with shorter lead times of 1-2 periods. This bifurcation has caused persistent stock-outs because the OR backend's 'pipeline' calculation incorrectly includes these lost/stalled units, leading to insufficient ordering. To fix this, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the higher seasonal demand (~101/period), and setting an explicit Lead Time (L=3) to force the backend to account for the risk of delays and to ignore the 'in-transit' units that should have arrived long ago. This high L and current mu_hat should trigger a larger replenishment order to overcome the stock-out status.

Carry-over insight: Consistent seasonal demand increase confirmed: March/April average (~96) is significantly higher than Jan/Feb (~68). Supply chain bifurcation remains critical: large orders from P1 and P3 are effectively stalled/lost, while recent small orders adhere to L=1 or L=2.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the 'Bob V-neck' (women's basic t-shirt) is in a high-demand seasonal phase. Since Period 4, demand has averaged ~96 units/period, significantly higher than the training mean (~70). Recent demand (Periods 10-12) remains elevated, confirming this trend. The supply chain is severely compromised: massive orders from Period 1 (90 units) and Period 3 (172 units) are 12 and 10 periods overdue, respectively, and are effectively lost. The 'in-transit' figure of 476 is misleading because it includes 262 units that will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the dead 'pipeline inventory', I must assume a longer lead time (explicit L=3) to increase the target base stock and set mu_hat based on the current high-demand regime (N=9 covers the period since the upward shift began in March). This helps compensate for the fictional 262 units in the pipeline that are blocking new orders.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is a women's basic V-neck t-shirt, which typically sees sustained demand moving into summer. Demand since Period 10 has been high (P10: 156, P11: 105, P12: 95, P13: 90), with a recent 4-period average of ~111, compared to the pre-game average of ~68. Supply chain issues persist: the P1 order (90) and P3 order (172) are now 13 and 11 periods old respectively and must be treated as lost. Consequently, the 'In-transit' figure is inflated by 262 unreliable units, leaving only ~181 units actually expected (P10: 130, P12: 45, P13: 6). We are currently stocked out. Lead times for successful arrivals oscillate between 1 and 2 periods. To recover from the stock-out and account for the lost 'phantom' inventory, I will set an explicit high mu_hat based on the recent elevated demand regime (avg ~111) over a 3-period coverage window (L=2 + 1). I will use explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in April.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 262 units (P1: 90, P3: 172) which are lost. Actual pipeline is significantly lower than system display. Recent demand regime (P10-P13) stable at ~111 units/period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a persistent stock-out state. The system shows 398 units in-transit, but 262 of these (from Period 1 and Period 3) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend from ordering enough to meet replenishment needs because it believes the pipeline is full. Recent demand (P10-P14) has stabilized around an average of 111 units per period. The actual lead time for successful deliveries has consistently been 1-2 periods. To force the OR backend to place an order and overcome the phantom inventory obstruction, I am using the 'explicit' method. For mu_hat, I am setting it to (1+L)*111 (for L=2, this is 333), plus an additional buffer of 262 to offset the phantom pipeline. This results in a mu_hat of 595. For sigma_hat, I am using an explicit value of 45 to reflect recent demand volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period delivery window.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has shifted from an initial mean of ~68 to a stabilized higher regime of ~104 (average of last 6 periods). I am currently at an on-hand inventory of 0 and have faced frequent stock-outs. The backend 'In-transit' count of 633 is highly misleading: 262 units (from Period 1 and 3) are effectively lost/phantom, and the 235 units ordered last period (P15) won't arrive until P16 or P17. The actual viable pipeline is primarily that P15 order. To compensate for the 'phantom' inventory that prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders (since it subtracts pipeline from base stock), I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the actual rolling mean. This 'inflated' mu_hat forces the base stock level above the phantom inventory threshold to trigger replenishments. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bypass the standard calculations and maintain a high service level through the early summer season, while setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed delivery speed of 1-2 periods for non-lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilized: May demand (P13-P15) averages 99.3, confirming the shift from the spring average (~111) to a steady high-summer baseline. Lead time for successful deliveries remains 1-2 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3rd), the SKU 'Bob V-neck' is in a high-demand summer regime. Demand in the most recent periods (P14-P16) has averaged ~112 units (106, 102, 128). The supply chain is notoriously unreliable: there is a 'phantom' pipeline of 262 units from P1 and P3 that are lost, which the OR backend incorrectly counts as available inventory. Furthermore, while promised lead time is 2, actual lead times for successful deliveries oscillate between 1 and 2. The Current In-transit (633) includes the lost 262 units and a large P15 order of 235 units. Since we are currently at 0 on-hand and have been stocking out, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering approximately P12-P16) to capture the current demand level of ~108/period. I set L=2 (promised) as the base, but because the backend subtracts the inflated 'pipeline_inventory' (633 total), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to effectively override the backend's logic and force a large enough base stock to trigger an order that compensates for the lost 262 units and persistent stock-outs.

Carry-over insight: Early June demand maintains the high-summer baseline (~112 units/period). Supply chain bifurcation remains a major risk: 262 units from P1/P3 are permanently lost but still appear in 'In-transit'.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 10, 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized at a summer baseline of approximately 107 units per period (average of the last six periods, excluding the 156 anomaly in April). The supply chain is highly unreliable: 262 units from orders in Periods 1 and 3 are effectively lost, yet they remain in the system's 'In-transit' calculation. This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR engine from placing the necessary orders to maintain a service level for the 107 units/period demand. Current on-hand is 141 (safety stock + some leftover), but without adjusting parameters, the backend will severely under-order because it believes 398 units (136 real + 262 phantom) are coming. To force the backend to ignore phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to a value that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the volume of the lost units (~107 * 3 + 262 \u2248 583). I will use L=2 (promised) to remain conservative on the pipeline calculation. sigma_hat is set to cover the observed volatility in this high-demand regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (mid-summer). Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck' remains in a stabilized summer regime. Recent samples P14-P18 show demand of 106, 102, 128, 94, 69 (average ~100). The drop in P18 (69) might be a weekly fluctuation or early sign of mean reversion, so I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent behavior while maintaining the summer baseline. Regarding lead time (LT), though promised LT=2, we have seen successful deliveries at LT=1 and LT=2. However, there is a persistent 'phantom inventory' issue: 262 units from P1 (90) and P3 (172) are definitively lost but stay in the 'In-transit' count (which shows 463). Actual pipeline is 463 - 262 = 201 units (P18 order: 65, and potentially recent orders balancing the difference). To prevent the OR backend from 'undercutting' orders due to these phantom 262 units, I will set an explicit L=4. Since the backend calculates base_stock = (1+L)*demand, increasing L increases the target stock, effectively ignoring the defunct inventory that isn't arriving.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand appears to be softening slightly from the May/June peak (69 in P18), but maintained average around 100 for summer baseline. Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 262 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (2019/6/24), the SKU 554772002 (Women's T-shirt) is in a high-summer demand regime. Recent demand (P17-P19) shows values of 94, 69, and 101, suggesting a slight cooling or volatility compared to the late spring peak, but maintaining a mean near 100. Supply chain behavior remains bifurcated. The total 'In-transit' shown in the system is 403 units, but 262 of these are 'phantom inventory' from Period 1 (90) and Period 3 (172) which are long overdue and effectively lost. The true pipeline consists only of the Period 19 order (5 units) and potentially the current Period 20 order. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' in its base-stock calculation (order = base_stock - on_hand - in_transit), and it cannot see that 262 units are 'dead', I must use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat to manually inflate the base stock to compensate for these phantom units. Calculated Target Base Stock = (L+1) * \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3. With L=2, \u03bc\u0302=100, \u03c3=25, and q=0.8 (z\u22480.84), Target \u2248 3 * 100 + 0.84 * (sqrt(3)*25) \u2248 336. To force the OR engine to order approximately 100 units while it thinks I have 262 + 5 in the pipeline and 36 on hand, I set mu_hat explicitly to the Target + Phantom Pipeline \u2248 336 + 262 = 598. This ensures the OR logic does not starve the location due to old lost shipments.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-01. Analyzing demand: The recent regime (last 5 periods) shows an average demand of 96.6 units (94, 69, 101, 111, and the current state's implied demand). This aligns with the 'high-summer baseline' previously identified. Analyzing supply: The 'In-transit' total is 599. However, 262 units (from P1 and P3) are long-lost 'phantom' inventory. Subtracting these, the functional in-transit is 337 units. Specifically, we have P19 (5 units) and P20 (196 units) in the pipeline. With on-hand at 0 and functional pipeline at 201, and an expected weekly demand of ~100-110, we are under-stocked for the 3-period coverage window (L+1=3). Lead times for successful arrivals are consistently 1 or 2 periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this 1-2 period reality. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the summer demand baseline and sigma_hat with N=10 to account for recent volatility (e.g., the dip to 69 and peak of 111).

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Summer demand baseline remains stable with a 5-period mean of ~97. Supply chain remains bifurcated: functional pipeline consists of recent orders (P19, P20) while 'phantom' inventory of 262 units (P1, P3) persists in the system count.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 599 units in-transit. The 'In-transit' figure is heavily inflated by 262 'phantom' units from Periods 1 and 3 that are confirmed lost/overdue by 18+ periods. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P19 (5 units), P20 (196 units), and P21 (0 units). Period 19 ordered 5 units and we see one arrival is missing in P21 conclude (expected if L=2). Period 20's 196 units are expected in P22 or P23. Demand remains stable around a summer baseline of ~100. P18-P21 demand: 69, 101, 111, 114 (Mean: 98.75). Given the chronic stock-outs and the OR backend's inability to see 'lost' shipments, I must use an explicit L to reflect the average functional lead time (~1.5) and an explicit mu_hat that ignores the phantom pipeline by targeting a base stock that forces a corrective order if the recent functional orders don't arrive. Target base stock = (L+1)*Demand = 2.5 * 100 = 250. However, the system sees 599 in transit. To force an order despite 599 in transit, the mu_hat would need to be extremely high, but that risks a massive over-order if the phantom units 'appear'. I will set L to 2 (promised) and mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current 100-unit demand regime. I will assume the P20 order of 196 units will arrive in P22 or P23 to alleviate the current stockout.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) remains stable within its summer regime, with an average of approximately 100 units/period over the last 10 periods. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 403 units, but 262 units (from Period 1 and Period 3 orders) are confirmed 'phantom' inventory that will likely never arrive based on historical evidence. Excluding these, the actual functional pipeline is 141 units (130 units from P10 and 11 units from P19/P20 leftovers, though given recent arrivals, the P10 order of 130 is also likely lost or severely stalled). Recent successful lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. To maintain a healthy stock level for the lady's basic T-shirt in mid-July, I will set mu_hat based on the stable summer regime (recent_N=10) and use explicit lead time of 2 periods to cover the promised duration, while the backend's base-stock calculation will naturally account for on-hand and pipeline. I am choosing recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand average (~101 units) and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed P10 order (130 units) is likely lost/stalled (now 13 periods overdue). Total phantom in-transit inventory is now estimated at 392 units (P1, P3, P10). Functional pipeline is near zero.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has remained relatively stable during the summer months (May-July), with an average demand of approximately 98 units over the last 10 periods. The most recent demand (P23) was slightly lower at 64. The critical issue remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. The system shows 403 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis, 392 of these units are permanently lost (P1: 90, P3: 172, P10: 130). Only the order from P19 (5 units) might still be active, though it is now 5 periods old, suggesting it too may be lost. Effective pipeline inventory is effectively 0 or negligible. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the large phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to reflect the expected demand over (L+1) periods (~300 units) plus a buffer to offset the 392 units the system incorrectly thinks are coming. By setting mu_hat to 700, the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) should result in an actual order of ~300 units, which is necessary to replenish on-hand inventory (currently only 38) before it stocks out in P24.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Phantom in-transit inventory updated to 397 units (P1, P3, P10, and likely P19). The functional pipeline is zero. Summer demand baseline is stable at ~100 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/7/29), the SKU is currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). The primary challenge is the significant quantity of 'phantom' in-transit inventory. The system reports 669 units in-transit, but historical data confirms that orders from Period 1 (90), Period 3 (172), Period 10 (130), and recently Period 19 (5) have likely been lost or indefinitely stalled, totaling 397 phantom units. This leaves a functional pipeline of 272 units (the P24 order of 266 and the P19 order which is overdue). Demand for this 'Everyday Basic' V-neck has remained stable at a summer baseline of ~100 units/period (mean of last 5 periods: 92.4; mean of last 10 periods: 96.3). To compensate for the 397 phantom units and ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders to meet the L+1 demand window (approx 280-300 units), I will set mu_hat explicitly high. Specifically, by setting mu_hat = 697, I signal to the OR backend that it needs to cover the current demand plus the missing volume that it incorrectly believes is already coming. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect the promised window and the most recent successful delivery pattern (P20 arrived in P22).

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Phantom in-transit inventory remains a critical distortion. Total estimated lost units: 397 (P1, P3, P10, P19). Functional pipeline is effectively just the P24 order of 266 units. Summer demand baseline is stable at ~100 units/week.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Recent demand (P22-P25) has shown a slight softening to an average of ~73 units, compared to the May/June peak of ~100+. However, the system is stock-out at the beginning of P26 with 0 on-hand units. The primary challenge remains the distorted inventory record. 'In-transit' shows 727 units, but analysis of history confirms a massive 'phantom pipeline': P1 (90), P3 (172), P10 (130), and P19 (5) are all far beyond their promised lead time and are likely lost or permanently stalled, totaling 397 lost units. The functional pipeline consists of the P24 order (266) and P25 order (58). Given the promised lead time (L=2), the P24 order is expected to arrive during P26. We use recent demand data (N=5) to capture the current trend (~81 units/period) and maintain a cautious base-stock level. By setting L to 'explicit' at 2 and using 'recent_N' for demand, we allow the OR backend to compute a target that ignores the phantom inventory by assuming the pipeline is much thinner than reported.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Phantom in-transit inventory remains 397 units (P1, P3, P10, P19). Demand has softened in late July/early August to ~73 units/period, but maintain recent_N=5 to capture the broader summer baseline of ~81.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 27 (mid-August), the core challenge remains accounting for 'phantom' in-transit inventory and a shifting demand baseline. Total In-transit is 727 units. Based on history, we have confirmed lost or extremely overdue shipments from P1 (90), P3 (172), P10 (130), and likely P19 (5). This sums to 397 lost units. Additionally, the large P24 order (266) and P25 order (58) are still within a plausible lead-time window (L=1-2). On-hand is 0, and demand has softened slightly in late July/early August. I use mu_hat with recent_N=5 (Avg: ~78) to adjust for this late-summer softening while still providing enough buffer for potential volatility. I use explicit L=4 for the Lead Time parameter to force the base-stock calculation higher, effectively bypassing the 397 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR engine would otherwise subtract from my replenishment order. This ensures the engine places an order that covers actual forecasted demand rather than relying on ghost stock that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Confirmed phantom in-transit inventory still at 397 units (P1: 90, P3: 172, P10: 130, P19: 5). Demand has cooled from June peaks (~112) to an August baseline of ~78.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-August (2019-08-19). Demand for this SKU has transitioned from a high-summer peak (~112) to an August baseline averaging approximately 78 units per period over the last five weeks (P23-P27: 64, 79, 54, 78, 77). The primary challenge continues to be the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. The system shows 669 units in-transit, but based on history, 402 units are effectively lost or permanently stalled (P1: 90, P3: 172, P10: 130, P19: 5, P20: 5 - note: P19 and P20 are estimated based on small residuals). The only functional order in the pipeline is from P24 (266 units), which is now overdue (3 periods since order). To compensate for the 402 lost units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to artificially inflate the target base stock. Setting mu_hat to 540 (calculated as: 3 periods \xd7 80 avg demand + 300 unit buffer) ensures the OR engine places an order despite the phantom 402 units. Lead time is set to 2 to reflect the promised window, as recent successful deliveries (P25) adhered to L=2.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Phantom in-transit inventory adjusted to 402 units (P1, P3, P10, P19, P20). Actual demand baseline for August is stable at ~78 units/period, down from the June peak of ~112.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for this basic V-neck t-shirt is fluctuating around a late-summer mean. Recent demand (P24-P28) shows a mean of ~78 units/period (54, 78, 77, 107 in P25-P28, excluding P24's 79 which was stock-out constrained). However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 669 units is severely distorted by lost/stalled shipments. I have confirmed 402 units are 'phantom' (P1: 90, P3: 172, P10: 130, P19: 5, P20: 5 - P20 order of 196 total: only 196-5=191 needed if some units were shorted, but based on history, if they don't arrive in the 1-2 period window they are lost). Specifically, the P24 order of 266 units, placed 5 periods ago, is now significantly overdue compared to the typical 1-2 period lead time and is likely also stalled/lost, bringing phantom inventory to 668 units. With 0 on-hand and the functional pipeline at 0, a large restock is required. I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the ~80 unit baseline and maintain a default sigma to handle the volatility seen in P28 (107 demand).

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Phantom in-transit inventory updated to 668 units. The order from P24 (266 units) is now 5 periods overdue and presumed lost, joining previous lost shipments from P1, P3, P10, P19, and P20. Functional pipeline is zero.

The order from P24 is now 6 periods overdue, which is the same delay at which we previously wrote off P3. Currently, the functional pipeline is effectively zero, and on-hand inventory is zero, leading to persistent stock-outs. Demand in August (P26-P29) has averaged 81.25 units, showing a slight cooling from the summer peak but remaining above the pre-game baseline. Given the extreme unreliability of the supply chain and the fact that orders are frequently lost rather than just delayed, I am setting L to 2 (promised) to trigger ordering despite the high (but fake) in-transit count. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current late-summer/early-autumn demand level (~80 units/period) while ignoring the 'phantom' supply.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Phantom in-transit inventory updated to 668 units (P1, P3, P10, P19, P20, P24). The 266 units from Period 24 are now 6 periods overdue and presumed lost. Functional pipeline is zero. Seasonal demand for late August/early September is stable at approximately 80 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 is currently facing a critical supply chain failure. As of Period 31, the system shows an in-transit inventory of 669 units, but my analysis confirms that the vast majority of this is 'phantom' inventory consisting of lost shipments. Specifically: P1 (90), P3 (172), P10 (130), P19 (5), P20 (196 - now 11 periods overdue), and P24 (266 - now 7 periods overdue). The total lost volume is 859 units, which exceeds the displayed in-transit count, meaning the functional pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero, leading to persistent stock-outs. To fix this, I must force the OR backend to place a large recovery order. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it to a value that overrides the phantom pipeline (Target Base Stock = Predicted Demand + Phantom Inventory). With a stable late-summer/early-autumn demand baseline of ~80 units and a lead time of 2, the required inventory for the cycle is 240 units. Adding the 669 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 909. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=10 to reflect the actual volatility of the summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed total collapse of previous pipeline. Every order placed between P1 and P24 (except small fills) is now lost or permanently stalled. Total phantom in-transit inventory is 669 units. Functional pipeline is 0 units. Actual demand for early September is ~80 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand has showing a clear downward trend in the late summer/early autumn transition (P30: 47, P31: 30), significantly lower than the previous ~80 baseline. I am adjusting the demand forecast downward using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this cooling trend (average ~63). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a massive 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 669 units (P1, P3, P10, P19, P20, P24) which are effectively lost. The system reflects 941 units in-transit, but the only functional part is the P31 order of 272 units. Since the functional pipeline (272) exceeds the required base stock for the current demand regime (mu_hat for 3 periods \u2248 189), I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure we don't over-order against phantom units, while allowing the OR engine to use the recent 272 order as sufficient coverage for now. No new order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend because the functional pipeline (272) is greater than the base stock calculated from current demand (~63/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand softening confirmed in mid-September. Late August/Early September demand dropped from ~80 to ~63 (last 4 periods). Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 669 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 is currently in a state of high pipeline distortion. The system shows 669 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these are 'phantom' units from lost shipments in Periods 1, 3, 10, 19, 20, and 24. These orders are significantly past their promised lead time of 2 and are presumed lost. The only functional order that recently arrived was from Period 31 (272 units), which arrived in just 1 period. Current demand has dropped sharply in mid-September, with the last two periods showing 30 and 26 units respectively, compared to the summer average of ~80-100. This suggests a seasonal 'cooling off' as we enter fall. With 246 units on-hand and demand falling towards ~30-50 units/period, the current inventory covers over 5 periods of forecasted demand. No new order is needed this period. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this recent significant demand drop (average ~43), while maintaining sigma_hat on a slightly longer window (N=7) to account for the recent high volatility during the transition.

Carry-over insight: September demand collapse confirmed: Late September demand (P31-P32) has dropped to ~28 units/period, a ~65% decrease from the August baseline of ~80. Functional pipeline remains zero following the arrival of the P31 order; all other in-transit units (669) are confirmed lost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has undergone a significant seasonal collapse as we transition into autumn. Over the last three periods (P31-P33), demand has plummeted to an average of ~34 units per period, compared to the August baseline of ~78. On-hand inventory is currently 200 units, which, at the new demand rate, represents nearly 6 periods of cover. The 'In-transit' figure of 669 units continues to be entirely composed of 'phantom' inventory from historically lost or stalled orders (P1, P3, P10, P19, P20, P24), and is thus ignored for planning. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the new low-demand regime, the goal is to avoid any further ordering to minimize holding costs while the current excess is cleared. I will set mu_hat to an explicit low value based on the most recent 3-period average (~34 * (1+L) = 102) and maintain a low sigma_hat to represent the reduced volatility seen in the current trough. This ensures the base_stock calculation remains below the current on-hand level, preventing new orders.

Carry-over insight: September demand collapse persistent: Mean demand for P31-P33 is ~34 units/period, confirming a transition from summer basics to low autumn baseline. Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 669 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 (Women's Jersey V-neck) has entered a low-demand autumn regime. Recent demand (P31-P34) averages ~33 units/period, down significantly from the summer baseline of ~80. Inventory management is complicated by a large 'phantom' in-transit volume of 669 units which are confirmed lost or permanently stalled (P1, P3, P10, P19, P20, P24). The actual functional pipeline is zero. Currently, we have 171 units on-hand, which at the current demand rate of ~33/period, provides approximately 5 periods of cover. Given the target service level and the 2-period promised lead time, we are currently overstocked due to the large P31 order. No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand collapse using N=4 (covering the recent low-demand period) to prevent the OR backend from seeing the 'lost' pipeline as valid inventory and to recognize the new lower demand ceiling.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand collapse confirmed: Late September/Early October demand (P31-P34) has stabilized at a low baseline of ~33 units/period, a ~60% reduction from the August baseline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Bob V-neck T-shirt' has entered a low autumn baseline. Demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) has averaged 31.2 units per period, a significant drop from the summer average of ~100. On-hand inventory is currently 146 units, which at the current burn rate covers roughly 4-5 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 669 units remains entirely composed of 'phantom' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P10, P19, P20, and P24) which are long overdue and confirmed lost. Because the current on-hand inventory (146) is significantly higher than the required base stock for an (L+1) cycle (3 periods * ~31 units = 93 units), no new order is necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent 5-period autumn baseline and use recent_N for sigma to capture the reduced volatility of this period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt has undergone a significant seasonal shift, dropping from a summer average of ~100 units/period to an autumn baseline of ~33 units/period (P31-P36 demand: 30, 26, 46, 29, 25, 22). Current on-hand inventory is 124 units, which covers approximately 4-5 periods of current demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 669 units is confirmed 'phantom' inventory consisting of lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P19, P20, P24). Consequently, the actual functional pipeline is zero. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, it is optimal to carry less inventory during this low-demand phase. No new orders are needed as current on-hand stock and the expected arrival of the Period 31 order (already arrived and mostly sold) have left us with sufficient coverage. Parameters are set to match the recent 5-period demand regime (~30 units/period) to allow the OR backend to correctly assess that the current on-hand (124) exceeds the required base stock, preventing unnecessary ordering while holding costs accumulate.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Autumn demand stabilization confirmed at ~30 units/period. The 669 units in 'In-transit' are permanently lost; actual functional pipeline is zero.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has transitioned into a low-volume autumn baseline. Over the last 7 periods (P31-P37), demend has averaged ~28 units/period, significantly lower than the summer average of ~100. On-hand inventory is currently 107 units, which covers approximately 3-4 periods of current demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 669 units is confirmed 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P19, P20, P24) and must be ignored for ordering purposes. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs profit of $4.0, the target service level is 80%. With 107 units on hand and a demand rate of ~28, no new order is required this period. I will set parameters to reflect the low autumn baseline (recent_N=7) and use explicit L to stabilize the backend against the phantom pipeline distortion.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Autumn demand baseline confirmed at ~28 units/period (P31-P37). Phantom in-transit inventory remains 669 units; actual functional pipeline is zero.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 39 (early November). Demand for this basic t-shirt SKU has significantly cooled since the summer peak (~100-112) and has stabilized at an autumn baseline of approximately 27 units per week over the last 8 periods (P31-P38). The current on-hand inventory is 81 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of the current demand regime. The 'In-transit' figure of 669 units is confirmed 'phantom' inventory consist of various lost or permanently stalled shipments from P1 through P24; the actual functional pipeline is zero. Given the current on-hand inventory (81 units) exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods, 3 * 27 = 81), the OR backend will correctly calculate that no new order is required. We will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized low-demand autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Autumn demand baseline remains consistent at ~27 units/period (P31-P38). On-hand inventory is now sufficient to cover lead-time demand without further ordering. Phantom in-transit remains 669 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a stable autumn/winter low since mid-September (Period 31), averaging approximately 25 units per period over the last 9 weeks. Current on-hand inventory is 74 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 3 periods of demand at the current rate (covering the standard 2-period lead time plus the decision period). The 'In-transit' figure of 669 units is comprised entirely of 'phantom' inventory from orders placed between Periods 1 and 24 that were never delivered and are confirmed lost. Because on-hand inventory (74) is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time (L=2, thus 3 periods of demand \u2248 75 units), and the game is approaching its final stages (Period 40 of 47), no new order is required. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 captures the current low-demand regime precisely. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' based on recent successful arrival patterns (L=1 or 2).

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Autumn/Winter low-demand regime confirmed stable at ~25 units/period (P31-P39). Phantom in-transit remains unchanged at 669 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable low-demand regime characteristic of the autumn/winter season for basic cotton jersey tops. Demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) has averaged approximately 26 units per period, consistently lower than the summer baseline of ~80-100. On-hand inventory is 61 units, which covers more than 2 periods of current demand (26 * 2 = 52). The 'In-transit' figure of 669 units is confirmed as 'phantom' inventory consisting of multiple lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P19, P20, P24) and should be ignored for planning. Since on-hand inventory is sufficient to meet current demand regimes through the promised lead time and beyond, no new order is required. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this low-demand state and L to default.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a stable low-demand regime typical for late autumn and early winter. Demand since Period 31 has remained consistently low, averaging approximately 25 units per period (P31-P41 mean is 25.5). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P38-P41) show demands of 26, 7, 13, and 20, further confirming this baseline. On-hand inventory is 41 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 1.6 periods of demand. With a promised lead time of 2 periods and an actual lead time often observing 1-2 periods for successful deliveries, the current inventory is near the base stock level needed (Base Stock \u2248 (L+1)*mu + z*sigma). Given that we are at Period 42 out of 47 and entering the year-end holiday season, demand for basic jersey tops may see a slight seasonal shift, but current data does not yet show a spike. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the stabilized low-demand regime (~26 units) while maintaining a safe sigma. The massive 'In-transit' figure (669) remains composed entirely of 'phantom' inventory from lost historical orders (P1, P3, P10, P19, P20, P24), meaning the functional pipeline is actually zero. No order is required this period as on-hand is adequate to cover the immediate lead time risk.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019. We are in a stable late-autumn/early-winter demand regime for this basic V-neck t-shirt. Recent demand (P38-P42) averages ~20 units per period, which is a significant drop from the summer peak of ~112. On-hand inventory is currently 8 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 2 periods, we must cover at least 3 periods of demand (L+1) to avoid stockouts. Based on the recent 5-period mean of 20 units, we need approximately 60 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 669 units consists entirely of 'phantom' inventory from orders placed between P1 and P24 that are confirmed lost or permanently stalled. To trigger the OR backend to place an order despite this phantom pipeline, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat that accounts for the required stock plus the phantom units. Target base stock is ~80 units (covering 4 periods of demand at 20/period). To bypass the pipeline deduction (80 - 669 = negative), I set mu_hat to 750 (669 phantom + 81 target). Sigma_hat is set to a recent 10-period standard deviation to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed phantom in-transit inventory remains at 669 units. Functional pipeline is zero. Winter demand is stable at ~20 units/period (P38-P42).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554772002 transitioned into a low-demand winter regime starting around Period 31, with demand consistently averaging ~20-25 units/period in the most recent 10 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0 after clearing remaining stock in Period 43. The 'In-transit' count of 758 is heavily distorted by 669 'phantom' units (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P10, P19, P20, P24). The only functional order in the pipeline is the P43 order of 89 units, which is expected to arrive within 1-2 periods. Since the functional pipeline (89) already exceeds the expected lead-time demand (approximately 3 periods * 20 units/period = 60 units), there is no immediate need to place more orders. Therefore, the parameters are set to maintain a conservative base stock that covers the current demand regime (~20 units/week) across the review and lead time (L+1=3). Recent_N=7 for mu_hat correctly captures the current winter baseline (mean ~20).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Winter demand baseline remains stable at ~20 units/period. The functional pipeline consists of the P43 order (89 units); all other 669 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late-winter low-demand period (mid-December). Current demand has stabilized at approximately 20 units per period based on the last several weeks (P38-P44). On-hand inventory is 0. The functional pipeline consists of the P43 order (89 units), which is expected to arrive this period (P45) or next (P46), assuming a lead time of 1-2 periods. The remaining 'In-transit' balance of 669 units (758 total - 89 from P43) is confirmed phantom inventory from previously lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P19, P20, P24). Consequently, the OR backend sees a massive pipeline and will not order. Since 89 units are sufficient to cover the remaining 3 periods of the game (P45, P46, P47) at the current demand rate (~20/period), no new orders are required. I will maintain parameters that reflect the current low-demand regime to ensure the OR backend manages the incoming 89 units effectively against holding costs.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. We are in a stable winter low-demand regime for this 'Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. Over the last 8 periods (P38-P45), demand has averaged approximately 16.4 units per period, consistently remaining below 35 units. On-hand inventory is currently 75 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 669 units, which has been exhaustively confirmed as phantom inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P10, P19, P20, and P24) and must be ignored. Given the predicted demand of ~16 units and a lead time of 2 periods, the stock-on-hand (75 units) covers roughly 4.5 periods of demand (well beyond the L+1 requirement). No new order is necessary. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 669 phantom units as functional pipeline, and to match the current low-demand reality, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the winter baseline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the demand for the Bob V-neck t-shirt has stabilized in a winter low-demand regime. Analysis of the most recent periods (P41-P46) shows demand values of 20, 33, 8, 10, 14, 14, resulting in a mean of approximately 16.5 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 61 units. Given a lead time (L) of 2, the inventory position needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). At the current burn rate, 61 units provides security for nearly 4 periods, which is sufficient. The 669 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P10, P19, P20, P24) and do not contribute to the functional pipeline. I will set mu_hat to reflect this current low-demand baseline using recent_N=6 to capture the winter stability and avoid over-ordering during the end-of-year lull.
