  "rationale": "For Period 1 (2019/2/11), we are managing SKU 554772002 (Women\u2019s V-neck T-shirt). Historical demand shows an average of ~68.6 units/period (58, 59, 81, 84, 61), with a noticeable spike in late January (Jan 21-28), potentially related to pre-spring shopping or promotions. Being a basic jersey t-shirt, demand is likely to be stable but will start trending upwards as we move toward Spring in the Northern Hemisphere. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To calculate the order for Period 1, I need to cover demand for Period 1 (current), Period 2, and Period 3 (since an order placed now arrives in Period 3). Expected demand per period is ~70 units. Total needed for 3 periods = 210 units. Safety stock is added to account for potential lead time variability or demand surges, targeting a total pipeline of ~250 units. Starting inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0, so the order is 250 units.",

We are currently in mid-February, entering the spring season for retail, where basics like t-shirts often maintain steady or slightly increasing demand. I placed an order of 250 in Period 1. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, that order should arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current inventory is 0, and the Period 1 demand of 83 was lost because the starting inventory was 0. I need to cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). Estimated demand for P2-P4 is roughly 210-250 units (approx 75-80 per week). My current pipeline (in-transit) is 250, which perfectly covers the next three periods.

The order from P1 (250 units) was expected to arrive in P3's arrival phase and be visible in P4 start. However, P3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that either the lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Pipeline Assessment: Current on-hand is 0. Total in-transit is 550 (P1: 250, P2: 150, P3: 150).

The current date (Nov 18, 2019) places it in the pre-holiday winter period where demand for short-sleeved basic t-shirts is typically at its annual minimum. Recent demand (last two periods: 7, 13) confirms this low-demand regime. On-hand inventory is 100 units, which covers approximately 4-5 periods of forecasted demand (at ~20 units/period). The total in-transit figure (1500 units) is largely composed of 'phantom' stock from early-year delivery failures (P1, P3, P4, etc.) totaling approximately 1550 units, offset by recent successful small deliveries. Since current on-hand stock is more than sufficient for the next several weeks and holding costs ($1.0/unit) are high relative to the perceived demand risk, no new order is required.",

Supply chain reliability has historically been very poor, with approximately 1550 units (including P38's 50 units which is now 3 periods out) categorized as lost or indefinitely delayed.

Historically, demand for this basic SKU peaked in June/July (~105 units/period) and significantly declined moving into autumn. Over the most recent 10 periods (P33-P42), demand has averaged 20-30 units per period, with a slight seasonal uptick in late November (P42 demand: 33). Lead times have been erratic, but recent successful deliveries arrived within 1-3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 1500 units is composed almost entirely of 'lost' or indefinitely delayed inventory from early-mid 2019 (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24), creating a massive phantom pipeline. Effective pipeline is zero as no orders were placed between P39-P42. On-hand inventory is 47 units. Given an average demand of ~30/period and a lead time of 2-3 periods, I need to cover approximately 90-120 units to maintain service through P45. Ordering 100 units now will replenish the stock to handle current demand levels plus a buffer for potential holiday variance, while minimizing holding costs on this low-margin but high-carrying-cost item.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Systemic 'In-transit' inflation: 1500 units appear in-transit, but these represent cumulative lost/stalled orders from throughout 2019; effective usable pipeline is zero. Winter demand regime is established at ~25-35 units/period.",

Current demand is in a low winter regime (avg ~20-30 units/period), though it occasionally dips lower (8 units in P43). Current on-hand inventory is 39 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1600 units is composed of systemic 'phantom' inventory (lost/stalled orders from throughout 2019) and should be ignored for planning. Only the order from P43 (100 units) is a viable incoming shipment, likely arriving between P44-P46 given the erratic but generally 1-3 period lead time recently observed. Total remaining demand for the game (Periods 44-47) is estimated at ~80-100 units. With 39 on-hand and 100 in the reliable pipeline, the system is slightly over-covered for the endgame, but given the high unreliability and the risk of the P43 order being lost, no further orders are placed to avoid accumulating holding costs ($1.0/unit) on excess stock at the end of the simulation.",

Although 'In-transit' shows 1600 units, these are long-lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, etc.) that have never arrived and should be considered 'phantom' inventory. Period 43's order of 100 units is the only active, reliable pipeline, expected to arrive between Period 44 and 46 based on the 1-3 period lead time observed in recent deliveries (P35-P37). Since we are at Period 45 of 47, we have approximately 3 periods of demand remaining (P45, P46, P47). Total expected demand for the remainder of the game is ~30-45 units.
