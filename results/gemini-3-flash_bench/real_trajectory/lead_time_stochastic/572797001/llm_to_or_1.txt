Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Essential Tanktop Lace TVP'. Historical demand data shows a steady pattern over the last 5 weeks (mean=104, std=9.5). Being mid-February, we are approaching the transition to Spring/Summer season where demand for tank tops typically increases, though we don't have enough evidence for a regime shift yet. The on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Given the stable demand history, I will use the recent 5 data points (the entire available history) to establish the baseline mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the initial order covers the expected demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's tank top with lace (essential item). In Period 1, we observed a demand of 128 units, which is higher than the historical average (approx 106). Since we started with 0 on-hand inventory, we lost all sales in Period 1. There are 122 units in transit from the Period 1 order. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 and be visible/usable in Period 4. The historical demand samples (111, 117, 92, 109, 103) plus the recent Period 1 demand (128) suggest a mean demand of approximately 110. With L=2, the OR logic needs to cover 3 periods of demand (1+L). mu_hat is set to (1+2)*110 = 330. Standard deviation of historical samples is approx 12.0; sqrt(1+2)*12.0 is approx 20.8. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including the recent 128 demand) to capture the trend while maintaining stability.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's lace tank top, which is likely entering its peak season as we move into spring. Historical demand samples (Jan/early Feb) averaged ~108 units. However, observed demand in Period 1 (128) and Period 2 (207) shows a significant upward trend, likely driven by seasonality. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in significant lost sales because previous orders have not yet arrived. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 (122 units) is expected to arrive during P3 resolution (visible P4 start). Order placed in P2 (131 units) is expected in P4. Total in-transit is 253. Given the demand jump to 207 in P2, the average demand (mu_hat) needs to reflect this recent surge. I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture the spike to 207 while acknowledging the growth from 128. With L=2 and a 1-period review cycle, mu_hat needs to cover 3 periods of demand (1+L). Based on the recent average of (128+207)/2 = 167.5, mu_hat should be approx 502.5. Since the backend calculates (1+L) * mean(last N), setting N=2 for mu_hat will use the P1 and P2 demand values.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand increase detected starting Feb 11 (Period 1): demand rose from ~108 average to 128 (P1) and 207 (P2), a ~90% increase over the historical baseline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU is a 'Womens Casual' lace tanktop, which is seeing a significant seasonal demand surge as Spring approaches. Historical demand (Jan/early Feb) averaged ~107, but the last three periods have seen demand of 128, 207, and 175 (mean: 170). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the 'Critical Timing Example', the order from Period 1 (L=2) should arrive during Period 3 and be confirmed in the Period 4 'conclude' message (which I will see next period). However, looking at 'In-transit', we have 503 units (122+131+250), meaning nothing has arrived yet. If Period 1's order (122 units) does not appear in the Period 4 'conclude' next turn, we must suspect a delay. For now, I will treat L as the promised 2. mu_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime (avg ~170/period). With L=2, mu_hat = (1+L)*170 = 510. sigma_hat is also calculated over the recent volatile period to ensure a sufficient safety stock to handle the high variance (std of [128, 207, 175] is ~40, so sigma_hat = sqrt(3)*40 \u2248 69).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). The SKU is a 'Lace Tanktop', which is entering its spring/summer peak season. Current inventory is 10 on-hand with 379 in-transit. A review of the lead times: Period 4 saw the arrival of the Period 2 order (131 units) with exactly a 2-period lead time, confirming the promised lead time holds. The Period 1 order (122 units) is notably missing/overdue (it should have arrived in Period 3). I will treat the Period 1 order as potentially lost and focus on covering the high demand seen in recent weeks. Demand history (recent samples: 128, 207, 175, 121) shows an average of ~158, significantly higher than the baseline (~108). I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand to capture the seasonal uplift while smoothing out the Period 2 spike. With a lead time of 2, the mu_hat needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/03/18. The product is a women's tank top. Historical baseline demand was ~108. Since Period 1 (Feb 11), we saw a seasonal spike (128, 207, 175) followed by a sharp decline in the last two periods (121, 68). The low demand in Period 5 (68) might be due to stockouts (ending OH was 0), but the demand figure represents actual customer requests. Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4). The P1 order (122 units) is notably missing/lost as it was due in P3 and hasn't arrived by P5 conclude. P3 order (250) is due now (P6). With 464 units in-transit and 0 on-hand, our pipeline is large. Given the drop in demand (average of last two periods is ~95), I am setting mu_hat to reflect this recent lower mean while maintaining a buffer for seasonal volatility. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the transition from the peak toward the current level, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen during the February spike.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (122 units) confirmed lost/overdue (3+ periods since expected arrival). Demand appearing to stabilize lower (avg ~95) after Feb peak.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (March 25). The product is a Women's Casual Lace Tanktop. Looking at historical demand (Jan-Feb) and game history: Jan demand averaged ~107. P1-P3 (Feb) saw a significant spike (avg 170) likely due to pre-spring shopping, followed by a recent cooling (P4-P6 avg ~87). We are currently undersupplied due to missing shipments: P1 order (122 units) is confirmed lost/overdue (now 6 periods since ordered), and P3 order (250 units) is now 4 periods since ordered (past promised L=2). However, P2 arrived in 2 periods and P5 arrived in 1 period, suggesting lead times are volatile but generally short if not lost. Demand is currently trending lower than the Feb peak. For parameters: L=2 (default) is maintained as recent successful arrivals were 1-2 periods. mu_hat will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the lower, stabilized demand (avg ~87) seen in March (P4-P6), which avoids over-ordering while waiting for the 250 units from P3 to potentially arrive. sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Demand has returned to baseline levels (avg ~87 for P4-P6) after the February spring spike. P3 order (250 units) is now overdue (4 periods since order, promised 2).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (April 1st), the demand for the Essential Tanktop has stabilized at a lower level following the February spike. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is 83.5 units, significantly lower than the baseline of ~108. Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0, and there are two major missing shipments. The P1 order (122 units) is confirmed lost. The P3 order (250 units placed Feb 25) is now 5 periods old\u20143 periods past its promised delivery. Given that the P5 order arrived in only 1 period (in P6), the logistics are highly erratic. With 0 on-hand inventory and the 'pipeline' consisting of 379 units (likely 250 from P3, 129 from others), I need to set parameters that trigger an order if the pipeline remains stalled. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period stable demand (N=4) to avoid over-ordering based on the Feb spike, but use an explicit L=3 to account for the ongoing supply chain delays, extending the safety cover.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability: P3 order (250 units) is severely overdue (5 periods since order). Demand regime has settled at ~84 units/period following the spring spike.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a floral lace tank top. Examining recent demand: Period 8 saw a sudden spike (197 units), which contrasts with the previous three weeks where demand averaged ~71. This spike might be related to warming weather or mid-spring shopping. Supply-wise, we are in a stockout (On-hand: 0). The P3 order (250 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost. The total in-transit is 379 units (P1: 122, P2: 0, P3: 250, P4: 7, P5: 0, P6: 0, P7: 0, P8: 0). However, history shows P1 (122 units) and P3 (250 units) are severely overdue. The last successful delivery was P5 arriving at P6 (Lead Time 1). The P4 order (7 units) is also overdue. To recover, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the recent spike while acknowledging the baseline, and use explicit lead time L=2 (promised) as recent actual lead times are erratic. I set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility seen in P8.

Carry-over insight: P8 demand spike detected (197 units), significantly breaking the post-February baseline of ~71. P1, P3, and P4 orders (totaling 379 units) are currently overdue and treated as lost for planning purposes.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/04/15), we observe significant supply chain failure. Orders from Period 1 (122 units), Period 3 (250 units), and Period 4 (7 units) are severely overdue (lead times of 9, 7, and 6 periods respectively vs. promised 2). While 'In-transit' shows 379 units, these must be treated as lost for planning to avoid stockouts if demand persists. Demand context: After a baseline of ~108, we saw a February peak (~170), a dip to ~70, and then a fresh spike in Period 8 (197) and Period 9 (117) coinciding with warmer weather/Easter season for a 'Tanktop Lace'. The average demand for the last 2 periods is 157. To recover from 0 on-hand inventory and account for unreliable lead times, I will set L to 3 (actual observed lead times for successful deliveries averaged 1.5, but recent failures suggest extreme risk). I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the recent demand spike (~157/period) to ensure the base stock calculation targets at least (L+1)*157 = 628 units. Because the backend subtracts 'In-transit' from this target, and 379 units are 'stuck', making the target high ensures an order is triggered despite the stagnant pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained supply chain failure: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (379 units) are effectively lost. New demand regime detected in April: P8-P9 average increased to 157 units/period from the March average of ~71 (+120% increase).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22). The item is a 'Women's Casual Jersey Tanktop'. We are currently seeing a sustained April demand spike (P8-P10 avg = 149.7) compared to the March baseline (~71). This aligns with late spring/pre-summer seasonality for vest tops. Inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 627, but this includes P1 (122), P3 (250), and P4 (7) orders which are severely overdue (lead times would be 10, 8, and 7 periods respectively) and are considered lost. The only viable in-transit units are from P10 (248 units). To recover from the stockout and project for the current demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P8, P9, P10) which captures the April shift (Avg=149.7 * (1+L) = 449). Lead time 'L' is kept at 'calculate' to incorporate the observed P2 delivery (L=2) and P5 delivery (L=1), while the 'explicit' mu_hat helps the OR backend understand the current higher demand level despite the pipeline noise from lost orders.

Carry-over insight: April demand regime confirmed: Avg increased to 150 units/period (P8-P10) from March avg of 71 (+110%). Total of 379 units from P1, P3, P4 are confirmed lost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 29, 2019. We are managing a women's lace tank top. The demand history shows a clear shift: Feb 'spring spike' (P1-P3, avg ~170), March cooling (P4-P7, avg ~84), and now a strong April surge (P8-P11, avg ~163). Specifically, demand in the last period (P11) was 202, suggesting accelerating interest as we head into warmer months. Supply chain performance is highly unreliable: orders from P1, P3, and P4 (379 units) are considered lost. The only viable in-transit units are from P10 (248 units). I am setting L=3 to account for recent arrival delays and using recent_N for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the current April demand regime. Given the volatility (P8-P11 demand: 197, 117, 135, 202) and previous stockouts, I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 80 to ensure a higher safety stock to cover the (L+1) horizon (4 periods). This balances the high service level needed for a $1/$1 profit-cost ratio while accounting for high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: April demand regime confirmed: Avg increased to ~163 units/period (P8-P11) from March avg of 84 (+94% shift). Previous lost order assumptions (P1, P3, P4) remain in effect.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For SKU 572797001 (Women's Tanktop), there is a significant April/May demand regime shift, likely driven by spring/summer seasonality. The demand average for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 152.4 units, which is significantly higher than the March baseline (~80). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and total in-transit is 651 units. However, consistent with previous 'Carry-over Insights', the orders from P1 (122), P3 (250), and P4 (7) totaling 379 units are severely overdue and considered lost. This implies the 'effective' pipeline is only 272 units (the orders from P10 and P12). Because the backend OR engine does not account for lost shipments and sees the full 651 units in transit, it will likely under-order. To compensate for the lost inventory that will never arrive, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a higher base-stock target while keeping L at default (2) to align with recent successful arrivals (like the 1-2 period lead times seen in P4 and P6). mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * 152.4 = 457.2 to cover the 3-period risk window.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime confirmed: Avg demand for P8-P12 is 152.4 units, a 90% increase over the March baseline. Supply chain failure for P1, P3, and P4 orders (379 units total) persists.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. The product is a lace trim tank top, which is seasonally relevant for spring and summer. Demand has recently dropped significantly to 40 units in Period 13 after a period of high demand in April (averaging ~160 units). The current pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 651 units, which consists of orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P12. Based on carry-over insights, orders P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 379 units) are significantly overdue (10+ periods) and likely lost. Effective pipeline inventory is thus 248 (P10) + 24 (P12) = 272 units. The OR backend needs to account for the fact that nearly 60% of the reported in-transit stock will likely never arrive. To prevent under-ordering while acknowledging the recent demand drop, I will use a mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P9-P13), which averages ~121 units/period, covering the April spike and the May dip. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times for the orders that actually arrived (P2, P5).

Carry-over insight: May demand transition: Period 13 demand dropped to 40 units, significantly lower than the April average of 163, suggesting a potential shift out of the early spring peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/20. The item is a 'Women's Casual Essential Tanktop', which saw a significant demand surge in April (avg ~163) that appears to be cooling off in May. Period 13 and 14 demand dropped significantly to 40 and 49 units respectively, suggesting a post-spring-peak demand shift. Supply chain reliability remains poor: orders from P1, P3, and P4 (379 units) have been missing for 10+ periods and are treated as lost. Total in-transit is 627, but if we deduct the 379 lost units, effective in-transit is 248 units (from Period 10), which should arrive shortly given the observed lead time of 2 periods for recent successful deliveries (P4, P6, P14). Since demand has transitioned downward, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P12-P14) to reflect the lower avg of ~66.6 units/period and prevent over-ordering as the season changes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand drop in May: Period 13-14 demand averaged 44.5 units, down from the April average of 163 (-72%), signaling the end of the spring seasonal peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility in May. After a significant drop in Periods 13 and 14 (averaging 44.5), Period 15 saw a sudden demand spike to 189 units. This suggests that the 'seasonal end' detected previously may have been premature, or the 'Essential Tanktop' is experiencing high variance as summer approaches (late May). Total in-transit inventory is 627 units, but 379 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/severely overdue. This leaves 248 units (ordered P10) as the only viable large replenishment, which is now at Period 16 (6 periods since P10 order), indicating a severe lead time extension or potential loss. Given the extreme supply chain instability and the high demand spike in Period 15, I will use recent_N for demand to capture the latest volatility (P13-P15 avg is ~93, but sigma will be high). I am setting L to 6 (explicit) to account for the actual delay observed for the P10 order, forcing the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock requirement to cover the extended pipeline, while the capped policy prevents over-ordering if the 248 units finally arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Supply chain failure continues to worsen; lead time for the P10 order (248 units) has reached 6 periods without arrival. Period 15 demand spike (189 units) invalidates the previous 'sustained drop' signal, indicating a high-volatility regime rather than a clean seasonal exit.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3, 2019. The SKU is a 'Womens Casual Lace Tanktop', which is seeing a significant surge in demand during late spring/early summer. Demand in Period 15 was 189 and Period 16 was 240, indicating a new, high-intensity seasonal peak. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: orders from Period 1 (122), Period 3 (250), and Period 4 (7), totaling 379 units, are significantly overdue and likely lost. The Period 10 order (248 units) is now 7 periods old (promised 2), suggesting it is also likely lost or severely delayed. Currently, On-hand inventory is 0. My goal is to capture the recent high-demand regime while accounting for the high volatility and unreliable pipeline. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P14-P16) to focus on the current summer surge (average ~159 units/period) and use recent_N for sigma to account for the high variance observed in May. I will keep L at the default promised lead time of 2, but provide an explicit high mu_hat to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock, as current pipeline units (especially from P1, P3, P4, P10) should not be relied upon to cover demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer Peak Confirmed: Demand for Period 15-16 averaged 214 units, a massive increase from the early May average of 44.5 (+380%). Extended supply chain failure: P10 order (248 units) is now 7 periods overdue; combined with P1, P3, and P4, total likely lost inventory in the pipeline is 627 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Casual Fitted Vest Top with Lace Trims', which is highly sensitive to the summer season. Current date is June 10, entering the peak summer period (June/July). Recent demand has been extremely high: P15 (189), P16 (240), and P17 (116). The average of the last 3 periods is 181.67. Supply chain reliability is very poor. Orders from P1, P3, P4, and now P10 (248 units ordered April 15, expected April 29) are effectively lost or so delayed they cannot be counted as reliable pipeline inventory. Only the 627 units in-transit (P1: 122, P3: 250, P4: 7, P10: 248) exist, but they have failed to arrive for months. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current summer peak (avg ~182) and the need for the lead-time + review period (1+L=3) to be covered.mu_hat = 3 * 182 = 546. Sigma_hat is set high to handle the extreme volatility seen (range of 116 to 240 in recent weeks). By setting a high mu_hat and treating pipeline as unreliable, I prompt the OR backend to place new orders despite the 'theoretical' 627 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Summer Peak established: Late May to early June demand (P15-P17) averages 181.7 units/period. Supply chain failure expanded: P10 order (248 units) is now 7 periods overdue; total likely lost in-transit inventory is 627 units. Planning should treat pipeline as near-zero.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'ESSENTIAL TANKTOP LACE TVP' is in a high-demand summer season (June). Recent demand (P15-P18) has shown extreme volatility with peaks up to 240 units and a recent dip to 94, averaging ~160 units. The supply chain for this SKU is extremely unreliable: orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10 (totaling 627 units) are severely overdue and must be treated as lost. Since the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' from the base stock target, and 'in-transit' currently reflects these 627 'phantom' units, the system will not place new orders unless we intervene. I will set the lead time (L) to 8. This ensures the OR engine's formula for mu_hat ((1+L) * mean) and its base stock calculation generate a high enough target to overcome the 627-unit 'pipeline_inventory' deduction, triggering a replenishment order to meet current summer demand. Demand mean is set to 150 based on the recent volatile peak average.

Carry-over insight: Sustained supply chain failure confirmed: Orders P1, P3, P4, and P10 (627 units total) are 8+ periods overdue and effectively lost. Summer demand regime established (average ~150 units).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (June 24, 2019), we continue to observe significant supply chain instability. The in-transit inventory of 903 units includes historical orders from Periods 1 (122), 3 (250), 4 (7), and 10 (248), totaling 627 units that are now between 10 and 19 periods overdue. These are effectively lost. The functional pipeline consists only of the Period 19 order (276 units). Demand for the Summer season (P15-P19) has stabilized at a mean of 153.2 units per period (189, 240, 116, 94, 127). Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and the majority of the pipeline is non-viable, I am setting L to 5 explicitly to account for the risk of extended lead times and to allow the OR engine to create a larger buffer. mu_hat is set to the current summer regime average (approx 153) multiplied by (1+L), and sigma_hat is calculated from the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen in May/June.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (late June) stabilized at avg 153.2 units (P15-P19). Lead time risk remains high; planning treats 627 units of transit inventory as lost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st. The SKU is a 'Womens Casual Fitted vest top', which is in peak summer seasonality. Demand in Period 20 spiked significantly to 434 units, potentially due to the July 4th holiday or peak summer heat, compared to the recent summer average of ~150 units. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10 (totaling 627 units) are severely overdue and effectively lost. The total 'In-transit' of 918 units includes these 627 'ghost' units; the only viable pipeline likely consist of orders from P19 (276 units) and P20 (15 units). To compensate for the effectively zero on-hand inventory and the lost pipeline units, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 (P15-P20) to capture the high summer demand average (~200 units/period) and volatility. I will use an explicit L of 4 to account for the frequent delays and losses, ensuring the OR backend targets a larger stock buffer to mitigate the risk of continuous stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Extreme demand spike in Period 20 (434 units) observed, potentially seasonal (July 4th). Supply chain failure now exceeds 600 units of lost inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lace tank top, currently in the peak summer demand season (early July). Period 20 showed a massive demand spike (434 units), likely tied to the July 4th holiday weekend, followed by a return to a more typical summer level of 124 units in Period 21. The current demand regime (P15-P21) averages approximately 189 units/period, excluding the P20 outlier, or ~224 units/period including it. Supply chain reliability is a major concern: orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10 (627 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 1000 units likely includes these ghosts plus orders from P19 (276), P20 (15), and P21 (82). To maintain a high service level while managing high volatility (\u03c3), I am using a recent_N calculation for demand (N=7, covering the summer period) and lead time, while maintaining a high safety stock. I will assume the promised lead time of 2 for current ordering decisions but recognize that actual deliveries are erratic.

Carry-over insight: July 4th seasonal spike confirmed (P20 demand: 434). Summer demand regime (P15-P21) established with an average of ~224 units/period, characterized by high volatility (std dev ~115).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lace tank top, currently in the peak summer demand season (mid-July). Period 22 demand was 81 following the July 4th peak of 434 (Period 20), suggesting a normalization. The summer regime (P15-P22) averages 175.6 units/period with high volatility. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19 (totaling 903 units) are significantly overdue or show no signs of arrival despite being well past the promised 2-period lead time. On-hand inventory is 0. Since the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' from the 'base_stock' to calculate orders, and 903 of the 985 units in-transit are likely lost, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand (3 periods: current + 2 lead time) PLUS the lost pipeline volume (approx 900 units). This forces the back-end to place a corrective order. I estimate 3 periods of demand at ~175/period (525 units) + 900 lost units = 1425. sigma_hat is set high to reflect seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Supply chain failure exacerbated. Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P19 (total 903 units) are considered lost. Summer average demand (P15-P22) is ~176 units/period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (July 22, 2019), we are in the peak summer season for women's tank tops. Demand analysis reveals a highly volatile summer regime: excluding the exceptional July 4th spike (434 units), the recent average demand (P17-P23) is approximately 134 units per period, while the full summer period (P15-P23) averages 175 units. I will adopt a 7-period 'recent_N' for demand to capture this active summer trend. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' quantity of 1343 units is deceptive due to extensive historical losses. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19 (totaling 903 units) are effectively lost, as they are 5 to 22 periods past their promised 2-period lead time. Only the P23 order (440 units) is recently placed. Consequently, the 'usable' pipeline is likely significantly lower than reported. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data, I aim to generate a robust base stock that replenishes inventory to handle the 134-175 unit weekly range despite these systemic pipeline losses, ensuring we capture available sales during the remaining summer weeks.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P15-P23) established at avg 175 units/period with high volatility. Supply chain failure confirmed for P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19; total 903 units in-transit are lost, leaving the actual pipeline at only 440 units (P23 order).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (July 29, 2019), we are in the peak summer demand regime for this tanktop SKU. Demand over the last 10 periods (P15-P24) has averaged 164.3 units per period. However, the supply chain remains highly unreliable. Total in-transit inventory is 1343 units, but orders from P1 (122), P3 (250), P4 (7), P10 (248), and P19 (276) represent 903 units that are significantly overdue and must be treated as lost. Only the P23 order of 440 units is currently 'live' in the pipeline. With 0 on-hand inventory and the P23 order expected soon (promised lead time 2), our total effective inventory (on-hand + 'live' pipeline) is 440 units. To satisfy demand for the review + lead time window (L+1 = 3 periods) at the current summer average of ~164 units/period, we need approximately 492 units. The OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' logic will see the full 1343 units in-transit and fail to order. To force a necessary order to cover the deficit of effectively 'lost' stock, I am setting L to 5 (explicitly reflecting the actual delay for surviving orders) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the recent high-demand, high-volatility summer regime (N=10).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Aug 5th. Demand for the product (Women's Tanktop) showed a massive July 4th spike (434) and has since cooled. The last two periods (P24-P25) shows demand averaging 123 units, aligning with a post-peak summer pattern. Inventory management is critical due to severe supply chain failures: orders P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19 are long-overdue and confirmed as lost (903 units total). In-transit inventory reflects 1343 units, but subtracting the 903 lost units leaves a realistic pipeline of 440 units (from P23). Given on-hand is 0, the goal is to set parameters to trigger an order that covers the current demand regime (~123 units/week) while accounting for the high volatility shown in July and the untrustworthy in-transit data. I will set mu_hat based on the last 11 periods to capture the summer average and high volatility, effectively signaling the OR backend that the 'lost' pipeline units should be replaced.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply chain failure for order P19 (276 units), which is now 6 periods overdue. Total inventory treated as lost in the pipeline is now 1179 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). Demand regime for late summer (P24-P25) has dropped to an average of 123 units from the early July average of 224.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-320.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent arrival of 440 units from the P23 order confirms that the supply chain is functional, albeit with a slightly extended lead time (3 periods observed for the last shipment). The demand has significantly cooled since the early July spike (434), with the last three periods (P24-P26) averaging 102 units/period (169, 77, 60), signaling the end of the summer peak for this tank top. Currently, on-hand inventory is 380 units. I am treating the 903 units in-transit (from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19) as permanently lost based on their age (P19 is now 7 periods overdue). Given current on-hand stock covers nearly 4 periods of recent demand (380 / 102 \u2248 3.7), and the OR backend's inventory calculation includes total in-transit units (effectively seeing OH+IT = 380+903 = 1283), I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat carefully to prevent the OR engine from triggering massive orders or unnecessarily high holding costs, while still maintaining some safety. I'll use a recent N of 3 to capture the most recent cooling demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift confirmed: Late summer cooling observed with P24-P26 demand averaging 102 units, a 42% decrease from the previous July average (~175). Supply chain remains fragile with the P23 order arriving in 3 periods instead of 2.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-to-late August (Period 28). Demand for this 'Essential Tanktop' has cooled significantly as summer ends, with an average demand of 59.7 units over the last three periods (P25-P27), compared to July's high volatility and triple-digit averages. On-hand inventory is 341 units, which is generous relative to this lower demand regime. The pipeline shows 903 units in-transit, but based on extensive historical evidence (P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P19 confirmed as lost after 9 periods), these 903 units are considered permanently lost. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current late-summer cooling (avg ~60), and sigma_hat with recent_N=3 to reflect the reduced volatility in this quieter period. While the P23 order arrived with a lead time of 3, the promised lead time remains 2; I will use default (2) but monitor for future arrivals. Given the existing on-hand stock covers 5+ periods of current demand, the OR engine (with the 0.5 service level implied by $1/$1 costs) is unlikely to place a new order, which is the correct conservative stance.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand cooling confirmed: average demand for P25-P27 dropped to 59.7 units, a ~65% decrease from the July peak average. Supply chain failure for orders P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19 (903 units total) is considered permanent.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (August 26, 2019), it is clear that demand for this SKU (Essential Tanktop) has entered a late-summer/pre-autumn cooling phase. After the extreme volatility and peaks seen in June/July (averaging ~224 units), the last three periods (P26-P28) have shown significantly reduced demand: 60, 39, and 49 units respectively, averaging 49.3 units. This confirms a demand regime shift out of the summer peak. The supply chain has stabilized for recent successfully delivered orders (P20, P21, P23), with lead times of 2-3 periods. However, a total of 903 units from older periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) are permanently lost. The OR backend needs to recognize the current lower demand to avoid over-ordering. I set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent cooling average (~50/period), and sigma_hat with recent_N=3 to reflect the current lower volatility. With 292 units on-hand and 0 expected in-transit inventory (treating the 903 units as lost), the current stock is sufficient for over 5 periods of demand at current rates.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand cooling confirmed: average demand for P26-P28 is 49.3 units per period, a ~72% decrease from the July peak. Supply chain failure for 903 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) is considered permanent; pipeline inventory should be discounted.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019-09-02), demand for the 'Essential Tanktop' is cooling significantly as we transition out of the summer peak. The last four periods (P26-P29) show demand of 60, 39, 49, and 114, averaging 65.5 units/period. The spike to 114 in P29 is likely a late-summer clearance or labor day effect but remains lower than the July average of ~175. On-hand inventory is 178 units, which covers approximately 2.7 periods of current demand. The pipeline shows 903 units, but according to carry-over insights, these orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) are 6+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts in-transit from the base stock, keeping these lost units in the pipeline would result in zero ordering even if needed. However, since current on-hand inventory (178) is already above the 3-period demand requirement (L+1 = 3), no new order is necessary yet. mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the autumnal cooling trend, and L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Late summer/Early autumn cooling confirmed. Demand avg for P26-P29 (65.5 units) is significantly below the summer peak average of 175 (-62%). On-hand inventory of 178 units provides sufficient coverage for the current demand regime despite lost pipeline inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Essential Tanktop Lace' is currently in a post-summer cooling phase. Demand for the last four periods (P27-P30) has averaged 78 units, significantly lower than the July average of ~175 units. Period 31 (Sept 9) marks the transition into autumn, where demand for vest tops typically stabilizes or continues to decline. On-hand inventory is 68 units, with the effective pipeline at 0 (the 903 units in-transit are long-term lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19). I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this cooling trend (avg ~78), using a lead time of 2 as the supply chain has shown recent arrivals within 2-3 periods. This ensures the base stock calculation targets approximately 234 units (3 periods of demand), triggering an order to replenish the currently low on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime confirmed: average demand for P27-P30 is 78 units, a 55% decrease from the July peak average of 175. Actual pipeline remains at 0 as 903 units are confirmed lost/overdue.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (2019/09/16), the demand for the lace tanktop is in a post-summer transition. Demand for the last four periods (P28-P31) has averaged 99 units (49, 114, 110, 123), which is lower than the July peak but higher than the late August cooling predicted earlier. On-hand inventory is now 0. Pipeline inventory of 903 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) is confirmed lost as they are 7 to 31 periods overdue. Consequently, the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' logic will incorrectly subtract these 903 units from the base stock, resulting in zero orders. To force an order and replenish stock, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect a demand target PLUS the lost units to bypass the back-end subtraction, or use the 'explicit' L to shorten the look-ahead while targeting the current regime. Given the mismatch, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the current demand regime (~100 units/period) plus a buffer for the lost pipeline reported in the system. However, the system's cap formula and the backend logic means I need to provide a mu_hat that, when pipeline is subtracted, still triggers an order. To cover (L+1) periods of demand (~300 units) and offset the 'phantom' 903 units in transit, I will set mu_hat to 1200 and sigma_hat to 150. This ensures the base stock (approx 1200) minus 903 results in a net order of ~300 units, which covers the next 3 weeks of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Post-summer demand stabilized at ~100 units/period (P29-P31 avg: 115). All 903 units in-transit (P1-P19) are confirmed lost and must be offset in parameter logic.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand has transitioned from a high-volatility summer peak to a more stable post-summer cooling regime. In the most recent four periods (P29-P32), demand has averaged 80.5 units (114, 110, 123, 75). Supply chain issues remain a critical factor; orders totaling 903 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) are confirmed lost and must be ignored in pipeline calculations. In Period 32, an order of 297 units was placed to replenish zero on-hand inventory. For Period 33, I will focus on the most recent demand regime (last 4 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N=4 captures the shift away from the summer spikes while accounting for the current stabilization. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual arrival performance (which has drifted between 1 and 3 periods). This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers roughly 3 periods of the current demand (~240-300 units) to account for the pipeline and expected demand during the lead time.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (September 30), we are in a post-summer cooling phase. Demand over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) has averaged 77.8 units, showing stabilization after the July peak. The supply chain remains highly unreliable: historical data confirms that 903 units (from orders P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19) are permanently lost. The current in-transit inventory shown as 1200 units includes these lost units plus the Period 32 order (297 units). Therefore, for OR logic, the 'effective' pipeline is only 297 units. To ensure the backend places an order if needed, I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the recent average demand (approx 80 units/period) for the lead-time window (L+1=3), resulting in 240 units. Since the backend subtracts pipeline inventory from mu_hat, and it sees 1200 units, it will not place an order unless mu_hat is set significantly higher or the pipeline is clarified. However, since we have 0 on-hand and the P32 order (297 units) is due to arrive in Period 34 or 35 (given L=2-3), we expect stock to replenish soon. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the next window while acknowledging the high volatility (sigma_hat).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed (P29-P33): Demand averaging ~78 units/period. Pipeline data remains distorted by 903 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand cooling regime. Demand for the most recent periods (P32-P34) has averaged 63.3 units/period, down from the early autumn levels. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1200 units is heavily distorted by 903 units of permanently lost inventory (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). The only 'live' order is P32 (297 units), which is expected to arrive this period (P35) given the lead time of 2-3 periods. To ensure we cover demand during the review and lead time without over-ordering based on the high summer historical mean, I am using a recent_N strategy for mu_hat. N=6 (P29-P34) captures the current cooled demand regime (average ~81 units). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect current lowered volatility. L is set to calculate to use the historical average performance, despite the known fragility of the supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer/Early Autumn demand regime (P29-P34) established an average of 81 units/period, a significant reduction from the summer peak. Pipeline effectively consists only of the P32 order (297 units) as 903 earlier units are confirmed lost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 14th, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for this tank top SKU. Recent demand (P29-P35) has averaged 92.4 units per period, showing stabilization significantly below the summer peak (approx. 175) but slightly above the initial cooling phase observed in late August. Inventory management is complicated by a persistent pipeline issue where 903 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19) are effectively lost, though they still appear in the 'in-transit' count. Current on-hand inventory is 179 units. The most recent arrival (P32 order) took 3 periods, confirming that lead times are currently drifting slightly above the promised 2 periods (avg. 2.5-3). I will set L to 3 to account for this drift. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 7 periods (P29-P35) to capture the current stabilization (N=7), providing a buffer for the minor uptick in demand observed in the most recent period (118 units). This approach ensures we maintain service levels during this stable phase while accounting for the unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime stabilized (P29-P35) at an average of 92.4 units per period. Pipeline distortion persists: 903 units from orders P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19 are confirmed indefinitely lost. Most recent successful lead time was 3 periods (P32 order).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October. Demand in Period 36 was 152, significantly higher than the previous 7-period average of ~92, potentially indicating a mid-autumn spike or higher volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 27 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 903 units consists entirely of orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) that are severely overdue (7 to 35 weeks) and must be treated as permanently lost. The most recent successful lead time was 3 periods (P32 order). To calculate the base stock, I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat (P29-36 average is 100.8), which captures the post-summer stabilization while acknowledging recent higher demand. I will also use recent_N of 8 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in the last two periods (range 48-152). I am setting L to 3 manually to reflect the actual lead time seen in the last two successful deliveries (P23, P32), as the promised 2 is consistently exceeded. This configuration will trigger an order to replenish stock before the current 27 units are exhausted.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: October demand volatility observed (Period 36: 152 vs Period 34: 48). All 903 units in-transit are confirmed lost. Effective lead time stabilized at 3 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797001 is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a pipeline consisting only of 903 units from orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) that have been confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed through historical evidence. For inventory planning purposes, I treat the pipeline as 0 and base my orders on current demand signals. Demand in October (P35-P37) shows some volatility but has stabilized around an average of 127 units per period (118, 152, 112). I will use a recent demand window (N=5, covering P33-P37) to capture this post-summer stabilization while accounting for recent activity. The effective lead time observed from recent successful arrivals (P23 arriving in P26, P32 arriving in P35) is 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. I will set the lead time to 3 to ensure the OR engine covers demand over the correct (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime stabilized at an average of ~127 units (P35-P37). Effective lead time is consistently 3 periods based on the last two successful arrivals (P26, P35).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is November 4th, 2019. Historical demand for October (Periods 35-38) has stabilized at an average of 118.75 units per period (118, 152, 112, 93). This is a Moderate Autumn regime, lower than the Summer peak but higher than the late August cooling. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 903 units is composed entirely of confirmed lost/overdue shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19; hence, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Observed lead times for the most recent successful arrivals (P23 arriving P26, P32 arriving P35) have consistently been 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Therefore, I am setting L to 3 and estimating demand based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the October/November stabilization. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the extended lead time and the current demand level while ignoring the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: October/November demand regime stabilized at ~119 units/period (P35-P38). Confirmed effective lead time is 3 periods (based on P26 and P35 arrivals).

LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797001 (Essential Tanktop) is currently in a stable post-summer/autumn demand regime following several seasonal transitions. Current demand for the most recent period (P39) was 109, and the average over the last five periods (P35-P39) is approximately 116.8 units. The supply chain has settled on an effective lead time of 3 periods, as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P23, P32, and previous insights. There is a persistent distortion in the 'In-transit' figure: 903 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19) are effectively lost and will not arrive. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the actual pipeline (excluding lost units) is also 0. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to cover the 3+1 period lead time window, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 and calculate demand based on the recent stable regime (N=5). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base_stock, and the pipeline is erroneously reported as 903, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the base stock to compensate for the invisible shortfall, or simply set parameters that trigger an order. Given the 'cap' logic in the backend, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a target stock that ignores the 903 ghost units and accounts for the ~117 units/period demand.

Carry-over insight: November demand remains stable at ~117 units/period (P35-P39 average: 116.8). Effective lead time is consistently 3 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for the SKU (Essential Tanktop) has remained stable during October and November, with an average of approximately 117 units over the last 5 periods (P36-P40: 152, 112, 93, 109, 145). Although 1289 units are listed as 'In-transit', 903 of these (from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19) are effectively lost based on historical carry-over evidence. The actual pipeline consists only of the order placed in Period 40 (386 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Based on the most recent successful deliveries (P26, P35), the effective lead time is 3 periods. I will set the lead time parameter (L) to 3. \u03bc\u0302 will be set to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Using the recent demand average of 117, \u03bc\u0302 = 117 * 4 = 468. \u03c3\u0302 will be calculated based on the recent volatility of the same 5-period window to ensure the OR engine maintains an appropriate service level without excessive holding costs for this stable regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has been stable since early October (P35-P41), averaging approximately 117 units per period. The supply chain has a confirmed pattern of failure for several historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19), totaling 903 units, which are considered permanently lost. For recent successful fulfillments (P23, P32), the lead time has consistently been 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. The order placed in P40 (386 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of P43 (since lead time is 3). I will set L to 3 to reflect this reality. mu_hat will be calculated using a recent N of 7 (P35-P41) to capture the current stable demand regime (avg ~117.7), which translates to a total demand across the lead time + review period (1+3 periods) of approximately 471 units. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P35-P41) stabilized at ~117 units/period. Effective lead time for successful deliveries (P23, P32) is confirmed at 3 periods, deviating from the promised 2.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '572797001' is entering December, where we observe a massive demand spike in Period 42 (328 units), likely representing a seasonal peak (Holiday/Black Friday effect). The historical baseline for the post-summer regime was ~117, but the P42 spike suggests a shift. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P40-P42) is 189.3. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 1289, but based on carry-over insights, 903 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) are confirmed lost. The P40 order of 386 units is the only active inventory in transit, expected to arrive around P43 (since recent effective lead time is 3 periods). Given the spike to 328 units and the fact that we are currently at 0 on-hand, the OR backend needs to recognize higher volatility and a higher mean to ensure the P40 order (when it arrives) is supplemented if needed. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (P38-P42) to capture the trend while acknowledging the recent spike. Lead time L is set to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time observed in recent successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: December seasonal spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 328 units, a ~180% increase over the previous stable baseline of 117.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a December seasonal peak. Demand spiked significantly in Period 42 (328 units) following a stable autumn baseline of ~117 units. Period 43 demand was 89 units, which may indicate high volatility or the start of the holiday pre-peak cooling before Christmas. Based on the 2018 historical data (starts Jan 2019), we must prepare for potential late December spikes. The current on-hand inventory is 297 units. The pipeline shows 903 units, but according to carry-over insights, these (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) are confirmed lost and effectively zero. The most recent arrival (P40 order) confirmed an effective lead time (L) of 3 periods. I will set L to 3. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-volatility December regime (Avg P39-43: 153 units). Since high volatility is expected during the Christmas/New Year period, I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 120 (adjusting for sqrt(1+L) this results in a robust base stock) to ensure service levels are maintained despite the supply chain's history of lost orders.

Carry-over insight: December seasonal volatility confirmed: Period 42 spike (328) followed by Period 43 (89). Effective lead time stabilized at 3 periods (P40 arrived in P43).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has shown high volatility recently with a seasonal spike in Period 42 (328 units), though Period 44 settled at 105 units. The historical average for the late Autumn/Winter regime (P35-P44) is approximately 139.6 units per period, reflecting this increased volatility. Regarding lead time, recent successful arrivals (P23, P32, P40) consistently show an actual lead time of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. The pipeline inventory of 903 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) is confirmed lost/void and does not contribute to stock coverage. With 192 units on-hand and an effective lead time of 3, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the real-world delay and using a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current seasonal volatility (average ~140) while smoothing the extreme P42 spike. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to reflect the current high variance.

Carry-over insight: December volatility confirmed: Demand remains erratic but elevated compared to the autumn baseline. Effective lead time for all successful Q3/Q4 shipments is 3 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. The product is a seasonal tank top with lace trims. We are in the late December holiday period, following a confirmed seasonal spike (Period 42: 328 units). Recent demand (P43-P45) has stabilized somewhat (average 104 units), but volatility remains high due to holiday and winter clearance cycles. The carry-over insights and historical data confirm that 903 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) are permanently lost and should be discounted from the pipeline. The effective lead time for all successful Q3/Q4 shipments (P32 to P35, P40 to P43) has consistently been 3 periods, not the promised 2. Therefore, I set L=3 using the explicit method. For demand (mu_hat), I use 'recent_N' with N=11 (covering P35-P45) to capture the post-summer baseline and recent December volatility, resulting in an average of ~123 units per period. Since L=3, the mu_hat parameter covers (1+L)=4 periods of demand. This approach ensures we maintain sufficient inventory for potential year-end demand while accounting for the extended real-world lead time and cleaning the pipeline of 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: End-of-year lead time confirmed at 3 periods (P40 order arrived P43). Demand remains volatile but averages ~115-125 units in the late Q4 period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, right after the Christmas peak and heading into the New Year. Demand in Period 42 showed a significant seasonal spike (328), but has since reverted to a stable post-summer baseline. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P43-P46) is approximately 104.5 units per period. The supply chain remains characterized by an effective lead time of 3 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P40 order in P43, despite the promised 2 periods. The 'In-transit' count of 903 units consists of orders P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19, all of which are 20+ periods overdue and confirmed lost; therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will set L to 3 to reflect the established actual lead time and use an 8-period window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while acknowledging late Q4 volatility.
