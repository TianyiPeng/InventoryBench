Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the Mariette Blazer. This is early spring, a period where women's tailored blazers often see consistent demand. Historical demand from the last 5 weeks ranges from 145 to 196, with a clear upward trend (161 -> 145 -> 179 -> 196 -> 186), averaging 173.4. Given the product type and the timing, I expect sustained demand. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a baseline. I'll use L=default (promised 2 periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent information while smoothing out the volatility observed in the January/early February data. This will set a base stock level that covers (1+L)=3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a Women's Blazer ('Mariette Blazer'). Analyzing the historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 11): 161, 145, 179, 196, 186, 227. There is a visible upward trend in demand as we move into the spring retail season. The last demand of 227 is significantly higher than the 5-week average of ~173. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 207 units which are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (concluding Period 2). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 227 demand was lost in Period 1 due to stockout. Since the demand is trending upwards, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher mean of the last 5 weeks (~187 per week) over the long-term average. With L=2, mu_hat should target (1+L)=3 periods of demand. I will set L to 'default' as we haven't seen any lead time anomalies yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', a professional women's tailoring item. We are currently in late February (2019/2/25), heading into the Spring season where demand for Blazers typically increases for professional wardrobes. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 161, 145, 179, 196, 186 (pre-game) followed by 227 (P1) and 284 (P2). The mean of the last 3 samples (186, 227, 284) is approximately 232. Given the promised lead time (L=2), mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this recent growth while remaining grounded in the data. Inventory is currently critical (0 on-hand) due to high initial demand and the 2-period lead time; orders from P1 (207 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. No shipments are confirmed lost yet; we are within the standard lead time window for all orders placed. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the volatility of the recent growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from an early Jan/Feb average of ~170 to ~255 over the last two periods (P1-P2), a ~50% increase likely due to Spring seasonality for blazers.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer', which is entering the Spring peak season. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 747 units in transit. Historical demand shows a regime shift: Early samples (Jan/Feb) averaged ~173, while recent periods (P1-P3) averaged 236.3. Specifically, demand was 227 (P1), 284 (P2), and 198 (P3). The promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in P1 (207 units) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in P4's conclude message; however, we have not yet seen the P3 conclude message results for arrivals in this decision phase. Based on the rules, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible at the start of P4. Since we have 0 on-hand at the start of P4 and the P3 conclude message shows demand of 198 but 0 sold, it confirms the P1 order (L=2) did not arrive in time to satisfy P3 demand. We will maintain L=2 for now but watch for potential delivery delays or lost orders. I will use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher late-winter/early-spring volumes while accounting for the slight dip in P3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (2019/03/11), we are managing a women's blazer. Historical demand (161, 145, 179, 196, 186) averaged 173, but recent demand (P1-P4: 227, 284, 198, 214) has increased to an average of 230, confirming the 'Spring seasonality' shift previously noted. We currently have 22 units on-hand and 598 in-transit. The order from P2 arrived exactly after the promised 2 periods (L=2) during Period 4. Orders from P1 (207 units), P3 (304 units), and P4 (87 units) are in-transit. The P1 order is now at L=3 and has not yet appeared in a 'conclude' message, indicating a slight delay or loss risk, though P2's arrival is encouraging. I will set L to 2 (promised) as most recent data confirms it, but I'll use a recent N=4 for demand forecasting to capture the higher Spring regime (avg ~230). This targets a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (~690 units) against a pipeline of 620 (on-hand + in-transit).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time of 2 periods in P4 (P2 order arrival). Demand regime sustained at higher Spring levels (Avg ~230 vs earlier ~173).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees high demand during the spring season. Historical demand data from early Jan-Feb averaged ~173 per week, but since mid-February (Period 1), demand has shifted upwards, averaging ~227.6 over the last 5 weeks (227, 284, 198, 214, 215). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 777 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2, and the conclusion of Period 4 confirmed an actual lead time of 2 (Order P2 arrived P4). An order placed in Period 3 (304 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5's resolution (visible in P6's conclude), and an order from Period 1 (207 units) is notably missing/overdue, as it was expected by P3 conclude. Given the stockout in Period 5 (sold only 22 of 215 demand), we need to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover the (L+1) period demand (weeks 6, 7, 8). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the sustained higher spring demand regime, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (207 units) overdue as of P5 conclude; possibly lost or significantly delayed.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's blazer, which is in high demand during the spring season. Historical demand since early Feb (P1-P6) has averaged ~225, significantly higher than the Jan pre-season average of ~170. We are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Inventory reconciliation: P1 order (207 units) is now 4 periods overdue (promised L=2) and is likely lost. P3 order (304 units) and P4 order (87 units) are in-transit. P5 order arrived in 1 period (P6 conclude), which is faster than promised. P6 order (1 unit) was an anomaly due to the OR backend's response to the unexpected P5 arrival. To recover and maintain stock for the sustained demand regime (Avg ~225), I will set L to the promised 2 periods (as P4 confirmed L=2 and P5 arrived earlier). For demand parameters, I use N=6 (P1-P6) to capture the current high-demand regime. Explicit mu_hat is set to (1+L)*225 = 675. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility recorded in the P1-P6 window (std dev ~33), adjusted by sqrt(1+L), resulting in ~57.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (207 units) confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed after 4 periods past promised lead time. Evidence of lead-time variability: P2 order (L=2), P5 order (L=1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is experiencing high demand due to spring seasonality, but is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). The demand history since Feb 11 (P1-P7) shows a mean of ~218.4, which is significantly higher than the initial samples (~173). The lead time has shown variability: P2 order took 2 periods, while the P5 order arrived in 1 period; additionally, the P1 order is confirmed lost. With 170 units ordered in P7 and 304 units ordered in P3 (which is now 5 periods ago and likely lost or severely delayed, though the Carry-over suggests only P1 is confirmed lost, P3 is nearing that status), our pipeline is fragile. For Period 8, I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical average of concluded lead times (1.5 periods). mu_hat will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained higher demand regime observed since Period 1 (mean ~218.4 * (1+L)). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility. This configuration aims to aggressive restock to capture remaining spring demand while accounting for realized lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: P3 order (304 units) is now 5 periods old with no arrival; if it does not arrive in P8 conclude, it should be treated as lost. Demand remains stable in the 180-220 range for the Mariette Blazer.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The 'Mariette Blazer' is in 0 on-hand inventory, and 598 units are in-transit. Based on the history: P1 (207 units) is lost. P3 (304 units), ordered 6 periods ago, has not arrived and is now confirmed lost (it should have arrived in P5 or P6). This leaves 294 units truly in-transit (P4 order of 87 and P8 order of 207, adjusting for the order of 0 in P8 conclude history implies we look at the pipeline). Actually, looking at the history: P4=87, P5=179 (arrived), P6=1 (arrived), P7=170 (arrived), P8=0. Wait, the history says P8 ordered 0. My pipeline inventory is reported as 598, which likely includes the lost P1 (207), P3 (304), and P4 (87). If we treat P1 and P3 as lost, the OR core needs to replenish. Demand has been high: the last 8 periods average ~223. Recent demand (P8) was 249. Given the recurring stockouts (0 inventory at end of P5, P6, P7, P8), we must set parameters that force an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline. Since L=2 is promised but we see variability (L=1, L=2), I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the 210-250 demand regime. To overcome the 598 in-transit units being 'dead weight', I will use explicit mu_hat to signal a higher base stock requirement.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: P3 order (304 units) confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (6 periods since order, promised 2). Current pipeline of 598 is mostly composed of lost units (P1: 207 + P3: 304 = 511 units lost).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-April (2019-04-15), managing a women's blazer. Demand has stabilized but remains volatile, with an average of ~200 over the last 5 periods. The significant challenge is the 'ghost' pipeline: Period 1 (207 units) and Period 3 (304 units) have been confirmed lost, and Period 9 (454 units) is still in transit. The in-transit total of 1052 includes 511 units that will never arrive. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand has resulted in lost sales due to stockouts, we must place a replenishment order. I am using 'explicit' L=2 based on promised lead time (as L=1 was observed but is unreliable). For mu_hat, I'm using the mean of the last 5 periods (~208) multiplied by (1+L) to get 624. Sigma_hat is set to an explicit value (60) scaled by sqrt(1+L) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation accounts for recent demand spikes like Period 8 (249 units).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline clarification: Total 'lost' units reached 511 (P1: 207, P3: 304). The OR engine's 'in-transit' calculation of 1052 counts these lost units, so parameters are set to force replenishment despite the high apparent pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 11 (2019/4/22), the Mariette Blazer shows a moderating demand trend. Following the early Spring peak (~215-284 in Periods 1-5), demand in the last three concluded periods has been 249, 178, and 130. The average of the last 5 samples is approximately 174. The inventory situation is critical to manage: On-hand is 324. The In-transit figure of 598 still contains 511 units from lost orders (Period 1: 207, Period 3: 304) that have not arrived and are extremely unlikely to arrive. Excluding these 'ghost' units, the real pipeline is only 87 units (from Period 4, which is also overdue and likely lost). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover future demand, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Although recent demand is lower, setting mu_hat = 800 (representing roughly 200 units/period for L=3 coverage) forces the engine to ignore the 511 ghost units in transit. If I used default methods, the engine would see (On-hand 324 + Pipeline 598 = 922) and order nothing, leading to a stockout as demand continues.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline cleanup: P4 order (87 units) is now 7 periods old and should be considered lost, bringing total confirmed lost inventory to 598 units. Recent demand trend shows a post-peak decline (130 units in P10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), we are transitioning out of the peak spring season for the Mariette Blazer. Recent demand has cooled from the ~220 range to an average of 128.5 over the last two periods. Inventory management is complicated by a pipeline inflated by lost orders. Specifically, orders from P1 (207), P3 (304), and P4 (87) totaling 598 units are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods and are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 603 units is almost entirely composed of these lost units (603 - 598 = 5 units actually in transit from P11). To maintain availability against the new lower demand regime (~130 units/week) while the OR engine incorrectly believes there is a large pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. This bypasses the OR engine's logic of subtracting the (largely phantom) pipeline from the base stock. I choose a value of 1000 for mu_hat because (Base Stock - Pipeline) must result in a positive order; with Pipeline ~603 and On-hand 197, we need a Base Stock of roughly 800+ to trigger any replenishment. Setting mu_hat to 1000 ensures a safety buffer and accounts for (1+L) periods of demand at the current rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Moving from Spring peak (~220) to late Spring baseline (~130 units/week) based on P10-P11 data. Total confirmed lost shipments: 598 units (P1, P3, P4).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are managing the Mariette Blazer, which experienced a demand peak in Feb-Apr (averaging ~220-250) but is now transitioning to a lower late-spring/early-summer regime. Demand in the last three periods has been 130, 127, and 191 (Mean=149). The on-hand inventory is critically low at 6 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 945 units is significantly inflated by historical lost shipments: P1 (207), P3 (304), and P4 (87), totaling 598 lost units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 347 units (945 - 598), mostly consisting of the P12 order of 342 units. Lead times have been volatile, alternating between 1 and 2 periods. To ensure replenishment despite the bloated 'in-transit' count perceived by the OR engine, I will use 'explicit' methods. mu_hat is set to 447 based on an expected demand of ~149 per period for the review + lead time window (L=2, so 3 periods). sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent variability and the stock-out risk given current low inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the Mariette Blazer is entering late spring/early summer. Historical demand data shows a clear shift: early spring (P1-P9) averaged ~216 units, while recent demand (P10-P13) has dropped significantly to an average of ~152 units. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) after a demand of 160 in P13. The pipeline situation remains the core challenge: 'In-transit' is 940 units, but 598 units are confirmed lost (P1: 207, P3: 304, P4: 87). This leaves an 'active' pipeline of 342 units (ordered in P12). Given the promised lead time of 2, the P12 order is due to arrive during P14. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the new lower demand regime of ~150 units/week while factoring in the 598 'phantom' units in transit, I will use the 'explicit' method. I want a base stock that covers 3 periods (L=2 + review period 1) at ~150 units/period (total 450) plus an adjustment for the 598 units the backend thinks are coming but aren't. Thus, mu_hat is set to 1050 (rounded) to force the backend to place a small replenishment or at least recognize the deficit, even with the P12 order arriving. Lead time is set to 2 to reflect the promised value and recent performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 10-13 average is ~152 units compared to earlier Spring average of ~216. Active pipeline is only 342 units (ordered P12); 598 units remain lost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20, 2019. The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized at a late-Spring/early-Summer level of approximately 165 units per week (Average of P11-P14 is 168). The 342 units ordered in P12 arrived as expected in P14 (L=2) and P14 concluding inventory is 146. A critical issue remains with known lost shipments: P1 (207 units), P3 (304 units), and P4 (87 units) totaling 598 units are still counted in the 'In-transit' figure of 794. The active pipeline consists only of the P14 order (196 units). Since the OR engine subtracts all 'In-transit' units from the target base stock, it believes we are overstocked by 794 + 146 = 940 units. To force an order and maintain stock for the next 3 weeks (L+1), I will use 'explicit' methods. mu_hat is set to cover 3 periods (~165 * 3 = 495) plus an offset to neutralize the lost shipments (495 + 598 = 1093). sigma_hat is set to the recent standard deviation across the stabilized period (sqrt(3) * ~30 = 52).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at ~168 units/week (Periods 11-14). Pipeline integrity: 598 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4) but still visible in system in-transit counts, necessitating upward adjustments in explicit mu_hat to trigger replenishment.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/05/27), we are managing the Mariette Blazer. Current on-hand inventory is near zero (3 units) after selling 143 units in P15. The 'In-transit' count of 1033 units is significantly inflated by lost shipments from P1 (207), P3 (304), and P4 (87), totaling 598 units that will never arrive. Additionally, the ordered units from P14 (196) and P15 (239) are still in transit. Given the promised lead time of 2, the P14 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 16 and be visible at the start of P17. Demand has stabilized into a post-peak Spring regime, averaging ~163 units over the last 5 periods (P11-P15: 127, 191, 160, 196, 143). To trigger replenishment despite the 598 lost units clogging the OR engine's pipeline calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I Target a base stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (3 * 163 = 489) plus a buffer for the lost units (598), totaling 1087. This ensures the OR engine (computing order = base_stock - 1033) actually places an order to maintain stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline ghosting: 598 units (P1, P3, P4) confirmed lost but still visible in system In-transit. Demand regime is stable at ~163 units/week for the late Spring/early Summer transition.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), we focus on the Mariette Blazer during the transition into early summer. Demand is stable at ~163 units/week (Periods 11-16 average). The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1170 units. My historical reconciliation shows that 598 of these units are permanently lost (P1: 207, P3: 304, P4: 87). Subtracting these lost units leaves an active pipeline of 572 units (Ordered P14, P15, P16). Given a target stock level for (L+1)=3 periods of demand at ~163 units/period, we need approximately 489 units. Since the active pipeline (572) already exceeds this and on-hand is 0, we do not need a large new order, but we must ensure the OR backend doesn't halt ordering entirely due to the 'ghost' 1170 units. By setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the lost 598 units, we counteract the system's overestimation of the pipeline. I will set mu_hat = (1+L) * (Forecast + Lost_Inventory/ (1+L)) = 3 * (163 + 598/3) \u2248 1087 to force the base stock calculation above the ghost inventory level while maintaining a realistic buffer.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. Recent demand (P14-P17) has stabilized at a lower post-peak level, averaging ~156 units per week (196, 143, 168, 118). Pipeline reconciliation: The In-transit count of 794 is comprised of 598 'ghost' units from confirmed lost orders (P1: 207, P3: 304, P4: 87) and 196 units ordered in P14. Since P14's order (196 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived (promised L=2), and P15-P16 orders arrived in P17, P14's order is now highly likely lost. This brings total 'ghost' pipeline to 794 (598 + 196). Because the OR engine subtracts the full 794 in-transit from the base stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these lost units and ensure a new order is triggered. With on-hand at 258 units and expected demand around 160, I need to replenish to cover the next 3 weeks (L+1). Target base stock = 3 weeks * 160 + safety stock \u2248 550. To bypass the ghost pipeline of 794, mu_hat is set to a value that, when subtracted by 794, still results in a positive order. Using mu_hat = 1350 roughly targets an order size to replenish for the upcoming period while accounting for the ~800 unit pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: P14 order (196 units) confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (4 periods since order, promised 2). Total confirmed lost stock in pipeline is now 794 units (P1, P3, P4, P14). Demand remains in the late Spring/Summer baseline of ~140-160 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Early Summer). Demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized at a late Spring/early Summer baseline of approximately 140-160 units (Period 13-18 mean is ~143.8). On-hand inventory is 119. The system's 'In-transit' count is 1175, but my tracking confirms that 794 of these units are lost (P1: 207, P3: 304, P4: 87, P14: 196). This leaves an active pipeline of 381 units (ordered P18). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1175 'ghost' pipeline from the base stock calculation, it will stop ordering unless I compensate. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover future demand, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target inventory position (base stock) for 3 periods (L+1) as 150 units/week * 3 = 450. To force the OR backend to place an order when it sees 1175 units in transit, I set mu_hat to approximately (Target Base Stock + Ghost Pipeline) = 450 + 794 = 1244. I set L to 2 (promised) and sigma_hat to a recent 5-period standard deviation to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/ghost inventory in pipeline reached 794 units (P1, P3, P4, P14). Continuing to use explicit mu_hat inflation is required to bypass the system's overestimation of 'In-transit' stock.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24. Demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized at a summer baseline, with the last four periods averaging ~127 units (range 118-139). The 'In-transit' count of 830 is highly misleading because it includes 794 units from confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed shipments (P1: 207, P3: 304, P4: 87, P14: 196). Consequently, the actual active pipeline is only 36 units (ordered P19). With 378 units currently on-hand, we have enough stock to cover roughly 3 periods of demand at the current rate of ~127 units/period. The OR engine calculates the order as (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Since pipeline_inventory (830) + on-hand (378) = 1208 far exceeds any reasonable base stock, the engine will order 0 unless we inflate mu_hat. To ensure the engine maintains a safety stock while accounting for the 794 'ghost' units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1180. This is calculated as: [Expected Base Stock (approx 130 * 3) + Ghost Pipeline (794)] \u2248 1184. This will trigger a small replenishment order to maintain recent demand coverage without over-ordering into a summer slowdown.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/1 (Summer). Demand has dropped significantly in Period 20 (73 units). The inventory situation is complex due to 'ghost' in-transit stock. Total In-transit is 859 units, but historical data shows orders from P1 (207), P3 (304), P4 (87), and P14 (196) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Total lost stock = 794 units. Active In-transit is currently P19 (36 units) and P20 (29 units) = 65 units. On-hand is 305. Total effective inventory (On-hand + Active Pipeline) = 370 units. The OR engine sees 305 + 859 = 1164 units. At a current demand baseline of ~120 units/week (average of P17-P20), the system will not order for many weeks unless forced. I will use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate demand, bypassing the 794 ghost units. Target Inventory (Base Stock) = (L+1) * Demand. With L=2, Target = 3 * 120 = 360. To force the engine to see a need for ~360 total units while it thinks it has 1164, I must set mu_hat to approximately 1164/3 + safety stock. However, since the current effective inventory (370) is already close to the target for 3 periods (360), no massive replenishment is needed this week, but I must ensure the system doesn't stop ordering entirely when effective stock drops. I'll set mu_hat based on the late Spring/Summer average (~120) with a slight buffer for lower demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand decline confirmed: Period 20 demand dropped to 73, pulling the 4-week average down to ~113 units. Total confirmed lost/ghost inventory remains at 794 units (P1, P3, P4, P14).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/7/8. Demand for the Mariette Blazer has clearly entered a Summer low, with the most recent two periods at 73 and 116 units respectively (Avg ~95). The system shows 859 units in-transit, but 794 of these units are confirmed lost/ghost shipments (P1: 207, P3: 304, P4: 87, P14: 196). This leaves an effective pipeline of only 65 units (from P19: 36 units and P20: 29 units), which are still within the promised lead time window. Current on-hand is 189 units. Since the OR engine subtracts the full (inflated) in-transit count of 859 from its base stock calculation, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' to force a replenishment order. A base stock target of roughly 350-400 (3 periods of ~120-130 demand) is appropriate to ensure availability. By setting mu_hat to 1200, the high in-transit count is bypassed, allowing the OR engine to maintain inventory against actual demand while ignoring the historical delivery failures.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand low confirmed: Late June/Early July demand is averaging ~95 units (P20-P21), significantly below the Spring baseline. Pipeline ghosting remains at 794 lost units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/15, representing mid-summer. Demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized at a lower summer level, averaging ~107 units over the last three periods (P20-P22). The pipeline inventory remains severely distorted by 794 units of confirmed lost/ghost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14). The backend 'In-transit' count of 1052 includes these 794 dead units, meaning only 258 units are actually 'live' in transit (P19: 36 units + P22: 222 units). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet current demand (~107 units/week) while ignoring the 794 ghost units, I must inflate 'mu_hat' using the 'explicit' method. To cover 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 3) at a service level targeting ~107 units/week, plus neutralizing the 794 ghost units, the base stock targets a value that bypasses the dead pipeline. Given current on-hand of 98 and a live pipeline of 258, total real inventory is 356. Target stock for 3 periods at 107/week is ~321 plus safety stock. To trigger proper ordering and maintain availability without overstocking on expensive holding costs ($1/unit), I will set mu_hat to cover current demand plus the volume of the ghost inventory.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/7/22, placing us mid-summer. Demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized at a summer low, averaging ~107 units over the last four periods (P20-P23: 73, 116, 120, 120). The 'In-transit' figure is 865 units, but we have confirmed 794 of these are 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P4, P14) that will never arrive. The actual active pipeline consists only of the P19 order (36 units) and P23 order (35 units), totaling 71 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 865 units of inventory and stopping all orders while we run out of stock, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target inventory level by the amount of the lost stock. The target base stock covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Forecasted demand is ~110 units/week. Baseline target = 3 * 110 = 330. Adjusted target = 330 + 794 (lost units) = 1124. This will trigger a small order to maintain the desired service level despite the false pipeline data. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the current lower volatility compared to the Spring peak.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/29. Demand for the Mariette Blazer has clearly entered a Summer low period, with Period 24 demand dropping to 63 units and the last 5 periods (P20-P24) averaging ~98 units. The 'In-transit' count shown by the system is 984 units, but historically, 794 of these are confirmed lost/ghost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14). The true active pipeline consists of orders from P19 (36 units - 6 periods old, likely lost), P23 (35 units), and P24 (119 units). Given that P19 is far beyond the 2-period lead time, it is now treated as lost, bringing total ghost inventory to 830 units. The effective pipeline is only 154 units (P23, P24). To bypass the system's overestimation of 'In-transit' stock (984 vs 154 real), I will set mu_hat explicitly to the current Summer demand average (~100 units/week) multiplied by (1+L) plus the ghost inventory offset (830 units). This ensures the OR backend triggers a replenishment order if the target base stock (calculated against 984) falls below required coverage.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/ghost inventory in pipeline reached 830 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19). Summer demand regime (mid-July/August) stabilized at a lower average of ~100 units/week.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/5. We are in the late Summer demand regime for the Mariette Blazer. Recent demand (P20-P25) has averaged ~98 units per week (73, 116, 120, 120, 63, 94). There is a significant discrepancy in pipeline monitoring: the 'In-transit' count is 1073, but history confirms that 830 units are lost or indefinitely delayed (P1: 207, P3: 304, P4: 87, P14: 196, P19: 36). The active pipeline consists of orders from P23 (35 units), P24 (119 units), and P25 (89 units), totaling 243 units. With on-hand inventory at 43, the true effective inventory (On-hand + Active In-transit) is 286 units. The OR engine, however, sees 43 + 1073 = 1116 units. To force the OR engine to order enough to cover the next 3 weeks (L+1) of demand (~300 units), I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that offsets the 830 'ghost' units. I will set mu_hat based on the current demand (100 * 3 = 300) plus the ghost units (830) to bypass the pipeline inflation. Sigma_hat is calculated for N=6 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/ghost inventory in pipeline reached 830 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19). Demand for late summer/August is stable at ~100 units/week.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-12. Demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized at a late-summer baseline, with recent demand being 94 (P25) and 146 (P26). The average demand over the last four periods (P23-P26) is approximately 106 units. The most critical issue remains the massive pipeline inflation caused by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P1 (207), P3 (304), P4 (87), P14 (196), and now likely P19 (36 units, 8 periods ago) are lost, totaling 830 'ghost' units in the system's In-transit count. Since the OR engine subtracts this full In-transit total (1124) from its base stock calculation, it will never order unless I explicitly inflate the mu_hat parameter to bypass this 'ghost' inventory. With an active pipeline of only approximately 294 units (from P24-P26) and 0 on-hand, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover the ghost stock plus the required (L+1) demand. I estimate required base stock as (3 periods * 110 avg demand) + 830 ghost units \u2248 1160. Using an explicit mu_hat of 1160 will force the OR engine to place a replenishment order despite the 1124 in-transit units, ensuring stock levels are maintained as we transition out of summer.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/ghost inventory in pipeline reached 830 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19). Demand for late summer/August is stable at ~100-110 units/week.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Demand in Period 27 spiked to 301, likely a pre-fall season uptick or back-to-school promotional effect, breaking the summer baseline of ~100. I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this potential shift while acknowledging the ghosting issue. Total confirmed lost/ghost inventory in the pipeline remains 830 units (P1: 207, P3: 304, P4: 87, P14: 196, P19: 36). The system's 'In-transit' of 1161 minus 830 'ghost' units leaves a true pipeline of 331 units (P24, P26, P27). With 0 on-hand, I must ensure the OR engine triggers an order. To bypass the 830 units of ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at (1+L)*350 (approx 1050) to ensure the base stock exceeds the inflated pipeline total.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in P27 (301 units), potentially signaling the start of a late-summer/pre-fall regime shift from the previous ~100/week baseline. Ghost inventory remains at 830 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is experiencing a late-summer/pre-fall demand surge. Demand jumped from a Summer baseline of ~100 to 301 (P27) and 251 (P28), signifying a regime shift. I am forecasting at a new average of ~275 units/week. The system 'In-transit' count of 1314 is highly inflated by 830 'ghost' units from lost/missing orders (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19). The valid pipeline contains only P24 (119 units), P26 (86), P27 (126), and P28 (153), totaling 484 units. To ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order despite the ghost inventory, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory = (1+2)*275 + 830 = 1655. This forces the base stock calculation to account for the units that will never arrive. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the high volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Fall demand regime shift: Average weekly demand increased from ~100 to ~275 (+175%) starting P27. Total confirmed lost/ghost inventory in pipeline remains 830 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Start of September (Period 30). Demand has experienced a significant regime shift upwards since Period 27 (averaging ~261 over the last three periods: 301, 251, 231), likely representing early Fall demand for the blazer. Pipeline check: On-hand is 0. Visible In-transit is 1881. Confirmed lost/ghost inventory: P1 (207), P3 (304), P4 (87), P14 (196), P19 (36) = 830 units. Total active pipeline is 1881 - 830 = 1051 units. These active orders (from P26 onwards) should begin arriving starting this period. The OR engine sees the 830 lost units as available stock, which would lead it to under-order or stop ordering entirely. To bypass this, I use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target base stock, effectively forcing the backend to ignore the ghost inventory and maintain a healthy replenishment flow for the current high-demand Fall regime (~261/week). I will target a base stock sufficient for (L+1) periods (3 * 261 = 783) plus a safety buffer, but inflated by the 830 lost units to ensure the 'order = base_stock - pipeline' logic produces a meaningful result.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Fall demand regime shift: Average weekly demand increased from ~100 to ~261 starting Period 27. Ghost inventory remains at 830 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a clear Fall demand regime shift that began around Period 27 (mid-August). Demand in the last four periods (P27-P30) was 301, 251, 231, and 357, averaging ~285 units/week. This represents nearly a 3x increase from the Summer average of ~100. Despite arriving units in P30, high demand exhausted all available stock, leaving On-hand at 0. Currently, the system shows an In-transit pipeline of 1602 units. However, based on extensive history, 830 units are 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost in periods P1, P3, P4, P14, and P19). The active pipeline likely consists of P24 (119 - potentially lost/overdue), P26 (86 - potentially lost/overdue), P29 (567), and the current Period 30 order which was 0. Excluding confirmed 'ghost' stock and highly suspicious overdue units (P24, P26), the credible pipeline is roughly 567 units (P29). To ensure the OR engine orders enough to meet the 285 units/week demand while bypassing the 830 'ghost' units, mu_hat must be set explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1)*Demand + Z*Sigma. With L=2 and Demand=285, (1+2)*285 = 855. Adding a safety buffer for volatility (Sigma ~50 * sqrt(3) ~ 87), the target level is ~942. To force the OR engine to order despite seeing 1602 In-transit units, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of ghost inventory: 855 (demand) + 830 (ghost) = 1685.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak Fall season (mid-September), with demand significantly higher (avg ~300) than the Summer baseline. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total system In-transit of 1846 is heavily inflated by 830 'ghost' units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P19). The real pipeline consists of P24 (119), P26 (86), P29 (567), and P31 (244), totaling 1016 units. To ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment order despite the inflated 'stable' pipeline, I will use an explicit mu_hat. I estimate the needed base stock for a 3-period window (L+1) at the current Fall demand rate (~310/week) plus a safety margin for high variance, then add the 830 ghost units to 'offset' the system's incorrect in-transit count. Calculation: (3 periods * 310) + 1.5 * (std ~50 * sqrt(3)) + 830 \u2248 930 + 130 + 830 = 1890. I set mu_hat to 1890 to navigate the ghost inventory and maintain service levels during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Fall peak demand confirmed: Periods 27-31 average demand is 294 units/week, a nearly 200% increase over the Summer average (~100). Ghost inventory remains at 830 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a high-demand Fall regime (Sept/Oct). Recent demand (P27-P32) averages ~302 units/week (301, 251, 231, 357, 328, 341). I am currently at 0 on-hand inventory. The system's 'In-transit' of 1796 units is severely inflated by ghost inventory (confirmed lost: P1, P3, P4, P14, P19 = 830 units) and the large P29 order (567 units) which is now 4 periods old (promised L=2) and likely delayed or lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1796 from its base stock calculation, it will refuse to order unless I provide an explicit mu_hat that compensates for this ~1400 unit gap (830 confirmed + 567 suspicious). Target stock for 3 periods (L+1) at 302/week is ~906 units; adding enough buffer to overcome the 1796 pipeline requires an explicit mu_hat near 2500. This ensures the OR logic [max(base_stock - pipeline, 0)] results in an order large enough to replenish the stock-out.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: P29 order (567 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived; added to suspicious pipeline inventory. Total likely lost/ghost units \u2248 1397 (830 previously confirmed + 567 highly probable). Fall demand stable and high at ~300 units/week.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 34 (Sep 30) indicates we are in the peak of the Fall demand regime. Demand spike in P33 reached 612 units, while the Fall average (P27-P33) is now ~346 units. The product is a Blazer, which aligns with Fall seasonality. Inventory is critically low (0 on-hand). The 'In-transit' figure of 2645 is heavily inflated by lost or delayed shipments. I have confirmed 830 units lost (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19) and high suspicion for P29 (567 units) which is now 5 periods old (promised 2). Total likely ghost inventory is 1397 units. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend despite the high in-transit count, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level. I will set mu_hat based on the current high demand average (~350) across 3 periods (L+1), then add the 1397 ghost units to 'offset' the pipeline overcount, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 2447. This ensures the engine sees a net requirement for new stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Fall peak demand confirmed with a sharp spike to 612 units in P33; regime average (P27-P33) is ~346 units/week. Ghost inventory in pipeline increased to 1397 units (830 previously confirmed + 567 from P29 which is now 5 periods old with no arrival).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a high-volume Fall regime, with recent demand average (P27-P34) at approximately 342 units/week and a significant spike of 612 units in P33. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system shows an In-transit balance of 2807 units. However, based on lead-time analysis, a massive portion of this pipeline is likely lost/ghosted inventory. Specifically: P1 (207), P3 (304), P4 (87), P14 (196), and now P29 (567) are all long past their expected arrivals (total 1361 units confirmed/probable lost). The P33 order of 849 units is only 2 periods old and is expected to arrive during P35 or P36. To force the OR backend to order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method, setting it to a level that accounts for the ghost inventory plus the required base stock for a 342-unit weekly demand across L+1 periods (targeting a base stock of ~1026 units + 1361 lost units = 2387). Since the backend order logic is min(base_stock - pipeline, cap), and pipeline is 2807, I must set the mu_hat high enough to trigger replenishment given the current zero on-hand status and high demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost inventory in pipeline remains at 1361 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P29). Fall demand regime remains strong, averaging 342 units/week since P27.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 is in the Fall peak season (average demand ~340 units/week since P27). Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline integrity remains the primary challenge: The system reports 'In-transit: 2613', but historical evidence suggests a significant portion is lost or delayed. Confirmed/likely lost orders include: P1 (207), P3 (304), P4 (87), P14 (196), P19 (36), and P29 (567). Total likely 'ghost' units = 1,397. This leaves an active pipeline of ~1,216. Notable active orders include P33 (849) and P34 (162). Because the backend subtracts the full 2,613 in-transit units from its base stock calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a replenishment order. The target base stock should cover (L+1) weeks of demand. With L=2 and average demand ~340, target is ~1,020. To bypass the 2,613 in-transit deduction and trigger an order to cover the current stockout and expected demand, I set mu_hat explicitly to 3,000. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to generate an order despite the 2,613 'ghost' units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline ghosting increased: P24 (119 units) and P26 (86 units) are now 12 and 10 periods old respectively with no arrival, and are considered lost. Total confirmed lost/ghost inventory in pipeline updated to 1,602 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P26, P29).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in the Fall peak demand regime for the Mariette Blazer. Recent demand (P27-P36) has averaged ~330 units/week. P36 demand was 282, showing stability at high levels. The system shows an In-transit pipeline of 2469 units. However, based on historical evidence, 1602 of these units are 'ghost' units (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P26, and P29). Subtracting these, the true active pipeline is 867 units (P34: 162 + P36: 705). With on-hand inventory at 567, total reliable inventory is 1434 units. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at the average of 330 units, we need approximately 990-1100 units. The active inventory (1434) currently covers this. However, since the OR backend uses the 'In-transit' figure of 2469, it will stop ordering because (567 + 2469) far exceeds any estimate. We must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the demand requirement and force the backend to place necessary orders. I will set mu_hat to a value that offsets the 1602 lost units while aiming for a 3-week target. Current target (3 * 330) + 1602 lost units = 2592. I'll use 2600 for mu_hat to ensure replenishment continues during this high-demand period.

The Mariette Blazer is in a high-demand Fall regime (Date: Oct 28). Current demand averages ~340 units/week since Period 27. The primary challenge is 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 1,602 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P26, P29) but remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (2469 total). Period 36 and 37 confirm that recent shipments (P33) are arriving with a lead time of 3 periods, while P34 (162 units) and P36 (705 units) are still in transit. To force the OR engine to order despite the inflated pipeline, I am using an explicit mu_hat. calculation: Target Inventory = (L+1) * Expected Demand. With L=3 and Demand=340, target is 1360. To bypass the 1,602 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to (Target + Ghost) = 2962. This ensures the backend places orders to cover real demand while accounting for the inventory that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline ghosting persists and is the dominant factor in parameter selection. Total confirmed/highly probable lost units: 1,602 (P1:207, P3:304, P4:87, P14:196, P19:36, P24:119, P26:86, P29:567). Lead time is currently averaging 3 periods for successful arrivals. Fall demand regime is stable at ~340 units/week.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a high-demand Fall regime, with recent demand (P27-P38) averaging approximately 340 units/week, though P38 saw 385 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The significant challenge remains pipeline 'ghosting': 1,602 units are confirmed or highly probable as lost (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P26, P29) but remain visible in the system's 'In-transit' count of 3,058. This leaves an 'active' pipeline of approximately 1,456 units (P34, P36, P38). To ensure the OR engine triggers an order despite the inflated total pipeline, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that covers the actual demand forecast plus the volume of ghost inventory. With a target stock level (L+1 periods) based on a forecast of 360 units/week and L=3, the desired base stock is ~1,440 units. Adding the 1,602 ghost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 3,042 to neutralize the system's overestimation of available stock.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline ghosting inventory update: P29 (567 units) remains missing after 10 periods and is now firmly classified as lost. Total confirmed/highly probable lost units: 1,602 (P1:207, P3:304, P4:87, P14:196, P19:36, P24:119, P26:86, P29:567). Lead time for successful arrivals is averaging 3 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a sustained Fall/Winter demand regime for the Mariette Blazer, with the last 13 periods (since P27) averaging approximately 334 units per week. Although demand in P39 dipped to 231, the recent multi-week trend remains high. Lead times for successful arrivals are averaging 3 periods (P32, P33, and P36 arrivals all had L=3). The primary challenge is the massive system-reported 'In-transit' inventory of 2632 units. Based on historical data, 1602 of these units are confirmed or highly probable lost/ghost shipments (P1: 207, P3: 304, P4: 87, P14: 196, P19: 36, P24: 119, P26: 86, P29: 567). This leaves an 'active' pipeline of approximately 1030 units (representing orders from P38 and P39). To bypass the OR engine's logic\u2014which would stop ordering because of the 1602 ghost units\u2014I will continue to set L to 3 and use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The explicit value is calculated to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1=4) minus the 'active' pipeline while accounting for the ghost inventory. Since current on-hand is 474 and active in-transit is ~1030, totaling ~1500 units, we are covered for nearly 4.5 weeks at current demand (~334/week). I will set mu_hat to 1200 (approx 300 * 4) to maintain a steady replenishment signal without over-ordering as we approach the end of the year.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18, approaching late November. Demand for the Mariette Blazer remains in the Fall regime, averaging ~300 units/week over the last 10 periods, though it has slightly softened from the October peak. The primary challenge remains 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. Total confirmed lost shipments are 1,602 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P26, P29). These units remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (2,632), meaning the active/real 'In-transit' is only 1,030 units (representing orders from P34 onwards). The on-hand inventory is 196. To ensure replenishment, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that essentially 'tricks' the backend into ordering by exceeding the sum of actual on-hand + inflated pipeline inventory. I will set mu_hat based on the (L+1) period demand (where L is effectively 3) plus the ghost inventory offset. Forecasted demand is ~300/week; for L=3, (3+1)*300 = 1200. Adding the ghost amount of 1,602 yields ~2802. I set 'mu_hat' to 2800 to trigger an order that fills the gap left by the lost units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4425.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for the Mariette Blazer in late November (P41) is stable within the Fall/Winter regime, averaging 292 units over the last 5 periods (P37-P41). The primary challenge remains the substantial 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (lost shipments). Confirmed/highly probable lost units include: P1(207), P3(304), P4(87), P14(196), P19(36), P24(119), P26(86), P29(567)\u2014totaling 1,602 units. Current system In-transit is 2,654; subtracting the 1,602 lost units leaves an active pipeline of 1,052 units (P38: 589, P34: 162, P41: 301). The arrival from P39 (279 units) in P41 confirm that newer orders are arriving, while P38 (589 units) is now 3 periods old and overdue based on the typical 2-period lead time. To ensure the OR backend triggers replenishment despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, mu_hat is set explicitly to cover target inventory (L+1 periods of demand) plus the volume of ghost units. Calculation: (3 + 1) * 292 + 1602 = 2770. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual drift to ~3 periods observed in recent successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Pipeline ghosting updated: Total confirmed/highly probable lost units remain 1,602. Recent successful arrivals (P36, P39) suggest an actual lead time of 2-3 periods. Fall/Winter demand regime is steady at ~290 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike (733 units), far exceeding the recent Fall/Winter average of ~290. This is likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (Date: 2019/11/25). Historically, demand for this SKU drops significantly after seasonal peaks (similar to the post-Spring drop). However, with only 5 periods left in the game and a stockout in Period 42, we must ensure enough inventory arrives to cover remaining demand while accounting for the massive 'ghost' pipeline. Total confirmed lost/ghost inventory in the pipeline is 1,602 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P26, P29). The system's 'In-transit' count of 2852 units includes these 1,602 lost units and the P38 (589), P41 (301), and P42 (198) orders. Effectively, the 'active' pipeline is only 1250 units (2852 - 1602). To trigger an order and overcome the ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I'll use a lead time of 3 (recent average for successful arrivals) and forecast a refined baseline of ~250 units/week, adjusting for the post-holiday taper. To force the OR engine to order despite the 1,602 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Units / (1+L). Calculation: (1+3)*250 + 1602 = 2602.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday spike confirmed in Period 42 (733 units). Ghost inventory remains at 1,602 units, necessitating highly inflated explicit mu_hat values to ensure replenishment through the end of the simulation.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is entering its final stretch (Period 44 of 47). Current on-hand is 132 units. The 'In-transit' count of 2990 is severely inflated by ghost/lost inventory. Based on history, at least 1,602 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P26, P29). Additionally, Period 38 (589 units) is now 6 periods old with no arrival, making it highly probable it is also lost. This brings the estimated ghost inventory to 2,191 units. The REAL active pipeline consists of P42 (198 units) and P43 (439 units), totaling 637 units. Post-Black Friday demand has normalized to 169 units in P43, but the Fall/Winter average remains around 280-300 units. To trigger a replenishment order in the face of the 2,990 'In-transit' units, an explicit mu_hat must be set to approximately (L+1) * Mean + Ghost Inventory. Using L=2 (confirmed recent lead time), we need to cover ~3 periods of demand (~900) plus the 2,191 ghost units, totaling ~3091. This will bypass the backend's capped policy constraints and allow for a final replenishment to cover the remaining 3 periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Ghost inventory update: P38 order (589 units) is now 6 periods old with no arrival and is classified as lost. Total confirmed/highly probable lost units in system pipeline: 2,191 (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P26, P29, P38).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47). The system shows an 'In-transit' count of 3401 units. However, I have identified that 2,191 of these units are 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P26, P29, P38). Additionally, orders from P41 (301 units, arrived P43) are correctly accounted for, but P42 (198 units) is currently 3 periods old and P43 (439 units) is 2 periods old. The true 'active' pipeline is approximately 1,210 units (P42, P43, P44), leaving 2,191 units as confirmed/highly probable losses. Demand remains strong in the Fall/Winter regime; excluding the Black Friday spike (733), the recent average (P40, P41, P43, P44) is approximately 256 units/week. Since the backend policy uses (min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)), I must set an 'explicit' mu_hat that is high enough to compensate for the 2,191 ghost units to trigger an order. I will set mu_hat to 1,200 (calculated as (1+L)*300 + ~300 buffer/ghost offset) which, when combined with the default sigma, should ensure we maintain stock for the final two periods without being blocked by the inflated pipeline count.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are approaching the final phase of the simulation (Period 47). Current demand for the Mariette Blazer remains stable in the Winter regime, with a recent 3-period average of ~244 units (excluding the Black Friday spike of 733 in P42). On-hand inventory is currently 379 units. The system's 'In-transit' count of 2764 is heavily distorted by ghost inventory. Total confirmed lost units are 2,191 (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P26, P29, P38). Period 44 (411 units) is now 2 periods old, within the standard lead time, so it is likely still active. Thus, the effective pipeline is 411 units (P44). Total inventory assets (on-hand 379 + effective pipeline 411) = 790 units. With one period remaining after this decision, this inventory is sufficient to cover expected demand (~250-300 units/period). However, the backend OR engine sees a pipeline of 2764, which is roughly 10x the actual requirement. To prevent the OR engine from halting orders if replenishment were needed, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the perceived total inventory need plus the ghost inventory (2191 lost + ~1000 buffer), although with only one period left, extreme ordering is not required as current stock will last.

We are at Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the final decision period. Historical patterns show that demand for this SKU typically cools down in late December/early January after a Fall/Winter peak. The immediate recent demand (P46) was 128 units, down from the post-Black Friday average. Ghost inventory remains a massive distortion: in-transit is reported at 3460 units, but 2191 units are long-overdue and confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P26, P29, P38). Adding the recently missing P44 (411 units, now 3 periods old with no arrival) brings the total ghost inventory to approximately 2602 units. The 'real' pipeline likely only includes the P46 order (696 units). To bypass the system's overcounting of lost units and fulfill demand for the upcoming periods, I must set 'mu_hat' using an explicit value that is high enough to trigger the base stock calculation, effectively treating the ghost inventory as non-existent. An explicit mu_hat of 3800 units (intended base stock) minus on-hand (251) and real pipeline (696) targets a safe coverage for the transition into 2020.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Total confirmed/highly probable lost units in system pipeline updated to approximately 2,602 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P24, P26, P29, P38, and now P44). Demand transition from Winter peak to Jan baseline observed (P46: 128 units).
