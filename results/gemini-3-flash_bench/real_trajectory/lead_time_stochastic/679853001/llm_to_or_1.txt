Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for SKU 679853001 (a knit sweater) shows a noticeable upward trend throughout January, starting at 69 and peaking at 133 before settling at 92 in the most recent week. This seasonality likely reflects late winter demand. Since this is the first decision period, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To capture the recent demand level while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) observed in January (range 69-133), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available historical samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the most relevant demand average and variability for this specific knitwear item as we transition through February.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a soft knit jumper, which typically sees demand during late winter/early spring. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) show a mean of 101.2 units (69, 89, 133, 126, 92). The demand in Period 1 (Feb 11) was 45 units, significantly lower than the January average, suggesting a potential post-winter drop-off. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the Period 1 order (147 units) is in-transit (promised lead time is 2). I will use the last 5 demand samples (including the recent dip in Period 1) to calculate mu_hat, as the most recent data points are more representative of the current trend than the high January peaks. L is set to default (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history (69, 89, 133, 126, 92, 45, 46) shows a recent decrease, with the last two periods averaging 45.5 units. The item is a 'Sirpa Basic TVP Jumper', which is likely a staple winter/early spring knitwear piece. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (147 units) were expected to arrive in P3 resolution but are not yet reflected in OH (as P3 is just starting). On-hand is currently 0, leading to stockouts in P1 and P2. To recover, I need to ensure the pipeline covers current demand trends. Given the recent drop from the initial samples (average ~102) to the current environment counts (~46), I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this lower but more recent demand regime (avg ~61 including the 92 from the sample) while keeping the lead time at default (2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 4 (2019/3/4), we are managing SKU 679853001 (a knit jumper). The product has faced significant stockouts with 0 on-hand inventory since Period 1, resulting in lost sales. Historical demand data (Jan-Feb) showed a mean of ~101.8, but observed demand in the game (Feb) has been lower (45, 46, 25). Promised lead time (L) is 2. The order from Period 1 (147 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4, but 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Pipeline inventory is currently 302 units (147 from P1 + 155 from P2). Moving into March, demand for knitwear typically stabilizes or shifts slightly as spring approaches. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (incorporating the most recent 5 samples: Jan 28, Feb 4, P1, P2, P3) to capture the cooling demand trend while maintaining enough base stock to recover from the stockout.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Sirpa Basic TVP' knitwear jumper. Promised lead time is 2 periods. History confirms this: the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2). The Period 1 order (147 units) is currently missing (sent 4 periods ago, expected 2 periods ago). This missing shipment explains why starting inventory was 0 until Period 4, leading to lost sales. Current inventory: On-hand=131, In-transit=182 (P1=147, P4=35). Since P1 is significantly overdue, I will assume it is lost and set mu_hat/sigma_hat to ensure we cover demand regardless of its arrival. Demand samples (69, 89, 133, 126, 92) show an average around 102. Recent demand (P3: 25, P4: 24) is significantly lower than initial samples, but we must be cautious as knitwear remains relevant in March. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture this recent dip while accounting for some variability, and 'default' for lead time since the one successful arrival matched the promise.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a basic knitwear item. Historical demand showed a peak in January (133, 126), followed by a decline in February and March (45, 46, 25, 24, 33). Average demand over the last 5 weeks is approximately 34.6 units. Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Current inventory is 98 (on-hand) + 182 (in-transit). The in-transit units likely include the Period 1 order (147 units) which is now overdue (it should have arrived in Period 3) and the Period 4 order (35 units). Since Period 1 is significantly overdue, it may be lost. However, the backend does not know this. To prevent over-ordering while accounting for the likely lost shipment, I will set L to the promised 2, and mu_hat based on the recent lower demand regime (last 5 periods). Since demand has stabilized at a lower level since early February, N=5 is appropriate for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand history shows an initial higher segment (avg 104 in Jan) followed by a shift starting in Feb (Period 1). The average demand from Period 1 to Period 6 is approximately 33.5 units per week. The promised lead time is 2. We have observed one arrival (ordered P2, arrived P4) confirming an actual lead time of 2. An order placed in Period 1 (147 units) is currently missing (it should have arrived in Period 3 conclude or Period 4 start). Since it hasn't arrived by Period 7, I will assume it is lost. Our current pipeline shows 182 units in transit (likely the P2, P4, and potentially recent small orders), but the P1 order is likely gone. Given on-hand is 70 and demand is stable around 30-35, we need to maintain a base stock for L+1 (3 periods). I will use recent demand (Periods 1-6) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the promised lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 1 (Feb onwards): mean dropped from ~100 to ~34 units/week. Order from Period 1 (147 units) is presumed lost as it is 4 periods past its expected arrival.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a soft-knit jumper. Historical demand analysis shows a significant drop around early February: Period 1-5 mean was ~101 (pre-game history), but demand from Period 1 to 7 has averaged only 30.5 units/week (45, 46, 25, 24, 33, 28, 13). Specifically, the last 4 periods average 24.5 units, suggesting a sustained low-demand regime as we move into spring. Regarding lead times: The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. However, the Period 1 order (147 units) is now 5 periods overdue and is definitely lost. The 'In-transit' count of 182 units likely includes this lost 147 units and the 35 units ordered in Period 4 (which should arrive this period). Pipeline inventory is therefore overstated by 147. To compensate for this in the OR backend (which subtracts full pipeline inventory), I am using 'explicit' L alongside 'recent_N' for demand to maintain a lean stock level suitable for the low-demand spring season, while ensuring the 147 lost units don't prevent necessary replacement ordering if the 35 units in Period 4 don't cover the baseline.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmation: Period 1 order (147 units) confirmed lost (5 periods past due). Pipeline inventory contains 147 phantom units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). Analysis of demand from Period 1 to Period 8 shows a stable regime averaging 30.6 units/week (range 13-46), a significant drop from the pre-game samples (~102 average). The order for 147 units from Period 1 is now 7 periods overdue (promised lead time 2) and is confirmed lost; however, it still inflates 'In-transit' counts to 182 (147 lost + 35 from Period 4). In-transit for Period 4 (35 units) is due to arrive in Period 9's arrival phase. Current on-hand is 32. Since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (182) from the base stock (calculated on mu_hat), it will erroneously see an oversupply and fail to order. To force an order and clear the stockout risk, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate demand for (L+1)=3 periods at approximately 90 units. I set 'mu_hat' to 242 to offset the 147 phantom units (95 required + 147 phantom = 242) so the OR backend places an order to bridge the gap. Sigma_hat is set based on recent demand volatility (std ~11 over 8 periods, scaled by sqrt(3)).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/15. The product is a knitwear sweater, which typically sees declining demand as spring progresses. Historical demand since Period 1 (excluding the jan-start samples) shows a mean of ~25.7 units per week. The pipeline inventory currently stands at 227 units, but 147 of these (ordered Period 1) are confirmed lost. Therefore, the 'real' pipeline inventory is 80 units (35 from P4, 45 from P9). On-hand is 20 units, bringing effective total inventory to 100. Expected demand for (L+1)=3 periods is ~77 units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' in its base-stock calculation. Since the 'phantom' units (147) are still in the backend's 'In-transit' count, the OR engine will see 20 (on-hand) + 227 (in-transit) = 247 units available, which is far above the desired base stock (~100-110 units), causing it to order 0. To force an order that covers the true deficit, I must use 'explicit' values. I set mu_hat based on (1+L) * recent mean (3 * 25.7 \u2248 77). To compensate for the 147 phantom units that the backend subtracts, I will inflate mu_hat by 147. Target mu_hat = 77 + 147 = 224. This ensures the backend recognizes the need for stock despite the dead inventory in the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a soft knit sweater, which traditionally sees a demand decrease as spring progresses into summer. Historical demand from the initial sample period (Jan) averaged ~108, but since Period 1 (Feb), the average has dropped to ~23.4 units/week. Crucially, the order for 147 units placed in Period 1 is confirmed lost (10 periods late), but it remains in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation. To correct for this 'phantom' inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate forward demand at ~25 units/week. For (L+1)=3 periods, mu_hat would normally be 75. However, I must add the 147 lost units back into the target base stock so the OR engine (which subtracts the 147 phantom units from the calculation) actually places an order. Target base stock = (forecast * (L+1)) + lost units = 25 * 3 + 147 = 222. Setting mu_hat to 222 ensures the OR engine places an order to cover the actual physical need. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current low volatility (std \u2248 13), resulting in ~22.5 for 3 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019-04-29). The product is a basic sweater, which is transitioning into the warmer spring/summer season, explaining the significant demand drop observed since Period 7. Demand in the last three periods has been 12, 3, and 5 (average ~6.7). The carry-over insights confirm that the Period 1 order (147 units) is lost, yet it remains in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation. To correct for this 'phantom' inventory while dealing with low seasonal demand, I am using the 'explicit' method. I set L=2 (promised) to ensure the OR engine targets a (2+1)=3 period window. I set mu_hat to 75 (25 units/period average * 3 periods) which is higher than the immediate last 3 weeks but lower than the long-term average, providing a buffer for potential volatility while acknowledging the seasonal decline. I set sigma_hat explicitly to 50 to maintain a respectable service level despite low recent volume. By setting mu_hat to 75 while on-hand is 57 and 'perceived' in-transit is 182 (total 239), the OR engine will likely order 0, which is correct given we are overstocked due to the seasonal drop and the phantom inventory issue.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: Demand has dropped significantly further to <10 units/week (avg 6.7 over last 3 weeks) coinciding with late Spring transition.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a sweater, which is entering a low-demand season (Spring/Summer). Demand has dropped significantly since mid-April (Period 10), averaging 6 units over the last three weeks (3, 5, 10). I have 47 units on hand and 182 units in transit. However, 147 of those in-transit units are from Period 1 and have been confirmed as lost (phantom inventory). This leaves a real pipeline of 35 units (ordered P4, lead time 2, expected to arrive). Since on-hand (47) + real pipeline (35) = 82 units, and weekly demand is ~6, I have enough stock for over 10 weeks. The OR backend needs to recognize the current low-demand regime and the fact that 147 units in the pipeline are 'phantom'. By setting L=2 (promised) and mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (N=3), the base stock will be set very low, preventing unnecessary orders while I burn through existing stock. I use 'explicit' for L to ensure the backend uses the promised lead time of 2 despite one anomaly of 1 period to calculate the (1+L) factor correctly.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a knitwear jumper, which is experiencing a significant seasonal decline as we enter mid-May (late Spring/early Summer). Current on-hand inventory is 37 units. In-transit inventory is listed as 182 units, which consists of a 147-unit order from Period 1 (confirmed lost in Carry-over Insights) and a 35-unit order from Period 4 (also likely lost, as it is now 10 periods past its order date). Because the 'lost' units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count, the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation (on-hand + in-transit) is artificially inflated (37 + 182 = 219), causing it to suggest an order of 0. However, actual usable inventory is only the 37 units on-hand. Since demand has stabilized at a low level (~7-10 units/week since Period 10), and the lead time is approximately 2 periods, the current 37 units will cover roughly 4-5 weeks of demand. No new order is needed yet, but I must adjust \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect the new low-demand regime. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Period 4 order (35 units) is now 10 periods past due and is presumed lost, joining the Period 1 order in phantom pipeline inventory. Total phantom inventory in-transit: 182 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (Knitwear Jumper) is in a low-demand regime as we move into late spring (May 20). Demand over the last 5 periods has been very low (3, 5, 10, 10, 1). The average demand over the last 5 weeks is 5.8 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 36 units, which is significantly more than 6 times the current weekly average, covering at least 6 weeks of demand. Additionally, we have identified 182 units in 'in-transit' inventory that are definitively lost (147 units from Period 1 and 35 units from Period 4). These phantom units prevent the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To fix this, I must set mu_hat to a value that accounts for these phantom units to force a correct base stock, but since current on-hand (36) is already very high relative to demand (mean ~6), no new orders are needed anyway. L is estimated as 'calculate' as lead times have been 1 and 2 periods (avg 1.5). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (post-Period 9 shift).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is late May (2019/5/27). The product is a soft-knit jumper, which is highly seasonal and entering its low-demand phase (Spring/Summer). Demand has dropped from an average of ~34 units/week (Feb-Mar) to ~6.3 units/week over the last 6 periods (Apr-May). On-hand inventory is 27 units, which covers more than 4 weeks of current demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 182 units consists entirely of 'phantom' inventory: the 147 units from Period 1 (now 15 periods overdue) and the 35 units from Period 4 (now 12 periods overdue). Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), these phantom units prevent the system from ordering. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values. I will set the target base stock (mu_hat) to be low, reflecting the seasonal decline, while acknowledging that with 27 units on hand and very low demand, no new orders are currently needed. Setting mu_hat to 30 (approx 4-5 weeks of demand at current rates) ensures the OR system doesn't over-order if it suddenly reconciles the ghost inventory, while the 182 phantom units in the backend's pipeline calculation will successfully keep the order at zero for now.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a soft knit jumper, which is entering its low season in late spring/early summer. Demand has been consistently low since Period 10 (April 15), averaging 6 units per week (periods 10-16: 3, 5, 10, 10, 1, 9, 4). Pipeline inventory currently shows 182 units (147 from P1 and 35 from P4), which are confirmed/presumed lost based on lead-time analysis. Because these 'phantom' units prevent the OR backend from ordering necessary stock (it subtracts pipeline from base stock), I must use 'explicit' methods to override the logic. I am setting mu_hat for the (L+1) period window to cover the next 3 periods of demand (3 * 6 = 18). However, since on-hand inventory (23) already exceeds this requirement and the item is seasonal (declining demand), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat low to prevent holding excess stock. I set L to 1 because the most recent successful delivery (Period 10) had an actual lead time of 1.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (679853001) is a 'Basic TVP' knit sweater, which is currently experiencing low summer demand as we move into mid-June. Current on-hand inventory is 22 units, while demand has averaged only 5.4 units/period over the last 8 periods (since P10). The In-transit count of 182 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Period 1 (147 units) and Period 4 (35 units). Because the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock (order = base_stock - pipeline), these 'phantom' units will prevent the system from ever placing a new order if demand rises. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values. I calculate the target base stock (S = (L+1)*mu + z*sigma*sqrt(L+1)) based on recent demand (mean=5.4, std=3.8). For L=2, S \u2248 (3*5.4) + 0.84*3.8*1.73 \u2248 16.2 + 5.5 \u2248 22. To bypass the 182 phantom units, I must set the 'explicit' mu_hat to approximately the phantom total plus the desired safety stock. 182 + 22 = 204. By setting mu_hat=204 and sigma_hat=1, the OR engine will calculate a base stock slightly above 204, and since pipeline inventory is 182, it may trigger small replenishment orders if on-hand inventory drops too low, while primarily relying on existing stock.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (a knit sweater) is currently in a very low demand regime (Summer), with demand averaging ~4.5 units per week over the last 8 periods (Periods 11-18). The current date is mid-June, reinforcing the seasonal irrelevance of this item. On-hand inventory is 21 units, which covers over 4 weeks of current demand. There is a critical accounting issue with 'In-transit' inventory: 182 units are confirmed phantom/lost (from Period 1 and Period 4 orders) but remain in the backend's calculation. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these phantom units, mu_hat must be set to an 'explicit' value that forces the base stock to exceed the total pipeline (phantom + on-hand). Given on-hand=21 and phantom=182, the total perceived pipeline is 203. However, with demand so low, we do not actually want new stock. Setting mu_hat to a very low explicit value will result in a zero order, which is correct given the high on-hand coverage for current demand. I will use recent_N for sigma based on the low-demand regime to keep settings consistent with the current environment.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a knitwear jumper, which is highly seasonal. As of late June (Period 20), demand has almost entirely ceased, reflecting the summer season. Over the last 10 periods (since Period 10), average demand has been ~4.4 units/week, and in the last 3 periods, it has dropped to ~0.33 units/week. We currently have 22 units on-hand, which is far more than enough to cover any remaining summer demand. There are 182 units listed 'In-transit' which are confirmed phantom inventory (lost orders from P1 and P4). To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary new orders due to these lost shipments, I will use 'explicit' parameters. I will set mu_hat to a very low level (reflecting (L+1) demand) and inflate L to 15 to account for the phantom inventory (182 units) within the pipeline logic (base_stock calculation), though the primary goal is to signal that no more inventory is needed. Given the high holding cost ($1) and low current demand, the goal is to carry zero additional stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '679853001' (Knitwear/Jumper) is currently in a very low demand regime (Average ~3.8 units/week since Period 14) as it is mid-summer (July 1st). The 'In-transit' quantity of 182 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Period 1 (147 units) and Period 4 (35 units). These 'phantom units' prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline inventory is high. To bypass this, I am setting \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) using an explicit value that accounts for the phantom inventory. Since the backend calculates order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory, and pipeline_inventory is 182, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order if needed. However, given current on-hand inventory (21) and very low demand (1 unit last period, 0 the period before), the current stock is sufficient for ~5 weeks. I will use a conservative N=7 for recent demand to reflect the summer lull while maintaining the explicit lead time of 2. I do not need to order yet, but the parameters must be set to ensure no excess ordering while the phantom inventory exists.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a knitwear jumper, which is currently in a deep off-season (July). Demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 0.75 units per week over the last 4 periods (P18-P21). On-hand inventory is 20 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover demand for the foreseeable summer weeks. The 'in-transit' inventory of 182 units consists entirely of 'phantom units' from Period 1 (147 units) and Period 4 (35 units) which are confirmed lost. The OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders. Since 182 phantom units + 20 on-hand = 202 pipeline units, and the base stock (target) for a demand of <1 unit/week is very low, the backend will naturally not place any new orders. To ensure the OR backend doesn't overreact to the low demand while carrying these phantom units, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 12-period regime (since Period 10), where demand dropped to its current floor (mean ~4.3). L remains calculate to use historical lead times (observed 1 and 2).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a knitwear jumper ('Sirpa Basic TVP'), which is highly seasonal. Demand has plummeted from an initial average of ~34 units (Feb-Apr) to a very low average of ~3 units over the last 12 weeks, consistent with the summer season (July 15). Demand over the last 5 weeks is even lower (avg 1.4). There are 182 units in 'In-transit' that are confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P1 and P4 which were lost), meaning the OR backend thinks we have more supply than we actually do. However, our current on-hand inventory of 16 units is sufficient to cover approximately 10 weeks of current demand levels. To prevent any further ordering by the OR system (which would be unwise given the low summer demand and high holding cost relative to profit), I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect the current low-demand regime and use recent_N for L to reflect the actual lead time of 1-2 periods observed in history.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a knitwear sweater (SKU 679853001), currently in the height of summer (Late July). Demand has stabilized at a very low level consistent with summer seasonality for knitwear. Over the last 10 periods (P14-P23), the average demand is approximately 3.8 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 9 units, which covers more than 2 weeks of current demand. Crucially, the 'In-transit' quantity of 182 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Period 1 (147 units) and Period 4 (35 units). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, these 182 phantom units will prevent the system from placing any new orders. To counteract this and ensure the system can actually order when on-hand inventory runs low, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom inventory plus a safety buffer for (L+1) periods. Calculation: Phantom In-transit (182) + Desired Base Stock (Targeting ~15 units to cover 3 weeks of demand at ~5 units/week). Total mu_hat = 200. This forces the OR engine to see a requirement higher than the 182 'phantom' units, allowing it to maintain a small physical buffer. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed lead times (averaging 1.33 periods) rather than the promised 2.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a soft-knit jumper, which is highly seasonal. We are currently in late July (Summer), where demand has hit its structural floor. Historical demand from February to April averaged ~34 units/week, then plummeted to <10 units/week from May onwards. The last 5 weeks average is 3.8 units/week. Lead times are currently either 1 or 2 periods (mean ~1.5). Crucially, the pipeline inventory of 196 units is almost entirely 'phantom'. This contains 147 units from P1 (lost) and 35 units from P4 (lost), totaling 182 phantom units. The remaining 14 units in transit are from P24 and are likely real. Because the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory (196 units) from the calculated base stock, it will not place orders unless the base stock exceeds 196. Since the current demand floor is extremely low (~4 units/week), a natural base stock would be around 12-16 units. To force the OR backend to place an order to cover the current stockout (On-hand: 2), I must set mu_hat explicitly high enough to offset the 182 phantom units. Target base stock = 182 (to zero out phantom) + 20 (safety stock for current low demand) = 202. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 202. sigma_hat is set to a low value reflecting the stable, low-volume summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Current demand floor for knitwear in July is ~4 units/week. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 182 units (P1: 147, P4: 35).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th. Demand for this knitwear jumper has surged in the last two weeks (7 units in Period 24 and 16 units in Period 25), indicating the start of the late-summer/pre-autumn seasonal transition. On-hand inventory is now 0. In-transit inventory stands at 205 units, but 182 of these are 'phantom' units from lost shipments in Period 1 (147 units) and Period 4 (35 units). The real pipeline inventory contains orders from Period 24 (14 units) and Period 25 (9 units), totaling 23 units. With the promised lead time of 2, these 23 units should arrive during Period 26 and 27. Given the demand acceleration, I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the upward trend and an explicit sigma_hat to account for higher volatility during this transition. Lead time remains 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P10, P19) fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand increase detected starting Period 24 (July/August transition): demand rose from a floor of ~4 units/week to 7 and then 16 units/week as Fall shopping begins.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a soft-knit jumper, which is highly sensitive to seasonality. Current status is August 12 (Period 27), marking the start of the Pre-Fall retail season. Demand has surged from a floor of ~4 units in July to 16 and 17 units in the last two weeks. I have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales for two consecutive weeks. The 'In-transit' figure of 205 units includes 182 phantom units from lost orders (Period 1: 147, Period 4: 35). The only real pipeline units are from Period 24 (14 units) and Period 25 (9 units), totaling 23 units. These orders (placed with a promised lead time of 2) should have arrived in Period 26 and Period 27 respectively, but have not yet appeared in 'conclude' messages. However, since the system treats 'in-transit' as real inventory, the OR backend will stop ordering if Pipeline (205) > Base Stock. To force an order to meet the surging Fall demand (forecasted at 20 units/week), I must set mu_hat explicitly high. A target base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods at 20 units/week plus safety stock (z*~0.84 for $4 profit/$1 holding) suggests a mu_hat > 250 to overcome the 205 phantom units and trigger a replenishing order. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 350 to ensure we capture the Fall ramp-up and bypass the frozen pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Fall demand surge confirmed. Weekly demand increased from 7 to 17 units over 3 weeks. Forecast adjusted to 20+ units/week for upcoming seasonal peak. Phantom inventory remains at 182 units, requiring explicit mu_hat elevation to trigger ordering.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jumper in a soft knit', currently entering its peak late-summer/early-fall demand season (Date: 2019/8/19). Demand has surged from 7 units in Period 24 to 59 units in Period 27. I expect this upward trend to continue or stabilize at this higher level given the seasonality of knitwear. Currently, On-hand is 0. In-transit is 322 units, but this includes 182 phantom units (Period 1: 147, Period 4: 35) confirmed as lost in previous insights. The real pipeline consists of the Period 24 order (14 units) and the Period 27 order (126 units), totaling 140 valid units. To ensure the OR backend ignores the 182 phantom units and places an order to meet the new demand regime (~60+ units/week), I set mu_hat explicitly. Lead time (L+1 = 3) requires coverage for 3 periods of demand. With demand at 59 and rising, I forecast a base-stock target of approximately 210 units (70 * 3). To force an order despite the phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 350, which targets a base stock exceeding both the phantom and valid pipeline (182 + 140 = 322).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Knitwear demand rose 350% in 4 weeks (16 to 59 units). Real pipeline is 140 units; In-transit display (322) contains 182 units of permanent phantom inventory from Periods 1 and 4.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '679853001' (Knitwear/Jumper) is in a rapid seasonal surge as it enters late August, with weekly demand jumping from ~7 to ~59 units over the last 5 periods. Current On-hand is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts (sold only 9 units of 59 demand in Period 27, and 0 of 58 in Period 28). The In-transit total of 388 units is misleading due to 182 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments in Period 1 (147 units) and Period 4 (35 units). Real pipeline inventory is actually 206 units (14 from P24, 126 from P27, and 66 from P28). Period 24's order (14 units) is now 4 periods old and likely lost or significantly delayed, as promised lead time is 2. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to overcome the phantom pipeline and force an order that accounts for the current demand spike (~60/week) across the 3-period horizon (L+1), adjusted for the 192 units actually expected in the next two weeks. To ensure the OR backend ignores the 182 phantom units, I set mu_hat at a level that creates a base stock higher than the total visible pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand has stabilized at a high seasonal level (~60 units/week). Total phantom inventory (confirmed lost) remains 182 units. Period 24 order (14 units) is now 4 periods past due and likely lost, bringing probable phantom inventory to 196 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '679853001' (Knitwear Jumper) is in its peak Fall seasonal demand phase (Sept 2nd). Recent demand has averaged ~55 units/week over the last three weeks (59, 58, 47). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 631 contains significant phantom inventory: 147 (P1), 35 (P4), and likely 14 (P24), totaling 196 units of lost shipments. The real pipeline consists of orders from P27 (126 units), P28 (66 units), and P29 (243 units), totaling 435 units. To ensure the backend OR engine orders enough to meet the 55-60 units/week demand while it believes 196 phantom units are available, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Following a base-stock logic where (1+L) periods of demand are needed (L=2, so 3 periods), we need ~180 units of real inventory. Since 196 units are 'ghosts', mu_hat is set to 380 to bypass the phantom stock and secure the upcoming inventory flow.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed total phantom inventory is 196 units (P1: 147, P4: 35, P24: 14). Seasonal peak demand stabilized at ~55 units/week. Mu_hat must be set above (Demand * (1+L)) + Phantom_Inventory to trigger orders.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '679853001' (Knitwear Jumper) is in its peak Fall demand season. Demand in Period 30 surged to 117 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization around 55-60 units. Total pipeline inventory is reported as 439 units, but this includes 196 units of confirmed phantom inventory (Period 1: 147, Period 4: 35, Period 24: 14) that will never arrive. The real pipeline is 243 units (ordered Period 29), which should arrive in Period 31 or 32. Current on-hand is 75 units. To ensure continuous stock during this peak and to account for the phantom inventory bias in the OR backend's order calculation, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I estimate a forward-looking weekly demand of 110 units. Therefore, mu_hat for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) must be at least (110 * 3) + 196 = 526 units to trigger necessary replenishment. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for higher volatility during the peak shopping season (observed demand jump from 47 to 117).

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand peak intensified. Weekly demand jumped from ~55 to 117. Forward forecast raised to 110 units/week. Phantom inventory remains 196 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Sirpa Basic TVP' (knitwear) has entered its peak fall season, surging to 139 units in Period 31. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory is 485, which includes 196 units of confirmed phantom inventory (P1: 147, P4: 35, P24: 14) that will never arrive. The real pipeline is 289 units (P29: 243, P31: 46). Given the lead time L=2, we must cover Periods 32, 33, and 34. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite the 196 phantom units, I am setting an explicit mu_hat. Total target inventory (Base Stock) = (Expected Demand * (1 + L)) + Phantom Inventory. With actual demand reaching ~140, I forecast 140 per period. Target = (140 * 3) + 196 = 616 units. Setting mu_hat to 616 to force the OR backend (which subtracts the full 485 in-transit) to target a real stock level of ~420 units (3 weeks of demand).

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand peak confirmed at ~140 units/week for September peak. Total phantom inventory confirmed at 196 units (P1, P4, P24).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a knitwear item (jumper) currently in its peak Fall season (late September). Demand has surged and stabilized at a high level, with the last two periods showing demand of 139 and 123 units (average ~131). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' of 631 units includes 196 units of confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from Periods 1, 4, and 24). The real pipeline inventory is 435 units (631 - 196). Lead times have been somewhat volatile (1 to 3 periods), so I will use a 2-period average (L=calculate). To ensure the OR engine triggers an order despite the phantom inventory inflating the pipeline, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the 196 phantom units. Forecasted demand is ~135 units/week. Target mu_hat = (135 * 3) + 196 = 601. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility seen during this peak (~20 units/week base std, scaled by sqrt(1+L)).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for knitwear has reached a massive peak, jumping from ~130 units to 264 units in Period 33, likely due to a major promotional event or the onset of peak Fall/Winter shopping in late September. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory is 631 units, which includes 196 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P1, P4, and P24) and 435 units of real inventory (P29: 243, P32: 192). The P29 order (243 units) is now 5 periods old and severely overdue (promised LT=2), while the P32 order (192 units) is still within a reasonable window. To trigger an order despite the 631 units in pipeline, mu_hat must be set above the (Forecast * (1+L)) + Phantom + Real_Pipeline threshold. With a forecast of 260 units/week and L=2, the required coverage is 780 units. I will set mu_hat to 1350 via the explicit method to account for the actual demand (780) plus the 196 units of phantom inventory and the 435 units of potentially stalled real pipeline, ensuring the OR engine places a replenishment order for the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Major seasonal demand spike confirmed at 264 units/week (Sept 30). Total phantom inventory remains 196 units. Logistics delay observed: Period 29 order (243 units) is 3 periods overdue.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 is a knitwear item experiencing a massive seasonal peak throughout September and October. Demand has jumped from ~60 to over 250 units/week in the last two periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Historical shipments from Periods 1 (147), 4 (35), and 24 (14) are confirmed lost, totaling 196 phatom units in the 1176 'In-transit' figure. Furthermore, the Period 29 order (243 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since order), but given recent arrivals (P27/P28/P31 arrived), it is more likely delayed or lost than functional pipeline. Excluding the 196 known phantom units and the suspect 243 units, there are 737 units in the reliable pipeline (Orders from P32 and P34). To ensure the OR backend places a necessary order to cover the current 250+ units/week demand (250 * 3 = 750 target base stock), mu_hat must be set explicitly high to overcome the 1176 units of reported in-transit inventory. Setting mu_hat to 1200 will force an order to maintain service levels during this critical peak, accounting for both the phantom inventory and the high seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Logistics instability confirmed. Period 29 order (243 units) is 5 periods past order date and likely lost or heavily delayed, joining the 196 units of confirmed phantom inventory (P1, P4, P24). Total probable phantom inventory is 439 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-October seasonal peak for knitwear. Recent demand remains high (264, 258, 228 over the last three periods), though it shows a slight tapering from the absolute peak in late September. Inventory management is severely complicated by logistics instability. A significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory (1117 units) is likely phantom. Confirmed phantom inventory includes P1 (147), P4 (35), and P24 (14), totaling 196 units. Furthermore, the P29 order (243 units) is now 7 periods old and significantly past the promised lead time of 2, making it highly probable to be lost or indefinitely delayed. This brings the probable phantom inventory to 439 units. Effective pipeline: 1117 - 439 = 678 units. To ensure the backend places an order to meet future demand despite the presence of 439 phantom units in its pipeline calculation, mu_hat must be set to cover (Expected Demand * (1+L)) + Phantom Inventory. Forecasting forward demand at 220 units/week with L=2, required mu_hat = (220 * 3) + 439 = 1099. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to reflect high volatility during the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Probable phantom inventory increased to 439 units. The P29 order (243 units) is 7 periods past due and likely lost, joining P1 (147), P4 (35), and P24 (14). Actual lead times are volatile (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (Knitwear) is in a high-demand Fall/Winter peak season. Recent demand has stabilized at a high level (Period 34: 258, Period 35: 228, Period 36: 195), averaging 227 over the last 3 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total 'In-transit' shown is 1093 units, but a large portion of this is 'phantom inventory' from lost orders. Specifically: P1 (147), P4 (35), P24 (14), and now officially P29 (243) are considered lost as they are significantly past lead time (P29 is now 8 periods old). This brings total confirmed phantom units to 439. Additionally, the P34 order (545 units) is currently in transit and expected in Period 37 or 38 based on recent volatile lead times (1-3 periods). To trigger necessary replenishment despite the phantom inventory inflating the 'pipeline', I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the backend's (base_stock - pipeline) calculation. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, targeting a service level for the peak demand (~220 units/week) plus the phantom offset (439 units) across the (L+1) horizon. Current demand avg (227) * (L+1=3) = 681. Adding 439 phantom units = 1120. I will set mu_hat to 1120 to ensure the policy attempts to maintain stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed phantom inventory stands at 439 units (P1: 147, P4: 35, P24: 14, P29: 243) which will never arrive. The seasonal demand peak has slightly softened from >250 to ~200 units/week but remains high for the October knitwear season.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019, which is the peak/late-peak season for knitwear. Demand has stabilized at a high level, averaging 216 units over the last 5 weeks. A critical factor remains the substantial phantom inventory in-transit that will never arrive: 439 units (P1, P4, P24, and now confirmed P29). Total In-Transit is 1204 units, but true inventory in the pipeline is only 765 units (1204 minus 439). Lead times are volatile, averaging approximately 2 periods. To trigger orders in the OR engine, mu_hat must be set to account for both the expected lead-time demand and the 'dead' weight of the phantom inventory in the backend's base-stock calculation. Average demand is ~215/week. Expected inventory needed for L+1 (3 periods) is ~645 units. Adding the 439 phantom units, we need a mu_hat around 1084 to ensure the OR logic places orders to cover real upcoming demand. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the backend's miscalculation caused by the phantom shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Confirmed total phantom inventory in-transit is 439 units (P1: 147, P4: 35, P24: 14, P29: 243). These units are officially lost and will never conclude. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (Knitwear Jumper) is in its peak seasonal demand period (November), with demand consistently ranging between 200-260 units per week over the last month. Current demand is stabilized around 220-240. The 'In-transit' figure (1093) is heavily distorted by 439 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P1, P4, P24, and P29). Subtracting this phantom inventory (1093 - 439) leaves an effective pipeline of 654 units, which corresponds to the orders placed in Periods 34 (545 units), 36 (109 units), and the now-delivered P37. The order from P34 is currently 5 periods old and is significantly overdue (L=2 promised), representing a logistics risk. Given the high demand and the risk of the P34 order being lost, mu_hat is set using an explicit value of 1100. This calculation is derived from (Expected Demand 220 * (1+L=3)) + 439 Phantom units = 1099. Setting mu_hat to 1100 ensures the OR backend recognizes the 439 phantom units as 'already filled' and targets a pipeline + on-hand balance that covers actual demand for the inferred lead time. L is set to 3 to account for recent logistics volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for this knitwear SKU remains high as we move through the fourth quarter peak, though it has slightly softened from the September highs (~260) to a more stable late-fall level (avg ~200 over the last 4 periods). Total 'In-transit' shown is 1042, but 439 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P1: 147, P4: 35, P24: 14, P29: 243). The real pipeline inventory is therefore 603 units (1042 - 439). Specifically, the real pipeline includes orders from Period 34 (545 units), Period 39 (58 units), and the current Period 40 decision. Lead times continue to be volatile (1-3 periods). To ensure the OR backend triggers an order despite the phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover (1+L) periods of demand AND offset the 439 phantom units. Forecasted demand is ~180 units/week. With L=2, (1+L)*180 = 540. To bypass the 439 phantom units, mu_hat needs to be approximately 540 + 439 = 979. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat at 980 and sigma_hat at 150 to maintain a high service level during this seasonal volume.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed phantom inventory remains 439 units (P1, P4, P24, P29). Actual pipeline inventory is In-transit (1042) minus 439 = 603 units. Demand for November has stabilized at approximately 180-200 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18), we are in the high-demand late Fall season for knitwear. Recent demand has stabilized between 170-240 units/week. The current inventory situation is critical: On-hand is 0, and the In-transit figure of 1107 contains 439 units of 'phantom' inventory (P1, P4, P24, P29) that are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The real pipeline is 668 units (1107 - 439). Lead times are volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I will use a conservative L=2 (promised) but monitor for arrival delays. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the large (but partially phantom) pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover the actual average demand (~200) across (L+1) periods, plus the phantom inventory bias. Calculation: Base Stock should be approx. (200 * 3) + 439 = 1039. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 1050 with moderate variance (sigma_hat=150) to ensure a robust safety stock and trigger an order to cover current stockouts.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679853001 (Knit Jumper) is in its peak seasonal demand period (late November). Recent demand oscillates between 165 and 237 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 1119 units, but 439 of these are confirmed phantom units (lost orders from P1, P4, P24, and P29) that will never arrive. The actual pipeline is 680 units (1119 - 439). These real units were ordered in P34 (545), P40 (65), and P41 (70). The large P34 order (545 units) is now 8 periods old; given that the recent lead time has been 1\u20133 periods, this order is significantly delayed and may be lost, but I will wait another period before declaring it 'phantom'. The backend OR uses 'In-transit' (1119) to calculate the order. To force an order despite the phantom inventory, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed (Pipeline + On-Hand). Current weekly demand is ~180. With L=2, base stock needs to be ~540. However, because the backend sees 1119 in transit, it will not order unless mu_hat is set very high. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to account for the phantom inventory: (Target Service Level units) + (Phantom Units) = (180 * 3) + 439 \u2248 979. I will set mu_hat to 1000 to maintain a small steady flow and sigma_hat explicitly to handle the high November volatility.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive unexpected demand spike to 661 units, likely a Black Friday/Cyber Monday event (Nov 25, 2019). This follows a stable November trend of ~180 units/week. While demand will likely retraced from the 661 peak, we enter the December holiday season where demand for knitwear remains high. The 'In-transit' figure of 1127 units includes 439 units of confirmed phantom inventory (P1, P4, P24, P29) that will never arrive. The actual pipeline is 688 units. To trigger ordering in the face of this 439-unit phantom drag, mu_hat must be set to cover (Expected Demand * (1+L)) + Phantom Inventory. With L=2, and expected demand returning to a high December baseline of ~200 units, the required mu_hat is (200 * 3) + 439 = 1039. Setting mu_hat to 1050 and maintaining high sigma to handle volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Record peak demand of 661 units observed (Black Friday). Phantom inventory remains 439 units. Expected baseline for Dec remains ~200 units/week.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows a major spike during Black Friday (661 units in Period 42) which has since returned to a December baseline (~118 units in Period 43). The confirmed phantom inventory remains 439 units (P1, P4, P24, P29). Subtracting this from the observed in-transit (1126) gives an actual pipeline of 687 units. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2. To ensure orders are triggered despite the phantom inventory inflating the backend's pipeline calculation, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the phantom inventory. Forecasted demand for the remainder of December is ~150 units/period. Therefore, target mu_hat = (150 * (2+1)) + 439 = 889. Sigma_hat is set to reflect high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday demand has stabilized at ~150 units/week. Actual pipeline inventory is In-transit minus 439 phantom units. Current actual pipeline is 687 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019, following the peak shopping season (Black Friday). Demand has stabilized post-peak at approximately 100-120 units per week. There is a critical inventory discrepancy: the 'In-transit' figure of 1126 units contains 439 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from Periods 1, 4, 24, and 29 that are confirmed lost or severely overdue and unlikely to arrive). The actual viable pipeline is 1126 - 439 = 687 units. These viable units include the large orders from Period 34 (545 units) and Period 43 (134 units). Since the viable pipeline (687) is already sufficient to cover roughly 4-5 weeks of current demand (~100-120/week), and the lead time is approximately 2-3 periods, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from triggering orders based on the phantom-inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To ensure the backend doesn't order, mu_hat + z*sigma_hat must be less than (On-hand + In-transit). By setting mu_hat to cover 3 periods of demand (1+L where L=2) at the current rate (~120 units/week) plus accounting for the phantom inventory, I am guiding the OR engine to wait for the arrival of the P34 and P43 orders. With On-hand at 0, mu_hat is set to 800 to ensure safety while acknowledging the phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand has settled near 100-110 units/week. Confirmed phantom inventory remains 439 units (P1: 147, P4: 35, P24: 14, P29: 243). The P34 order (545 units) is now 11 periods old and heavily delayed, but remains in the viable pipeline for now; its arrival is critical for late Dec/Jan stock.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has stabilized post-Black Friday at approximately 100-125 units per week (Period 43-45 avg: 114). The product is a knitwear jumper, entering the peak winter season (late December). We must account for the 439 units of 'phantom' inventory (confirmed lost from Periods 1, 4, 24, and 29) that will never arrive but still count against the OR engine's pipeline calculations. Additionally, the order from Period 34 (545 units) is now extremely overdue (12 periods) and should tentatively be considered lost or unreliable, bringing the likely phantom total to 984 units. With In-transit at 1000 units, the functional pipeline is effectively near zero. To force the OR backend to place an order to cover upcoming January demand despite the high 'In-transit' figure, mu_hat is set explicitly to (Demand * (1+L)) + Phantom Inventory. Using a forecast of 115 units/week and L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (115 * 3) + 439 = 784. I am being conservative with the P34 order for one more week before officially adding it to the phantom count in carry_over_insights.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Demand stabilized at ~115 units/week post-peak. Functional pipeline inventory remains critical due to 439 units of confirmed lost inventory. Order from Period 34 (545 units) remains outstanding at 12 periods past order date; its non-arrival is the primary driver of current stockouts.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 47 (Dec 30), post-Holiday period for knitwear. Demand has stabilized between 100-135 units/week. 

Inventory/Pipeline Check: On-hand is 0. In-transit shows 1116 units. However, we have a massive volume of 'phantom' inventory that will likely never arrive: P1 (147), P4 (35), P24 (14), P29 (243), and potentially P34 (545). The P34 order (545 units) is now 13 periods overdue, making its arrival highly improbable. Total confirmed/highly probable phantom inventory = 147+35+14+243+545 = 984 units. 
Functional Pipeline = In-transit (1116) - Phantom (984) = 132 units. This 132 units represents the order from Period 46 (116) and Period 45 (16). 

Strategy: To trigger an order from the backend despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, mu_hat must be set to exceed (Functional Pipeline + Expected Demand over L+1). With demand at ~125 and L=2, expected demand is ~375. Required mu_hat = 375 + 984 (phantom) = 1359. Setting mu_hat to 1400 ensures the OR engine sees a deficit and places an order to cover the current 125/week demand while neutralizing the phantom stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: The Period 34 order (545 units) is now 13 periods past due and is added to the confirmed phantom inventory list (P1, P4, P24, P29). Total phantom inventory is now 984 units. Mu_hat must be adjusted upward by this amount to bypass backend capping based on fake pipeline data.
