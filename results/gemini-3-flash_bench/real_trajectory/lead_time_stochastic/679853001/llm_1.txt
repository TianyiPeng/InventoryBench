  "rationale": "Product 679853001 is a 'Sirpa Basic TVP' sweater from the 'Divided' collection. In early February (Period 1, 2019-02-11), it is still within the winter knitwear season, although moving towards early spring. Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a peak in late January (133, 126) followed by a dip in the most recent week (92 on Feb 4). The average demand over the last 5 weeks is approx 102 units/week. Promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive during P3 and be available for P4. To calculate the target inventory level, I need to cover (Lead Time + 1) = 3 periods of demand (P1, P2, P3). Given the current demand trend (approx 100/week) and the transition out of deep winter, I will forecast a slightly conservative 100 units/period to avoid excess holding costs ($1.0/unit). Total needed for 3 periods = 300 units. Current On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Therefore, I will order 300 units to establish the pipeline and meet demand.",

In February (late winter), demand for sweaters is typically stable or slightly declining as seasonality shifts toward spring, but still significant. Historical demand data shows a range between 69 and 133 units weekly throughout January, with the most recent data point (Feb 4) at 92 and Period 1 demand at 45. The Period 1 demand (45) suggests a potential drop compared to January averages, but I will target a mean of ~80 to be safe. Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 300 units placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Inventory Position: I have 0 on-hand and 300 in-transit. Based on a lead time of 2, I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 = 3 periods). Estimated demand for 3 periods is ~240-300 units.

Current observations in Period 1 and 2 (Feb 11 and Feb 18) show demand has stabilized significantly lower, around 45-46 units per week. This suggests the peak 'sweater season' transition is fading, or this specific basic item has a baseline demand near 50 units. \n\nInventory Situation: On-hand is 0. Sales have been lost (0 sold) because no inventory has arrived. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the game logic: \n- Period 1 order (300 units) should arrive during Period 1+2 = Period 3 (current period).\n- Period 2 order (50 units) should arrive during Period 2+2 = Period 4.\n\nSince Period 1's order arrives *during* Period 3, I expect 300 units to be available to satisfy Period 3's demand.

Order P1 (300 units) was placed on Feb 11. Following the game sequence, it should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start state. However, 'arrived=0' was reported in the P3 conclusion. This suggests either a lead time of 3+ periods or a lost shipment. Inventory Appraisal: On-hand is 0, causing 100% stockouts for 3 weeks. In-transit is 350. Order Logic: I am currently expecting 300 units (from P1) and 50 units (from P2). Given the significant drop in demand (recent avg ~38) and the large pipeline (350 units), I have enough stock in flight to cover over 9 weeks of current demand once it arrives.

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Sirpa Basic TVP' knitwear jumper. In early 2019 (January), historical demand was high (avg ~102/week), likely due to winter seasonal demand. Current demand (Feb-early March) has dropped significantly (avg ~35/week) as the season transition begins. Analysis of lead time: The Period 2 order arrived exactly 2 periods later (in Period 4), confirming the promised lead time of 2. However, the Period 1 order (300 units) has not arrived after 4 periods (promised 2), suggesting it is likely lost. Current stock is 26 units with 250 units in transit (assuming 300 from P1 are lost and 50 from P2 arrived, but history shows 300 remaining in-transit, implying the system still tracks the lost P1 units). If the 300 units from P1 are lost, I have 0 valid units coming in. If they are just delayed, I am overstocked. Given the risk of stocking out if P1 is lost and the decline in demand, I will order to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at the current rate (~35-40 units/period). Total needed = ~120.

As we move into mid-March (Period 6: 2019/03/18), demand for knitwear is naturally declining in the spring transition. Historical demand started at 69-133 in Jan/early Feb but has settled into a lower regime of ~25-45 in late Feb/March. Demand Analysis: The last three periods of demand (P3: 25, P4: 24, P5: 33) confirm a lower demand regime averaging ~27 units/week. Lead Time & Pipeline: Order P1 (300 units) is confirmed lost (missing 3 periods past promised lead time). Order P2 (50 units) arrived in P4 (lead time = 2). Order P5 (100 units) is in-transit and expected to arrive in P7 (lead time = 2). Current Inventory Position: On-hand = 0. In-transit = 100 (from P5) + 300 (lost, but still in the system count). Effectively, the active pipeline is only 100 units arriving in Period 7. Strategy: Since I have 0 on-hand inventory for Period 6 and no arrivals until Period 7, I will experience a stockout this period. I need to cover demand for Period 7 and 8 (lead time + 1). Forecast demand is ~30 units/period. Total requirement for P7-P8 exposure = 60 units. I have 100 units arriving in P7.

Total reliable stock = 72 (on-hand) + 50 (in-transit) = 122 units. e) With demand ~28/week, 122 units cover ~4.3 periods. Since L=2, I need to cover Period 7, 8, and 9. Expected demand for 3 periods = 28 * 3 = 84. My current pipeline (122) exceeds this. However, holding cost is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit, so overstocking is moderately expensive.

  "rationale": "The SKU is a knitwear item (jumper/sweater). Period 42 showed a massive demand spike (661 units), which was likely the Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak. In the subsequent period (P43), demand regressed sharply to 118 units. This indicates that while we are in a high-season regime, the extreme outlier has passed. Historically, December demand for knitwear remains strong but usually stabilizes below the late November promotional peak. Lead times are volatile (1-3 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 632 units. In-transit arrivals expected soon are from P42 (150 units) and P43 (250 units), totaling 400 'reliable' units after accounting for the loss of the P34 shipment (450 units) - total pipeline is 400 + 632 = 1032 units. Given a stabilized demand expectation of ~150-200 units/week through the holiday season, this covers approximately 5-6 weeks of demand. We are close to the end of the simulation (P47); therefore, we should avoid over-ordering to minimize high holding costs ($1/unit). A smaller order of 100 units maintains a safety buffer without creating excessive ending inventory.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-Black Friday demand regression: After the P42 spike (661 units), demand fell to 118 units (P43), suggesting a return to a standard winter baseline rather than a sustained 600+ level. Lead time remains volatile but averages 2-3 periods.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a knitwear item (soft knit jumper), currently in its peak winter demand season (mid-December). Demand history shows a massive spike in Period 42 (661 units), likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, followed by a regression to more standard winter levels (~100-120 units) in Periods 43 and 44. Since we are approaching the end of the calendar year, I expect demand to remain steady or slightly increase before the post-holiday dip in January. On-hand inventory is healthy at 531 units. In-transit arrivals (excluding lost shipments) include orders from P38 (20 units, likely lost), P42 (150 units), P43 (250 units), and P44 (100 units), totaling 500 units in the reliable pipeline. Given the lead time volatility (1-3 periods), I want to maintain enough stock to cover roughly 3 weeks of demand. Current stock (531) + reliable pipeline (500) = 1,031 units. Projected demand for the next 3 weeks at a conservative average of 150/week is 450 units. While well-stocked, I will place a small maintenance order of 100 units to ensure inventory doesn't deplete too rapidly if lead times shift toward the 3rd period or if there's a late-December surge.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-peak holiday demand (Dec) has stabilized at ~100-120 units/week, significantly lower than the Black Friday spike of 661 but consistent with winter norms. Reliable pipeline is 500 units (Orders from P42, P43, P44).",

  "rationale": "The product is a knitwear item (jumper), which is highly seasonal. We are currently in late December (Period 46). Demand peaked during the Black Friday week (P42: 661 units) and has since stabilized in a range of 100-125 units per week (P43: 118, P44: 101, P45: 124). Looking at historical data from similar periods last year (Jan/Feb 2019), demand was approximately 70-130 units before dropping off in March. Therefore, I expect demand to remain between 100-130 units for the next few weeks. Currently, On-hand inventory is high at 807 units. The active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (100 units) and P45 (100 units), totaling 200 units. A 300-unit order from P1 and a 450-unit order from P34 are confirmed lost. Total reliable inventory (On-hand 807 + In-transit 200) is 1,007 units. At an average demand of 115 units/week, this covers approximately 8.7 weeks of demand. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00) and the nearing end of the peak winter season, carrying excess stock is risky. I will order 0 units to allow existing inventory to deplete towards more efficient levels.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-holiday winter demand (Dec-Jan) is stable at ~100-125 units/week. Lead times remain variable between 2-3 periods. Significant on-hand inventory (807 units) suggests a pause in ordering to avoid excessive holding costs as the season progresses toward the spring decline.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a knitwear item (jumper), which is highly seasonal. We are currently at Period 47 (2019/12/30), entering the post-holiday winter phase. Historical data from the beginning of the game (Feb 2019) shows demand was initially around 90 units before dropping significantly as spring approached. Recent demand (P43-P46) has stabilized between 101 and 135 units, averaging approximately 120 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high at 672 units. The in-transit pipeline is 1180 units, but this includes several likely lost shipments (P1: 300, P26: 60, P29: 150, P34: 450). The valid pipeline consists of orders from P38 (20), P44 (100), and P45 (100), totaling 220 units. Total reliable stock (on-hand + valid in-transit) is 892 units. At a forecast of ~120 units/week, this covers approximately 7.4 weeks of demand. Given that we expect a seasonal decline in knitwear demand starting in February (based on P1-P5 history), maintaining excessive stock now would lead to high holding costs. No new order is needed this period as the current inventory position is more than sufficient to cover the 2-3 period lead time and the remaining peak winter demand.",
