In Period 1, I ordered 113 units; they are currently 'In-transit' and expected to arrive in Period 3 (read at Period 4). My current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order hasn't arrived yet.\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Recent historical demand for this SKU (Ankle-length skinny jeans) was: 36, 54, 62, 60, 113. However, Period 1 demand was 148, which is a significant jump compared to the provided history. This suggests a strong seasonal or trend-based increase in February, likely coinciding with early spring fashion shopping.\n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: I have 0 units on-hand and 113 in-transit. Total pipeline inventory is 113. \n4. **OR Baseline Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 149 units. The OR agent calculates base stock based on the average of all history (36, 54, 62, 60, 113, 148), which is roughly 79 units/period. With a lead time of 2, (L+1) demand is roughly 237. The OR suggests 149 because it subtracts the 113 in-transit and applies a safety stock cap.\n5. **Adjustment Strategy**: Considering the actual Period 1 demand (148) is much higher than the historical average, I expect demand to remain high (>120). To avoid stockouts for the next lead time window (Periods 2, 3, 4), I need more inventory than the OR suggests.

The OR recommendation (163) reflects this shift but might be slightly conservative given the recent trend. \n2. **Inventory & Lead Time**: On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales.

The order from Period 1 (113 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4, but the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is likely 3 periods (arrival during Period 4) or the shipment is delayed. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 442 units in-transit (Orders from P1, P2, and P3). The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees a large pipeline relative to historical averages. However, with demand around 150/period and a 3-period lead time, we need to cover demand for Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7 (L+1 + observation delay). Total pipeline (442) just barely covers 3 periods of demand.

However, the order from Period 1 (113 units) is conspicuously missing (it should have arrived in Period 3 or 4); I will treat the Period 1 order as a lost shipment. 2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand is 45 units. In-transit is total 353, but removing the lost P1 order (113) leaves 240 units (P3: 180, P4: 60). Current demand reflects a higher regime (P1-P4 mean: 138.5) compared to pre-P1 history (~65). The product is 'Ladies Denim/Ankle-length jeans', which traditionally sees high demand in early spring (March/April). 3. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 30 units is based on the assumption that all 353 units in-transit will arrive. Since 113 are likely lost, the pipeline is effectively 240. To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at a mean of ~140, I need a base stock of ~420. Current effectively available = 45 (on-hand) + 240 (valid in-transit) = 285. Gap = 135 units.

Currently, on-hand is 0. In-transit consists of P3 (180), P4 (60), and P5 (75), totaling 315 units (adjusting for the lost P1 order and the likely arrival of P3). If P3 arrived at the end of P5, it will be visible at the start of P7. \n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Historical mean demand before P1 was ~65. Recent demand (P1-P5) has been: 148, 171, 131, 104, 72. There's a clear spike in Feb (avg ~150) followed by a decline in March (avg ~88).

The P3 order (180 units) is now at Period 7 (4 periods since order) and hasn't arrived, suggesting a potentially lost shipment, similar to the P1 order.

Analysis of history shows that orders from P1 (113 units), P3 (180 units), and P4 (60 units) have never arrived and are over 7 periods old, totaling 353 'ghost' units in the pipeline. The effective pipeline (real units expected) consists only of orders from P10 (100 units) and P11 (80 units), totaling 180 units.\n2. **Inventory Position**: On-hand inventory is 129 units. Combined with the effective pipeline (180), the total real stock available for current and future periods is 309 units.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P9-P11) has stabilized at a lower mean of 77 units/period compared to the P1-P8 average. Using the (L+1) logic (L=2) and a buffer for variance, we should protect for roughly 3 periods of demand (~240-300 units).\n4. **OR Baseline Reconciliation**: The OR agent recommends 0 units because its internal 'In-transit' count (533) suggests massive overstocking. After subtracting the 353 lost units, the OR algorithm's 'pipeline' would effectively be 180, leading it to a different conclusion. \n5. **Decision**: With 129 on-hand and 180 in legitimate transit, we have 309 units available. At a current demand rate of ~75-80, this covers approximately 4 periods. While holding costs are $1, the profit is $19, meaning stockouts are more costly than slight overstocking.

Active pipeline units are: P13 (30 units), P14 (40 units), P15 (0 units), and P16 (40 units), totaling 110 units. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has rebounded from a low of 43-45 (Periods 13-14) to 70-115 (Periods 15-16), suggesting a new late-spring/early-summer demand surge for denim. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is ~67, but the last two periods averaged ~93. OR Recommendation: The OR agent recommends 0 units because its internal 'In-transit' calculation sees 563 units, which it believes covers the base stock level. Lead Time: Actual lead time is confirmed to be 2 periods. Orders placed now (P17) will arrive in P19. Decision: I must offset the lost shipments that the OR agent is including in its pipeline logic. To cover demand for Periods 17, 18, and 19 (Lead time + 1) with an estimated demand of ~85 units/period, I need a target inventory of roughly 255. Currently, active pipeline is 110.

P13 (30 units), P14 (30 units), and P15 (0 units) are also significantly overdue based on the observed 1-2 period lead time. Currently, the only reliable in-transit order is the P17 order of 100 units. Effective pipeline: 100 units.\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P16: 115, P17: 148) shows a sharp upward trend, mirroring the high-demand regime seen in February/March (P1-P3). This suggests a summer seasonal peak for 'Skinny Ankle' denim which OR is under-calculating. The average demand of the last two periods is ~132 units.\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. Ending inventory has been 0 for two periods, resulting in missed sales (104 units missed in P17, 94 units in P16). We need to cover demand for Period 18, 19, and 20 (Lead Time + 1).\n\n4. **Adjustment**: The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 623. Adjusting for the 353 confirmed lost units and the likely lost units from P13/P14, the OR base stock is severely under-supplied.

The system reports In-transit as 1383 units, but according to carry-over insights, at least 1043 units are lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Subtracting these from In-transit gives an 'effective' pipeline of 340 units. Specifically, orders from P34 (80), P38 (80), P40 (80), and potentially earlier unverified ones are outstanding. Based on the history, P34 is now 9 periods overdue and likely lost. P38 (ordered Period 38) and P40 (ordered Period 40) are within the normal arrival window (lead time varies between 1-3 periods). Demand Analysis: Recent demand has settled into a lower regime of 30-60 units (P38-P42: 36, 41, 31, 33, 60). Average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 40. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it perceives the massive 'In-transit' figure as available inventory. With 65 on-hand and an expected arrival from P38/P40 in the coming periods, current stock is sufficient for the immediate 1-2 periods. However, the order from P34 (80 units) is almost certainly lost by now.

The current on-hand (78) plus effective in-transit (40) equals 118 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of demand.
