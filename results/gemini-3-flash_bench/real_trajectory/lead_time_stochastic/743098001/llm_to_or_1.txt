Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 743098001. Historical demand for the last five weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 32.8 and a standard deviation of 11.4. The demand peaked around late January (51 units) and has since cooled to 20 units in the most recent observation. Given the upcoming Valentine's Day (Feb 14) and the product being a 'Flirty Linnea necklace', there might be a slight residual seasonal demand, though the primary peak likely occurred in late January/early February for pre-holiday shopping. Promised lead time is 2 periods. I will set parameters based on the full historical sample (N=5) to establish a baseline. Since current on-hand is 0 and there is no in-transit inventory, the OR backend needs to place an initial order to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the recent demand distribution.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace', a jewelry accessory. Demand history shows samples (33, 32, 51, 28, 20) with a mean of 32.8 and a standard deviation of 11.4. In Period 1, we ordered 52 units, which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is L=2, we do not expect this order to arrive until Period 3 or 4 (observation in Period 4 or 5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we missed 20 units of demand in Period 1 because the game starts with zero stock. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand baseline of 32.8 units/period. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using L=2 (default), a review period of 1, and the provided demand statistics to cover demand during the lead time and the replenishment cycle.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25) for the 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. This is a small accessory likely seeing stable demand early in the year, though historical samples show some fluctuation (20-51 units). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (52 units) and Period 2 (52 units) are currently in-transit. Per the timing rules, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. As our on-hand inventory is currently 0, we have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. To stabilize, I will use the mean of the available historical demand samples (average: 30.6) to set mu_hat. Since we have 5 historical samples plus 2 recent period demands (20, 23), I'll use N=7 for recent_N to capture the full recent history. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle volatility based on the standard deviation of all samples. L remains at the default promised lead time of 2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace', a jewelry accessory. Demand history shows values: 33, 32, 51, 28, 20 (pre-game) and 20, 23, 16 (Periods 1-3). The average demand is approximately 28 units. We are currently in Period 4, and the promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (52 units) and Period 2 (52 units) are in-transit (total 104 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in Period 3's conclude message. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or there is a delay. Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet to calculate a new average, I will use 'explicit' for L=3 to account for this observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 3 periods (20, 23, 16) suggest a slight softening compared to the earlier average, so I will use recent_N=3. Sigma_hat remains default to capture historical volatility. This should trigger a sufficient order to cover the (3+1) period window while accounting for the current stockout.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The SKU is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. Reviewing the performance: Demand has been low and somewhat volatile: P1=20, P2=23, P3=16, P4=8. The average demand across these 4 periods is 16.75. Current On-hand is 44, which covers over 2 periods of recent average demand. In-transit is 68 (orders from P1 and P3; P1 order of 52 units is technically overdue if L=2, as P2 order arrived in P4 with L=2). Since P1 order hasn't arrived by P4 conclude, it might be delayed or the lead time is inconsistent. However, with 44 on hand and 68 in transit, the pipeline is saturated relative to a demand mean of ~17. I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand to capture the recent downward trend (especially P4) and keep L at default (2) as confirmed by the P2-order arrival. The backend will calculate the base stock based on these parameters, likely resulting in a small or zero order given the high pipeline inventory.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Reviewing history: The order from P1 (52 units) is still missing (it should have arrived in P3 conclude). The order from P2 (52 units) arrived in P4 conclude (lead_time=2). The order from P3 (16 units) should have arrived in P5 conclude, but it did not. This suggests either a lead time lengthening or potentially lost shipments. However, looking at demand, there's a significant drop: P1-P3 demand averaged ~19.6, while P4-P5 averaged 9.0. Given the on-hand inventory (34) and in-transit (68, which includes the missing P1 and P3 orders), the pipeline is currently high relative to recent low demand. I will use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the recent downturn and 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to average the observed lead time, while monitoring if the P1/P3 orders are lost in future periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU 743098001 (Women's Small Accessories - Necklace) shows a significant demand shift. Initial historical samples (Jan/Feb) averaged ~33 units/week. However, since Period 4 (early March), demand has dropped significantly to 8, 10, and 7 units respectively (avg ~8.3). This suggests a post-peak seasonal decline or a shift in regime. The promised lead time is 2, and the ONLY concluded shipment (ordered P2, arrived P4) confirms an actual lead time of 2. Currently, we have 27 units on-hand and 68 units in-transit (ordered in P1 and P3). Note: The P1 order of 52 units is now overdue (should have arrived in P3), suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed. To avoid over-ordering due to the high in-transit count (despite the potential loss), I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=3) to reflect the current low-demand regime of ~8.3 units/period and set L to 'default' (2). This balances the risk of excess inventory if the P1 order eventually arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: weekly demand decreased from avg ~30 to avg ~8 (-73%). Potential lost shipment: Order from Period 1 (52 units) has not arrived by Period 6 (expected Period 3).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the SKU has 0 on-hand inventory and 68 units in-transit. A massive demand spike occurred in Period 7 (59 units), which was likely seasonal or a promotion, as it far exceeded the previous trend of ~8 units. Regarding logistics: the order from Period 1 (52 units) is officially confirmed lost (expected P3-P4, now P8), and the order from Period 2 arrived on time (2 periods). The current in-transit (68 units) includes the order from Period 3 (16 units, now overdue) and whatever was ordered in Periods 4-7 (system history shows 0 ordered in P4-P7, but 'In-transit' is 68, implying the backend placed orders based on previous parameters or the P1 order is still being counted as 'in-transit' by the OR engine). I will use N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent spike (mean ~25) while acknowledging the high volatility (sigma_hat) from the 59-unit outlier. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 2 periods as the only successful delivery met this.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Order from Period 1 (52 units) confirmed lost (missing for 5 periods past promise). Demand volatility significantly increased following a 59-unit spike in Period 7.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a necklace. Historical demand analysis shows a low-demand regime (avg ~8 units) followed by a significant spike in Period 7 (59 units) and Period 8 (50 units). These spikes likely correspond to the lead-up to Easter/Spring season demand. On-hand inventory is 0 due to the high demand exceeding prior stock. I ordered 74 units in Period 8, which are currently in-transit. The Period 1 order (52 units) is confirmed lost, so the backend's pipeline calculation (which includes it) is overstating available stock. Consequently, the OR engine will likely order too little. To correct for this, I will set 'L' to 'explicit' at 2 (promised) to stabilize calculations, and set 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent demand surge (P6: 7, P7: 59, P8: 50). This increases the base stock level to account for higher seasonal velocity and essentially 'replaces' the lost units by demanding a higher stock target.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand spike confirmed: Periods 7 and 8 saw demand increase from ~8 to ~54 (+575%). Pipeline correction required for permanently lost Period 1 shipment (52 units).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime (Spring/Easter season for accessories). Recent demand (Periods 7-9) averaged 47 units, a significant shift from the previous average of ~8. The Period 1 order (52 units) is officially considered lost, which explains the stockouts despite the theoretical 'In-transit' count. Current on-hand inventory is 0. There are 196 units in transit, but 52 of those are the 'ghost' shipment from Period 1. The OR backend needs to cover 3 periods of demand (Promised L=2 + review period 1). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 2-period lead time seen in Period 4. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current demand spike (average ~47), resulting in a forecast of ~141 for the 3-period window. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the high volatility during this surge, ensuring the service level is maintained against stockouts.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (April 22). Historical data shows a clear demand shift starting in Period 7 (late March/early April), aligning with Spring/Easter seasonality for accessories. Before Period 7, demand averaged ~8.5 units. Periods 7-10 show a new regime with demand samples: 59, 50, 32, 25 (average ~41.5). Lead times have been mostly consistent at 2 periods (except for the lost P1 order and a recent 1-period arrival). Currently, we have 103 units on-hand and 68 in-transit (ordered in P1-P3, though P1 is likely lost). To account for the seasonal surge and high volatility observed in P7-P8, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the higher demand average of ~41.5 units per period. Since L=2, mu_hat should reflect (1+L)*41.5 \u2248 124.5. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to manage the increased volatility (std dev ~15). This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the seasonal peak while accounting for the high 'in-transit' volume that includes the likely lost P1 shipment.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019-04-29). The product is a piece of fashion jewelry. Demand history shows three distinct regimes: Period 1-3 (avg ~20-25), Period 4-6 (low, avg ~8), and Period 7-11 (high, avg ~39, though tapering off from a peak of 59). The current on-hand inventory is 75 units, and a large shipment of 128 units (74+54) arrived in Period 10, bringing our safety stock back to a healthy level. Lead times have been stable at 1-2 periods for recent successful arrivals. The lost shipment from Period 1 (52 units) is still reflected in some tracking systems as 'in-transit' but is confirmed lost by history. However, the backend 'in-transit' currently shows 68 units (this likely includes orders from Period 10 or 11 which are not shown in the truncated history but are active). Given demand is settling around 25-30 units recently, I will use a window of 5 periods (Periods 7-11) to capture the current active demand level (~38.8 units/week). Setting L=2 (promised) as recent actuals (1 and 2) validate it. This will ensure we maintain enough stock for (1+2)=3 periods of demand (~116 units) while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in Period 10-11 at ~27 units/week following the April peak (avg 54 in P7-8). This confirms the seasonal spike is cooling but remains higher than the March low.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are managing the 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. Reviewing recent history, demand spiked in late March/early April (P7: 59, P8: 50) and has since stabilized at a lower but consistent level (P10: 25, P11: 28, P12: 19). The average demand over the last three periods (P10-P12) is 24 units/week. On-hand inventory is 56, with 16 units in-transit (ordered P12, expected P14) and 68 units potentially 'stuck' in-transit from before the P10 influx (P1 order of 52 and P3 order of 16). Since P1 and P3 orders are over 9 periods old, they are considered lost per carry-over insights. The backend OR engine needs to cover demand for the current period plus the promised lead time (3 periods total). Applying L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+L) * 24 = 72, and sigma_hat is calculated using the recent 3-period volatility to ensure we don't over-index on the previous seasonal spike.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098001' (Flirty Linnea necklace) has exhibited distinct demand regimes. After a very low period in March (avg ~8), demand spiked during April (avg ~54) and has since stabilized in May. In Periods 10-13, demand was 25, 28, 19, and 33, averaging approximately 26 units per week. This suggests a post-spike stabilization. Current on-hand is 23 units, with 16 units in-transit (ordered P12, expected P14) and 68 units presumably still reflecting the 'lost' order from P1 and early artifacts. However, the system shows 84 units in-transit (68 + 16). Since the Period 1 order (52 units) is confirmed lost but remains in pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the stable ~26 units/week demand while keeping the service level high. Lead time appears stable at the promised 2 periods (P8 and P9 orders arrived in P10).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at ~26 units/week (Periods 10-13) following the April seasonal peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (2019/5/20), we are reacting to a significant demand spike in Period 14 (78 units), which depleted our inventory (on-hand 0). This spike likely represents a late spring/pre-summer seasonal surge for the 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. The demand history shows a low baseline in March (~8), a spike in April (~54), a stabilization in early May (~26), and now a sharp jump to 78. Current in-transit inventory is 68 units (sum of orders from P13/P14 if any, though history shows only P12 arrived; however, the status reports 'In-transit: 68'). Given the lead time is reliably 2 periods (P12 order arrived in P14), we expect these 68 units to arrive in Period 15 or 16. To account for the recent volatility and the high demand in P14, I will use a mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (Periods 10-14) which averages ~36.6 per week. With L=2, mu_hat (1+L) should be approximately 110. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the transition from stabilization to the new spike, while sigma_hat is set to explicit (40) to guard against the stockout risk seen in P14 due to the high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in Period 14 (78 units), indicating a possible pre-summer seasonal peak for jewelry. On-hand inventory is depleted to 0 as of Period 15.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand period for the 'Flirty Linnea necklace', with a massive spike to 156 units in Period 15 (May 20). This follows a previous spike of 78 units in Period 14, confirming a significant pre-summer seasonal surge. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods has been 19, 33, 78, 156, and historical context suggests these peaks can be extreme. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am shifting mu_hat to a recent_N (N=3) calculation to capture the surge from periods 13-15 (avg ~89/week) and setting sigma_hat explicitly high (70) to account for the extreme volatility (33 to 78 to 156). The lead time remains stable at 2 periods (except for one outlier).

Carry-over insight: Major demand surge confirmed starting Period 14: Demand jumped from avg 26 (P10-13) to 78 (P14) and 156 (P15), indicating extreme late-May seasonality for small accessories.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098001' (Womens necklace) is currently in a massive demand surge likely related to late-May/early-June seasonality (graduations, weddings, or summer gifting). Demand has skyrocketed from a stable ~26 (P10-13) to 78 (P14), 156 (P15), and now 165 (P16). The average over the last 3 periods is 133 units. On-hand inventory is 0 due to back-to-back stockouts. We have 299 units in-transit (orders from P15 and P16). Given L=2, the backend needs to cover 3 periods of demand (P17, P18, P19). I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the average of the surge (133 * 3 = 399 total requirement). The OR engine will subtract the 299 in-transit units and place an order to reach the calculated base stock. Lead time remains stable at 2 periods based on history. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the heightened volatility during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Extreme seasonal demand surge at Period 14-16: Average weekly demand increased from 26 to 133 units (+411%) for early June period.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 15-17) shows a significant seasonal peak (156, 165, 153), confirming the regime shift noted in Carry-over insights. Prior to this (Periods 10-13), demand was steady at ~26 units. The product (necklace) likely follows early summer/event-driven seasonality. For Period 18, I am using recent_N=4 to capture this current high-demand regime (Avg ~138 units/week). Lead times have been stable at 1-2 periods, so I will use 'calculate' to reflect the average of actual arrivals. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * ~138 and sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility seen during this surge to ensure the backend maintains a high service level for this high-profit SKU during its peak season.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Flirty Linnea necklace spiked significantly between Periods 14-17 (averaging ~138 units/week), likely due to early summer/festival season demand for small accessories. However, Period 18 saw a sharp drop to 38 units, which matches the stabilization seen in Period 8-13 (avg ~26) after the previous (April) spike. This suggests the extreme 'late-May/early-June' peak is cooling down. We have 451 units currently in-transit (ordered in Periods 17 and 18), which should arrive in Periods 19 and 20. With current on-hand inventory at 40 and demand retreating towards a mean of ~38-40, we are now over-leveraged in the pipeline. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5: P14-P18, mean=98) to reflect the transition from peak to post-peak, while allowing sigma_hat to remain high (N=5) to account for the extreme volatility observed in this cluster. For lead time, 'calculate' is used as actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak (Periods 14-17) concluded; demand decreased from 153 (P17) to 38 (P18), signaling a return to a lower baseline demand regime similar to the April post-spike levels.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The summer peak observed between Periods 14-17 (avg demand ~133) has clearly subsided. Demand in the last two periods (P18-P19) has averaged 48.5 units. The current date (late June) suggests a post-solstice demand normalization for accessories. On-hand inventory is healthy at 150 units, and there is a significant pipeline of 307 units (largely from the large Period 17 order of 214 units which is expected to arrive this period). Lead times have been fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods; I'll use the 'calculate' method to average these observations. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I am moving away from the extreme peak and targeting the most recent regime. Using N=3 for mu_hat captures the transition from the peak (P17: 153) to the new baseline (P18: 38, P19: 59), resulting in a more moderate forecast of (~83 units per period including lead time) to prevent excessive overstocking as seasonality cools, while sigma_hat using N=3 will account for the high volatility seen during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak demand regime shift: Average demand decreased from 133 (P14-P17) to 48.5 (P18-P19) following the mid-June seasonal pivot.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. The 'Summer peak' identified in periods 14-17 (avg ~133 units) has clearly concluded. Demand over the last three periods (P18-P20) has stabilized at a lower level: 38, 59, and 57 (avg 51.3). This represents a post-peak plateau. The carry-over insights suggest that following the April peak, demand held at ~26-27 units, but the current post-summer baseline appears higher, around 50 units. Lead times have been volatile but generally hover around the 1-2 period mark (P18 order arrived in 1 period, P19/P20 have not arrived yet). Since current on-hand (93) and in-transit (307) totaling 400 is very high relative to the current demand of ~50, the OR backend needs to recognize the reduced demand regime to avoid further overstocking. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this post-peak stabilization (avg ~51) for mu_hat, and use calculated lead time to reflect the 1-2 period reality.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer plateau confirmed: Periods 18-20 show demand stabilizing at ~51 units/week, significantly lower than the June peak (~133) but higher than the May baseline (~26).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 743098001 (Womens Small accessories) has transitioned from a high-demand summer peak (Period 14-17, avg 133/week) to a more moderate post-peak plateau (Period 18-21, avg 61.75/week). The most recent demand was 93 in Period 21, which is higher than the previous three weeks (~51 avg), potentially indicating a mid-summer lift or lingering volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have a very large pipeline of 307 units (orders from P17 and P19, with P17's 214 units and P19's 25 units likely arriving this period based on the calculated lead time of 2 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical performance (mostly 1 or 2 periods). I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this post-peak regime (P18-P21 mean = 61.75), and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility in this cooling phase. This approach ensures we don't over-order against a massive pipeline while remaining responsive to the updated baseline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is July 15, 2019 (Period 23). The product is a decorative necklace. Historically, we have seen two surges: an April flurry and a major late-May/early-June peak (Periods 14-17). Following the peak, demand has stabilized at a higher plateau than the spring levels. Specifically, from Period 19 to 22, demand figures were 59, 57, 93, and 97. The recent two weeks (93, 97) suggest a second summer wave or sustained high demand in July. My current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a massive pipeline of 307 units (largely from the Period 17 and 19 orders which are overdue or just arriving). Reviewing lead times: P15 arrived P17 (L=2), P16 arrived P17 (L=1), P18 arrived P19 (L=1). The large order from P17 (214 units) has not arrived yet\u2014if it had an L=2, it should have been in the P20 report. It is now 4-5 periods since P17, suggesting potential delays or a lost shipment, though I will assume it's delayed for now. Given the recent demand jump to ~95 units, I will set mu_hat to reflect this current regime using recent_N=4 (covering the post-peak plateau and recent rise). Lead time remains variable; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge detected: Demand increased from avg 58 (P19-20) to avg 95 (P21-22). Order from Period 17 (214 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since order).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a significant demand spike occurring over the last three periods (P21-P23: 93, 97, 108), averaging ~99 units/week. This follows a mid-summer surge previously detected. The in-transit inventory is 307 units, which includes a large order from Period 17 (214 units) that is now 6 periods old and extremely overdue (promised lead_time is 2). If the P17 order (214 units) is lost, the pipeline only contains 93 remaining units (307 - 214). Given the current demand (avg ~99), we are severely under-inventoried. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime (last 3 periods) and set a higher sigma_hat explicitly to account for the volatility seen in this category and the risk of continued stockouts. For lead time, I'll use 'calculate' to reflect the variability in arrivals (which have ranged from 1 to 2 periods, excluding the likely lost shipment).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: P21-P23 demand stabilized at ~99 units/week, up from ~51 units/week in P18-P20 (+94%). The order from Period 17 (214 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost; pipeline inventory should be discounted by this amount in strategy calculations.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (July 29, 2019), the demand for the Linnea necklace remains high, averaging ~100 units/week over the last four periods (P21-P24). On-hand inventory is 0 and has been depleted for four consecutive periods, causing significant lost sales. The order from Period 17 (214 units) is now 7 periods overdue (promised 2) and is officially considered lost; it should no longer be counted in pipeline inventory. Currently, the 'In-transit' of 323 units consists of the lost P17 order (214), a P18 order (169, which actually arrived in P19 but the system still shows in-transit until reconciliation), and recent orders. Specifically, true functional pipeline is very low. To recover, I need to set mu_hat to reflect the current ~100 units/week regime. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the high summer demand (avg 100), and use explicit sigma_hat to account for high volatility (std ~6). L=2 is maintained as the standard lead time for calculation, despite the one-off loss in P17.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Order from Period 17 (214 units) is now 7 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Functional pipeline inventory is significantly lower than the 'in-transit' figure suggests due to this loss.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5, 2019), the product is in a mid-summer demand regime. Demand since the mid-July surge (P21) has averaged approximately 94 units/week (P21-P25: 93, 97, 108, 101, 71). The recent drop to 71 in Period 25 may indicate the start of a late-summer slowdown, so a balanced N=5 is used for mu_hat to anchor the forecast to this summer level. A significant supply issue persists: the order from Period 17 (214 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 323 units includes this lost shipment, meaning the functional pipeline is only 109 units (323 - 214). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (avg ~94) covers the (L+1) horizon of 3 periods (approx 282 units). Current functional pipeline (109) + on-hand (0) is significantly below the target base stock. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' for its calculation, so I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the 'ghost' inventory of 214 units. By setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a target base stock that accounts for the 214 lost units, I ensure the system replenishes the stock-out.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand mid-summer regime (P21-P26 avg: ~92 units/week). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts since Period 21. There is a major discrepancy in the pipeline: one shipment from P1 (52 units) and one from P17 (214 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 266 units. While 'in-transit' shows 513 units, the functional pipeline is only 247 units (513 - 266). These 247 units consist of orders from P19 (25), P24 (16), and P26 (190), plus some smaller residuals. To compensate for the lost 266 units and the missed demand, mu_hat is set to roughly 3 weeks of the current demand regime (88 units/week * 3 = 264), and sigma_hat is set to 80 to aggressively push the base stock higher, enabling the OR backend to place a large recovery order despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure. L is kept at 2 per the promised lead time, as recent successful arrivals have varied between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P21-P26) shows stabilization at avg ~92 units/week. Confirmed lost shipments: Period 1 (52 units) and Period 17 (214 units), totaling 266 units erroneously included in backend pipeline calculations.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 19, 2019. Demand remains in the mid-summer plateau regime (P21-P27), averaging approximately 94 units/week (93, 97, 108, 101, 71, 82, 105). On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite a high 'in-transit' figure of 513 units. This discrepancy is caused by suspected lost shipments: P1 (52 units) and P17 (214 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 266 'phantom' units in the backend's pipeline inventory count. To force the OR backend to order and recover stock despite these phantom units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I set mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecast * Inflation_Factor. With L=2 and forecast=94, a base stock of ~282 would normally be targets. However, with 513 in transit (including 266 lost), the backend sees 513 and will not order. I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 266 lost units. Forecast (1+L) * 94 = 282. Adding the 266 lost units brings the target to 548. I will set mu_hat to 548 and sigma_hat explicitly to capture recent volatility (std of last 7 periods is ~13, so sqrt(3) * 13 \u2248 23).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. Demand has shifted from a mid-summer steady state of ~92 units/week (P21-P26) to a significantly higher level, averaging 121 units/week over the last two periods (P27-P28), likely entering a late-summer/pre-fall peak. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and a technical pipeline of 586 units. However, this pipeline includes confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (52 units) and Period 17 (214 units), totaling 266 'phantom' units. The functional pipeline is therefore only 320 units (586 - 266), which includes orders from P19 (25), P24 (16), P26 (190), P28 (73), and the current P29 order. Due to the high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), and the clear demand acceleration, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 363 (121 demand * 3 periods for L+1) to ensure the backend aggressively orders to cover the current peak and account for the pipeline gap caused by lost units.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand surge confirmed: P27-P28 demand increased to avg 121 units/week (+31% vs P21-P26 avg). Total confirmed lost shipments remain 266 units (P1, P17).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. Demand since Period 27 has increased to an average of 121.67 units/week, indicating a late-summer surge for this jewelry SKU. The 'In-transit' figure of 586 units is significantly inflated by 266 units from two confirmed lost shipments (Period 1: 52 units, Period 17: 214 units). This leaves a functional pipeline of 320 units. However, there is a massive gap in arrivals: no shipments have arrived since Period 19 despite multiple orders (P24, P26, P28). This suggests a systemic lead-time delay or logistical failure. Current on-hand is 0. To force the backend to place an order despite the 'ghost' pipeline inventory and capture the 121.7 demand regime, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=3) to focus on the current peak and 'explicit' for L to account for the ongoing delivery delays. I am setting L=5 to reflect the current period where we are waiting on multiple overdue orders, which increases the target base stock to cover more periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Systemic lead-time delay detected: No shipments have arrived for 10 consecutive periods (P20-P29). Demand regime shift at P27 to 122 units/week (+31%).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/09. Demand is in a high-regime stage (Late-summer surge) with the last 4 periods (P27-P30) averaging 124 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 662 units, but this remains heavily inflated by lost shipments from P1 (52 units) and P17 (214 units), totaling 266 'phantom' units. Subtracting these, the functional in-transit inventory is 396 units. The arrival of the P28 order (73 units) in P30 acknowledges that the supply chain is delivering again after a long dry spell, though delays are still evident. I will set L to 4 to account for the actual time since the last large orders (P24, P26) which should have arrived by now, but haven't. For mu_hat, I use the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current 120+ demand level. Given the significant loss of inventory and the 'phantom' pipeline, I am setting an explicit mu_hat to ensure the base stock calculation targets a high enough level to trigger orders despite the backend's belief in the 662 units.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain activity resumed in P30 (first arrival since P19), but 'phantom' pipeline remains at 266 units (P1, P17). Actual lead time for recent fulfillment (P28 order) was 2 periods, but multiple older orders (P24, P26) are currently overdue, suggesting inconsistent lead times or further losses.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019), the supply chain remains highly unstable. While an order from Period 28 arrived in Period 30 (lead time = 2), multiple other orders (P24, P26) are overdue, and orders from Period 1 (52 units) and Period 17 (214 units) are definitively lost. This creates a 'phantom' pipeline of 266 units that the OR backend incorrectly counts as incoming inventory. Consequently, the backend will severely under-order because it believes these 266 units are coming. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflated the base stock. The current demand regime (Late-Summer) is averaging ~121 units/week (P27-P31). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the total required stock is demand * (L+1) = 121 * 3 = 363. To offset the 266 missing units that the backend won't order, I must set mu_hat to approximately 363 + 266 = 629. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the recent high volatility (N=5 for the P27-P31 period). L is set to 'calculate' to account for the inconsistent arrival times while acknowledging the promise is still 2.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic supply chain instability: While P28 arrived on time (L=2), orders from P24 and P26 are currently overdue as of P32, joining the permanently lost P1 and P17 shipments (266 units total). Demand remains in a late-summer high regime of ~121 units/week.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a late-summer/early-autumn demand regime, which has stabilized at approximately 108 units/week (average of P27-P32). Recent fulfilling lead times have been consistent at L=2 (P28 and P30 orders) or L=1 (P31 order), though there is significant supply chain noise due to older missing shipments. Specifically, orders from P1 (52 units), P17 (214 units), P24 (16 units), and P26 (190 units) are severely overdue or confirmed lost, totaling 472 units of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. With 521 units reported in-transit, only about 49 units (P32 order + possible remnants) are likely real. To compensate for this 472-unit deficit that the backend counts as available supply, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high: (1+L) * Mean + Phantom Lost. This forces the system to order enough to ignore the lost stock. Sigma is set to reflect the moderate volatility (std ~25-30) across the last 6 periods.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain loss confirmed: Orders from P1, P17, P24, and P26 (total 472 units) are permanently lost or severely overdue, creating a persistent inventory deficit in backend calculations. Late-summer demand (P27-P32) has stabilized at ~108 units/week.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P27-P33) has stabilized at an average of 112 units/week (sum: 105+137+123+132+95+76+117 / 7 = 112.1). In contrast, the backend's 'in-transit' figure of 796 units is severely inflated by multiple confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed shipments: P1 (52), P17 (214), P24 (16), and P26 (190), totaling 472 'phantom' units. This discrepancy causes the OR engine to under-order because it believes these units are arriving soon. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to significantly increase the base stock level and bypass the backend's reliance on the inflated pipeline. Using the late-summer baseline of ~112 units, for a lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) is 336 units. However, to aggressively compensate for the 472-unit deficit and current 0 on-hand status, I am setting mu_hat to 650. This forced increase ensures the backend places a substantial order despite the phantom arrivals. L=2 is maintained based on the most recent successful arrivals in P30 and P32. sigma_hat is calculated for the last 7 periods to capture current high volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Flirty Linnea necklace is currently in a late-summer/early-autumn regime, with the last 8 periods (P27-P34) averaging approximately 109 units/week. Lead times remain unstable; while recent orders from P28, P30, and P31 arrived with L=1 or L=2, several older orders (P1, P17, P24, P26) totaling 472 units are confirmed lost or severely overdue. This 'phantom' pipeline inventory causes the OR backend to under-order because it believes these units are still coming. To compensate for the 472 units missing from the 796 units 'In-transit', I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-week window (L+1=3) at the current demand rate (~109 * 3 = 327) and then add the 472 lost units to that target (327 + 472 = 799). Setting mu_hat to 799 forces the backend to place an order that restores the physical pipeline, effectively ignoring the units that will never arrive. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain loss total updated to 472 units (P1, P17, P24, P26). Demand regime for late-September/early-October (P27-P34) stabilized at ~109 units/week.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 743098001 is currently experiencing zero on-hand inventory and persistent supply chain issues. Demand has stabilized at a late-year regime (P27-P35) averaging 104 units/week, down slightly from the summer peak but significantly higher than the spring baseline. The most critical issue is the 'phantom' pipeline: orders from Periods 1 (52), 17 (214), 24 (16), 26 (190), and 33 (275) are now significantly past their promised lead time. The order from Period 33 (275 units) is 2 periods old and didn't arrive in P35, but given recent history, it's likely delayed rather than lost forever. However, P1, P17, P24, and P26 (total 472 units) are confirmed losses. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this non-existent stock, I explicitly set 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' to account for these losses. Demand for the last 9 periods (N=9) averages 104 units. To compensate for the 472 units of lost pipeline that the backend still counts as 'in-transit', I use an explicit mu_hat that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1) plus a recovery factor to clear the backlog and offset the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain loss total updated to 472 units (P1, P17, P24, P26). Demand regime for late-September/early-October (P27-P35) stabilized at ~104 units/week. Order from Period 33 (275 units) is currently overdue but not yet confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $580.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Flirty Linnea necklace is cooling from its late-summer high. Comparing the late-September/early-October regime (P27-P35 avg ~104) to the most recent two periods (P35: 63, P36: 46), we see a clear downward shift toward a late-autumn baseline. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. On the supply side, the systemic loss of orders from P1, P17, P24, and P26 (totaling 472 units) remains a critical factor. These units are counted in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' but will never arrive. To compensate and force the backend to order, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, adding the 472 'phantom' units to the (1+L) * demand forecast. This ensures the base stock level is high enough to trigger an order despite the inflated pipeline count. Although lead times have been unstable (1-3 periods), the recent arrivals (P33 at L=3, P35 at L=1) suggest an average near the promised 2 periods; I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: Demand has dropped below 70 units/week for two consecutive periods, indicating the end of the late-summer/early-autumn plateau and a move toward a lower winter baseline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Flirty Linnea necklace is transitioning into a lower winter baseline. Following the late-summer peaks (avg ~109), the last two periods (P36-37) showed demand of 46 and 89 (avg 67.5), confirming the end of the previous regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward shift (avg ~66 units/week). In-transit inventory is currently 517 units, but this includes 472 units from confirmed lost shipments (P1: 52, P17: 214, P24: 16, P26: 190). The actual functional pipeline is only 45 units (P36: 4, others pending). Lead times have been inconsistent, varying between 1 and 3 periods recently (P33 and P35 arriving in P36); I am using the 'calculate' method to allow the backend to average these recent observations. On-hand inventory is 205, which combined with the small functional pipeline, is sufficient for the current lower demand phase. mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted to prevent over-ordering while accounting for the significant 'phantom' inventory in the backend's pipeline total.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: Transition from late-summer peak (~104) to late-autumn baseline (~67 units/week). Total confirmed lost/phantom pipeline inventory increased to 472 units (Periods 1, 17, 24, 26).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, entering the lead-up to the holiday season. Historical analysis shows a demand regime shift starting around Period 36, where demand dropped from the ~104 late-summer avg to a late-autumn baseline. Recent demand (P36-P38) has been 46, 89, and 77 (avg ~71). On-hand inventory is 128. The 'In-transit' figure of 517 is heavily inflated by 472 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 52, P17: 214, P24: 16, P26: 190). These losses must be accounted for as the backend OR logic otherwise underestimates the need for new stock. Excluding these 472 units, the functional pipeline is only 45 units (P19=25, P36=4, P24/P26 were small/lost). Lead times have been inconsistent (1-3 periods), but most recent arrivals show L=3 or L=1. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to project a conservative winter baseline of ~75 units/week (total 225 for L+1), and 'explicit' for L=3 to account for recent supply chain delays, ensuring the (L+1) window is covered despite the phantom inventory in the backend.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic supply chain loss total: 472 units (P1, P17, P24, P26). Demand regime for late-autumn (P36-P38) stabilized at avg ~71 units/week. Supply chain remains unstable with lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a late-autumn baseline of approximately 71 units/week (P36-P39 avg: 69.3) following the late-summer peak. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current regime. The supply chain remains unstable with 472 units definitively lost (P1: 52, P17: 214, P24: 16, P26: 190). The backend 'In-transit' figure is 513, but subtracting these 472 lost units yields a functional pipeline of only 41 units (likely the P33 order, though its arrival is uncertain). With On-hand at 67, the total functional inventory is ~108 units. To ensure we don't stock out under inconsistent lead times (actual L varying between 1-3 periods), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to force the base stock calculation to cover a wider window, compensating for the 'phantom' inventory the OR backend believes exists. This will trigger a safety order to bridge the gap between actual and perceived inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: Lead times for recent arrivals (P32, P33, P36) varied between 1 and 3 periods. Total confirmed lost shipments: 472 units (P1, P17, P24, P26).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a lower late-autumn/winter baseline of approximately 66 units/week (average of P36-P40 is 66.2) following the late-summer spike. The supply chain remains unstable: while recent arrivals (P33, P35, P36) have finally fulfilled, the 'phantom' pipeline of 472 units (from P1, P17, P24, P26) is definitively lost and should not be counted toward meeting future demand. With On-hand inventory at 13 units and a real in-transit amount of 41 units (513 - 472), the actual inventory position is 54. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current regime of ~66 units/week. Since the backend OR uses 'In-transit' including the 472 lost units, it incorrectly believes we are overstocked; I will use 'explicit' values for L and sigma_hat and potentially mu_hat to ensure an order is triggered to cover the upcoming late-November/December demand, as we only have ~1 week of stock left.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a late-autumn/winter regime, averaging approximately 64 units per week over the last five periods (P36-P41: 46, 89, 77, 65, 54, 68). The inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 513 units is heavily distorted by systemic supply chain losses. Specifically, orders from P1 (52), P17 (214), P24 (16), and P26 (190) totaling 472 units are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. Additionally, recent lead times have been volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods. To correct for the phantom inventory in the backend's base-stock calculation, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values. I calculated the target base stock for a (L+1) horizon (using L=2 as the baseline, so 3 weeks) at 64 units/week, which is 192 units. To force the backend to place an order despite the 513 'in-transit' units, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that exceeds (in_transit - losses). Functional pipeline is 513 - 472 = 41 units. Setting mu_hat to 235 and sigma_hat to 80 ensures the OR backend sees enough 'demand' to cover both the holiday buffer and the physical deficit caused by the phantom pipeline data.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the jewelry category (Flirty Linnea necklace) is entering the peak holiday shopping season. Historical demand shows a stabilization around ~65 units/week in November (P39-P42 avg: 62.5), but early December typically sees a final annual surge. A major issue is the lead-time and 'phantom' pipeline: 472 units from Periods 1, 17, 24, and 26 are long overdue and confirmed lost. These must be offset. Additionally, no new orders have been placed since P36, and the 'In-transit' figure of 513 contains the 472 lost units, meaning the *actual* pipeline is only 41 units (P40-P42 had 0 orders, P39 had 0, P38 had 0, P37 had 0). With 0 on-hand and only 41 units likely to arrive, the system is severely under-stocked for December. To force the backend to place a large corrective order despite the phantom 472 units, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~110 units/week to account for the holiday surge (similar to late summer 104-109 levels). With L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*110 = 330. To overcome the 472-unit phantom inventory blocking the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic, I will artificially inflate mu_hat to 850 (approx 330 + 520 to clear the phantom units and provide stock).

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand surge expected starting P43; target forecast ~110 units/week. Systemic supply chain loss confirmed at 472 units (P1, P17, P24, P26), requiring artificial 'mu_hat' inflation to bypass backend pipeline logic.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering the peak December holiday demand period (Date: 2019/12/9). In Period 43, I anticipated a surge and ordered 307 units, but demand recorded was surprisingly low (26). However, historical data and product category ('Flirty Linnea necklace') strongly suggest holiday spikes in the final two weeks of December. The primary challenge is the 'phantom' pipeline inventory: 472 units from Periods 1, 17, 24, and 26 are confirmed lost but remain in the backend's 'in-transit' calculation. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a current in-transit total of 820 (which includes the 472 ghost units), the real pipeline is only 348 units (mostly the Period 43 order). To force the backend to place an order that covers the holiday peak despite these ghost units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate holiday demand will peak at ~150-180 units/week. To offset the 472 lost units, I set mu_hat to 1350, which targets a base stock that accounts for both the seasonal surge and the systemic 472-unit deficit.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand surge expected (Dec 9 - Dec 23). Systemic supply chain loss confirmed at 472 units (P1, P17, P24, P26) causes the backend to overestimate pipeline inventory; artificial mu_hat inflation is required to maintain stock levels.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak gift-giving window for the holiday season (mid-December). Demand in Period 43 and 44 was unexpectedly low (26 and 17), suggesting consumers may have shifted to last-minute shopping or the supply chain deficit (0 on-hand inventory) is suppressing our ability to see demand, though the game logic captures 'demand' regardless of stockout. More importantly, the system has 472 units of confirmed lost shipments (Periods 1, 17, 24, 26) that the backend incorrectly includes in its 'pipeline_inventory'. To force the OR backend to place an order when it thinks the pipeline is full, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock level that accounts for the current 472-unit deficit plus a buffer for the final two periods of the year. Since 'in-transit' is 1302 and 472 are lost, the functional pipeline is 830. An explicit mu_hat of 1200 will force a replenishment order to ensure we don't stock out during the final week (Period 47).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23, representing the peak of the holiday shopping season. Historical demand for this women's necklace SKU has shown significant volatility and major seasonal spikes (e.g., Period 15-16 surge). Recent demand (P45) was 66 units, while the pre-holiday weeks (P43-44) were unusually low (~20 units), likely due to stockouts or timing. We are now in the critical late-December window. A persistent issue exists where 472 units (from Periods 1, 17, 24, 26) are confirmed lost but remain in the backend's 'pipeline' calculation. This causes the OR engine to under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the true seasonal demand for the lead time period (L=2, so 3 periods total) to be approximately 330 units (110 per week). To bypass the 472-unit phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat to 802 (330 + 472). This ensures the order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful replenishment. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility while smoothing outlier weeks.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand (P45) began rising at 66 units; expected peak demand is ~110 units/week for late December. The phantom pipeline deficit remains constant at 472 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), effectively past the peak holiday demand. Last period (P46) saw 53 units, following P45's 66 units, confirming the anticipated December surge was more modest than the 110-unit target. The supply chain has stabilized recently (P43 arrived in 2 periods), but the backend still carries a 'phantom' pipeline of 472 units (lost from P1, P17, P24, P26), making it think on-hand + in-transit is higher than reality. To maintain availability for a potential post-holiday baseline, I will maintain an inflated mu_hat. Since demand is cooling from the holiday peak to a likely winter plateau (~50-60 units), I will set mu_hat to cover roughly 300 units (3 weeks at ~100 units/week), which effectively forces an order despite the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is kept at a recent standard to account for seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization: Late December demand (P45-46) averaged ~60 units/week, down from the projected 110. Phantom pipeline inventory remains fixed at 472 units.
