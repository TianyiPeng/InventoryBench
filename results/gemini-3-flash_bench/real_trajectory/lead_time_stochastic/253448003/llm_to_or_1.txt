Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 253448003 (Push-up bra). Historical demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show values of 54, 38, 37, 54, 35. The mean of these 5 samples is 43.6 with a standard deviation of 9.37. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Given the date is mid-February, we are past the initial post-holiday slump but should prepare for stable demand. I will use the 'default' methods to leverage all available historical samples (N=5) for the initial base stock calculation. The OR backend will compute mu_hat as (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L)*std, targeting a high service level due to the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a push-up bra, which generally shows stable demand but can be influenced by seasonal events. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 54, 38, 37, 54, 35 (mean: 43.6, std: 9.3). In Period 1, we saw a demand of 37, which aligns with this range. We started with 0 inventory and ordered 60 units in Period 1. Since the promised lead time is 2, these 60 units are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 0 sales last period because of the stockout. To minimize the stockout duration given the 2-period lead time, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent historical demand to ensure enough inventory is ordered to cover lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Feb 25, 2019. The product is a women's push-up bra. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show an average of 43.6 units/week. In Period 1 and 2, demand was 37 and 55 respectively, showing some volatility. Promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (60 units) and P2 (54 units) are currently in-transit (Total 114). Following the Lead Time Definition, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase (visible in P3 conclude/P4 start). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order hasn't arrived yet, leading to lost sales. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N=5 (including pre-game samples) to capture the base demand level of approx 44 per week. Since the lead time is L=2, the backend will target covering demand for 3 weeks (L+1). I'll use default for sigma_hat and L as there's no evidence yet to deviate from the promised lead time or standard volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The SKU is a push-up bra, which generally follows stable demand patterns. Historical data shows demand around 35-55 units weekly (mean ~46). In-transit inventory reflects orders from P1 (60), P2 (54), and P3 (44), totaling 158 units. Promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in P1 should arrive in P3's arrival phase and become visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). Since P3 conclude shows 0 arrivals, the shipping is delayed. However, since only one period has passed beyond the expected arrival window for the P1 order, I will continue to treat the lead time as 2 for calculation but monitor for 'lost' status. I will use the recent demand samples (n=8, including provided history) to set parameters. mu_hat target is (1+L)*mean = 3 * 46 = 138.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). History shows demand for the last 5 weeks (including pre-game samples) as: 54, 38, 37, 54, 35 (pre-game) and 37, 55, 55, 37 (in-game). Mean demand is approximately 45.1 units/period. The promised lead time is 2. Arrival confirmation in Period 4 shows the Period 2 order (54 units) arrived with an actual lead time of 2 periods, confirming the promise. The Period 1 order (60 units) is still missing (ordered P1, expected arrival P3, but not recorded in P3 or P4 conclude messages); this suggests it might be lost or significantly delayed. We have 17 units on hand and 111 in-transit (P1: 60, P3: 44, P4: 7). If P1 is lost, our true pipeline is only 51. I will set L to 2. For mu_hat, the demand remains stable around 45 units; (1+L)*mean = (1+2)*45.1 = 135.3. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of recent demand is approx 9, so sqrt(3)*9 is roughly 15.6.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Push-up bra in microfibre', a stable staple category. Period 6 (March 18) corresponds to the post-summer/autumn season in Melbourne. Current status: 0 on-hand, 144 in-transit. Historic demand mean (including pre-game samples) is approx 43.6 units/week. Recent demand (last 5 periods) mean is 42.8. Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4; P1 order likely lost as it hasn't arrived by P5 conclude). Demand is relatively stable with no clear seasonality spike yet. The OR backend needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. With 144 in-transit, we are well-covered for the lead time pipeline, but 0 on-hand inventory caused stockouts in P5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and sigma to capture the current stable-but-slightly-lower-than-initial mean, and set L to default (2).

Carry-over insight: P1 order (60 units) presumed lost - failed to arrive after 4 periods (promised 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $627.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Evaluation of lead times shows high variability: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods (P4), Period 5 order arrived in 1 period (P6), and the Period 1 order remains missing (presumed lost after 6 periods). This suggests a volatile supply chain. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 129 units in transit (from Periods 3, 4, and 6). Demand for this 'Push-up bra' has been relatively stable, with samples: 54, 38, 37, 54, 35 (pre-game) and 37, 55, 55, 37, 30, 43 (periods 1-6). The mean of the last 6 periods is ~42.8. Given the lead time instability and the fact that we are out of stock despite deliveries, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (1 and 2), and mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the slightly higher recent demand mean compared to the initial samples. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to account for recent demand volatility (std \u2248 10).

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed lead times of 1 and 2 periods, with one shipment (P1) lost. Supply chain reliability is low.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 43.1 units per period across the last 7 periods (total demand 302 / 7 periods). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variability: P2 arrived in 2 periods, P5 arrived in 1 period, and P1 is confirmed lost. Currently, there are 158 units in-transit (P3, P4, P6, P7), which significantly exceeds the expected demand for the L+1 window. However, the lost shipment (P1) and recent stockouts (Period 1, 2, 3, 5, 7) emphasize the risk of supply chain unreliability. Since P1 (60 units) is recorded in 'in-transit' but is lost, the OR engine's pipeline calculation is inflated. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for (L+1) = 3 periods based on recent average (approx 129 units) and use 'calculate' for L to account for the observed lead time average (1.5 periods). sigma_hat will be set via recent_N to capture recent volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a push-up bra. Historical demand indicates a significant spike in Period 8 (demand=83), which coincides with the lead-up to Easter 2019 (April 21). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline inventory is 111 (all from Period 3, which is significantly overdue and potentially lost). Lead times have been inconsistent (1, 2, and one presumed lost). Since the P3 order (44 units) is now 6 periods old and hasn't arrived, I will treat it as lost and set parameters to trigger a replenishment. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the recent upward demand trend (avg ~50) while smoothing the Period 8 spike, and use 'calculate' for lead time to let the engine account for the observed 1-2 period variation. Sigma is set to 'recent_N' to reflect the higher recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: P3 order (44 units) presumed lost - failed to arrive after 6 periods (promised 2). Demand spike observed in P8 (83 units) likely due to Easter seasonality.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/04/15). The item is a push-up bra. Historical demand shows a baseline around 40-50 units, with a spike in P8 (83 units) likely due to Easter (April 21, 2019). Demand in P9 was 41, suggesting a return to mean. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (199) is highly suspect; orders from P1 (60 units) and P3 (44 units) are almost certainly lost as they are 7+ periods overdue. Only the order from P9 (88 units) is realistically expected. Given the unreliability and lost shipments, I will use an 'explicit' lead time of 3 to account for the risk of delays/losses. For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 samples (30, 43, 45, 83, 41) average ~48. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this level while smoothing the Easter spike. Sigma_hat remains default to handle the observed high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmation: P3 (44 units) failed to arrive after 7 periods; combined with P1 loss, this confirms a high cargo loss rate (~25-30% of order instances). Lead time for surviving orders fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 253448003 (Push-up bra) shows significant supply chain instability. Historical lead times for successful arrivals are 1-2 periods, but two shipments (P1: 60 units, P3: 44 units) are definitively lost as they haven't arrived after 10+ and 8 periods respectively. P8 showed a massive demand spike (83 units) likely due to Easter (April 21, 2019), which has now passed. Post-Easter demand in P10 was 58. Current on-hand is 30, with 151 units in transit (P10: 40, P9: 88, plus lost units still in pipeline). I'll use L=2 (promised) as the base, but set mu_hat explicitly to account for the supply loss risk and return to baseline demand. Given recent demand (41, 58) and the pre-peak average (~40-45), I estimate demand around 45 units/period. Over (L+1)=3 periods, mu_hat should be 135. Sigma_hat is set relatively high (recent_N=5) to handle the extreme volatility seen in P8 and the unreliable supply chain.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) following a demand of 64 in Period 11. Historical demand analysis shows a baseline mean around 43 units, but recent periods (P8-P11) have seen elevated demand (avg 61.5) possibly related to seasonal trends or post-Easter sales. The supply chain remains highly unreliable: P1 (60 units) and P3 (44 units) are confirmed losses. Successfully arrived orders (P2, P5, P6, P7, P9) show actual lead times of 1 or 2 periods. The current in-transit inventory (155 units) consists of orders from P10 (40 units) and P11 (4 units), plus the long-lost residues. Because the OR backend assumes all pipeline inventory will arrive, the presence of lost units (104 units) in 'In-transit' will cause the backend to under-order. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to set a high target that accounts for both the demand increase and the 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. I am targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1) at approximately 60-65 units/period, plus an offset for the ~100 units of lost stock the backend thinks is coming.

Carry-over insight: Sustained cargo loss rate established: ~25% of orders (P1, P3) never arrive. Post-Easter demand plateauing at a higher level (~60 units/week) compared to start of year (~43 units/week).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448003' (Push-up bra) is facing a stocking crisis: on-hand inventory is 0 after a string of stockouts due to high cargo loss rates (~25%) and shifting demand. Historically, demand was ~43 units/week (P1-P7), but since the Easter peak in P8 (83 units), demand has settled into a higher regime averaging ~60 units/week (last 5 periods: 83, 41, 58, 64, 73). Current on-hand is 0, and we rely entirely on the in-transit pipeline (278 units). The P12 order (123 units) is expected in P14 or P15. Given the high stockout frequency (ending inventory has been 0 in 9 out of 12 periods) and the ~25% cargo loss risk (P1 and P3 never arrived), I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher demand regime (~64 units/week) and choosing an 'explicit' lead time L=3. Although successful deliveries arrive in 1-2 periods, setting L=3 in the OR backend effectively creates a larger safety buffer to account for the risk of lost shipments without explicitly having a 'loss rate' parameter. This will push the base stock higher to ensure better service levels in a volatile supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~43 to ~64 (+49%) starting Period 8. Supply chain reliability remains low with a ~25% lost shipment rate.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of chronic stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of history confirms a demand regime shift started around Period 8; demand for the last 6 periods (P8-P13) has averaged 66.3 units, significantly higher than the initial average of ~43. The product is a push-up bra, and the current calendar (May) suggests sustained spring/early summer demand. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: orders from P1 and P3 are long lost, and several orders from periods 10 and 12 (123 units) are currently undelivered. The Promised Lead Time is 2, but actual observed lead times for successful deliveries oscillate between 1 and 2 periods. To recover from the stockout and account for the ~25% shipment loss rate, I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect the higher demand regime (66 units/week * 3 weeks = 198) plus a buffer for the observed variability. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the increased volatility of the new regime. L is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average for surviving orders, while the higher mu_hat ensures the backend attempts to restore the pipeline despite the high loss rate.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory, despite a significant demand spike in Period 14 (163 units). Analyzing the history, demand shifted around Period 8 (Easter/seasonal push for lingerie) and has remained elevated. The average demand since Period 8 (excluding the massive spike) is roughly 66 units, but the Period 14 spike suggests a new, higher volatility or peak. Since I see 181 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 10 and 13), and the arrival from Period 12 just concluded, I expect arrivals shortly. However, the system has a documented ~25% cargo loss rate (P1 and P3 never arrived). To protect against this loss and satisfy the higher demand levels seen in May, I am utilizing an explicit mu_hat. I estimate the go-forward weekly demand at 85 units to account for the recent upward trend. With a lead time (L) of 2, the required base stock (L+1) needs to cover 255 units. Given 181 are in transit (and some of these might be lost), setting mu_hat explicitly to 255 (85 * 3) will prompt the OR backend to place an order that fills the gap between reliable pipeline and expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in May; Period 14 demand reached 163 units, indicating a potential Mother's Day peak or seasonal trend extension. Adjusted baseline demand forecast to ~85 units/week.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a push-up bra, which recently experienced a significant demand spike (Peak demand 141-163 units in mid-May), likely driven by Mother's Day and seasonal trends. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has transitioned from an early-year baseline of ~43 units to a elevated level averaging ~100 units over the last four weeks (83, 41, 58, 64, 73, 79, 163, 141). Specifically, the last two periods averaged 152 units. To prevent stockouts given the observed lost shipment rate (~25%), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the May demand escalation while smoothing the Mother's Day peak. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the variability between 1 and 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility seen in May.

Carry-over insight: May seasonality (likely Mother's Day) confirmed with peak demand reaching 163 units. Mean demand for the trailing 4 periods (P12-P15) increased to 114 units, up significantly from the April average of ~64. Pipeline inventory is high (331 units), but risks of stockouts remain due to persistent ~25% cargo loss rate.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. Demand for 'OP Push Melbourne' bras has significantly increased throughout May (P14: 163, P15: 141, P16: 139), likely driven by Mother's Day and a seasonal shift in lingerie spending. The mean demand for the last 3 periods is 147.7 units. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with a large pipeline of 470 units. Given the persistent cargo loss rate (estimated at ~25% from lost orders P1 and P3), we must maintain high base stock targets to buffer against non-arrivals. The Lead Time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability (1-2 periods) observed in arriving shipments. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high demand regime of ~148 units/week. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this period.

Carry-over insight: Post-Mother's Day demand remains sustained at a high level (~140-150 units/week) representing a new demand regime significantly higher than the April average.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/6/10), we are in a post-Mother's Day regime. While Period 14 peaked at 163, the last three periods (P15-P17) show a mean demand of approximately 128 units (141, 139, 105). We observe a slight stabilization but demand remains significantly higher than the April average. The shipments from P15 and P16 arrived in P17, which significantly replenished on-hand inventory to 184 units. Pipeline inventory (192 units) includes the P10 order which is now 8 periods overdue and definitively lost, and the orders from P12/P13/P14 are also overdue. However, given the high on-hand stock and recent successful arrivals in P17, the OR backend needs to balance high holding costs against the ~25% cargo loss rate. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the high-demand regime from mid-May to early June (avg ~124), and L=explicit=3 to account for the frequent shipment losses which effectively extend the required planning horizon.

Carry-over insight: Post-Mother's Day demand regime (P15-P17) stabilized at ~128 units/week, significantly higher than the Q1 average. Shipment P10 is confirmed lost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19 (June 17), we are in a post-peak demand regime following Mother's Day. After demand spiked to ~140-160 units in May, it has softened in the last two periods (105 and 80 units). The current trailing 4-week demand average (P15-P18) is 116 units, but the most recent two weeks suggest a downward trend towards a stabilize baseline. I will use recent_N (N=4) to set mu_hat, which results in (1+2)*116.25 = 348.75. Given the persistent ~25% cargo loss rate (confirmed losses: P1, P3, P10; P13 is now also late and potentially lost), the backend's base stock calculation needs to be aggressive to prevent stockouts. Pipeline inventory is currently 369 units (orders from P13, P17, P18), but P13 (30 units) is likely lost. By setting L to 'calculate', the backend will factor in the observed 1-2 period lead times for surviving orders. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the higher volatility seen throughout May and June.

Carry-over insight: Shipment P13 (30 units ordered P13) is now 6 periods old and failed to arrive, likely lost; this reinforces the ~25-30% cargo loss rate. Demand is cooling from the May peak (~140+) but remains above the pre-April baseline, stabilizing near ~100 units/week.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 24, 2019. Demand is currently in a high-baseline regime post-May peaks, averaging 101.6 units/week over the last 5 periods (P15-P19). The supply chain remains unreliable with a confirmed ~25% loss rate (Orders P1, P3, P10, and now P13 are presumed lost). To account for the lost orders, my target mu_hat must compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory that the OR backend assumes will arrive. Specifically, P13 (30 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost. The pipeline reported is 192 units (P17: 11 units, P18: 177 units, P19: 0 units - wait, P18 arrived in P19, so pipeline consists of P17: 11 units and P15-P19 orders). Actually, checking the history: P17 ordered 11, P18 ordered 177 (arrived P19), P19 ordered 0. The current 'In-transit' of 192 likely includes the 11 from P17 and older lost orders (P1, P3, P10, P13). Since the OR engine's formula is [Base Stock - Pipeline], and the pipeline is inflated by lost units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a high enough base stock to trigger necessary replacement orders. I'm forecasting a weekly mean of 100 units. For a (L+1) period coverage where L=2, mu_hat should be 300. To offset the ~85 units of lost stock in the recorded pipeline, I'll set mu_hat to 385.

The current date is July 1, 2019. Demand has stabilized after the May peak (Mother's Day), with the last three periods averaging ~96 units (80, 120, 89). This confirms a new 'post-peak' regime that is lower than May's average of ~140 but higher than the pre-April baseline. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this stabilization. Shipment P13 (30 units, ordered P13) and P10 (40 units, ordered P10) are now clearly lost, as they are 7 and 10 periods old respectively. P1 (60 units) and P3 (44 units) were also lost earlier. Total pipeline inventory is 297, which includes 105 units from P20, 11 from P17, and the 70 units from P13 and P10 which I consider dead inventory. Effective pipeline is closer to 116 units. The OR backend needs to maintain a safety buffer against the ~25% cargo loss rate and demand volatility, so I will use a slightly higher mu_hat via recent_N=3 and explicit sigma_hat to account for the current demand spread.

Carry-over insight: Post-Mother's Day demand regime (P18-P20) stabilized at approximately 96 units/week. Reliable shipment arrival rate remains ~75%, with P1, P3, P10, and P13 confirmed lost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand has transitioned from the May peak (Mother's Day) to a summer regime. In the last three periods (P19-P21), demand has been 120, 89, and 70 (average 93). This indicates a cooling trend from the previous regime (~128 units/week). We currently have 2 units on-hand and 297 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory consists of P17 (11 units), P18 (effectively arrived, but history shows 177 in P19), P20 (105 units), and P22 (TBD). Looking at the pipeline: P17 is overdue (4 periods since order), and P20 (ordered P20, expected P22-P23) is pending. Note that shipments P1, P3, P10, and P13 were lost (~25% loss rate). To account for this reliability risk and the shift in demand, I will use a 4-period window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the recent decline toward ~90 units/week while maintaining safety stock. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period variance of surviving shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled in July, averaging ~93 units/week (P19-P21) compared to the ~128 units/week May/June regime. Shipment P17 (ordered P17) is significantly overdue and potentially lost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a post-peak summer regime, averaging approximately 81 units per week over the last 5 periods (P18-P22). This is a cooling from the May/June peak but remains significantly higher than the Q1 average. Inventory management is complicated by a persistent cargo loss rate of approximately 25-30% (confirmed losses: P1, P3, P10, P13, and likely P17 which is now 5 periods overdue against a promised lead time of 2). Because the OR backend assumes all 'In-transit' units will eventually arrive, I must set mu_hat explicitly high to offset the 'phantom' pipeline inventory caused by these lost shipments. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 300 to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to trigger new orders despite the 224 units in transit (many of which are likely lost). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period delivery window for surviving orders, and sigma_hat is set to 50 to account for demand volatility in this higher regime.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime (P18-P22) stabilized at ~81 units/week. Shipment P17 (ordered P17) is 5 periods old and failed to arrive, confirmed as the 5th lost shipment (P1, P3, P10, P13, P17), maintaining the ~25% loss rate reaching into Q3.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. Demand in July has stabilized around a mean of 80 units/period (P21: 70, P22: 85, P23: 83), which is lower than the May/June 'Mother's Day' peak but higher than the Q1 baseline. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and although there are 329 units in-transit, 137 of those were ordered very recently (P23) and 150 (P15) and 139 (P16) were already resolved in P17. Note: The 'In-transit' figure of 329 likely includes the recent order from P23 (137 units) and several significantly overdue/lost shipments (P1: 60, P3: 44, P10: 177? no P10 was 177 ordered and arrived, let's re-check: P1=60 loss, P3=44 loss, P10=?? back history shows P10 ordered 40 and P11 arrived 0, P13 loss, P17 loss). We maintain a 25% lost shipment rate. Given the current stockout and the lead time of 1-2 periods, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the stable July demand (avg ~81). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to best approximate the 1-2 period actual window. Parameters aim to refill the pipeline to cover the 3-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: July demand regime (P21-P23) confirmed stable at ~80 units per week, significantly cooling from the Q2 peak (~130) but remains +85% above the Q1 baseline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 253448003 (Push-up bra) is currently in a stable Q3 demand regime, averaging ~84 units per week over the last five periods (P20-P24). Demand has cooled from the Q2 peak (~130 units/week) but remains significantly higher than the Q1 average (~43 units/week). The inventory position is currently strained with 0 on-hand at the start of Period 25 and 329 units in-transit. Based on 'Carry-over Insights', there is a persistent cargo loss rate of ~25% (orders P1, P3, P10, P13, and P17 were lost). The effective pipeline must be discounted to account for this. The order from P23 (137 units) is expected to arrive in P25 (lead time 2 confirmed for surviving recent orders). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the most recent stability (avg ~84). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the 1-2 period actual lead time observed for successful deliveries. High sigma_hat via recent_N=4 is used to buffer against both demand spikes (e.g., P24 demand was 101) and the supply chain unreliability.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/8/05), the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline of 329 units. Analyzing current performance: Demand has stabilized into a late-summer regime averaging approximately 85 units/week over the last 5 periods (P21-P25: 70, 85, 83, 101, 76). The supply chain remains unreliable with a confirmed ~25% cargo loss rate; specifically, the large order from P23 (137 units) is now 3 periods old and has not yet arrived (promised 2), though it is not yet confirmed lost. Pipeline inventory (329 units) is composed of the P23 order and potentially others. To safeguard against the persistent the loss of the P23 shipment and to maintain service levels for the ~85 unit/week demand, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to reflect the stabilized post-peak demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility. Lead time (L) is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period variance while I monitor the P23 shipment for potential loss.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand (July/August) stabilized at ~85 units/week, down from the June peak but significantly higher than the Q1 baseline. Shipment P23 (137 units) is currently overdue (3 periods), heightening risk of stockout given on-hand is zero.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'OP Push Melbourne' bra is in a stable late-summer regime. Over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 93.8 units/week. However, the most recent demand (P26) spiked to 124, suggesting some late-summer volatility or a return to June-level demand (~100-110). On-hand inventory is currently very low (13 units). The critical issue remains supply chain reliability: P23's order arrived with a lead time of 3 periods (exceeding the promised 2), and roughly 25% of shipments (P1, P3, P10, P13, P17) have been lost. To account for the 25-30% loss rate and the observation that lead times frequently hit 2-3 periods, I am setting L to 3 to provide a larger safety buffer. For demand, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current plateau while allowing for the recent uptick. This strategy aims to prevent stockouts caused by high cargo loss and slightly longer lead times.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time for P23 confirmed as 3 periods (exceeding promised 2). Cargo loss rate confirmed at ~22-25% (6 overdue/lost shipments out of 23 cycles).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a stabilized demand regime post-May/June peaks, with demand in the last 4 periods (P24-P27) averaging ~103 units/week. This is higher than the July average (~80) but lower than the Q2 peak. The supply chain remains unreliable with a confirmed cargo loss rate of ~22-25% (P1, P3, P10, P13, P17, and potentially P24/P25 orders though those were 0) and actual lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P23 took 3 periods). As of P28, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline of 318 units includes the P27 order of 126 units and potentially older, unfulfilled orders. To account for the risk of shipment loss and the current demand trend, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current ~100 units/week baseline, and sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to account for the increased volatility seen throughout Q3. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: average demand stabilized at ~103 units/week (P24-P27), up from July's ~80 units baseline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August 2019), the demand for the Push-up bra has stabilized in a new regime. Over the last five periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged 102.8 units per week (101, 76, 124, 110, 103), following a summer cooling period. The supply chain remains highly unreliable; we have confirmed a cargo loss rate of approximately 25% (P1, P3, P10, P13, P17, and likely P27/P28 depending on arrival timings). Although P23 finally arrived in P26 with a lead time of 3 periods, on-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit inventory is 364 units (from P1, P3, P10, P13, P17, P27, P28), but history suggests many of these are lost. I am setting L to 2 (promised) but will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the stabilized ~103 units/week demand. This ensures the base stock targets the current demand level while the OR backend's inventory logic accounts for the (inflated) pipeline. Because the pipeline is technically high but practically suspect, I'll allow the OR engine to order by acknowledging the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~103 units/week (P24-P28). Sustained cargo loss rate remains ~25%; pipeline inventory likely contains multiple lost shipments (P10, P13, P17).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 103 units per week (periods 24-29). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and while pipeline inventory is 364 units, history shows a persistent 25% cargo loss rate. Orders from P10, P13, and P17 are long-confirmed as lost. The recent order P27 (126 units) is 3 periods old (matching the lead time of P23) and has not yet arrived, creating immediate stockout pressure. Given the Lead Time variability (ranging from 1 to 3 periods) and the high loss rate, I am maintaining mu_hat based on the stable N=6 period demand regime while using an explicit Lead Time of 3 to account for the recent slowdown in arrivals. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 3-period lead time plus the review period, mitigating the risk of extended stockouts during this low-reliability supply chain phase.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the demand for this push-up bra has stabilized following the Q2 highs (Mother's Day peak). The recent demand regime (P24-P30) shows a mean of 96.14 units/week, with the most recent sample (P30) dropping to 61 units, suggesting a potential seasonal cooling as summer ends. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture this post-July stabilization while weighting the peak-demand periods less. For lead time, while the promised L=2, the actual lead times for P23 and P27 were both 3 periods, and there is a documented ~25% cargo loss rate (P1, P3, P10, P13, P17). Currently, there are 288 units in-transit, but based on history, approximately 25-30% of these units may never arrive. Setting L to 'calculate' allows the OR backend to account for the observed lead time drifts (averaging between 1.5 to 3). Sigma_hat uses recent_N=7 to reflect the volatility of the current demand regime. The on-hand inventory of 111 units plus the 'real' portion of the 288 in-transit units should provide a sufficient buffer against the inconsistent supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~96 units/week (P24-P30) during the Aug/Sept transition, cooling from the Q2 peak. High lead time variability continues, with recent arrivals (P23, P27) taking 3 periods despite a promised 2.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period 253448003 has stabilized around 90-100 units/week following the end of the summer season, with the most recent two weeks showing a slight cooling (61 and 47 units). However, looking at the regime since Period 24, the average demand is approximately 83 units/week. Lead time variability is significant, with recent shipments (P23, P27) arriving in 3 periods instead of the promised 2. The cargo loss rate remains a critical factor, with ~25% of orders historically failing to arrive (P1, P3, P10, P13, P17). Currently, on-hand inventory is 64 units, and the pipeline contains 288 units. This pipeline is heavily inflated by the P30 order (96 units) and likely several old, lost shipments that the OR backend still considers 'in-transit'. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the post-July demand level (~83 units/week) and setting L to 3 to reflect the observed reality of longer delivery times. This combination will target a higher base stock to buffer against both lead time extensions and the high probability of shipment loss.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled in Sept (P30-P31 avg: 54) following a stable Aug regime of ~103 units/week. Lead time remains volatile, trending towards 3 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand is cooling significantly from the Q2/early-Q3 peaks, averaging ~49 units/week over the last three periods (P30-P32), compared to the previous ~103 units/week. This suggests a transition to a lower demand regime for the Fall season. In-transit inventory stands at 287 units, but this includes multiple confirmed/highly probable lost shipments (P10, P13, P17, and potentially P11 which was for only 4 units but never arrived). Total confirmed lost units are P1=60, P3=44, P10=177, P13=30, P17=11. More recently, lead times have fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods (P23 arrived in 3, P27 in 3, P28 in 2, P30 in 2). I will set L=3 as a conservative measure due to recent variability. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the cooling demand trend (~49 units/week), resulting in a targeted base stock that reflects current lower consumption while considering the high (though inflated) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: demand cooled to ~49 units/week (P30-P32) from the previous ~103 units/week baseline. Inventory pipeline remains inflated by multiple historical lost shipments (~25% loss rate).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1560.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P30-P33) indicates a significant cooling from the Q3 peak, averaging approximately 58 units/week (61, 47, 40, 84). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower volume regime while accounting for the recent spike to 84 in P33. The supply chain remains unreliable with a ~25% cargo loss rate; current pipeline inventory (287 units) includes order P32 (95 units) and likely several unreceived/lost shipments from earlier periods (P10, P13, P17, etc.). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline from the base stock, an inflated pipeline due to lost orders will lead to under-ordering. To compensate for this and the observed lead time drift (average ~2.5, trending toward 3), I set L to explicit '3'. This forces a higher base stock (1+L=4 periods of demand) to ensure enough inventory is ordered to cover both lead time and current on-hand depletion, despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (P30-P33) stabilized at ~58 units/week, a significant reduction from the August average of ~103 units/week. Lead time variability persists, with L=3 observed in late Q3.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448003 has transitioned into a lower Q4 regime, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) dropping to approximately 56 units/week compared to the August peak of ~103 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and while pipeline inventory is 287, we must adjust for the persistent cargo loss rate (estimated at ~25%). Shipments P1, P3, P10, P13, and P17 are confirmed lost. Lead times remain volatile, often taking 3 periods despite a promised 2 (as seen with P23 and P27). To prevent stockouts during this lower demand phase while accounting for supply chain unreliability, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent cooling, and setting L to an explicit 3 to reflect the observed stretch in lead times and lower the risk of under-ordering due to transit delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $445.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Push-up bra has significantly cooled since the peak in Q2/early Q3. September/October data (P30-P35) shows a transition to a lower demand regime averaging ~51 units/week (47, 40, 84, 47, 27 - note P33 was an outlier). Current on-hand is 68 units, with 192 units in-transit. Lead times are volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (observed in P26, P30, P35) despite the promised 2. A critical factor is the established ~25% cargo loss rate; of the 192 units in-transit, roughly 48 are likely lost, leaving an effective pipeline of ~144. To handle the cooling demand while accounting for the unreliable supply chain (L=3 and losses), I will use N=6 for mu_hat to capture the recent slow-down (average ~51) and set L to 3 to improve the safety buffer against delayed arrivals. This targets a base stock that covers the lower demand regime while accounting for the 1-period excess lead time risk.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime (P32-P35) stabilized at ~49 units/week, continuing the downward trend from September. Supply chain lead time is frequently 3 periods, not the promised 2.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448003' (Push-up bra) is currently in a lower demand regime reflecting post-summer/early-autumn seasonality. Over the last five periods (P32-P36), demand has averaged 45.4 units per week, which is a significant drop from the ~100 units observed in August. On-hand inventory is 39 units, and 201 units are in-transit. However, the supply chain remains unreliable with a confirmed ~25% loss rate (P1, P3, P10, P13, P17 are historical losses; P33/P34 orders, if any were placed, would also be suspect, but no orders were placed in those periods). The recent lead time for successful arrivals (P23, P27, P32) has shifted consistently to 3 periods rather than the promised 2. I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for this drift. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower demand level (~45/week) while providing protection for the L+1 window. Pipeline inventory is currently inflated by past lost shipments, so an explicit L and a conservative mu_hat will help the OR backend avoid over-ordering while maintaining service for the detected regime.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime (P32-P36) stabilized at ~45 units/week. Lead time for successful deliveries remains 3 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448003 has significantly cooled in October, stabilizing around 45 units per week (periods 32-37). This follows a much higher regime in Q2 and August. Based on the product description (Push-up bra) and the current date (late October), we are in a low-season period prior to any potential year-end holiday spikes. Lead times remain volatile, ranging between 2 and 3 periods; I am setting L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against these delays. The pipeline inventory (219 units) is significantly inflated by historical lost shipments (P10, P13, P17 are long-confirmed lost, and potentially others). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this ghost inventory, I am keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations focused on the recent low-demand regime (N=6) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current needs while accounting for the ~25% cargo loss risk indirectly through higher service levels (inherent in the profit/cost ratio).

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed stable at ~45 units/week (P32-P37). Lead time for surviving shipments frequently tracks at 3 periods despite a promised 2.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 4th, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a low level (approx. 45 units/week) over the last 6 periods (P32-P37), cooling significantly from the summer peaks. However, as we approach the November/December holiday shopping season, we must be vigilant for an upcoming seasonal uptick. Lead times remain highly volatile, with recent observations of 1, 2, and 3 periods, and a historical cargo loss rate of ~25%. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory of 220 units likely includes ghost inventory from lost orders (P10, P13, P17, and potentially others). To protect against these supply chain failures and prepare for a potential late-November demand increase, I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current stable low period while allowing the OR backend to define the base stock. I will use an explicit L of 3 to account for the frequent delays observed in the second half of the year.

Carry-over insight: Early November demand remains in the low regime (approx. 45 units/week), but historical Q2 trends and product type (lingerie) suggest monitoring for a late-year holiday spike. Cumulative delivery failures continue to suggest the pipeline inventory is overstated by approximately 50-70 units due to historical lost shipments.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand has been in a sustained low regime (Oct/Nov avg: ~31 units/week), a significant drop from the Q2/Q3 peak. However, historical performance shows a 25-30% cargo loss rate, meaning 'In-transit' quantities are likely overstated by approximately 70-100 units (confirmed losses: P1, P3, P10, P13, P17). Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with L=3 being common for surviving shipments. I am setting L=3 to account for this variability. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the current stabilized low-demand regime (~31 units/week), which results in a base stock level that prevents excessive holding costs while monitoring for any late-year holiday spikes associated with the lingerie category. I will rely on the OR backend's default sigma calculation to handle recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 34: average demand stabilized at ~31 units/week (P34-P39), down from ~100 in August. Pipeline inventory remains structurally overstated by ~25% due to cumulative lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P13, P17).

The demand for SKU 253448003 has stabilized at a low-volume regime, averaging approximately 31 units per week over the last seven periods (P34-P40). However, history shows significant volatility and seasonal shifts (e.g., Mother's Day). With mid-November dates approaching, we must remain vigilant for a late-year holiday spike, although current demand remains low. The supply chain continues to reflect high lead-time variability (tracking at 3 periods) and a persistent lost shipment rate (~25%). Shipment P38 (ordered P38) is currently 3 periods old and has not arrived; if it does not arrive in P41, it may be lost like P1, P3, P10, P13, and P17. The current 'In-transit' figure of 227 is significantly inflated by these historical losses; I estimate the 'true' pipeline is closer to 40-50 units (P38, P39, P40 orders). Given zero on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 7-period mean to reflect the current regime while using explicit Lead Time (L=3) to account for the actual observed logistics delays. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the current low but consistent variance to avoid over-ordering high-cost holding units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 253448003 (Push-up bra) is currently in a low-demand regime. Since Period 34, demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 31 units/week (P34-P41), significantly lower than the Q2 and Q3 peaks. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 216 units in-transit. However, historical evidence indicates a persistent cargo loss rate of approximately 25%. Currently, the pipeline likely includes several overdue or lost shipments (e.g., P33, P34, P35 were 0 orders, but historical baggage from P10, P13, P17, and P40/41 arrivals need checking). Specifically, P38 (ordered 19) is now overdue (3 periods), suggesting it may be late or lost. Given the proximity to the end of the year and the product type, I am maintaining a conservative 'recent_N' approach for demand (N=8 to capture the current stable low regime) and using 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to factor in the recent volatility between 1 and 3 periods. The high in-transit figure (216) relative to demand (~30/week) means the 'cap' logic in the OR backend will likely prevent unnecessary ordering unless the pipeline is proven empty by further delivery failures.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable at ~31 units/week (P34-P41). Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are entering the December holiday season. Historical data and the product category (push-up lingerie) suggest a strong potential for a December demand spike similar to the Easter/Mother's Day peaks seen in Q2. Although the recent regime (P34-P42) has averaged ~31 units/week, P42 showed an uptick to 42 units. I will proactively increase the demand forecast to 60 units/week to prepare for the holiday surge. Regarding the supply chain, the promised lead time is 2, but actual observations (P23, P27, P32, P36) frequently hit 3 periods, and there is a persistent ~25% cargo loss rate. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline inventory is 216 units, but this includes multiple verified lost shipments (P10, P13, P17) totaling 105 units. Effectively, the reliable pipeline is likely ~111 units. I will set L to 3 to account for frequent delays and use an explicit mu_hat of 240 (60 units * 4 periods of protection) to ensure the system orders enough to cover the expected holiday spike while accounting for the high shipment loss risk.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand anticipation: Lifting baseline from 31 to 60 units/week based on Q2 seasonal patterns for lingerie. Pipeline inventory is structurally overstated by approximately 105 units due to cumulative lost shipments (P10, P13, P17).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering the peak December holiday season (Period 44, Dec 9). Historical demand for this lingerie item surged significantly during the Q2 spring/Mother's Day peak (reaching 163 units). Given the pre-holiday cooling ended at ~31 units/week (P34-P41), but started to rise recently (P42 demand was 42), I am forecasting a significant holiday spike. I will raise mu_hat to an explicit value of 240, reflecting a forecasted weekly demand of ~60 units over the lead time + review period (1+3=4 periods), which aligns with the start of the Q2 surge but remains conservative compared to the 100+ peaks. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to reflect the consistent supply chain delays observed in Q3/Q4. Pipeline inventory is currently 295, but at least 105 units are confirmed lost/missing (P10, P13, P17, etc.), making the effective pipeline much lower. A higher mu_hat compensates for this ghost inventory and the upcoming Christmas/New Year demand.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand baseline lifted to 60 units/week (total mu_hat 240 for L=3) to account for seasonal lingerie gifting patterns, similar to the Mother's Day trend detected in Q2.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019, entering the peak holiday shopping week. Historically, this SKU (lingerie) saw a massive demand spike during Mother's Day, and a similar year-end holiday effect is anticipated. While demand in P43-P44 was low (17 and 19 units), these periods often represent the 'calm before the storm' in retail, or stockouts (on-hand has been 0 for multiple periods). I am maintaining the mu_hat forecast at 60 units/week to prepare for this spike, which translates to 240 units for a 4-period cycle (L=3). The in-transit inventory is high (295 units), but contains significant 'dead' inventory from historical lost shipments (P10, P13, P17, and likely others), totaling approximately 100-120 units that will never arrive. Lead times for surviving orders continue to trend at 3 periods. By setting L=3 and mu_hat=240, the OR backend's order calculation will account for the 3nd-period arrival delay and the seasonal demand lift, while the capped policy will prevent excessive over-ordering if the pipeline contains surviving units.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand baseline maintained at 60 units/week despite low P43-P44 observations to protect against anticipated seasonal spike. Pipeline inventory is confirmed to be structurally overstated by ~115 units due to confirmed losses (P1, P3, P10, P13, P17).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the holiday shopping season for lingerie. Historical patterns from Q2 (Mother's Day) showed demand spiking to ~163 units. While P43-P45 demand was low (avg 21), these likely represent the 'calm before the storm' or pre-holiday lull. To protect against a Christmas/New Year spike, I am maintaining mu_hat at an explicit value of 240, reflecting a forecasted weekly mean of 60 over a 4-period window (L=3 + 1). On-hand inventory is 57. The pipeline (211 units) is structurally over-reported due to the persistent ~25% cargo loss rate; specifically, shipments P1, P3, P10, P13, and P17 (totaling ~115 units) are confirmed lost and never arrived. Removing these 'phantom units' leaves an effective pipeline of 96 units. Setting L=3 reflects the frequent delivery delays observed throughout Q3 and Q4. This high mu_hat and conservative L will trigger a necessary replenishment order to bridge the gap between effective stock and the anticipated seasonal peak.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 30, following the Christmas/Holiday peak. Historical data for this 'Push-up bra' shows demand peaks coincide with gifting seasons (Mother's Day in Q2 saw demand hit 163). While December demand (P43-P46) has been lower than the Q2 spike (averaging ~21 units/week), we must remain cautious of late-holiday spending or early New Year resets. The lead time (L) is consistently tracking at 3 periods for surviving shipments. Pipeline inventory (211 units) is significantly inflated by historical lost shipments (P10, P13, P17, etc.); approximately 120-130 units in the pipeline are likely lost based on the established 25-30% loss rate. To compensate for this 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive, I am maintaining a conservative mu_hat of 120 (approx 30 units/week across 4 periods) to ensure the backend continues to place small replenishment orders as needed, while avoiding overstocking if the winter peak remains muted. I use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat to capture the lower Q4 demand regime while keeping \u03c3\u0302 calculation focused on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand (late Dec) has settled at a lower regime of ~21 units/week (P43-P46), which is lower than the Q1/Q2 baselines. Structural pipeline overstatement due to cumulative lost shipments is estimated at ~125 units.
