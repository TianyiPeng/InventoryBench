The average demand over the last 5 weeks is approximately 342. Since Feb 11th is post-New Year resolutions but pre-spring, I expect demand to remain stable around the 350-380 range. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Placement in P1 means arrival in P3 resolution, visible in P4. d) Inventory/Pipeline: Currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. e) Decision: To cover demand for P1, P2, and P3 (the periods before the first shipment arrives) plus a buffer for P4 demand, I need to stock up immediately. Total pipeline target for L+1 periods (2+1 = 3 periods) plus current period (since demand starts now) suggests a 4-week coverage. 350 * 4 = 1400 units.

Period 1 demand was 325, consistent with this history. There is no clear trend up or down yet; demand appears stable around 340-350 units/week. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2. The Period 1 order (1400 units) is expected to arrive at the start of Period 4 (Decision Day P1 + 2 = Arrival Day P3, visible at start of P4). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Demand for P1 (325) was lost because on-hand was 0. In-transit is 1400 units, which covers roughly 4 weeks of demand (~350 * 4). e) Final Order Logic: Since I am currently out of stock and have a lead time of 2, I need to ensure that the pipeline covers\u9700\u6c42 (L+1) = 3 periods plus safety stock. Currently, in-transit (1400) covers ~4 weeks. However, since P1 demand was 325 and I currently have 0 on hand, I will be out of stock for P2 and P3 as well. Total missed demand so far (P1-P3) will be ~1000 units. The 1400 coming in P4 will only leave ~400 available for P4. To prevent a stockout in P5/P6, I need more inventory. I will order 700 units now to cover P5 and P6 demand (~350 per week).",

Recent real-time demand in Period 1 (325) and Period 2 (421) confirms this growth regime, likely driven by 'New Year, New Me' fitness trends and approaching spring activity. Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 0. Currently, 2,100 units are in-transit (1,400 ordered P1, 700 ordered P2). Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2. Following the timeline, the P1 order (1,400) is scheduled to arrive DURING Period 3 and will be visible at the start of P4. The P2 order (700) is scheduled for P4 and visible at P5. Forecasting: Demand is averaging ~370-400. To cover L+1 periods (L=2, so 3 periods: P3, P4, P5), I need ~1,200 units. Pipeline check: In-transit (2,100) already covers expected demand for the next three periods. However, I currently have 0 on-hand and sold 0 units in P1/P2 due to stockout (lost profit). Since P1 order of 1,400 should arrive this period (P3) to satisfy P3 demand, I need to ensure I don't over-order given the high holding cost ($1/unit) relative to profit ($1/unit). Cumulative demand for P3-P5 is estimated at 1,200-1,300. Pipeline is 2,100. I am already over-extended if lead times hold. I will place a 0 order this period to allow the pipeline to clear and avoid excessive holding costs, as I expect the 1,400 units arriving now to satisfy demand through P6.",

Average is ~336, but the trend is downward. Moving forward, I estimate demand at ~300. c) Lead Time/Missing Orders: The order from Period 1 (1400 units) is now 3 periods overdue (expected P3, currently starting P6). It is highly likely lost. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on the promised lead time (2 periods). d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 130. In-transit consists of P5 order (700 units, due P7).

Re-evaluating: Period 6 'arrived=700 (ordered P5)' means 700 are now on-hand. In-transit should be 400 (from P6) + 700 (if P5 was 1400? No, P5 was 700). Let's look at the In-transit status (1800). If P1 (1400) is still counted as in-transit but lost, and P6 (400) is in-transit, that equals 1800.

While Period 12 showed a bump to 175 (likely short-term variability or local promotion), the overall trend from Period 10-12 averages ~124 units. On-hand inventory is 190. In-transit inventory includes a massive 1500-unit shipment (ordered Period 1, presumed lost but technically still in pipeline status) and multiple smaller orders. However, looking at the in-transit field specifically, it says 1500 units. My previous logic treated Period 1's 1400 units as lost. Even if they remain lost, I have 190 on hand and 100 units from Period 10 arriving soon (Lead time varies between 1-2). Current demand is low (~125 avg). With 190 on hand, I can cover the next period's demand without an additional order, especially since I am already carrying significant holding costs ($1/unit) and the product is in a seasonal trough. No new order is necessary until the massive in-transit situation is clarified or on-hand stock dips further.",

  "rationale": "The current date is December 23, 2019. The product is SUPREME sports tights, which experienced peak demand in February (~400 units/period) and has since fallen to a very low winter floor, averaging ~5 units over the last 5 periods (P41-P45). While January usually sees a 'New Year, New Me' fitness spike, the historical data provided for January 2019 (292, 300, 355, 391) suggests the surge begins in the first full week of January. Given the lead time of 2 periods, an order placed now (P46) would arrive at the start of P49 (late January). We currently have 188 units on-hand. With demand currently <10 units/period, these 188 units are sufficient to cover the low end of December and the initial rise in January demand (expected to hit ~300 by mid-to-late Jan). Monitoring the pipeline, the 'In-transit' figure of 1500 remains contaminated by a confirmed lost shipment from Period 1 (1400 units). Therefore, effective inventory is 188 on-hand + 100 in-transit (from P10, likely also lost but negligible). Since 188 units cover >20 periods of current demand and at least 2-3 weeks of peak January demand, there is no immediate risk of stockout. Over-ordering now would incur excessive holding costs ($1/unit).",

  "rationale": "The product is 'SUPREME tights', a fitness-oriented garment. Current date is December 30, 2019. Historically, demand for this SKU peaked in January and February (292-421 units/period), coinciding with New Year fitness resolutions. Throughout autumn and winter (Periods 35-46), demand has been extremely low, averaging <6 units/period. We are now entering the critical 'New Year' resolution window where demand is expected to spike significantly based on the start of the historical data (Jan 7: 292, Jan 14: 300). Current on-hand inventory is 186 units. In-transit (1500) consists of a long-lost order from P1 (1400 units) and a newer order of 100 which has not arrived; effectively, we should rely primarily on on-hand. To prepare for the imminent January surge (expected ~300+ units/week), I need to replenish inventory. The promised lead time is 2 periods. An order placed now (P47) will arrive in P49. I must ensure I have enough stock for P47, P48, and P49. Expected demand P47/P48: ~10 units combined. Expected demand P49: ~300 units. Total needs ~310. With 186 on-hand, I am short for the peak.
