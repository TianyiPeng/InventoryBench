Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 448509014 (Perrie Slim Mom Denim). Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 3, 175, 168, 106, 278. The latest data point (Feb 04) is the highest yet. Given the product is a denim trouser and we are entering February/March, we are likely seeing early Spring season demand growth. With a promised lead time of L=2, the OR engine needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Using the recent 3 samples (168, 106, 278) provides a mean of ~184. Over 3 periods, mu_hat should be approximately 552. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this recent momentum and volatility while keeping the lead time at its default promised value of 2.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a 'Slim Mom Denim TRS'. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend from Jan to Feb (P-4: 3, P-3: 175, P-2: 168, P-1: 106, P0: 278). Period 1 (last week) had a demand of 258, which was entirely lost as stock-out (sold=0) because the first order was only placed in Period 1. The Promised Lead Time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 (328 units) is expected to arrive in P3 (visible in P4 start). We currently have 0 on-hand and 328 in-transit. Given the rising demand trend into February, I am using recent history (recent_N=4) to capture the higher volume compared to the very low initial sample on 2019-01-07. For L, I will stick to 'default' (promised=2) since we have no completed arrival data yet to suggest a lead time shift. I'll use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent higher demand periods (P0, P-1, P-2, P-3) more heavily than the initial outlier low demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a pair of slim mom denim jeans, a staple item with seasonal relevance in late winter/early spring. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) show an upward trend: 3, 175, 168, 106, 278. Recent concluded demand for Periods 1 and 2 was 258 and 315, confirming a shift to a higher demand regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 608 units in transit (328 from P1, 280 from P2). The promised lead time is 2, meaning the P1 order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the P3 conclude message (ready for reading in P4). Since we have no concluded arrivals yet, we maintain L=default (2). For mu_hat, the last 3 available demand data points (P2 conclude: 315, P1 conclude: 258, and Feb 4th sample: 278) average to 283.6. Using N=3 for recent_N captures this current high-demand state (~284 units/week). Sigma_hat is set to default as we need more stable history to adjust volatility precisely.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demand (P-4 to P0) was [3, 175, 168, 106, 278]. Since the game started (P1), realized demand has been [258, 315, 291], showing a significant increase from the early pre-game samples. The promised lead time (L) is 2. No orders have arrived yet (P1, P2, P3 concludes show 0 arrival), which is expected: the P1 order (ordered P1) should arrive in P1+2=P3 and be reported in P4's conclude. Since we are currently at the start of P4's decision phase, we haven't seen the P3 conclude yet. The product is a denim trouser for the transition into spring, explaining the demand rise. Current on-hand is 0, with 851 units in-transit (P1-3 orders). I will set mu_hat using the 3 recent game-play demand samples (avg ~288) to adapt to the higher regime, and use the promised lead time L=2. Total units to cover (L+1=3) periods is approximately 3 * 288 = 864.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1: demand increased from pre-game average (~145) to gameplay average (~288) as spring approaches.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is 'Slim Mom Denim', which is a spring/summer staple. Demand has consistently increased from Feb (avg ~288) into early March (reached 335). There is a critical inventory shortage: we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have missed significant sales (sold 280 vs demand 335 in Period 4). The promised lead time is 2, and Period 2's order arrived exactly on time (2 periods). However, the Period 1 order (328 units) is now 2 periods overdue (should have arrived in Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start). This suggests the Period 1 shipment is likely lost. I will set L to 2 (promised). For demand, I'll use a recent_N of 4 to capture the high-demand regime observed since gameplay started (avg ~300). I am opting for explicit mu_hat to ensure we aggressively restock to cover the 0 on-hand and the likely lost shipment, setting it to (1+L)*320 to reflect the current upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Shipment from Period 1 (328 units) is confirmed lost/highly overdue as it is 2 periods past expected arrival with no conclude message.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Slim Mom Denim TRS' (jeans), which typically sees high demand in spring. Demand has stabilized at a high level, averaging ~314 units over the last 5 periods (258, 315, 291, 335, 332). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts. The shipment from Period 1 (328 units) is confirmed lost (promised L=2, now at P6 with no arrival). The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2). Total in-transit is 900 units (Orders from P3, P4, P5). We need to maintain a high base stock to recover from stockouts and account for the high demand and the lost shipment. Using recent_N for mu_hat based on the last 5 gameplay periods to capture the spring demand shift.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/3/25. We are entering the spring season, and the product (Slim Mom Denim TRS) is showing a strong, consistent demand regime. Recent demand (last 6 periods) averages 304 units per week, significantly higher than early Jan/Feb data. The shipment from Period 1 (328 units) is officially confirmed lost after 6 periods. The shipment from Period 3 (243 units) is also highly suspect as it is now 2 periods past promised lead time. The Period 5 order arrived in 1 period, suggesting variable actual lead times. Given high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0), the optimal service level is 50% (z=0), meaning we aim to have roughly one lead-time interval of demand on hand. However, because of the high likelihood of lost shipments (P1 and potentially P3), I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current 300+ demand regime and maintain L=2 as the planning horizon. I will use recent_N for sigma based on the high-demand regime (N=3) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 3 (243 units) is likely lost (2 periods past promised L=2). Inventory strategy must now assume a significant loss rate for incoming shipments in this environment.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), we are entering the peak spring season for 'Slim Mom Denim TRS'. Demand has increased significantly, reaching 413 units in Period 7. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of the delivery history indicates a highly unreliable supply chain: P1 (328 units) is definitely lost (6 periods late), P3 (243 units) is likely lost (4 periods late), and P4 (13 units) is now 1 period overdue. Conversely, P5 arrived in just 1 period. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock' to calculate orders. Currently, 'In-transit' is 893, but this includes P1 (328) and P3 (243) which are likely lost. To bridge this, I am setting 'explicit' parameters. I will target a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) at the current high-demand regime (approx 350-400 units/week). To offset the ~571 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (lost orders P1 and P3), I will set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat - pipeline) generates a meaningful order for Period 8 to capture spring demand. I'll use L=2 (promised) and mu_hat = (1+2)*480 \u2248 1440 to force an order around 500-600 units, accounting for 'loss' in the system.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain reliability is verified as low: P1 (328 units) and P3 (243 units) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Aggressive ordering is required to compensate for pipeline inventory that will likely never arrive.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are seeing a significant demand surge for the 'Slim Mom Denim TRS' as spring progresses. Recent demand peaked at 521 units in Period 8. The mean demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 400 units. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: orders from Period 1 (328 units) and Period 3 (243 units) are definitively lost. While recent lead times have fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods, the 'In-transit' figure of 1131 units includes the 571 lost units. To compensate for this 'ghost' inventory in the OR engine's logic (which subtracts pipeline from base stock), I must provide an explicit mu_hat that covers the actual demand plus the lost units. Base stock target should be (L+1)*Demand. With L=2, target is 3*400 = 1200. Since the OR engine subtracts 1131 in-transit, I set mu_hat explicitly high to 1700 to force an order that replenishes the current 0 on-hand inventory and prepares for May demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: average weekly demand increased to ~400 units in April from ~300 in March. Net loss of 571 units of pipeline inventory (P1 and P3) continues to necessitate inflated mu_hat values to bypass the 'pipeline-offset' logic in the base-stock formula.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15. The product is a seasonal denim item (jeans). We are in a high-demand spring period, though Period 9 saw a temporary dip to 220. We have 0 on-hand inventory and the backend believes we have 1700 units in-transit. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 571 units (from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Because the OR backend formula 'final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory' counts all 1700 units as valid 'pipeline_inventory', it will likely under-order unless we artificially inflate mu_hat to offset these ghosts. Recent demand (P7-P9) averages 384 units/period. The promised lead time L=2 is being treated as L=1 or L=2 physically, but to ensure the base stock calculation (which uses (1+L)*demand) covers the pipeline gap, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target stock should cover (1+L) periods (~3 periods) plus the 571 units of 'ghost' inventory. (3 * 400 demand) + 571 = 1771. Setting mu_hat to 1771 effectively forces the backend to ignore the fake pipeline and place a meaningful order.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Demand volatility observed (Period 9 dip to 220), but average remains near 400. Statistical pipeline inflation (+571 units) remains necessary to combat the ghost inventory from P1 and P3 in the OR backend logic.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the product 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is in the heart of the spring/summer peak. Recent demand has fluctuated (P9: 220, P10: 199) following a significant spike in Period 8 (521). The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 337 units. However, we are dealing with a critical supply chain issue: two shipments (P1: 328 units and P3: 243 units) totaling 571 units are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (including these 'ghost' units) from the base stock targets, we must artificially inflate our demand forecast (mu_hat) to offset these 571 units and ensure the engine places orders. We set L to the promised 2 periods (actual performance has varied between 1 and 2). To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) plus the 571 ghost units: Estimated demand (337 * 3) + 571 units \u2248 1582. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current high volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), we are dealing with high-waisted denim jeans. Demand has shown significant volatility in April, peaking at 521 in Period 8 and then dropping to the 176-220 range in Periods 9-11. The previous extreme 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments P1 and P3 totaling 571 units) is still present in the 'In-transit' figure of 665. Current On-hand inventory is 741, which covers roughly 3-4 periods of recent demand. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). Since in_transit (665) incorrectly includes the lost 571 units, we must continue to inflate mu_hat to ensure the OR engine doesn't under-order. Recent demand (last 3 periods) average is 198. With L=2, the base stock should cover 3 periods (~600 units). However, the 'pipeline' visible to the OR engine is 741 (on-hand) + 665 (in-transit) = 1406. To trigger any order at all, mu_hat would need to exceed 1406. Given the current surplus on-hand (741), we do not need to order immediately. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 400 * (1+L) = 1200 to stabilize, acknowledging that no order will be placed this period due to high current stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand has settled lower in late April (avg ~198) compared to early April peak (521). The 'ghost inventory' of 571 units continues to distort the OR engine's pipeline calculation.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019/05/06). Current on-hand inventory is 572 units. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has stabilized lower at an average of ~181 units, significantly down from the April peak. In-transit inventory stands at 665 units, but history confirms that 571 units of this (from Period 1 and Period 3 orders) are 'ghost inventory' (lost/indefinitely delayed). The OR backend formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) treats all 665 units as real and subtracts them from the target order. If we use the actual demand mean (~181) and L=2, mu_hat would be ~543 (181 * 3). Subtracting the 665 units of pipeline would lead to a zero order, which is acceptable now given high on-hand stock (572). However, to prevent being under-stocked once the current on-hand units are sold, we must continue to 'inflate' mu_hat by the lost 571 units to ensure the OR engine targets a real usable stock levels. Setting mu_hat to (181 * 3) + 571 = 1114. Sigma_hat is calculated for the recent regime (last 4 samples) to capture current lower volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (May 13). Demand for this denim product peaked in early April (~521) and has steadily declined through May (recent 4-week average ~163). On-hand inventory is 471 units, and the backend shows 655 in-transit. Crucially, the 'in-transit' total includes 571 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are long-confirmed lost (carry-over insights). This 'ghost inventory' reduces the OR engine's order amount because it assumes those units will arrive. To prevent the engine from under-ordering when inventory is depleted, I must continue to apply a buffer to mu_hat. However, because current on-hand (471) is high relative to current demand (~160s) and covers nearly 3 weeks, no immediate order is needed this period. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the cooling seasonal demand while maintaining L=2.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: May average is ~140, down from April peak of ~520. Ghost inventory of 571 units (P1, P3) remains in pipeline calculations.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/20. Recent demand data shows a clear downward shift in May (P13: 111, P14: 107) compared to the April peak. Moving from a spring high to a late-spring/early-summer cool-off for denim trousers. The 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 (328) and Period 3 (243), totaling 571 units, remains in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation despite being lost. The current pipeline inventory is reported as 655 units, but 571 of those units are lost shipments, meaning the functional pipeline is only 84 units (likely upcoming minor adjustments or zeroed out). With On-hand inventory at 364 units and a current demand rate of ~110/week, we have over 3 periods of stock remaining. The OR backend formula (Base stock - Pipeline) will subtract the full 655 units of 'ghost inventory' from any calculated target. Since my target base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods at ~110 units/week is ~330, and the logic subtracts 655, the OR engine will order 0 unless I artificially inflate mu_hat. However, given the current surplus (364 on-hand units exceed the expected demand of 330 for the next 3 weeks), a 0 order is actually the correct operational decision. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to reflect the current low demand regime (~130 including the P12 sample) and default for others.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27th), demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has significantly cooled, dropping from April peaks (~520) to a May average of approximately 100 units. On-hand inventory is 280, which is enough to cover nearly 3 weeks of current demand. However, the OR backend logic is still factoring in a 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 571 units (from orders in P1 and P3 that are confirmed lost), which prevents the engine from ordering even if demand starts to recover. Currently, since on-hand is already sufficient for current demand and we want to allow holding costs to decrease, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (last 4 periods, approx 102 units/week). L is set to calculate (avg L=1.57) to ensure the backend uses realistic lead times. No immediate ordering is desired given the high on-hand and declining seasonal demand trend heading into June.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: May demand stabilized at a much lower level (~100 units/week) compared to April (~400 units/week).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. Demand has significantly cooled as we move into summer, with the last four weeks averaging ~94 units (111, 107, 84, 75). The current on-hand inventory is 205 units, which covers over two weeks of recent demand. However, the system reports 'In-transit' as 655 units. Based on historical data, this pipeline includes 571 'ghost units' from Period 1 (328) and Period 3 (243) that are confirmed lost. The actual viable in-transit inventory is 84 units (likely the orders from P10-P11, though those amounts were small and most have arrived). The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to calculate orders. To ensure the backend places an order when needed despite the 571-unit ghost inventory, mu_hat must be inflated by that amount. However, with 205 on-hand and demand dropping, the priority is to avoid overstocking while holding costs equal profit ($1.0). I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand (~95 * 3 = 285) plus the 571 ghost units to neutralize the pipeline calculation, totaling 856. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of the current low-demand regime (approx 18) scaled for (1+L).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 18 (2019/6/10). The product is 'Slim Mom Denim TRS'. Demand has steadily declined from an April peak (~520 units) to a stable low in June (last four periods: 111, 107, 84, 75, 60), averaging ~87 units over the last 5 weeks. This reflects seasonality as heavier denim demand fades into summer. On-hand inventory is 145 units, which is sufficient for approximately 1.5-2 weeks of current demand. Key Constraint: The OR backend 'pipeline-inventory' calculation still includes 571 'ghost' units from Period 1 (328) and Period 3 (243) that are confirmed lost. Total in-transit is reported as 655 units, leaving only 84 units (from the order in Period 10) likely to actually arrive. Because (Base Stock - Pipeline) must be positive to trigger an order, and the ghost units (571) far exceed current demand needs, no new orders can be triggered without extreme mu_hat inflation. However, given the high on-hand inventory (145) relative to current demand (~75/week), we do not need to order yet. We will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (N=5) to maintain accurate base stock levels, while continuing to monitor the excess on-hand safety buffer.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (mid-June), demand for 'Slim Mom Denim TRS' is in a clear downward trend, consistent with seasonal shifts where heavy denim demand decreases in summer months. The last five weeks of demand (P14-P18) show values of 107, 84, 75, 60, and 46, dropping significantly below the May average of ~100. Current on-hand inventory is 99 units, while the OR engine sees a 'pipeline' (in-transit) of 655 units. However, we know 571 of those units (from P1 and P3) were lost months ago. The effective pipeline is actually only 84 units (655 - 571). With current demand averaging ~50-60 units/week, the on-hand stock (99) plus the real pipeline (84) is sufficient for about 3 weeks, which matches the L+1 window. However, the OR backend's formula (base_stock - pipeline) will see 655 units of 'ghost' inventory and refuse to order even if needed. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (capturing the recent low-demand regime of ~75 units/week) and use 'explicit' for L to set it at 2. Since on-hand inventory is currently high relative to the declining demand, no new orders are necessary, but I must ensure the parameters prevent a massive stock-out if the ghost inventory calculation becomes too restrictive in future periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: June demand has dropped to an average of ~50 units/week, significantly lower than the May average of ~100, indicating late-season tapering.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), demand for this specific denim SKU continues its late-season decline. The average demand over the last three periods (P17-P19) is approximately 53 units/week, down from 100 units/week in May and 400+ in April. The system currently shows 44 units on-hand and 655 units in-transit. Crucially, 571 of those in-transit units (from P1 and P3) are 'ghost inventory' that were lost or permanently delayed months ago, as established in the carry-over insights. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these ghost units, mu_hat must be set to cover the desired base stock plus the volume of the lost shipments. However, given that current on-hand inventory (44) combined with the expected weekly demand (~50) and high holding costs ($1/unit), No new orders are likely needed. Even though the backend 'pipeline' logic is distorted by 571 units, the actual stock is sufficient for current demand levels. I will set mu_hat using the recent 3-period average to reflect the current low-demand regime and use default lead time, as actual lead times for successful orders have stayed around 1.5-2 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st. Demand has entered a low-season regime, consistently declining since the April peak. The average demand over the last 4 weeks (Periods 17-20) is approximately 49.75 units. Despite this low demand, the OR engine's 'pipeline inventory' calculation is heavily distorted by 571 'ghost' units from Period 1 and Period 3 orders that never arrived and are long confirmed as lost. With on-hand inventory at 6 units and a distorted 'In-transit' figure of 655 units (which includes the 571 lost units and the 71+10+0... from P10-P20), the OR backend will never place an order unless we bypass its logic. However, given demand is only ~50 units/week and on-hand is 6, we technically need more stock. But the total ghost inventory (571) plus recent (P10) order of 71 and (P11) order of 10 creates a massive artificial stock cushion. To force an order to maintain service levels for the ~50 units/week demand (mu_hat needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods, ~150 units), mu_hat must technically exceed the pipeline value. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and declining trend, I will set mu_hat to 150 (3 * 50) naturally using recent_N, but acknowledge that the backend logic 'order = base_stock - pipeline' will result in 0 anyway because pipeline (655) > base_stock. Since demand is so low and we are in a 'clearance' phase for summer denim (high waist slim jeans), the risk of lost sales is outweighed by the penalty of holding cost on any new large orders. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the stable June/July floor.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8). The product is 'Slim Mom Denim', which has seen a significant seasonal decline from an April peak of ~520 units to recent July demand near ~40 units (average of last 4 periods excluding the P21 spike is ~37, including spike is ~60). The 'ghost inventory' of 571 units (lost P1 and P3 orders) still technically exists in the 'In-transit' total of 655 units (the other 84 units are likely later small orders never reconciled or actual drift). Because on-hand is now 0 and P21 demand spiked to 109, a small replenishment is needed. However, the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from its target 'Base Stock'. Since 571 of those units will never arrive, I must inflate mu_hat significantly to force an order. Target safety stock for 3 periods (L+1) at current demand (~60/wk) is ~180 units. To bypass the 655 pipeline offset, mu_hat must be set to approximately 835 (655 + 180). L=2 is maintained as the standard lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: July demand showing a slight mid-summer rebound/volatility (P21 = 109) compared to the late-June trough (~40). Strategy shifted to low-volume replenishment while maintaining large mu_hat inflation to bypass ghost inventory.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (July 15), we observe a significant mid-summer demand surge (P21=109, P22=165). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the in-transit pipeline (835 units) is heavily distorted by 571 'ghost units' from Period 1 and Period 3 that were confirmed lost. Consequently, the OR backend perceives 571 units that do not actually exist, causing it to under-order or not order at all. To force a replenishment order that covers the current demand level (~150 units/week) while overcoming the 571-unit pipeline penalty, I must set mu_hat (the basis for the base-stock) significantly higher than the actual expected demand. A mu_hat of 1200 reflects a target base-stock that, after subtracting the 'ghost' pipeline and current real in-transit (180 from P22 + 71 from P10 + 13 from P4 - oh wait, P10 and P4 units arrived, the 835 includes P1, P3, and P22, plus remnants), will trigger an order to maintain service levels during this July peak.

Carry-over insight: July demand surge confirmed: Demand has risen from ~40 to ~165 over the last two periods, necessitating a pivot from the late-season tapering strategy to active replenishment.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 448509014 (jeans) is experiencing a significant mid-summer demand surge. Demand increased from a trough of ~40 to 109, 165, and now 222 units in Period 23. This is likely a 'back-to-school' or late-summer fashion peak. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1 and P3 totaling 571 units) still sits in the pipeline, which the OR engine subtracts from the base stock. To trigger a real order, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 571-unit offset. Given current demand is ~220 and L=2, the required coverage is ~660 units. Adding the 571-unit ghost offset requires a total 'virtual base stock' of ~1231. To ensure the backend places an order of sufficient size to meet this trend, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 1230. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to reflect high volatility and maintain a high service level during this surge. L is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) as recent arrivals have shown variability (some L=1, some L=2).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (109, 165, 222), representing a clear departure from the June trough of ~45.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/07/29) context: Mid-summer demand for this denim SKU has surged over the last four periods (109, 165, 222, 164), averaging ~165 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments P1 and P3 total 571 units) remains in the 'In-transit' calculation (1230 total in-transit - 571 ghost = 659 actual units expected from P23 and P24). To force the OR backend's base-stock formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to place a replenishment order despite the ghost inventory, mu_hat must be inflated to cover both the real demand forecast and the 571-unit pipeline deficit. Forecast: Since demand seems to have plateaued after the surge, I'll use a 4-week average (~165) for future demand. Calculation: L=2, so (L+1) = 3 periods. Target base stock = (3 * 165) + desired safety stock (~170) + ghost inventory (571) \u2248 1236. Therefore, mu_hat (which the backend treats as (1+L) * mean) should be set to approximately 1066 (so that 1066 + safety stock offsets the 571 units already 'counted' as in-transit). I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to ensure this bypass. Sigma_hat is set relatively high (120) to maintain a higher service level during this volatile summer surge.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5, 2019), the product is experiencing a sustained mid-summer demand surge. Recent demand samples over the last four periods are 165, 222, 164, and 170, averaging approximately 180 units per week. This is a significant increase from the June lows of ~45. The 'ghost inventory' of 571 units (from orders in Period 1 and Period 3) remains in the pipeline, as there have been no conclude messages for them. With an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit balance of 1230 units (which includes the 571 units of ghost inventory), the OR backend's base-stock formula (base_stock - pipeline) will effectively subtract 1230 units from the target level. To ensure the backend places an order that covers replenishment plus the demand for the lead time (L=2, total 3 periods), mu_hat must be set to a value where mu_hat > 1230 + (Expected Demand * 3). Using a trailing average of 180, we need a base stock around 180 * 3 = 540 plus the 1230 offset = 1770. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1800 to bypass the pipeline distortion and ensure inventory flows to meet the current demand of ~180/week.

Carry-over insight: August demand regime confirmed: weekly demand has stabilized at ~175-180 units, up from the June trough of ~45. Ghost inventory from P1 and P3 (571 units) continues to require artificial mu_hat inflation for the OR backend to trigger orders.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27 (mid-August), the denim item continues a sustained summer demand regime, with recent demand samples of 222, 164, 170, and 242. The current avg demand is ~175. However, we are battling a significant 'ghost inventory' issue: 571 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are lost but remain in the 'In-transit' pipeline (Total In-transit: 1435, while only ~864 units are realistically coming: P24=210, P25=0, P26=570, plus some residual long-delayed shipments). To ensure the OR backend (Base Stock = mu_hat - pipeline) actually places an order, mu_hat must be inflated to cover both the projected demand for (L+1) periods (3 * 175 = 525) and the 571-unit ghost inventory, totaling ~1096. Setting mu_hat to 1100 with an explicit value ensures a positive order is generated. L is set to explicit 2 (the promised value and recent average), and sigma is set to explicit 40 to account for recent demand volatility (164 to 242).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Analysis of recent demand (Period 23: 222, Period 24: 164, Period 25: 170, Period 26: 242, Period 27: 294) shows a steady late-summer demand surge, with a 5-period average of ~218 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 1435 includes 571 units of 'ghost inventory' from periods 1 and 3 that are confirmed lost. The active pipeline consists of orders from Period 24 (210 units) and Period 26 (570 units). Since P24 is now 4 periods old and has not arrived, it may be delayed or lost given the observed unreliability. To trigger further ordering and overcome the 571 'ghost' units while meeting the ~218 unit weekly demand, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) demand PLUS the ghost inventory. Calculation: (3 periods * 218) + 571 = 1225. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual variability (recent arrivals were L=1 and L=3).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Late-summer demand surge confirmed with avg ~218 units/week over the last 5 periods. Supply chain unreliability continues; Period 24 order (210 units) is now 2 periods past promised lead time with no conclusion, potentially adding to the 571 units of lost inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/26, targeting the late-August demand period. Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of ~218 units/week (last 5 periods: 164, 170, 242, 294, 200). Pipeline integrity is severely compromised by 'ghost inventory' - orders that the OR backend expects to arrive but are likely lost. Confirmed lost: P1 (328) and P3 (243). Highly probable lost: P24 (210), which is now 3 periods past promised lead time with no conclusion. This brings the total estimated lost pipeline to 781 units (328+243+210). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base_stock to determine the order, I must inflate mu_hat to bypass this. My target base_stock is ~650 units (3 periods of ~218 units). Formula: (Actual mu_hat + Ghost Pipeline) = (218 * 3 + 781) \u2248 1435. Setting mu_hat to 1435 and sigma_hat to 150 ensures the base_stock calculation remains high enough to trigger an actual order for physical replenishment despite the 1435 'in-transit' units listed in the system.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain unreliability escalation: Period 24 order (210 units) is confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Total 'ghost inventory' distorting the pipeline calculation is now 781 units (P1: 328, P3: 243, P24: 210).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), demand for the 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has stabilized in a late-summer/early-fall regime, averaging approximately 220 units per week over the last five periods (242, 294, 200, 175). The primary operational challenge remains the high volume of 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Orders from P1 (328), P3 (243), and now P24 (210) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 781 units that the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from any new order calculation. To force the system to order despite this 781-unit deficit, I must set mu_hat (the (1+L) period demand) to a value that exceeds ('on-hand' + 'in-transit' - 'lost units'). Currently, In-transit is 1435. Net of lost units, the 'real' in-transit is 1435 - 781 = 654 units. On-hand is 0. To trigger a replenishment that covers (1+L=3) periods of demand at ~220/week (total 660 units), the mu_hat parameter must be set high enough to clear the total 1435 pipeline. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1450 to ensure the base_stock logic triggers a meaningful order while accounting for the ~220/week demand and the 781-unit pipeline distortion. Sigma_hat is set to 100 to provide a sufficient buffer for the recent volatility (range 175-294).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 31 (Sept 9). This is a 'Slim Mom Denim' SKU. Demand remains strong in late summer/early autumn, averaging 231 units/week over the last 5 periods (242, 294, 200, 175, 282). On-hand inventory is 0. 

Supply Chain Distortion: As documented in carry-over insights, the environment has effectively lost orders from P1 (328), P3 (243), and P24 (210), totaling 781 'ghost' units. Additionally, the P26 order (570 units) is now overdue (3 periods past order, 1 period past promised L=2). This brings the total distorted pipeline to 1,351 units (781 lost + 570 late/missing). The current In-Transit displays 1450, which includes these ghost units plus the small P30 order (15 units) and likely other unaccounted pipeline.

Strategy: To trigger an order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to exceed the current pipeline + desired safety stock. With ~230 demand/week and L=2 (Review+Lead = 3), the true requirement is ~690 units. Adding the 1,351 ghost units, mu_hat needs to be ~2041 to force a net order of roughly 600-700 units. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass the standard logic and correct for the pipeline error. Sigma_hat is set to 200 (explicit) to reflect high demand volatility (range 175-294).

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Supply chain instability continues. The order from Period 26 (570 units) is now overdue (3 periods elapsed), potentially increasing the total lost/ghost inventory to 1,351 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 16, 2019. Demand has surged again in late summer/early autumn, with the last two periods showing 282 and 286 units. The supply chain remains highly unreliable; specifically, the large order of 570 units from Period 26 is now 5 periods past its order date (promised L=2) with no arrival, confirming it as 'ghost inventory' along with previous losses from P1, P3, and P24. Total ghost inventory is now 1,351 units (P1: 328, P3: 243, P24: 210, P26: 570). With 2,041 units technically 'In-transit', the OR backend believes we are overstocked, even though On-hand is 0 and the pipeline is largely comprised of lost shipments. To trigger a replenishment order, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the ghost pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 2,400 to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~3 * 300 = 900) plus the 1,351 ghost units, forcing the system to place an order. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Period 26 order (570 units) is confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Total 'ghost inventory' distorting the pipeline calculation is now 1,351 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-108.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' remains steady in the late-summer/early-autumn regime, with the most recent demand sample at 249 and a 5-period average of ~238. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a cumulative 'ghost inventory' of 1,351 units (P1: 328, P3: 243, P24: 210, P26: 570) that the OR backend incorrectly views as valid pipeline supply. To trigger any replenishment, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed [on-hand (357) + total in-transit (1794)]. Current total pipeline is 2,151 units. To bypass the base-stock logic and allow for current demand coverage (approx 240/week), mu_hat is set explicitly to 2,870. This value accounts for the ghost inventory (1,351) plus a forecasted need for 3 weeks of demand (~240 * 3 = 720) plus a safety buffer to ensure an order is generated despite the high in-transit count. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile actual lead times observed (ranging from 1 to 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $357.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (2019-09-30), we are in an autumn demand surge. Demand in Period 33 was 482, maintaining a high level. Total 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) has accumulated to 1,351 units (P1, P3, P24, P26). The OR backend sees On-hand=0 and In-transit=2513. However, 1,351 of that in-transit is confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is actually (2,513 - 1,351) = 1,162 units. To trigger a sufficient order, mu_hat must be set to cover the desired base stock PLUS the 1,351 lost units that the engine will subtract. Recent demand avg (last 4 periods) is ~325. Expected (L+1) demand is 3 * 325 = 975. To bypass the ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat to approximately 975 + 1,351 = 2,326. This forces the base stock formula (base_stock - pipeline) to result in a positive order despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: P33 demand reached 482, with a recent 4-period average of 325. Total ghost inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P24, P26) remains 1,351 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 35 (2019/10/07). Demand has entered an autumn surge phase, with P33 demand peaking at 482 and a recent 4-period average of ~320 units. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable. Ghost Inventory: Orders from P1 (328), P3 (243), P24 (210), and P26 (570) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. This creates a total 'ghost inventory' of 1,351 units that the OR backend treats as 'in-transit', preventing new orders from being placed. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. Pipeline shows 2,513 units, but 1,351 of these are effectively gone. Strategy: To force the OR backend to order despite the 1,351 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) * Expected Demand + Ghost Inventory. Using a current demand estimate of 320 units/week and L=2, the required coverage is (3 * 320) + 1351 = 2311. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 2400 to ensure the policy triggers an order to replenish the 0 on-hand stock and cover the ongoing autumn demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-47.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36 (Oct 14th), demand has stabilized at an autumn average of ~300 units/week (last 4 periods: 482, 262, 156, and historical context). The pipeline is severely distorted by 1,351 units of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P24, and P26). Because the base-stock formula (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline) subtracts these 1,351 units that will never arrive, the OR backend will not place new orders unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to exceed the current pipeline (2,154 units) plus the desired stock. Current On-hand is 203, and the only real incoming shipment is P33 (719 units). To ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order to cover the next 3 weeks of demand (~900 units) despite the 1,351-unit pipeline penalty, mu_hat is set explicitly to 2,400. This value accounts for the ghost inventory (1,351) + the target coverage (approx. 900-1,000 units). Sigma_hat is set to 250 to maintain a high service level during this autumn season.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (October 21, 2019), demand has moderated significantly from the late-September peak (P33 = 482) to a more stable autumn level (avg ~165 over P35-P36). Currently, on-hand inventory is 748 units, which is ample for several weeks of current demand. However, the OR backend logic is still burdened by 1,351 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P24, and P26) which effectively blocks the system from placing new orders until the 'pipeline' drops. Although we have enough stock for the immediate term, failing to place orders now while demand is still present could lead to a stockout later. Since 1,351 units are in the pipeline according to the engine, I will set mu_hat to 1,900. This value accounts for (L+1) demand (approx 3 * 175 = 525) plus the 1,351 units of ghost inventory, ensuring the OR engine calculates a positive order to maintain replenishment. I am using recent_N (N=4) for sigma to reflect the current moderate volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), demand has stabilized from the autumn peak (P33: 482) back to a level of approximately 170 units/week (last two periods: 174, 166). The critical issue remains the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Based on historical data, shipments from P1 (328), P3 (243), P24 (210), and P26 (570) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 1,351 units. These units are counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory formula but will never arrive to satisfy demand. Current on-hand is 582, and the legitimate in-transit inventory is likely just the P36 order (43 units), meaning the effective pipeline is only 43 units while the OR backend sees 1,478 (1,351 + 43 + potentially other untracked artifacts). To force the backend to place orders when on-hand inventory drops, mu_hat must be set to a value greater than the ghost inventory plus expected demand. For this period, with demand at ~170, the expected demand over (L+1) periods (3 periods) is ~510. Combined with ghost inventory (1,351), mu_hat needs to exceed ~1,861 to trigger any replenishment. Given the high on-hand (582), there is no immediate stockout risk, but we must maintain the mu_hat inflation for future periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-04. Observed demand has stabilized in a late-autumn regime, with the last 4 periods showing 262, 156, 174, 166, and 189 (mean ~189). We have 393 on-hand, and an in-transit balance of 1478. However, the 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost shipments (P1: 328, P3: 243, P24: 210, P26: 570) totals 1351 units. These 1351 units are in the OR engine's pipeline calculation but will never arrive. To trigger any necessary ordering, mu_hat must be set to cover (forecasted demand for lead time + review) + ghost inventory. Given L=2, the horizon is 3 periods. Forecasted demand is ~190 * 3 = 570. Adding 1351 results in a required mu_hat of 1921. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to reflect recent demand volatility. L remains 'calculate' to account for recent arrivals experiencing slightly longer lead times (P32 and P33 both took 3 periods).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), we are in a lower demand regime following an autumn peak, with recent demand averaging ~164 units (Periods 35-39). The inventory position is currently 310 on-hand plus 1,485 in-transit. Crucially, 1,351 units of the 'in-transit' inventory are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P24, P26) based on multiple periods of overdue status without arrival. This 'ghost inventory' makes the OR backend subtract 1,351 units from its order calculation. To force a replenishment order that covers the 3 periods of risk (L+1), I must set mu_hat to encompass expected demand PLUS the ghost inventory. Expected demand for 3 periods is ~492. Adding 1,351 ghost units equals 1,843. I will set mu_hat to 1,850 to ensure the backend sees a logic-defying 'required' level and triggers an order to maintain stock as we approach the end of the year, while sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for recent demand volatility (126 to 189).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (Nov 18). Current inventory: On-hand 191, In-transit 1540. Demand has cooled significantly from the early autumn peak (482) to a stable November range of ~120-130 units. However, the 'ghost inventory' problem has reached a critical level. We have 1,351 units of known lost shipments (P1, P3, P24, P26) that remain in the OR engine's pipeline calculation, falsely suggesting we are overstocked. To trigger any replenishment, the mu_hat parameter must be artificially inflated to exceed (On-hand + Ghost In-transit). Current pipeline (1540) is mostly ghost inventory; actual live orders are likely only P39 (50) and P40 (55). To maintain a service level for the current demand of ~125/week across a 3-period horizon (L+1), we need ~375 units. To force the backend to order this despite the 1,351 ghost units, mu_hat must be set above the sum of ghost inventory and desired stock (~1351 + 375 = 1726). I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1750 to ensure small maintenance orders continue as we approach the end of the year, while holding sigma_hat at recent volatility levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Maintenance phase. Demand stabilized at ~125 units/week in November. Total ghost inventory (lost shipments P1, P3, P24, P26) remains 1,351 units, requiring heavy mu_hat inflation to bypass backend pipeline logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-77.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (Period 42). Demand has stabilized at a lower level, with a recent 4-period average of approximately 104 units (126, 119, 82, and implied previous). The supply chain remains highly unreliable; we have a total of 1,351 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P24, and P26) currently counted in the in-transit/pipeline total by the OR backend. To trigger any order despite this 1,351-unit pipeline inflation, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the actual forecasted demand. With 159 on-hand and 1,509 theoretically in-transit (1,351 of which is ghost), the OR engine sees a total position of 1,668. To maintain stock for the next three periods (L+1) at ~104 units/week, I need to offset the 1,351 units plus the desired base stock. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 1,700 via the 'explicit' method to ensure the net calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in a small, positive replenishment order. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to allow for moderate volatility around this lower demand mean.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Recent demand shows a spike to 289 in Period 42, likely reflecting early holiday shopping or month-end variability, following a November average of ~125. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit pipeline is 1,541 units, but 1,351 units of this are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P24, P26), leaving an effective pipeline of only 190 units (from P40, P41, P42). To trigger replenishment in the OR engine, which treats all 1,541 units as real, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the sum of (ghost inventory + current on-hand). I will use an explicit mu_hat of 1,700 to cover the 1,351 lost units plus approximately 350 units (representative of a high-demand week like P42 or the upcoming holiday lead-time window) over the L+1 cycle. This ensures the backend calculates an order despite the distortion. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N 5' to capture the recent volatility increase.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand volatility observed entering December (P42 jump to 289). Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,351 units, requiring continued mu_hat inflation to trigger orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (Dec 9), demand remains volatile but significant (P42 reached 289, P43 was 69). The primary challenge continues to be the 'ghost inventory' of 1,351 units (from lost shipments P1, P3, P24, P26) which remain 'in-transit' in the OR engine's view, preventing new orders. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed (Pipeline + On-hand). Current In-transit is 1,626 units, which includes the 1,351 'ghost' units and recent legitimate orders from P42 (32) and P43 (159). To trigger a replenishment order that covers upcoming December demand (averaging ~125-150 with spikes), I set an explicit mu_hat. A target base stock of 1,800 units will account for the 1,351 ghost units, the 5 units on-hand, and leave room to order enough to cover ~450 units of actual demand (roughly 3 periods at 150/week). L is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the actual observed lead time of 2-3 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (mid-December), the demand has cooled following a brief spike in late November (P42: 289), with recent demand at 69 and 85 units. The primary strategic challenge remains the 1,351 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P24, and P26) that persist in the OR backend's in-transit calculation. With current reported in-transit at 1,795 units, the backend effectively sees an inflated pipeline, which would normally suppress ordering. To ensure replenishment for the remaining 3 periods of the game, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that exceeds this ghost inventory plus several periods of demand. I am setting L to 3 (observed actuals) and mu_hat to 1,950 to ensure the base_stock calculation (mu_hat - pipeline) remains positive and triggers necessary arrivals before the game ends, while sigma_hat is set to capture recent volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 23rd, 2019. Demand is in a late-December trough (P45=56), despite a brief holiday spike in P42 (289). The 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments P1, P3, P24, P26) totaling 1,351 units continues to artificially inflate the pipeline in the OR backend. To trigger any replenishment, mu_hat must be set to exceed this ghost inventory plus the currently active in-transit units (P44=169, P45=155). The total pipeline distortion is significant: 1,351 (lost) + 169 (P44) + 155 (P45) = 1,675. To maintain service levels for early January demand while accounting for this 1,675 unit 'offset', I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1,800. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) remains higher than the pipeline (1,759), preventing the order from being zeroed out. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to reflect recent volatility including the P42 spike. L is set to calculate (3) based on recent realized lead times.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Jan 2020), demand has stabilized at a low late-winter level, averaging approximately 60 units/week over the last 4 periods (P43-P46). However, the central challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' in the OR backend's pipeline. Total confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P24, P26) sum to 1,351 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' figure (currently 1,759), causing the OR backend to believe the system is overstocked and preventing necessary orders. Specifically, true in-transit inventory is only ~408 units (P44: 169, P45: 155, P42/P43/P44/P45 residuals). To force the backend to place an order that covers the current demand (avg ~60) and lead time (L=2) while the pipeline is artificially inflated by 1,351 units, I must set mu_hat to approximately (Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory = (60 * 3) + 1351 = 1531. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) exceeds the pipeline inventory. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to provide this specific bridge and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current lower volatility.
