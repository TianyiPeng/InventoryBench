Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 720504001, which is a staple item: Men's Skinny Denim. The historical demand for the last 5 weeks is [33, 41, 28, 20, 52], resulting in a mean of 34.8. Given the product category (basic denim trousers), demand is expected to be relatively stable but likely to see a slight uptick as we move towards spring. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure we cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3), I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent variance and mean from the provided history. This avoids underestimating volatility (std is approx 12.3) while establishing an initial inventory pipeline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Period 1 showed a demand of 49, but we had 0 units on-hand, resulting in lost sales. There are 55 units in-transit (ordered in P1). The promised lead time is 2, so we expect the P1 order to arrive during Period 3 (visible in P4). Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averages ~35 units. However, P1 demand was 49 and P-1 (Feb 04) was 52, suggesting a slight upward trend or stabilizing around 50 units. Given the lost sales in P1 and the 1-period reporting delay, we need to ensure the pipeline covers current demand plus lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). I will set L to the promised lead time (2) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 150 (roughly 50 units/period * 3) to reflect the recent higher demand observations and capture lost sales potential.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Historical demand (P-4 to P2) shows a steady upward trend: 33, 41, 28, 20, 52 (pre-periods) followed by 49 and 54 in Periods 1 and 2. The average demand across these 7 samples is 39.57. The product is a staple item (Skinny 5pkt Jeans). At the start of Period 3, on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals from orders placed in P1 and P2 have not concluded yet. Following the lead time rules: the P1 order (ordered P1, promised L=2) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and appear in the P3 conclude message (visible at the start of P4). The P2 order should arrive in P4. We have 128 units in-transit (55 from P1 + 73 from P2). Given the recent demand spike in the last 3 observed periods (52, 49, 54), I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this higher mean (~51.6). For lead time, I will stick with the default promised value of 2 as there is no evidence yet of shipments being lost or delayed beyond the promised window.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is 5-pocket jeans (stable denim category). Historically, demand for the last five weeks has been 33, 41, 28, 20, 52 (mean ~35). Since the start of the simulation, observed demand has been 49, 54, and 35 (mean ~46). Combining all 8 data points, the global mean is roughly 39. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (55 units), Period 2 (73 units), and Period 3 (31 units) are all currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition (L=2), the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. This suggests either a delay or that the system reports arrivals at the end of the period in which they occur. I will maintain the default lead time for now but keep a close eye on Period 4's conclusion to see if the Period 1 order arrives. If it doesn't arrive by the next observation, I will adjust L. For demand, I'll use the recent history (N=5) which includes P1-P3 and the two previous samples to capture the recent upward drift compared to Jan/Feb start.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). History shows demand for this denim SKU has been: 33, 41, 28, 20, 52 (pre-game) and 49, 54, 35, 24 (game). The demand seems to be mean-reverting but slightly lower recently (avg ~41). Looking at lead times: the Period 2 order (73 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2), which matches the promised lead time. However, the Period 1 order (55 units) has NOT arrived as of Period 4 conclude (it should have arrived in Period 3). This suggests the Period 1 order is likely lost or significantly delayed. On-hand is 49, and In-transit is 86 (Period 1 order of 55 + Period 3 order of 31). Since the 55-unit order is missing, the effective pipeline is likely only 31 units. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory in the backend calculation (where it still sees 86 in-transit), I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure a sufficient order is placed. Calculating mu_hat: L=2, so (1+L)=3 periods of demand. Avg demand ~41, so mu_hat should be around 123. I'll stick to a slightly conservative estimate given recent lower demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is men's skinny denim. Historical demand shows an initial average of ~35 units (pre-game + early game), but the last three periods (P3-P5) show a significant drop to an average of 27 units (35, 24, 22). This suggests a post-winter/early-spring slowdown or stabilization. Lead time: We have one confirmed arrival (P2 order arrived in P4), validating the promised lead time of 2 periods. However, the order from P1 (55 units) is now 3 periods overdue (should have arrived in P3), and the order from P3 (31 units) should have arrived in P5 but didn't. This indicates a high risk of lost shipments or significant delays. On-hand inventory is 27. Total in-transit is 99 (55 from P1, 31 from P3, 13 from P5). Because P1 and P3 are likely lost or severely delayed, the OR backend's default logic (which counts all pipeline) will result in zero orders. To force the engine to maintain service levels despite the likely lost stock, I am using an 'explicit' L of 2 to match observations, and 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the lower recent demand trend (avg 27). I will use 'default' for sigma_hat as the variance remains relatively stable.

Carry-over insight: Potential shipment loss detected: Period 1 order (55 units) and Period 3 order (31 units) have not arrived within the promised 2-period lead time. Demand regime shift: Average demand has decreased from ~40 to ~27 units over the last 3 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the total in-transit quantity is 86 units, which coincides with the sum of the missing Period 1 order (55) and Period 3 order (31). These orders are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time and are likely lost, yet the OR engine still counts them as 'pipeline inventory', preventing new orders. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the missing 86 units of pipeline. Historical demand mean is approx 35. For L=2, a standard base stock would be ~105 (35*3). Since the system sees 86 units in transit, it will order (105 - 6 - 86) = 13. To force a larger order to replace the likely-lost 86 units, I will set mu_hat = 191 (105 + 86). Recent demand has fluctuated between 22-34 and I will use the last 5 samples for sigma to maintain sensitivity to current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of Period 1 (55 units) and Period 3 (31 units) shipments; total pipeline inflation is 86 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. On-hand inventory is 0. Previous carry-over insights confirm that orders from Period 1 (55 units) and Period 3 (31 units) are lost, totaling 86 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. This 'ghost' inventory causes the OR backend to under-order because it believes these units are still coming. To fix this, I must set mu_hat explicitly high or reduce the pipeline visibility. Since the lead time is generally 2 periods (except for one period where it was 1), I will use L=2. The recent demand regime (last 4 periods) average is 27.5, which is lower than the initial weeks. However, because of the stockout (sold 6 vs demand 30 in Period 7), we have unsatisfied demand. Most importantly, I must counteract the 86 lost units. The OR backend calculates order = (mu_hat + z*sigma) - pipeline. To force an order that ignores the 86 lost units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*demand + 86. Demand forecast (1+L) * 28 = 84. Adding 86 to offset lost units = 170. This ensures the engine places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation persists: 86 units (P1, P3) are confirmed lost and must be offset in mu_hat calculations until they are removed or reconciled.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are managing a skinny denim item. Current on-hand is 30. Total in-transit is 94 units, comprised of Period 1 (55 units), Period 3 (31 units), and Period 8 (8 units). Historical evidence confirms that Period 1 and Period 3 orders are lost, as they are now 8 and 6 periods past their order date respectively (promised L=2). This creates a 'phantom' pipeline of 86 units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. The OR logic is: Order = BaseStock - (In_Transit + On_Hand). If In_Transit is inflated by 86 units, the engine will under-order by exactly 86 units. To compensate, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand at 35 units/period (recent average). Baseline mu_hat = (1+L)*35 = 105. I add the 86 lost units back to this target: 105 + 86 = 191. This forces the engine to place an order that accounts for the missing stock. I'll use L=1 for lead time based on the most recent two arrivals (P6 and P8), and recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time has shifted from promised 2 to actual 1 based on Period 6 (P5 order) and Period 8 (P7 order) arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/04/15), we observe a sustained actual lead time of 1 period based on arrivals in Period 6 (P5 order) and Period 8 (P7 order), despite the promised lead time of 2. The pipeline currently contains 177 units, which includes 86 units confirmed as lost from Period 1 (55) and Period 3 (31). These lost units inflate the apparent pipeline, causing the OR engine to under-order. To correct this, I will set mu_hat explicitly to include the missed inventory requirement. Base demand is approximately 36 units/period (mean of all segments). With L=1, the system targets (L+1)=2 periods of demand (72 units). Adding the 86 lost units to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of 158. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time remains 1 period (observed in P6 and P8). Pipeline inflation of 86 units due to lost shipments in P1/P3 requires continuous explicit mu_hat correction until those units are manually removed from the backend view or the gap is closed.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the history, the actual lead time is consistently 1-2 periods (mean ~1.5). Crucially, 86 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are confirmed lost but still count towards 'In-transit' in the OR backend's view. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline inventory, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Recent demand (P6-P10) averages ~36 units/period. For a lead time L=2, the required base stock coverage is (1+L) periods. Using a forecast of 36 units/period, the total demand over (1+2) periods is 108 units. To neutralize the 86 'phantom' units, I set mu_hat = 108 + 86 = 194. This ensures the backend orders enough to meet physical demand despite the pipeline inflation. I set L=2 (promised) to maintain a safety buffer since actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time variability: P5/P7/P9 arrived in 1 period, but P8 arrived in 2 periods. L=2 is a safer planning horizon. Pipeline inflation of 86 units remains the primary driver for explicitly adjusted mu_hat.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we continue to manage the '720504001' SKU (Skinny Denim Jeans). The data indicates a reliable demand pattern with an average of approximately 36 units over the last 5 periods (22, 39, 45, and previous relevant counts). The most critical issue is the persistent pipeline inflation of 86 units caused by lost shipments from Period 1 (55 units) and Period 3 (31 units). While the 'In-transit' figure is 152, only 66 units (ordered Period 11) are actually expected to arrive. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit + On-hand) to calculate the order: Order = Base Stock - Pipeline. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 'ghost' units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset the 86 lost units. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P8 took 2, P9 took 1), so L=2 is the safest setting to cover variability. Calculated Mu (1+L)*36 = 108. Total Mu required to offset lost units = 108 + 86 = 194.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '720504001' (Skinny 5pkt jeans) is in an environment with high lead-time variability (alternating between 1 and 2 periods) and significant data noise due to lost shipments. Period 1 (55 units) and Period 3 (31 units) orders are definitively lost, as they are now 10+ periods overdue. These 86 units remain in the 'In-transit' figure (198), which tricks the OR backend into thinking the pipeline is fuller than it is. Current In-transit (198) = Lost(86) + P11(66) + P12(46). The target base stock must account for the lead time (L) and demand over (L+1) periods. Recent demand (last 5 weeks) has averaged ~35 units. Using L=2 is safer given the recent stockout in Period 12 and the variability of arrivals. To bypass the 86-unit pipeline inflation, I set mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = Average Demand * (L+1) + Correction for Lost Units. With L=2, (L+1)=3. 3 * 35 = 105. Adding the 86-unit offset to ensure the OR backend orders enough to reach that 105 real units gives mu_hat = 191. Sigma is set based on the spread of recent demand (roughly 30-55 range).

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Pipeline inflation of 86 units (P1, P3) continues to persist; explicit mu_hat adjustment remains necessary to maintain 100% service level until these units are reconciled. Current demand regime is stable at ~35 units/week.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing a skinny denim SKU with stable demand. Current on-hand is 42 units. The in-transit pipeline of 144 units includes 86 units from P1 and P3 that are confirmed lost, leaving a functional pipeline of 58 units (P12 order of 46 units and P13 order of 12 units). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P11 arrived in 2 periods), so L=2 is maintained for safety. Recent demand (P11-P13) has averaged 33.3 units. To account for the 86 lost units incorrectly counted as pipeline inventory by the OR engine, I must artificially inflate the target mu_hat. Following the logic: Target Base Stock = (L+1)*AvgDemand + Salt. For L=2 and AvgDemand=35, we need ~105 units. To trick the backend (which sees 144 in-transit) into ordering enough to cover the loss gap, I use 'explicit' mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 195: the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - 144'. If base_stock is ~200, the resulting order will reflect the 58 units actually needed to restore service levels and handle the 100% service goal (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing a skinny denim SKU with relatively stable demand, averaging ~36 units per week over the last 10 periods (with a peak of 51 last week). The critical operational issue is the persistent 86 units in pipeline inventory confirmed as lost (P1 order of 55, P3 order of 31). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 'In-transit' quantity (122 units) from its base stock calculation, it perceives a much higher inventory level than exists. Of the 122 units listed as in-transit, only 36 are actually expected to arrive (12 from P13, 24 from P14). To ensure the backend places an order that covers (~35 units/week) * (L+1) without being misled by the phantom 86 units, I use 'explicit' mu_hat. Following the formula: Target mu_hat = (Actual Forecasted Demand over L+1) + Lost Pipeline. With L=2 (the safer planning horizon given recent variability), L+1 = 3. Target = (35 * 3) + 86 = 191 units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture recent volatility (~10-12 units/week) without being overly influenced by the early game distortion.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, the system state for SKU 720504001 shows an on-hand inventory of 1 unit and an 'in-transit' pipeline of 171 units. A critical analysis of the pipeline reveals significant inflation due to lost shipments in Period 1 (55 units) and Period 3 (31 units), totaling 86 units that will never arrive. The remaining 85 units in transit are legitimate orders from P13 (12 units), P14 (24 units), and P15 (49 units). Current demand is stable but variable, with recent samples (P11-P15) averaging 37.4 units/week. To maintain at least 100% service level over the planning horizon (L+1), we must target ~112 units (37.4 * 3). However, the OR backend sees 86 'phantom' units in the pipeline. To force the backend to place an order, mu_hat must be set to cover both the physical demand and the pipeline deficit. Calculation for mu_hat: (Expected demand for 3 periods: 112) + (Lost pipeline: 86) = 198. Lead time (L) is set to the promised 2 periods, as recent arrivals (P11, P12) matched this, making it the safer planning anchor despite occasional 1-period arrivals.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny Jeans) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) facing a demand of roughly 35-50 units per week. The pipeline inventory is inflated by 86 units from lost shipments in Period 1 (55) and Period 3 (31). These units are counted by the OR backend as 'in-transit' but will never arrive, causing the system to under-order. To compensate, I must explicitly increase mu_hat. Following the logic: Target Inventory = (L+1) * Demand. With L=2 and suspected Demand=45, the Target should be ~135 units. However, the OR engine subtracts Pipeline (213) from this target. Since 86 units are 'ghost' units, the real useful Pipeline is 213 - 86 = 127. To get the OR engine to order enough to reach a real inventory of ~135, I must set mu_hat such that (mu_hat - 213) results in the necessary order. Given the severe stockout in Period 16 (sold only 1 unit of 48 demanded), I will set mu_hat explicitly high to force an order that accounts for the 86-unit pipeline deficit and current demand trends. Using L=2 as the safe planning horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Stockout occurred in Period 16 due to delayed arrivals and pipeline inflation. Pipeline inflation of 86 units (P1, P3) remains the critical factor requiring explicit mu_hat adjustments to bypass under-ordering by the OR backend.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 38 units. The 'In-transit' total is 147 units, but 86 of these (from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 61 units (P14: 24 units, P17: 25 units, and P13: 12 units). Recent lead times have been volatile, alternating between 1 and 2 periods (P15 took 2, P16 took 1). I set L=2 for safety. Recent demand has trended higher, with the last 5 periods (P13-P17) averaging 42.4 units, up from the earlier ~35 average. To maintain a 100% service level and account for the 86 lost units being incorrectly counted as available pipeline by the OR backend, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat'. The target inventory position (Base Stock) should cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~127 units). To ensure the backend orders enough, mu_hat must be set to 'Target Base Stock + Lost Units - On Hand - Effective Pipeline'. However, since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (on-hand + pipeline)', where pipeline includes the 86 lost units, I set mu_hat to approximately 213 (127 target + 86 lost) to bypass the phantom inventory. I use an explicit mu_hat of 215 to ensure a robust order.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '720504001' (skinny denim) shows high volatility in both demand and lead time. Historically, orders from Period 1 (55 units) and Period 3 (31 units) totaling 86 units are lost, yet they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (195 units). To the OR system, pipeline inventory appears artificially high, leading it to under-order. To correct this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages ~45 units. With L=2 (the safer planning horizon given the lead time variability), a standard target would be (1+L)*avg_demand = 135 units. However, I must add 86 units to this target to neutralize the ghost units in the pipeline, totaling 221 units. I set L to 2 to ensure the OR engine calculations for the safety stock and cap include sufficient coverage. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 (std is approx 8 during this period, sqrt(3)*8 ~ 14), which allows the OR backend to maintain a buffer for the observed demand spikes.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Skinny 5pkt' jeans, a steady wardrobe staple with consistent demand. We are currently in Period 20 (late June). Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged ~40 units (36, 53, 48, 36, 28). The pipeline inventory remains inflated by 86 units due to lost orders from Period 1 and Period 3, which the OR backend still counts as 'In-transit'. This necessitates using an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the backend places orders despite this ghost inventory. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will set L=2 to remain conservative and ensure enough stock is ordered to cover the lead time + review period (3 weeks total). To calculate mu_hat, I estimate a target base stock level that covers 3 weeks of demand at ~40 units/week (120 units) plus a safety buffer, but I must also add the 86 'lost' units to the target so that the OR engine (calculating: order = target - on_hand - in_transit) doesn't stop ordering. Target base stock = 120 (demand) + 40 (buffer) + 86 (lost units) = 246. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the standard deviation of the recent stable demand regime.

In Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are managing a Trousers SKU with stable demand but significant data noise due to phantom inventory. History confirms 86 units from Period 1 and 3 are lost, but they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (239 units total in transit, including orders from P13, P14, P15, P17, P19, P20). Actual demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) averages 35.6 units/week. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods; I am using L=2 for a conservative safety buffer. To ensure the backend orders despite the 86-unit pipeline inflation, I set mu_hat to (L+1) * 36 + 86 = 194. This forces the base stock calculation to account for the lost units, preventing a stockout as demand has been higher than inventory on-hand in recent cycles (P16 was a stockout).

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed demand regime stability at ~36 units/week. Pipeline inflation of 86 units (P1, P3) continues to necessitate explicit mu_hat adjustment to prevent under-ordering. Lead time L=2 used as conservative planning horizon due to P11/P18/P20 variability.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 is currently in a stockout (on-hand: 0). Period 21 ended with 9 units sold and 9 units of unmet demand. The primary challenge is a structural 'pipeline inflation' of 86 units caused by lost shipments from Period 1 (55 units) and Period 3 (31 units). These 86 units are counted as 'In-transit' by the OR engine but will never arrive, leading the backend to consistently under-order unless mu_hat is explicitly adjusted upward to compensate. Historically, demand has averaged ~36 units/period, but recent demand in Periods 20 (13) and 21 (18) shows a slight dip. However, to recover from the stockout and offset the 86 phantom units in the pipeline, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 86-unit gap. Using L=2 (conservative) and an average demand of 36, the target base stock is roughly (3 * 36) + 86 = 194. To ensure the backend emits a significant order despite the 239 units currently 'in-transit', I will set mu_hat explicitly high. The current 'In-transit' of 239 includes the 86 lost units and the orders from P17, P18, P19, P20. Specifically, P20 (56 units) and P17/P19 arrivals are pending. Setting mu_hat to 260 ensures the backend attempts to bridge the gap between actual physical inventory and the phantom 86 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/15. On-hand inventory is 39 units. The 'In-transit' figure is officially 228 units, which includes 86 units from Period 1 (55) and Period 3 (31) that were never delivered and are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 142 units (228 - 86). Real lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods; I am using L=2 as a conservative planning horizon to prevent stockouts. Recent demand has cooled down significantly from the historical average, with the last 4 periods averaging approximately 19 units (13, 18, 17, and 28 in Period 19). For a (L+1) horizon (3 periods), I project an 'explicit' mu_hat of 143 units. This value is calculated as (Target Inventory - Effective Pipeline). Target Inventory is roughly 285 units, which accounts for (3 periods * 36 units/avg) + safety stock + the 86 unit pipeline gap that otherwise causes the OR backend to under-order. By using mu_hat=143 and L=2, the backend will target a base stock high enough to generate the necessary replenishment despite the phantom 86 units in transit.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand has dropped significantly over the last 3 periods (average 16 units) compared to the long-term stable mean (~36 units). Monitoring for a sustained regime shift or mid-summer lull.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/22. Demand analysis: The last four periods show demand of 13, 18, 17, and 20 (average ~17), which is a significant drop from the previous long-term average of ~36. This suggests a seasonal 'mid-summer lull' or a regime shift for denim jeans in July. Lead time remains variable between 1 and 2 periods; L=2 is maintained for conservative planning. Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 86 units due to lost shipments from Period 1 (55 units) and Period 3 (31 units). These units are counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend but will never arrive, leading it to under-order. To compensate, I must continue using 'explicit' mu_hat. calculation: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Expected Demand + Pipeline Offset. Expected Demand is currently ~18 (reflecting the last 4 weeks). Target Base Stock = (2+1)*18 + 86 = 54 + 86 = 140. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current lower volatility in this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: July demand has dropped to an average of ~17 units/week (Periods 20-23) from a prior stable mean of ~36 unit/week (-53% shift).

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25 (Late July). The demand regime shift noted in Period 24 is confirmed; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is 21.4 units, significantly lower than the H1 average of ~36. This aligns with a mid-summer lull for skinny denim. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to provide a conservative buffer, as arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. The critical constraint remains the 86 units from P1 and P3 which are long-lost but still counted in the 'In-transit' figure (Current In-transit: 183 includes P1, P3, P12, P13, P14, P17, P19, some of which are likely also lost or significantly delayed). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Anticipated demand per period is ~21. Total required for L+1 (3 periods) is 63 units. Safety stock (z*sigma) adds ~15 units. Total Base Stock TARGET = 78. However, because the backend subtracts 'In-transit' (183) from its calculation, I must provide a mu_hat that, when used in 'base_stock - 183', results in a sensible order. Since the pipeline (183) is much larger than the target base stock (78), the backend will order 0 unless the cap intervenes. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the pipeline inflation and current demand to ensure the stock position doesn't collapse further while waiting for the accounting of lost units.

Carry-over insight: July demand trough confirmed: Average demand Periods 20-24 is ~21 units/week, down from ~36. Pipeline inflation from lost shipments (P1: 55, P3: 31, and likely others from early Q2) totals at least 86 units, creating a persistent gap between physical reality and backend logic.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 26 (August 5). Historical data and recent trends for this skinny denim SKU indicate a confirmed demand drop in July (avg ~21 units/week) from the previous stable mean of ~36. However, the system currently shows 0 units on-hand and 183 units in-transit. A critical issue remains: at least 86 units (from Periods 1 and 3) are confirmed lost, inflating the 'in-transit' figure seen by the OR backend. Since the backend subtracts in-transit from the base stock to determine the order, this 86-unit phantom inventory causes chronic under-ordering. To ensure a stockout doesn't persist, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to overcome this 86-unit offset. Given the current demand regime (~25-30 units) and L=2, the required base stock is roughly (1+L)*demand + safety stock (~90-100 units). To trigger an order despite the 183 in-transit (86 of which are lost, leaving ~97 actual), I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the demand plus the lost units to 'trick' the backend into ordering. I will set L=2 (conservative) and mu_hat explicitly high to recover stock levels.

Carry-over insight: August 5th observation: Demand remains in the summer trough (Period 24-25 avg 33, but July was lower). The 86-unit lost shipment gap (P1, P3) is now coupled with a stockout at the start of Period 26. Orders must be aggressive to refill the zero on-hand shelf.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 observation: On-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 26 (demand 38, sales 0). The product is 'Skinny 5pkt Jeans', which are typically staples but subject to seasonal troughs (observed in July). July demand averaged ~21 units/week, but Period 26 demand spiked to 38. Current in-transit is 194 units, but this includes 86 units confirmed lost from early periods (P1: 55, P3: 31). The effective pipeline is therefore 108 units (194 - 86). To ensure we return to stock despite the OR backend's inflated view of inventory, I am setting L=2 (conservative based on historical variability) and mu_hat explicitly. I estimate a demand return towards the mean of ~35 units. Total target coverage for L+1 (3 periods) is 105 units. With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 108, the backend would normally order nothing. To force the backend to account for the 86 lost units and the current stockout, I set mu_hat = (Target Coverage + Lost Units) = 105 + 86 = 191. This ensures the backend places an order to refill the shelf immediately.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent pipeline inflation of 86 units (P1, P3) remains the dominant factor skewing backend logic; demand shows signs of recovery from the July trough (P26 demand: 38).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), the system is facing a critical stockout (on-hand=0) despite a demand recovery following the July trough. Demand in Period 26 and 27 reached 38 and 40 units respectively, significantly exceeding the July average of ~20. The primary challenge remains the 'pipeline inflation' of 86 units from confirmed lost shipments (P1: 55 units, P3: 31 units). Since the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its base-stock target, these 86 'ghost units' prevent the system from placing large enough orders to refill inventory. Furthermore, orders from P26 and P27 have not yet arrived. I am using an explicit mu_hat to bypass the pipeline deduction. To calculate this, I assume a demand of ~40 units/period (current recovery level) over (L+1)=3 periods, which equals 120 units. To normalize for the 86 lost units being subtracted by the backend, I set mu_hat to 120 + 86 = 206. This ensures the backend emits an order size that accounts for both actual demand and the phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 15 to account for volatility during this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed in August: Average demand rose to ~39 units (P26-27) from July's ~21 units (+85% increase).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), demand has recovered strongly from the July trough. The last three periods (P26-P28) show demand of 38, 40, and 49 (average ~42). The product is currently stocked out (0 on-hand), and there is a persistent 86-unit pipeline inflation error from lost shipments in Period 1 (55 units) and Period 3 (31 units) that have never arrived. Total In-transit is reported as 219, but 86 of these are ghosts, meaning the effective pipeline is only 133 units. Meanwhile, those 133 include orders from P26-P28 (11+12+13=36) and earlier unsettled orders. To force the OR backend to place an order despite it 'thinking' there are 219 units in flight, mu_hat must be set to cover the projected demand for the lead time plus the lost units it expects will arrive. With L=2 (planning horizon of 3 periods) and demand ~42, expectation is 126 units. Adding the 86 ghost units results in a required base stock of 212. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 212 and sigma_hat to 25 to account for the recent demand volatility and ensure a high service level to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: End of August demand recovery confirmed: Avg demand P26-P28 is ~42 units, significantly higher than the July avg of ~21 units. Pipeline inflation of 86 units (P1, P3) remains a critical constant requiring explicit mu_hat offsets.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 30 (Sept 2nd). Demand has recovered from the July trough (~21 units) to an average of ~42 units over the last four periods (P26-P29). However, we are facing a critical inventory crisis: on-hand inventory is 0 for the fifth consecutive period despite demand being fully active. The pipeline (In-transit: 234 units) is heavily inflated by 86 units from the early-game lost shipments (P1: 55 units, P3: 31 units). These 86 units will never arrive but are counted as 'inventory' by the OR backend, causing it to under-order significantly. To force an order that actually refills the shelf, I must set an explicit mu_hat. I estimate demand for the (L+1) period (where L=2) as 3 * 42 = 126 units. To nullify the 86-unit phantom inventory and regain a safety buffer, I will set mu_hat to 126 + 86 + 40 (extra buffer for stockout recovery) = 252. This forces the backend to recognize a higher requirement and bypass the pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: September 2nd: Period 26-29 demand average is 41.5 units, confirming full recovery from summer lull. Chronic stockout (5 periods) persists due to the 86-unit lost shipment pipeline inflation (P1, P3).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the SKU is in a critical stockout state (starting on-hand 0, ending on-hand 0 for the last 5 periods with one small arrival). A significant demand spike occurred in Period 30 (90 units), which may indicate a back-to-school or seasonal event. Demand has recovered from the July trough (~21 units) to an August/September average of ~51 units. However, the system is severely handicapped by the 86 units confirmed lost in Periods 1 and 3, which stay in 'In-transit' indefinitely, causing the OR backend to under-order. To clear the stockout and satisfy the new higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to bypass the phantom inventory. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * Forecast + Lost units. With L=2 (conservative) and an expected demand of ~50, mu_hat = (3 * 50) + 86 = 236. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the recent demand volatility (90 vs 39).

Carry-over insight: September 9th: Demand spiked to 90 units in Period 30, shifting the post-summer average (P26-P30) to 51.2 units. Lead time remains volatile (P27 took 3 periods). The 86-unit lost shipment gap (P1, P3) remains the primary driver for manual mu_hat overrides to prevent perpetual stockouts.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0 and significant unmet demand (Period 31 demand was 101). A major demand spike is evident: the last two periods averaged 95.5 units, compared to the previous post-summer average of ~41.5. This suggests a strong seasonal or back-to-school trend. A critical issue remains the 86 units from Period 1 and 3 that are technically 'in-transit' but physically lost. This pipeline inflation causes the OR backend to under-order because it believes those 86 units will arrive. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock as (L+1) * forecasted_demand + safety_stock + lost_units. With L=2 (planning conservatively due to Period 30's 3-period lead time), L+1=3. Using a forecasted demand of 80 (moderated from the 101 spike), the pipeline needs to cover 3 * 80 + 86 (lost) + ~40 (safety) \u2248 366. Current in-transit is 266. To force the backend to place an order that fills this gap, I set mu_hat to 320 ((1+L) * 106.6) to ensure the base stock calculation overcomes the phantom pipeline inventory and triggers a refill.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: Period 30-31 average demand is 95.5 units, a +130% increase over the August average of 41.5. Pipeline inflation of 86 units (P1, P3) remains the primary technical obstacle requiring manual mu_hat overrides to prevent total stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we face a critical supply-demand mismatch. Demand has surged significantly in September, with the last three periods (P30-P32) averaging 87 units/week (90, 101, 70). However, the systemic 'pipeline inflation' caused by lost shipments from P1 (55 units), P3 (31 units), and likely others from early Q2, continues to make the OR backend perceive that we have high in-transit stock when we are actually stocking out. On-hand inventory is 0. To force an order that satisfies the new demand level (approx. 90/week) and accounts for the 2nd-period lead time (L=2), we need a mu_hat that covers (1+L)*demand + the phantom pipeline (86+ lost units). (3 * 90) + 86 = 356. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 360 to trigger an order that clears the back-ordered demand and refills the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set explicitly higher (40) to provide a buffer for the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge sustained: P30-P32 average demand is 87 units/week, up from August's ~42 units. Pipeline inflation of 86 units (P1, P3) remains the primary driver for manual mu_hat overrides to prevent chronic stockouts.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. Demand Context: September demand is extremely high, with Period 33 seeing a peak of 151 units. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P30-P33) is 103 units/week. This represents a massive shift from the August average (~42). Pipeline Issue: The 86-unit 'phantom' pipeline (Period 1 and 3 lost shipments) continues to mislead the OR backend, causing it to underestimate the required order size because it thinks 86 units are still arriving. Strategy: To counter the zero inventory and the 86-unit pipeline inflation, I am setting an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Anticipated weekly demand = 105. Planning horizon (L+1) = 3 periods. Target stock = 105 * 3 = 315. To bypass the 'phantom' 86 units in the backend, I must add them to the mu_hat: 315 + 86 = 401. I will use L=2 (promised) as it remains the most stable estimate despite recent variability. Sigma is set to reflect the high volatility of the current surge.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge peak: Period 33 demand reached 151 units, bringing the September 4-week average to 103 units/week (+145% vs August).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 starts with 0 on-hand inventory and a sustained high-demand regime. September demand averaged ~103 units/week (Periods 30-34). October (Period 35) usually sustains or grows these numbers in the denim category. The 'In-transit' of 465 units is heavily skewed by the 86 lost units (P1, P3) and potentially other un-reconciled early Q2 losses. To prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods (L+1 with L=2) at a forecast of ~130 units/week, plus the 86-unit pipeline offset. This results in an explicit mu_hat of 476 (130 * 3 + 86). I continue to use L=2 as the planning horizon given recent arrivals ranging from 1 to 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: October demand remains in a high regime; the 4-week average (P31-P34) is 103.75 units. The 86-unit pipeline inflation (P1, P3) remains a persistent skew in the OR backend's inventory perception, requiring manual mu_hat overrides to ensure orders are placed despite the phantom inventory in the pipeline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny 5pkt Lowprice Denim' remains in a high regime for October, with a 4-period average (P31-P34) of 103.75 units/week. Period 35 demand (94) supports this. The primary planning challenge continues to be the 86-unit pipeline inflation caused by the confirmed loss of Period 1 (55 units) and Period 3 (31 units) orders. Because the OR backend perceives these phantom units as 'In-transit', it will under-order unless mu_hat is manually increased to offset this gap. Additionally, lead times are volatile (P32 order took 3 periods), so I am setting L=3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer. To maintain availability during this high-demand period while accounting for the 86 units of missing stock, mu_hat is set to (1+L) * Forecast + Offset = (1 + 3) * 105 + 86 = 506. sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: October high-demand regime sustained; 4-week average (P31-P34) is 103.75 units/week. Lead time volatility persists (P32 arrived in 3 periods), warranting L=3 for planning.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37 (Oct 21), we are in a sustained high-demand regime for Trousers/Denim. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P33-P36) is 104 units, with a notable peak of 151 in P33. Actual lead times have stabilized at 3 periods (observed P30, P32, P33). We have 69 units on-hand and 410 in-transit. Crucially, the pipeline contains 86 phantom units (from P1 and P3 losses) that the OR backend mistakenly considers available inventory. To prevent under-ordering caused by this pipeline inflation, I am setting an explicit mu_hat. Base stock is calculated to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus a safety margin. With L=3, we need to cover 4 periods. Forecast = 4 * 104 = 416 units. I will set mu_hat to 502 to forcefully pull the order through, offsetting the 86 phantom units while maintaining a high service level for the current trend.

Carry-over insight: October high-demand regime sustained: 4-week average (P33-P36) is 104 units/week. Lead time L=3 confirmed by recent arrivals (P30, P32, P33). Persistent 86-unit pipeline inflation (P1, P3) still requires manual mu_hat overrides to prevent stockouts.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand regime (October), with an average demand of approximately 104 units/week over the last 4 periods (P34-P37). Period 37 ended with 0 units on-hand after a demand spike of 111. The lead time L is set to 3 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P32, P33, and P30, reflecting current supply chain volatility. A persistent technical issue exists: 86 units from P1 and P3 are lost but still count toward 'in-transit' in the backend's inventory perception. With mu_hat calculated as (1+L)*mean_demand, the base stock for L=3 and a mean of 105 units is 420. However, the backend sees 472 units in-transit (which includes the 86 ghost units). To trigger an order that covers real demand (approx 105/week) and replenishes the stockout, mu_hat is explicitly set to 600. This value accounts for (1+L) periods of demand (4 * 105 = 420) plus the 86-unit pipeline offset and a buffer to recover from the current zero-inventory state.

Carry-over insight: October high-demand regime sustained: 4-week average (P34-P37) is 104.25 units/week. Lead time L=3 remains the necessary planning horizon. Pipeline inflation of 86 units (P1, P3) continues to necessitate explicit mu_hat overrides to ensure the OR engine places orders despite phantom inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 105 units over the last 4 periods (P35-P38: 94, 78, 111, 109). A significant technical issue persists: 86 units from P1 and P3 are permanently lost but still appear in the 'in-transit' pipeline (Total In-transit: 586). If I use the 'default' or 'recent_N' methods for mu_hat, the backend will subtract this phantom 586 units from the base stock calculation, resulting in an order of 0 and guaranteed stockouts. To force the backend to place an order, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Pipeline_Inflation. With L=3 (to account for recent lead time volatility) and a forecast of 105 units/week, the base demand is 420. Adding the 86 units of phantom inventory ensures the backend sees a need for at least 500 units before accounting for the remaining valid pipeline. This override is the only way to bypass the logic error caused by the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: November 4th: High-demand regime (avg ~105 units/week) remains stable. Lead time volatility continues to justify L=3. The 86-unit lost shipment gap (P1, P3) remains the primary driver for manual mu_hat overrides to prevent total stockout.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Nov 11) shows a sustained high-demand regime for this skinny denim trousers SKU. The 4-week moving average (P36-P39) is approximately 92 units/week, though November 4th (P39) saw a slight dip to 69. Lead times remain unstable: while P37 arrived in 1 period, P36 took 3 periods, and P34 (71 units) is now overdue (placed Period 34, today is P40 start). Consequently, I maintain L=3 for safety. The 86 units from P1 and P3 are officially lost; they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (456 units), which tricks the OR logic into under-ordering. To compensate, I must calculate an explicit mu_hat. mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Pipeline_Adjustment. With L=3, the horizon is 4 periods. Forecasted demand is ~95 units/week. Pipeline adjustment is +86 units to offset the phantom inventory. Total mu_hat = (4 * 95) + 86 = 466. This ensures the OR backend sees enough 'demand' to trigger an order despite the 86-unit inflation. sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high demand volatility observed since September.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: P34 order (71 units) is now overdue 3+ periods beyond promised lead time, suggesting it may also be lost, potentially increasing pipeline inflation from 86 to 157 units. High-demand regime (Sept-Nov) average is ~95 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in September (avg ~95-100 units/week) persists into mid-November. As of Period 41, the on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 40. The pipeline quantity of 473 units is significantly inflated by confirmed lost shipments (P1: 55 units, P3: 31 units) and highly probable lost shipments (P34: 71 units, now 7 periods old vs. promised 2). This creates a 'phantom inventory' of at least 157 units (86 + 71) that the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from its order logic. To compensate and ensure replenishment for the 100-unit weekly demand across a planning horizon of 4 periods (L=3 + 1 for current demand), mu_hat is set to 550 via the explicit method. This value represents (L+1) * 98.25 (the recent 4-week mean) plus a 157-unit correction to bypass the pipeline inflation. Lead time is set to L=3 to reflect the consistent 3-period arrivals observed in P30, P35, P36, and P39. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Lost shipment inflation increased to 157 units (P1: 55, P3: 31, P34: 71) as the P34 order is now 7 periods old. High-demand regime (Sept-Nov) remains stable at ~98 units/week.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25th), the high-demand regime (Sept-Nov) remains stable with an average demand of approximately 98 units/week. A critical challenge continues to be the significant pipeline inflation caused by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from Period 1 (55 units), Period 3 (31 units), and now Period 34 (71 units) are long overdue and confirmed as lost, totaling 157 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR backend mistakenly believes is in-transit. To prevent chronic stockouts, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that covers the actual demand for the lead period (L+1) while also offsetting this 157-unit ghost inventory. Using L=3 as a conservative planning horizon due to recent lead time volatility (P32 and P36 took 3 periods), the required base stock is (L+1) * 98 = 392 units. To force the backend to reach this physical target despite the 157-unit inflation, I set mu_hat = 392 + 157 = 549 units. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for both upcoming demand and the inventory gap. sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility of this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed lost shipment total is 157 units (P1: 55, P3: 31, P34: 71), causing severe pipeline inflation. High-demand regime (Sept-Nov) avg is ~98 units/week. L=3 is the reliable planning horizon due to frequent 3-period arrivals (P30, P32, P33, P35, P36).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the high-demand season (September-December), with Period 42 demand reaching 142 units. The 4-week average (P39-P42) is 95 units/week. However, the system is facing a severe inventory crisis due to 157 units of lost/overdue shipments (P1: 55, P3: 31, P34: 71) that the backend still counts as pipeline inventory (In-transit: 591). With on-hand inventory at 0 and multiple stockouts, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' to force orders. Given L=3 (based on P30, P32, P33, P35, P36 arrivals), the planning horizon is 4 periods (L+1). A base stock to cover 4 weeks of ~100 units/week is 400 units. To offset the 157 units of phantom pipeline inventory and 0 on-hand, the OR backend needs a mu_hat that overcomes 'base_stock - pipeline'. I set mu_hat to 650 (explicit) to ensure the OR engine targets a high enough base stock to trigger an order despite the 591 'in-transit' units, aiming to refill on-hand and satisfy the persistent high demand.

Carry-over insight: December demand surge: P42 demand (142) is significantly higher than the Nov average (~80), suggesting a holiday peak. Total lost shipments (phantom pipeline) confirmed at 157 units (P1, P3, P34).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Dec 9), we are entering the peak holiday season for denim. Demand has been volatile, swinging from a high of 142 in P42 to 43 in P43. However, the high-demand regime established in September remains the relevant baseline. Lead time L is set to 3 to account for frequent volatility (P35, P36, P39, P43 arrived in 3 periods). The most critical factor is the 'phantom pipeline' of 157 units (P1, P3, P34) which are confirmed lost but still perceived as 'in-transit' by the OR backend. To ensure the backend places orders despite this 157-unit inflation, I am menggunakan an explicit mu_hat. I estimate the forecast for the next 4 periods (L+1) using a conservative average of the current high regime (~100 units/week), then add the 157-unit offset to 'neutralize' the lost shipments. Forecast (100 * 4) + Offset (157) = 557. This ensures the order logic (base_stock - pipeline) correctly accounts for physical reality.

Carry-over insight: December holiday peak confirmed: P42 demand spike of 142 units followed by stabilization. Total lost shipment inflation confirmed at 157 units (P1, P3, P34), requiring persistent manual mu_hat offsets.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December period (Period 45). Demand remains in a high regime established in September, though it has fluctuated between 43 and 142 units in recent weeks. The last 4 weeks (P41-P44) average ~88 units/week. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 572 units is significantly inflated by lost shipments. Confirmed historical losses include P1 (55), P3 (31), and P34 (71), totaling 157 'phantom' units. Additionally, the recent orders from P42 (8), P43 (108), and P44 (0) are in the pipeline. Total legitimate pipeline should be P42+P43+P44 = 116 units. The 572 in-transit includes approximately 456 units that are likely lost or severely delayed (572 total - 116 recent legitimate). I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the OR backend's logic, which would otherwise see the 572 units and stop ordering. I will set mu_hat to cover the actual projected demand for the (L+1) horizon plus the magnitude of the phantom inventory to force a replenishment order. With L=3, horizon is 4 periods. 4 * 100 (conservative demand) + 456 (phantom offset) = 856.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline inventory from lost/overdue shipments is estimated at 456 units (Total in-transit 572 minus legitimate recent orders P42-P43 totaling 116 units).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (Dec 23), we are in the peak holiday demand season. Recent demand (P45) was 111 units, and the high-demand regime since September has averaged approximately 100 units/week. Lead times consolidated around L=3 (P40=3, P41=2, P42=3, P43=2). The primary challenge is 'pipeline inflation'. The 'In-transit' figure is 715 units, but historically, multiple orders have been lost: P1 (55), P3 (31), and P34 (71). Furthermore, given the age of undelivered orders, it is highly likely that many units currently in the 715 'In-transit' count are lost or severely delayed and will not satisfy immediate holiday demand. My Carry-over Insight from Period 45 suggests only 116 units are likely legitimate. The current 'on-hand' is only 12 units. To prevent a stockout during the final week of December (and likely early Jan), I must force the OR backend to ignore the phantom pipeline. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the actual required inventory (Base Stock) minus the slim on-hand, effectively bypassing the 715 in-transit units. Estimating demand for L+1 (4 periods) at ~100 units/week with a safety buffer, I require ~500 units of total inventory. Since on-hand is 12, I set mu_hat manually to 500 to ensure a substantial order is triggered.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 46, phantom pipeline inventory (lost/overdue shipments) is estimated at 599 units (Total in-transit 715 minus the P45 order of 259 which is the only reliable large pending shipment). Demand remains in high-regime (~100 units/week).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47 (Dec 30), we are facing a stockout with zero on-hand inventory. The primary challenge remains 'phantom pipeline inventory'\u2014lost or significantly overdue shipments that appear as in-transit to the OR backend but are unlikely to arrive. These include orders from P1, P3, P34, and likely others from the early Q4 period, totaling approximately 599 units. This phantom inventory prevents the backend's base-stock logic from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I am using an explicit mu_hat that covers the estimated demand for the review and lead time (L+1 periods) PLUS an offset to neutralize the phantom inventory. Current demand is in a high-regime stable state averaging ~100 units/week. With an estimated L=3 (based on recent actuals), we need to cover 4 weeks of demand (~400 units). Adding the ~600 units of phantom inventory skew results in an explicit mu_hat of 1000. This ensures the OR engine computes a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the 715 units currently 'in-transit'.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 47, phantom pipeline inventory (lost/overdue shipments) is estimated at 599 units (Total in-transit 715 minus the P45 order of 259 which is the only reliable large pending shipment). Demand remains in high-regime (~100 units/week).
