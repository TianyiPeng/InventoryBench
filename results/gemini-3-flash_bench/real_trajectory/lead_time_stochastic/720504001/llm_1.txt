These are generally non-seasonal basics with steady demand, though they can see slight upticks in early February (post-Chinese New Year/early Spring refreshes). b) Demand Analysis: Historical data shows demand points of 33, 41, 28, 20, and 52 over the last 5 weeks. The average is ~35 units/week. The most recent demand (52) is high, possibly indicating a slight upward trend or randomness. c) Lead Time/Inventory: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, there is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. d) Order Logic: To cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods), I need enough stock for at least 3 weeks. Forecasted weekly demand is ~35-40 units. 3 periods * 40 units = 120 units. I will add a small safety buffer because I am starting at zero inventory. e) Final Order: Ordering 130 units to establish inventory and cover the 2-period lead time pipeline.",

Historical data shows an average demand of approximately 35 units per week (33, 41, 28, 20, 52). Period 1 actual demand was 49, which aligns with this baseline. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, there is an order of 130 units in transit from Period 1, which is expected to arrive at the start of Period 3 (visible in P4 status) based on L=2. However, since Step 2 of the Period Execution Sequence states orders arrive DURING the resolution phase, an L=2 order placed in P1 arrives in P3. We need to cover demand for Period 2, Period 3, and Period 4 (L+1 periods) to maintain availability. Expected demand for 3 periods is ~150 units (50/week). Current pipeline is 130 units against 0 on-hand. We missed all sales in P1 due to 0 inventory. To reach a safe stock level that accounts for the L=2 delay and avoids further stockouts while 130 units are in transit, I will order enough to bring the total pipeline + on-hand closer to a 4-week coverage (approx 200 units) to account for the current zero-stock position.",

My pipeline (In-transit 200) already covers this plus a small safety buffer for the next 3 weeks. However, to maintain a rolling pipeline and account for the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), I should order conservatively to avoid overstocking while ensuring I don't stock out once arrivals catch up.

Date is March 4th, entering the spring fashion season where denim demand typically remains steady or slightly increases. b) Demand Regime: Average demand across provided samples and game history (8 points) is approximately 39 units/week. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (130 units) is expected to arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that the lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. We expect the Period 1 order to arrive during Period 4 (visible in Period 5). d) Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 255 (130 from P1, 70 from P2, 55 from P3). e) Ordering: We need to cover demand for Period 4 and the lead-time window (L+1). If L=3, we need to cover 4 periods of demand (~160 units). Our total pipeline (255) already exceeds this. However, since we currently have 0 stock and have missed sales for 3 periods, we must ensure we don't under-order if lead times are shifting significantly.

Current game history (Periods 1-4) shows demand of 49, 54, 35, and 24, averaging ~40.5 units/period. The Period 4 demand of 24 is lower than average but likely due to random variance rather than a trend. Actual lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Current on-hand is 46. In-transit consists of orders from P1 (130), P3 (55), and P4 (45) totaling 230 units. Crucially, the P1 order of 130 units (placed on 2019/2/11) should have arrived in Period 3 if lead time was 2. It has not arrived as of P4's conclusion. Given it is 2 periods overdue, I must treat this shipment as potentially lost or significantly delayed. My inventory target for (L+1) = 3 periods should be ~120-130 units (3 * 42). Current reliable pipeline (P3+P4 orders) = 100 units + On-hand (46) = 146. This covers the next 3 weeks perfectly. However, if the 130-unit order from P1 is truly lost, I am safe; if it arrives late, I will have a surplus.

Demand Analysis: Historical data (Jan) showed ~30 units, followed by a surge in Feb (P1: 49, P2: 54) likely due to early spring shopping. Demand then declined in early March (P4: 24, P5: 22) but ticked up in Period 6 (34), possibly reflecting a steady baseline for late March. I estimate the current demand regime is roughly 25-35 units/period. Lead Time Analysis: Promised LT is 2. Arrival in P4 (from P2) confirmed LT=2. However, P6 arrival (from P5) showed a LT of 1. The P1 order (130) is effectively lost (6 periods since order). Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 20. In-transit consists of P3 (55), P4 (45), and P6 (40). Total pipeline = 20 + 55 + 45 + 40 = 160 units (ignoring the lost P1 order). Calculation: Target coverage for (L+1) = 3 periods at ~35 units/period = 105 units. Pipeline (160) already exceeds this coverage. However, the inconsistency of logistics (lost order, varying LT) suggests maintaining some safety stock.

Order P1 (130) is confirmed lost. Order P2 (70) arrived in P4. Order P5 (30) arrived in P6. c) Pipeline analysis: Order P3 (55) is overdue (placed 5 periods ago, LT=2).

Looking at the history, the order placed in P10 (80 units) should have arrived in P12 or P13. Since it hasn't appeared in the 'conclude' messages for P12 or P13, and the 'In-transit' balance is at 310, it implies: Lost Units (230) + P10 Order (80) = 310. This means the P10 order is now reaching the 3-period mark and might be delayed or lost. Inventory Position: On-hand is 41. Real Pipeline is effectively 0 if we assume P10 is also lost/severely delayed. To cover 3 periods (L+1) at an average of 35 units/period plus safety stock, I need ~130 units.
