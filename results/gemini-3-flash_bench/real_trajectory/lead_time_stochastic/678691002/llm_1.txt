High-support sports bras are essential athletic wear with steady year-round demand, though they often see peaks during 'New Year, New You' fitness resolutions (January) and leading into summer. \nb) Demand Analysis: Historical data for the last 5 weeks: 81, 48, 71, 68, 74. Excluding the Jan 7th outlier (81), the average demand is approximately 65-70 units per week. February demand has started around 74. \nc) Lead Time & Pipeline: The promised lead time is 2 periods. No orders have been placed yet. \nd) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Total units needed must cover Period 1 (current), Period 2, and Period 3 (since an order placed now arrives in P3 resolution). \ne) Final Order Logic: Forecasted demand is ~70 units/period. Protection needed for 3 periods (L+1 = 3) = 210 units. Adding a safety stock buffer of ~30-40 units to account for early February momentum and avoid stockouts during the lead time. Target inventory position: 250 units.",

The average weekly demand is approximately 66 units. Calendar context (Feb 18) indicates we are post-New Year's resolution peak but entering a steady fitness season. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 250 in-transit from Period 1. Based on the lead time of 2, the Period 1 order (250 units) is expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible in P4 start). Because I have zero inventory and just lost 56 units of sales in Period 1 due to a stockout at start, I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 periods) before the next possible shipment (if ordered now) arrives. The pipeline (250 units) covers roughly 3.7 periods of demand (250 / 67). However, I have missed 56 units in P1 and will likely miss 60-70 in P2 because arrivals happen AFTER demand resolution. To ensure I don't run out again once the initial 250 arrives and to build a small safety buffer for the 2-period lead time, I will place a modest order. Total demand for 3 periods (P2, P3, P4) is estimated at 200. My current in-transit is 250. This covers me through P4. To prepare for P5 demand (when an order placed now would arrive), I will place an order of 70 units.",

Recent periods (P1-P4) show demand around 54-65. b) Demand is stable but suppressed by stockouts. Real demand appears to be ~65 units/week. c) Lead time analysis: P2 order (70 units) arrived in P4 (LT=2). However, the P1 order (250 units) has NOT arrived yet. Since P4 concluded without it, it is now significantly overdue (expected P3). Usually, this indicates a lost shipment in this environment, but since the pipeline is already heavy with this potentially 'lost' unit, I must treat it with caution. d) Inventory: On-hand is 5.

Using the recent 4-period average (38 units), I estimate demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) to be approximately 114 units. Lead time is volatile, oscillating between 1 and 2 periods, so I must plan for L=2. Currently, there is 84 units on-hand and 300 units in-transit (reflecting the 250 units lost in Period 1 and the 50 units ordered in Period 10). The P10 order of 50 units is expected to arrive in Period 13 (this period) or Period 14. Total effective inventory (On-hand 84 + P10 In-transit 50) = 134 units. This covers the (L+1) requirement of 114 units. Additionally, the holding cost is high ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), making overstocking expensive. With a surplus of ~20 units relative to my forecast, no order is required this period.",

To cover 3 periods of demand at an estimated 35 units/period (safety buffer over recent 26 avg) plus safety stock, a target pipeline + on-hand of ~140-150 units is appropriate. Current effective total = 41 (on-hand) + 110 (effective in-transit) = 151. Since the effective coverage is already around 150 units, a small replenishment order is placed to maintain the flow given the history of lost shipments.",

Reported In-transit is 720, so the effective pipeline is 720 - 580 = 140 units. This effective pipeline consists of P34 (80 units, now 4 periods ago and likely lost or severely delayed), P36 (30 units), and P37 (30 units).
