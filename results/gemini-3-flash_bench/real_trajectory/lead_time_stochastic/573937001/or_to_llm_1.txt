The product is a staple item (5-pocket jeans). The OR algorithm recommends an order of 70 units based on the promised lead time of 2 periods and a critical fractile of 0.5 (since Profit $1.0 = Holding $1.0). Given that on-hand inventory is currently 0 and in-transit is 0, we need to establish a pipeline immediately. The OR recommendation of 70 units covers roughly 1.3 weeks of average demand, which is conservative given a lead time of 2 periods (total 3-period coverage needed). However, since this is the first period and we need to verify actual lead times and demand stability, I will follow the OR baseline of 70 units as a starting point to avoid excessive holding costs while building initial stock.",

Since L=2, these are expected to arrive in the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). No arrivals were expected in Period 1.\n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (64, 46, 43, 52, 63) average approximately 53.6 units. Period 1 actual demand was 45. The demand for 'ED Madison Skinny HW' (jeans) seems relatively stable in the early spring (February).\n3. Inventory Position: Currently On-hand is 0 (due to zero starting stock and lead time), and In-transit is 70 (from the Period 1 order). \n4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 68 units based on a base-stock level. \n5. Strategy: I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 periods) because the order I place now (Period 2) will arrive in Period 4. Total demand to cover: ~54 * 3 = 162 units. Current pipeline is 70. Net requirement is roughly 92 units. However, holding costs are high relative to profit ($1:$1), making the critical fractile 0.5. This means we should target the median demand to minimize total costs, rather than carrying heavy safety stock. The OR recommendation of 68 units is slightly more conservative than a '3-period cover' but respects the high holding cost and capping logic.

The Period 2 order (68 units) is expected in Period 4. No conclusions can be drawn yet about actual lead time deviations since we only have Period 2's conclusion, and a 2-period lead time means the first arrival confirmation appears in Period 4's start. \n2. **Demand Analysis**: Historical demand (64, 46, 43, 52, 63) averages ~53. Recent actual demand in P1 (45) and P2 (60) averages 52.5. The product is 'ED Madison Skinny HW' (trousers/jeans), a staple item with relatively stable demand. \n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 138 (70 from P1 + 68 from P2). \n4. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 22 units. Let's check the base-stock logic: \u03bc (avg demand) \u2248 53. L=2. Total demand over L+1 (3 periods) \u2248 159. Pipeline is 138. Base stock = 159 + safety stock. OR's 22 units + 138 pipeline = 160 units, which covers exactly 3 periods of average demand with minimal safety stock. \n5. **Adjustment**: Given we have 0 on-hand and have suffered two periods of stockouts (0 sales for 105 demand), we are in a 'catch-up' phase. However, the pipeline of 138 is significant. If P1's 70 units arrive this period as expected, they will cover P3 demand. I will follow the OR recommendation of 22 to maintain a steady flow without over-committing to holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), meaning the critical fractile is 0.5 (low tolerance for excess inventory).",

This indicates the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed/lost. 2. **Inventory Status**: On-hand inventory is 0.

However, because the P1 order is already late, we are currently in a stockout situation. 5. **Strategy**: I must account for the lead time delay. If the actual lead time is 3+, I need to ensure future demand is met. However, I have 160 units already in transit. If they all arrive soon, I will have high holding costs ($1/unit).

The lost 70 units from P1 are still in the 'In-transit' figure of 142 but should be ignored for planning. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (45, 60, 66, 74) shows a steady upward trend, significantly higher than the 2019 historical baseline (avg ~53). Current demand appears to be averaging ~65-70. 4. **OR Recommendation**: OR suggests 29 units. However, OR calculates pipeline inventory as 142.

Inventory Outlook: The P3 arrival of 22 units will be insufficient for P6 demand (65), leading to a stockout. The P4 arrival of 50 units in P7 will also be insufficient for P7 demand.

Current in-transit visible to the machine is 207, which includes these likely lost units (70 from P1 + 22 from P3 + 50 from P4 = 142 lost units). \n3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has spiked significantly (P7: 83, P8: 96). The historical average was around 53, but the last two weeks suggest a much higher regime. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees 207 units in-transit against its internal base-stock target. However, 142 of those units are almost certainly lost.

P8 is expected to arrive this period (P10) given the 2-period lead time. \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P7=83, P8=96, excluding the P9 outlier of 40 which likely reflects Easter Monday/low activity) shows a clear shift from the historical avg (53) to a higher regime (approx. 90). The product is H&M+ skinny jeans, which has stable, high-volume appeal. \n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it overestimates the healthy pipeline (counting lost units).

Inventory Situation: On-hand inventory is 48.

Expected demand over the next 2-3 periods (Lead time L=2 + review period 1) based on the recent average of 43 is approximately 129 units. The 120 units supply is nearly sufficient for the 3-period horizon. 5. Action: OR recommends 0.

The current 'In-transit' of 244 units includes: P10 (72 units), P11 (0 units), P12 (30 units)? Correction: The 'In-transit' figure of 244 reflects cumulative undelivered orders. Subtracting known lost orders (P1: 70, P3: 22, P4: 50 = 142 total) from 244 leaves 102 units currently in a 'healthy' pipeline (P10: 72, P12: 30). \n2. Demand Analysis: Demand has softened and stabilized significantly. The last 4 periods (P9-P12) show demands of 40, 43, 44, 39 (average ~41.5). This is a clear downward shift from the earlier spike of ~90 and even lower than the historical mean.\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 9. We expect 72 units (ordered P10) to arrive in Period 13 or 14. If they arrive this period, we cover demand. If not, we may stock out briefly this period, but the 72 units will more than cover the new lower demand regime (~42/period) for the next 1.5 periods.\n4. Strategy: OR recommends 0.

Inventory & Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it counts the entire 244 units in-transit as valid pipeline inventory. Adjusting for the high probability of lost shipments, we actually only have ~30 units (from P12) potentially arriving soon. To cover a 2-period lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods) at a demand rate of 43, we need ~129 units. Total pipeline (realistic) is 30, and on-hand is 0.

Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. With holding costs equal to profit ($1.0), the penalty for overstocking is high.

The recent shipment from P23 arrived at P26 (LT=3). Currently, 'In-transit' is 619 units. Subtracting the confirmed losses (409 units), the reliable pipeline consists of orders from P24 (70 units), P25 (70 units), and P26 (70 units), totaling 210 units. \n2. **Demand Analysis**: Historical mean demand is approx 53. Recent demand has been lower (Avg P24-P26 is ~28), but we must prepare for the (L+1) window, which is 3 periods. Looking at the SKU (H&M+ Skinny Jeans), demand is relatively stable but subject to availability-driven spikes. \n3. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand is 26. Reliable pipeline is 210. Total position = 236 units. \n4. **OR Baseline Comparison**: OR recommends 0 units because it counts all 619 units in-transit as valid, leading it to believe we are severely overstocked. However, adjusting for the 409 lost units reveals our actual position (236 units) covers approx 4-5 periods of average demand (53/period) or 8 periods of recent low demand. \n5. **Strategy**: With 26 on-hand and 70 units from P24 expected to arrive in P27 or P28, we have sufficient stock for the immediate future. To avoid over-ordering given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), I will pause ordering this period to see if the P24-P26 flow remains stable before committing more capital to a high-loss-risk channel.",
