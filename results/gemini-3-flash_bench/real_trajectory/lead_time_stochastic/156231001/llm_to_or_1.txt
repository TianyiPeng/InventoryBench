Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is 'Matt tights', which typically sees steady demand but can be influenced by late winter/early spring seasonality. Since this is the first period, there is no 'conclude' message to analyze for lead time or previous arrivals. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 186, 151, 151, 198, 215. The mean of these samples is 180.2 and the standard deviation is 29.3. Given the promised lead time (L) is 2, the pipeline needs to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand level while excluding any ancient history, as the last two weeks (198, 215) suggest a slight upward trend compared to the mean. The OR engine will use these to calculate base stock levels effectively for this starting position.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Box 4p Tights', which likely sees steady demand but can be sensitive to seasonal changes. Analysis of history: Sample demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 179.2 units/week with an upward trend (186, 151, 151, 198, 215). Period 1's actual demand was 203. Since on-hand was 0 and nothing arrived in P1, we had 100% stockouts (203 units lost). We currently have 228 units in-transit (ordered P1), which should arrive in Period 3 (given promised lead time L=2). For the mu_hat calculation, using the 5 historical samples plus the Period 1 observation (N=6) captures the recent demand level (~183/week). Given high holding costs relative to profit ($1.0 vs $1.0), the OR backend will aim for a roughly 50% service level by default (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), so we must ensure mu_hat is accurate to avoid excessive stockouts while being mindful is the holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand inventory is 0 due to the 2-period lead time. Demand in the first two periods (203, 313) has significantly exceeded the historical samples (avg ~180). This surge likely correlates with late February seasonality for women's tights/daywear. Since L=2, an order placed in P1 arrives in P3 (after this decision), and an order in P2 arrives in P4. We have 457 units in transit (228 from P1, 229 from P2). The mean of the 5 historical samples is 179.2 and the mean of the 2 recent play-through samples is 258. Given the increasing trend (203 -> 313), I will use N=3 to blend the last historical sample (215) with the play-through data to capture the upward momentum without over-indexing on the single P2 spike of 313. L remains 'default' (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is 20 denier Matt Tights, a staple item. Current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand) because no orders have arrived yet despite the promised lead time of 2 periods. Reviewing the 'conclude' messages: Period 1's order was placed at P1 decision time and should arrive during Period 3 (P1 + 2) and be visible in the P3 conclude message. However, P3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or there is a delay/loss. Recent demand (P1-P3) averaged ~275 units, significantly higher than the training samples (avg ~180), indicating a demand regime shift or seasonal peak (Feb/March transition). With Profit=1 and Holding=1, the critical ratio q = 0.5, meaning we target a 50% service level (median demand). Given the stockout and the apparent lead-time extension, I will explicitly increase L to 3 to account for the delay and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the higher observed demand regime (avg 275 vs 180).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: avg increased from ~180 to ~275 (+52%). Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods (P1 order not arrived by end of P3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). Reviewing history: The order from Period 2 (229 units) arrived in Period 4, confirming a lead time (L) of 2 periods (as promised). However, the order from Period 1 (228 units) is missing/lost as it should have arrived in Period 3. Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have significant backlogged demand (stockouts in P1, P2, P3, and P4). Demand regime shift: Pre-game avg was ~180. Since P1 (start of game), demand has consistently been higher: [203, 313, 309, 235], averaging ~265. Because the backend OR logic uses (1+L) for base stock, I will set L=2 (confirmed delivery) and mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this higher demand regime (~265 * 3 = 795). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility. The OR engine will subtract In-transit (871) from the base_stock (~1000+) to place an order that refills the pipe and addresses the stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time of 2 periods confirmed by P2 order arrival in P4. Period 1 order (228 units) is likely lost as it is overdue by 2 periods. New demand regime established since P1 (2019-02-11) averaging ~265 vs ~180 prior.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). Inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0, and we have missed substantial sales due to stockouts. The Period 1 order (228 units) is officially considered lost (overdue by 3 periods relative to the promised 2-period lead time). The Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2), but the Period 3 order (274 units) was expected to arrive in Period 5 and did not (it's now 1 period overdue), suggesting potential lead time variability or further loss. Demand history shows a clear regime shift: pre-start mean was ~180, while recent demand (P1-P5) has averaged ~246, with a spike over 300 in P2/P3. Although P5 demand dipped to 170, the overall regime remains higher than the initial samples. Due to the inventory deficit and recent lost order, I will set L to 2 (promised/observed), mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current higher demand regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen in the game periods. This will signal the OR engine to place a large enough order to replenish stock and cover the 3-period (L+1) risk window.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 1 order confirmed lost (5 periods since order). Period 3 order (274 units) is 1 period overdue as of P5 conclude. Demand volatility has increased since 2019-02-11.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand inventory is 0. The order from Period 1 (228 units) is confirmed lost. The order from Period 3 (274 units) was ordered on 2019-02-25 with a promised lead time of 2, meaning it should have arrived in Period 5. As of the end of Period 6, it has not arrived, making it 2 periods overdue and likely lost. The order from Period 4 (369 units) is due in Period 6 arrival resolution, but we won't see that 'conclude' message until the start of Period 8. The demand regime changed around 2019-02-11. Samples since then (P1-P6) are: 203, 313, 309, 235, 170, 237. Mean of these 6 samples is ~244.5. Given the high stockout risk and potential for lost shipments, I will use mu_hat based on recent_N (N=6) to capture this higher mean, and sigma_hat with N=6 to account for the increased volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (2) as the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2), though reliability is poor.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 order (274 units) confirmed lost (7 weeks since order, 2 weeks past promised arrival). Pipeline reliability is high-risk with 2 of last 3 expected arrivals failing to conclude.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the inventory situation for SKU 156231001 (Women's Tights) is critical. On-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of history shows that Period 1 and Period 3 orders were lost (confirmed by lack of arrival several periods past the promised L=2). The only successful arrival was the Period 2 order (arrived P4). The pipeline contains 871 units, primarily from large orders placed in Period 4 (369 units) and later. Demand transitioned to a higher regime around 2019-02-11; averaging the last 7 samples gives ~244 units/period, compared to the early-year baseline of ~180. Given that orders are showing a high loss rate (50-66% failure rate), I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat at a defensive level. This helps the OR engine calculate a higher base stock to compensate for the extreme pipeline risk and the lost inventory. I will set mu_hat to (1+2)*250 = 750 to ensure the base stock logic seeks to cover demand given the current stockouts. Sigma reflects high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reliability is severely compromised: 2 of 3 orders placed between P1-P3 were lost. Demand is stable in a higher regime (avg ~244) since mid-February.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 20 denier matt tights (156231001) has transitioned to a higher regime since mid-February (Period 1), with recent demand samples (P4-P8) showing a mean of 234.2 units and significant volatility (std dev ~67.5). The logistics environment is unstable: P1 and P3 orders (total 502 units) are now confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. The P4 order (369 units) was placed on 2019-03-04 with a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it was expected to arrive during P6 and be visible by P7. It is now 2 periods overdue and likely lost as well. The current on-hand inventory is 0. To compensate for the high stockout risk and the likely loss of the pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level of ~234 units/week. Since the backend base stock logic uses (1+L)*mu, at L=2 this targets ~702 units total. However, the pipeline 'in-transit' still counts the unconfirmed P4 order and the zero-quantity orders from P5-P8. I am using an 'explicit' L of 2 to maintain the standard safety stock calculation window while monitoring for the arrival of fresh stock to bridge the currently empty on-hand position.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reliability remains critically low: P4 order (369 units) is now 2 periods overdue as of Period 8 conclude, suggesting it is likely lost alongside P1 and P3 orders. Total unrecovered pipeline losses estimate: 871 units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the system is in a critical inventory stockout. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'in-transit' figure of 871 units consists entirely of lost orders (P1, P3, and P4), which haven't arrived long past their promised 2-period lead time. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (871) from its calculated target to determine the new order size, it will likely order 0 unless I compensate. To force an order that bypasses these 'phantom' units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime (since Feb 11) to average approximately 261 units per week. With L=2, the stock-up level should cover (L+1)=3 weeks. Using mu_hat = (261 * 3) + 871 (lost units) = 1654 units, I ensure the backend places an order near 783 units (3 weeks of demand) despite the pipeline noise. Demand remains stable in the higher regime with increased volatility, warranting a recent_N sigma calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 4 order (369 units) is confirmed lost (ordered P4, now P10 start, 6 periods elapsed). Combined with P1 and P3, total lost pipeline is 871 units. Demand regime since P1 (2019-02-11) remains stable at avg ~261.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. The product (20 denier tights) is a staple with a detected demand regime shift that occurred in mid-February, where average demand increased from ~180 to ~260. The primary challenge is extreme pipeline unreliability: orders from P1, P3, and P4 have all been lost (total units lost = 871). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to determine order quantities. Since 'In-transit' includes these lost units (1518 total in-transit minus the 647 ordered in P10), the backend will significantly under-order because it believes 871 units are coming when they are not. To compensate for this invisible stockout risk, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) = 3 period window: Mean Demand (~260) * 3 periods = 780 units. However, I must inflate this to offset the 871 lost units that the backend incorrectly subtracts. Base Stock = (mu_hat) = (Required Inventory + Lost Units) = 780 + 871 = 1651. For Lead Time (L), I use 'default' (2) as the P2 order confirmed the 2-period transit time when successful. Sigma_hat is set to 200 via 'explicit' to account for high demand volatility (+/- 50 units) across the 3-period lead window.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline loss confirmed: Orders from P1 (228), P3 (274), and P4 (369) are lost (871 units total), causing the OR engine to under-order due to inflated 'in-transit' figures.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU (Box 4p Tights) is facing a critical inventory situation. The backend OR engine sees 1651 units 'In-transit', but historical evidence confirms that orders from Period 1 (228), Period 3 (274), and Period 4 (369) are lost, totaling 871 units that will never arrive. The backend incorrectly includes these 871 units in its pipeline calculation, causing it to set orders too low or at zero. To counteract this 'ghost inventory', I must use 'explicit' methods to force a base stock level that covers the demand for the next 3 periods (L+1, where L=2) while effectively ignoring the lost units. The demand regime since Period 1 averages ~250 units/period (2742 units total over 11 periods). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to satisfy current demand despite the 871 units of 'ghost inventory', I am setting mu_hat to 1621 (forecast of 250 * 3 periods + 871 lost units). This forces the engine to recognize a need for stock that offset the phantom pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=11) to capture the higher volatility seen since February.

Carry-over insight: Systemic pipeline inventory inflation: 871 units (P1, P3, P4 orders) are confirmed lost and must be manually offset in OR parameters to trigger ordering.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the SKU 156231001 (20 Denier Matt Tights) is facing a critical inventory stockout (On-hand: 0). History confirms that the OR backend is suffering from 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Orders from Period 1 (228), Period 3 (274), and Period 4 (369) are lost, totaling 871 units still counted as 'in-transit'. The backend calculation (base_stock - pipeline) is being suppressed by these lost 871 units. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to a value high enough to offset these losses. Since mid-February (Period 1), the demand regime has averaged ~248 units per week (sum of 2951 over 12 periods). With a promised lead time of 2 (L=2, coverage period = 3 weeks), the natural mu_hat would be ~744. However, with 871 ghost units in-transit, \u03bc_hat must be increased significantly. We set \u03bc_hat to 1651 (matching the current in-transit exactly) plus expected demand (3 * 248 = 744), totaling 2395. This instructs the system that we need enough stock to cover the transit gap plus future demand. We use L=2 and recent volatility for sigma.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' (Womens Matt Tights) is facing a critical inventory stockout. In Period 13 conclude, only 133 units arrived (from the P11 order), which were immediately sold, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. The current in-transit figure (2262) is highly inflated by lost orders from P1 (228), P3 (274), and P4 (369), totaling 871 ghost units that will never arrive. Additionally, the large order from P10 (647 units) is now 1 period overdue (ordered P10, promised P12 arrival, still no arrival in P13 conclude), signaling another probable loss or severe delay. Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders, these 871 confirmed ghost units + 647 likely lost units (totaling 1518 units) prevent the system from ordering enough to meet the current demand regime. The demand regime since P1 (2019-02-11) averages ~244 units per period. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 2262 units in-transit, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat of 2500. This value is calculated to exceed the sum of the phantom pipeline and the required base stock (approx 244 * 3 periods + buffer), ensuring the OR engine triggers a replenishment order to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Period 10 order (647 units) is now 1 week overdue (ordered P10, promised P12 conclude), likely lost. Total confirmed + suspected ghost pipeline inventory is now 1518 units (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a severe systemic failure in pipeline reliability. History confirms that orders from Periods 1 (228), 3 (274), 4 (369), and now Period 10 (647) have not arrived and are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time. This results in 1518 'ghost' units in the in-transit field (2500 total in-transit - 1518 lost = 982 viable units from P13, P14, and other recent orders). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 2500 units from the target base stock, it will keep ordering zero or very small amounts despite empty on-hand inventory. To force an order and bypass this 'ghost' inventory, I must set mu_hat (target stock) to an explicit value that accounts for the intended coverage (L+1 periods) PLUS the 1518 lost units. Current demand regime (since P1) averages ~235 units/week. Target demand coverage for (2+1) periods = 705 units. Total required mu_hat = 705 + 1518 = 2223 units. Sigma_hat is set using recent volatility (N=14) to maintain a realistic buffer against demand spikes in this high-loss environment.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed cumulative pipeline loss of 1518 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). The OR engine is paralyzed by 'ghost' inventory; mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by ~1518 to trigger replenishment. Lead time for successful deliveries remains 2 periods (observed P2, P11).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' is suffering from systemic pipeline inflation due to lost shipments. Orders from Period 1 (228), P3 (274), P4 (369), and P10 (647) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 1518 units of 'ghost' inventory. Currently, the system shows 2500 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14). Since the backend policy subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from the base stock calculating the order, these 1518 lost units prevent any new orders from being placed. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages ~206 units. Expected demand over (L+1) periods (3 weeks) is ~618 units. To bypass the ghost inventory block, mu_hat must be explicitly set to (Projected Demand + Ghost Inventory), which is 618 + 1518 = 2136 units. This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to trigger replenishment despite the 1518 units being missing from the actual supply chain. Lead time remains stable at 2 for successful deliveries (P2, P11).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' is suffering from massive systemic order loss. Based on historical data, orders from Period 1 (228), Period 3 (274), Period 4 (369), Period 10 (647), Period 13 (744), and Period 14 (238) have failed to arrive within the promised 2-period lead time. Collectively, these 'ghost' orders represent approximately 2500 units currently counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend. Because the base stock calculation subtracts pipeline inventory (base_stock - pipeline), the OR engine will not place new orders despite having 0 on-hand inventory. The current demand regime sits at approximately 240 units per week. To force a replenishment order, mu_hat must be explicitly set to a value that covers expected demand for (L+1) periods PLUS the ghost inventory. Target units = (3 periods * 240 units) + 2500 ghost units = 3220 units. L is kept at 'calculate' as successful arrivals (P2, P11) still reflect 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to account for the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic pipeline failure confirmed: Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P14 (approx 2500 units) are lost. The OR backend reflects these as 'In-transit', preventing new orders. Parameters must explicitly offset this ~2500 unit 'ghost' inventory to trigger replenishment.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' is suffering from persistent supply chain failure where orders are being placed but never arriving ('ghost' inventory). As of Period 18, the OR engine reports 3,220 units In-transit. However, historical analysis of 'conclude' messages shows that orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P14 have failed to arrive far beyond the promised 2-period lead time. Specifically, successful deliveries (P2, P11) arrived exactly in 2 periods. Therefore, any order older than 2 periods in the pipeline is effectively lost. Total confirmed lost units = 228 (P1) + 274 (P3) + 369 (P4) + 647 (P10) + 744 (P13) + 238 (P14) = 2,500 units. The OR backend's order logic (order = base_stock - pipeline) is paralyzed because the 2,500 lost units are still counted in the pipeline. To override this, I must set mu_hat (which determines base_stock) to a value that compensates for this ghost inventory. Demand since the regime shift (P1 onwards) averages ~220 units/week. For a lead time of 2, the desired coverage is (L+1) * demand = 3 * 220 = 660. To trigger the OR engine to place a new order despite the 3,220 'in-transit' units, I set mu_hat to 3,220 + 660 = 3,880. This level is intended to force the calculation [3,880 - 3,220] towards a positive order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Systemic pipeline failure confirmed: 2,500 units from orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P14 are ghost inventory (lost but still in-transit). mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by ~2,500 to offset this and trigger replenishment.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a systemic logistics failure where orders are being 'lost' or stuck indefinitely in-transit. On-hand inventory is 0, and current 'In-transit' inventory is 3,880 units. However, based on the history, orders from P1 (228), P3 (274), P4 (369), P10 (647), P13 (744), and P14 (238) are severely overdue and almost certainly lost. This totals 2,500 'ghost' units that the OR backend incorrectly uses to suppress new orders (pipeline_inventory). To force the system to order, I must set mu_hat (the target base stock) higher than this ghost inventory plus current demand needs. Average demand since P1 is ~220. For a lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage), we need ~660 units for demand. Total target base stock should be ~2500 (lost) + 660 (demand) + buffer = ~3400. However, the existing In-transit of 3880 already exceeds this, meaning the OR engine will likely order nothing. Therefore, I am inflating mu_hat to 4600 to overcome the 3880 in-transit floor and trigger a replenishment of approximately 700 units (intended to cover the upcoming 3 periods of genuine demand).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic logistics failure: 2,500 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14) are confirmed lost/ghost inventory. mu_hat must be explicitly forced above the ghost inventory floor plus demand coverage to prompt any replenishment.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics environment for SKU 156231001 is categorized by systemic instability, though a significant arrival occurred last period. In Period 18, 660 units were ordered and arrived in Period 19 (actual lead time of 1 period, confirmed in Period 19 conclude). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 3940 units is severely inflated by 'ghost inventory' from previous failed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). Based on historical arrivals (P2 arrived P4, P11 arrived P13, P18 arrived P19), the actual lead time is likely 1-2 periods, so we maintain 'default' (2 periods). Demand has softened recently (avg ~103 over last 3 periods), but historical avg is ~220. My primary goal is to bypass the OR engine's 'inventory cap' logic by explicitly setting mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the 3940 units in-transit. To order approximately 800 units (intended to cover ~4 periods of demand at the historical mean), the target base stock must exceed the sum of current on-hand (577) and ghost inventory (~3940). Setting mu_hat to 4800 accomplishes this, forcing the engine to see a 'deficit' and place a new order. This is necessary because if I used calculated averages, the OR engine would see 3940 units 'coming' and order 0, leading to stockouts when those units never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Ghost inventory in-transit refined to approx 3940 units. Recent demand (P17-P19) has dropped significantly to avg ~103, but systemic replenishment failure remains the primary constraint. P18 order arrived with lead_time=1.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary constraint for SKU 156231001 is a massive 'ghost' in-transit inventory of 4,223 units, which significantly exceeds the current demand regime. The game history confirms that orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, and potentially P17 are lost (totalling approx. 3940 units) yet remain in the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. With on-hand inventory at 536 units and recent demand dropping to an average of ~84 units per period (P18-P20), the system will not place new orders unless the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) exceeds the pipeline inventory (4,223 units). I set mu_hat to 4600 explicitly to overcome this 'ghost' floor and provide coverage for approximately 3-4 periods of demand (100 units/period * (2L + 1)). Sigma_hat is set to 150 to maintain a high service level given the extreme delivery volatility. L is set to 2, the promised lead time, as recent arrivals show lead times of 1 (P18) and 2 (P11), despite the high loss rate.

Carry-over insight: Current ghost in-transit inventory is refined to approximately 3,940 units (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17). Recent demand (P17-P20) has shifted to a lower regime averaging ~88 units/period. The OR backend is paralyzed by the ghost inventory, requiring mu_hat to be set >4000 to trigger any order.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The central challenge remains the systemic failure of the logistics pipeline, where 3,940 units (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17) are recorded as 'In-transit' but are effectively lost. The OR backend subtracts this 'ghost' inventory from the target base stock, preventing new orders. To force replenishment, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds this ghost inventory plus the expected demand for the (L+1) window. Recent demand (P17-P21) has dropped significantly to an average of ~81 units per period (99, 127, 83, 41, 53). For a 2-period promised lead time (3-period window), expected demand is ~243. With ghost inventory at 3,940, a mu_hat of ~4,200 is required to signal a need for more stock. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 483 units relative to recent demand, so no immediate huge order is needed, but we must keep mu_hat high enough to neutralize the ghost inventory drag. I will use 'explicit' methods to maintain control over this offset.

Carry-over insight: Current ghost in-transit inventory is confirmed at 3,940 units (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17). Recent demand regime (P17-P21) has stabilized at a lower average of ~81 units/period. mu_hat must be maintained >4000 to offset ghost inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-660.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary constraint for SKU 156231001 is the presence of 3,940 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17) which are lost but still appear as 'In-transit' to the OR backend. With on-hand inventory at 713 units and current demand significantly lower (averaging ~66 units per period over the last 5 weeks: P18-P22), the 713 units currently on-hand are sufficient to cover approximately 10 weeks of demand at the current rate. Therefore, there is no immediate need to trigger a new order by inflating mu_hat. For Period 23, I will allow the inventory to wind down naturally. I will set mu_hat based on the recent lower demand regime (last 6 samples from 2019-06-10 onwards show a clear drop: 127, 83, 41, 53, 53, plus the pre-period P17 value of 99) to ensure the target stock level doesn't stay unnecessarily high, while acknowledging that the ghost inventory will keep the 'order' at 0 anyway. Actual lead time remains around 2 periods (as seen in the P20 order arriving in P22).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains low: avg ~71 units/period since Period 18 (2019-06-10). Ghost inventory (lost but in-transit) remains at 3,940 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing a systemic issue where approximately 3,940 units are permanently stuck in the 'In-transit' status (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17). This 'ghost inventory' prevents the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is overfilled. To maintain a healthy on-hand stock and account for current demand, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed this ghost inventory floor. Demand has significantly decreased since mid-June (avg ~52 over the last 5 periods P19-P23), but my primary goal is to bypass the OR engine's logic to maintain service levels. The 'On-hand' inventory is currently 683, which is sufficient for ~13 periods at recent demand rates, but given the extreme unreliability of the supply chain, the goal is to keep mu_hat near the ghost inventory count (3940) to prevent it from dropping below the order threshold prematurely. I will use 'explicit' values for L and sigma_hat to reflect observed lead times (avg 2) and current low volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' (20 denier tights) has entered a low-demand summer phase, with the last four periods averaging just ~36 units/period (compared to the spring average of ~260). Inventory management is currently dominated by a systemic logistics failure where 3,940 units are permanently stuck in the 'In-transit' pipeline (ghost inventory from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14, and 17). Because the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its target stock, this ghost inventory effectively paralyzes the replenishment system. As of Period 25, we have 674 units on-hand, which is sufficient to cover approximately 18 periods even at a safely estimated demand of 36 units/period. Therefore, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR engine from attempting to order more due to the ghost inventory offset used in previous periods, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=6) to reflect the current low-demand regime, while relying on the existing on-hand stock and the backend's natural capping logic (based on the 3,940 units in-transit) to result in zero order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime for tights confirmed (2019-06-24 onwards): average demand has dropped to ~36 units/period (86% decrease from spring peak). Ghost in-transit inventory remains at 3,940 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-demand summer phase (20 denier tights in August), with an average demand of approximately 31 units/period over the last 5 periods (P21-P25). On-hand inventory is 655 units, which provides approximately 20 weeks of coverage at current rates. The 'In-transit' figure of 3940 units remains comprised of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17). To prevent the OR backend from being paralyzed by this ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set above the in-transit floor (3940) plus the required safety stock. However, since we currently have excessive on-hand inventory relative to summer demand, there is no immediate need to trigger new orders. I will maintain mu_hat at a level that acknowledges the ghost inventory but does not force a surplus buy, while using recent_N for sigma to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019-08-12), the SKU remains in its summer low-demand regime, with the last 7 periods (since P20) averaging approximately 41 units/period. The current on-hand inventory of 571 units is sufficient to cover approximately 14 weeks of current demand, meaning no new orders are required. The 'In-transit' figure of 3940 units remains highly inflated due to 'ghost inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, and P17 that never arrived). Since inventory is more than ample for the current regime, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=7 to capture the summer trend. To prevent the OR engine from attempting to replenish based on the phantom inventory count, I will allow L to default to the promised 2 periods and set mu_hat to be lower than the current pipeline, which naturally results in zero orders. This strategy prioritizes minimizing holding costs while on-hand stock is high.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' (20 denier tights) is entering historical late-August/early-September, which typically sees a 'Back to School' or transition-to-autumn demand spike. Period 27 demand rose significantly to 197 units, confirming the end of the summer lull (avg ~36). The current on-hand inventory of 374 units is sufficient for approximately 2 weeks if demand trends toward 180-200. However, the 'ghost' inventory of 3,940 units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17) remains in the backend's pipeline calculation, preventing any automatic replenishment. To ensure a safety margin for the upcoming seasonal transition and to prevent the backend from being 'blind' to our inventory needs, I am keeping mu_hat set above the ghost inventory level. An explicit mu_hat of 4400 covers the 3940 ghost units plus approximately 460 units (representing roughly 2+ weeks of demand at the recovering rate of ~180-200). L is set to explicit 2 (the promised and most frequent successful lead time). sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for the high volatility observed during regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed starting Period 27 (2019-08-12): demand jumped to 197 units (+447% from summer avg) signaling the onset of the autumn/back-to-school transition. Ghost in-transit inventory remains constant at 3,940 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the autumn peak season for tights (late August). Demand has rebounded from the summer low (avg ~36) to an average of 173 over the last two weeks (P27: 197, P28: 149). This trend is expected to continue or intensify as school terms begin and weather cools. In-transit inventory stands at 4,026 units, but the vast majority is 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). Only the order from P28 (86 units) is potentially valid. To force the OR backend to place new orders despite the 4,026 units recorded in-transit, mu_hat must be set above this 'ghost' floor. To cover the current demand regime (~175 units/period) across the lead-time plus review period (L+1 = 3), we need 525 units of live stock. Adding 525 to the 4,026 units of ghost inventory yields a target mu_hat of approx 4,551. Setting mu_hat to 4,600 using the explicit method to ensure replenishment is triggered.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery confirmed (starting P27): Average demand rose to ~173 (+380% vs summer). Cumulative ghost inventory remains at ~4,026 units across multiple lost historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' (Womens Tights) is currently in an autumn demand recovery phase following the summer slump. Recent demand (P27-P29) averages ~153 units/period, significantly higher than the summer average of ~36. We are nearing early September, a peak period for back-to-school and autumn wardrobe transitions. The primary constraint remains the 'ghost' in-transit inventory of 4,375 units. This pipeline is composed of numerous lost historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target stock level, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is explicitly set higher than the sum of the ghost inventory and the desired safety stock. To trigger replenishment and cover the (L+1=3) period window at a forecast of ~180 units/period (total 540) plus the 4,375 ghost units, I am setting mu_hat to 5000 units. Sigma_hat is set to 300 to provide a robust buffer against the increased volatility observed during seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost in-transit inventory refined to 4,375 units (comprising lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). Replenishment requires mu_hat to be explicitly set above this 4,375 floor. Autumn demand regime (P27 onwards) confirmed at ~153 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' (Womens Tights) is currently in an autumn demand recovery phase (back-to-school/seasonal transition), with Period 30 demand spiking to 243 units. The 4-period average for this new regime (P27-P30) is approximately 176 units/period. The primary constraint remains the systemic logic failure where 4,375 units are listed as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost (ghost inventory from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). To trigger the OR engine to place any new order, the internal base stock calculation (which subtracts In-transit from mu_hat) must be forced above this ghost inventory floor. Current total In-transit is 4803. This includes the ghost inventory (4375) plus recent orders from P29 (349) and P30 (514) which total 863 units. Since the P29 order is expected to arrive in Period 31 (L=2), and on-hand is currently 0, we must ensure mu_hat covers the ghost floor + desired safety stock for the recovery regime. Setting mu_hat to 5500 via the explicit method ensures the backend recognizes a deficit despite the ghost inventory, aiming to maintain a service level for the 176/period demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost in-transit inventory is confirmed at 4,375 units (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). mu_hat must be set above this floor to trigger replenishment. Autumn demand (P27-P30) is averaging ~176 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge remains the systemic 'ghost' inventory of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) totaling 4,375 units. This in-transit figure prevents the OR backend from ordering unless mu_hat is set above this floor. Period 31 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and 274 lost sales, confirming the urgent need for replenishment. The current demand regime (Autumn recovery, P27-P31) averages ~195 units/period (197, 149, 114, 243, 274). To trigger an order, mu_hat must cover the ghost inventory (4,375) plus the expected demand for the lead-time window (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the recent average of 195 units: 195 * 3 = 585 units. Therefore, the target base stock must be at least 4,375 + 585 = 4,960. Given the high stockout risk and volatile recovery, I am setting mu_hat slightly higher at 5,100 to ensure a robust order is generated despite the 'In-transit' baggage. L is kept at 'calculate' as recent successful deliveries (P28, P20) confirm the 2-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-701.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a systemic 'ghost inventory' issue where lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) remain in the 'In-transit' count (approx. 4,289 units). This prevents the OR backend from ordering unless the target base stock (mu_hat) is set higher than this ghost floor. However, an arrival of 1,211 units in Period 32 (from P30 and P31 orders) has replenished on-hand inventory to 956 units. Current autumn demand (Date: 2019-09-23) is high, averaging ~257 units/period over the last 3 weeks. To maintain this stock without being paralyzed by ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set as: (Ghost In-transit + 3 periods of expected demand). Total Ghost In-transit is verified as 4,289. Expected demand is ~260. Target = 4289 + (3 * 260) = 5069. Setting mu_hat to 5070 and sigma_hat explicitly to handle the volatility of the autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost in-transit inventory updated to 4,289 units (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). Successive arrivals in P32 (514 units and 697 units) confirm that recent logistics are functioning with lead times of 1-2 periods, but historical ghost units persist. Autumn demand (P30-P32) is confirmed at a higher regime of ~257 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 20 denier tights, entering its peak autumn/winter season. Current demand in Period 33 spiked to 496 units, confirming a sharp upward trend (P30-P33 average: 317 units). On-hand inventory is 460 units. 'In-transit' is still inflated by 4,289 ghost units (lost historical orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). To trigger an order from the backend OR engine, mu_hat must be set above this ghost inventory floor plus the desired target inventory. Recent logistics have stabilized with a lead time (L) of 1-2 periods (P32 arrivals were L=2 and L=1). Using recent_N for L allows the engine to reflect this improvement. Given the seasonality and recent jump to 496, I set mu_hat explicitly to 5,500 (Ghost Inventory 4,289 + approx 1,200 for 3 weeks of high-season demand) to ensure replenishment starts before stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Cumulative ghost inventory remains 4,289 units. Autumn demand is accelerating significantly (P33 demand 496 vs P30-32 avg 257), requiring aggressive mu_hat adjustment to bypass ghost inventory floor.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak autumn/winter season for 20 denier tights (October). Demand has surged from a summer low (~36) to an autumn average of ~315 (P30-34). The most recent demand was 358 units. The primary operational constraint remains 'ghost inventory': 4,289 units in-transit are confirmed lost from historical periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) but still occupy the OR engine's pipeline view. To trigger any replenishment, mu_hat must be set above this ghost inventory floor plus the desired safety stock for the current demand regime. With recent demand averaging ~315 and lead time L=2, the base stock required is approximately (1+2)*315 + safety_stock. To bypass the 4,289 ghost units and the 5,040 total reported in-transit units, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Total In-transit is currently 5,040, which includes 4,289 ghost units and the P29 (349) and P34 (751) orders. Since P29 is likely lost (now 5 periods late), I must treat the effective ghost floor as ~4,638. I will set mu_hat to 6,200 to ensure the engine places an order to cover the seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost inventory floor increased to ~4,638 units as the Period 29 order (349 units) is now 3 periods overdue and likely lost. Autumn/Winter demand peak is confirmed with recent mean demand ~315 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn/winter regime (avg ~350 units/period) with zero on-hand inventory and a heavily inflated 'in-transit' pipeline (6,098 units). This pipeline is largely composed of 'ghost' inventory from lost historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, and now likely P29). Total confirmed ghost inventory is approximately 4,638 units. To trigger any new orders from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value that covers both the dormant ghost inventory floor (~4,638) and the projected demand for the review + lead time periods (L+1 = 3 periods). Using a recent demand average of ~350, the required coverage is 4,638 + (3 * 350) = 5,688. I will set mu_hat to 6,100 to ensure the backend moves beyond the 6,098 in-transit figure and places an order to replenish exhausted on-hand stocks during this peak season. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility of the current autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Ghost inventory floor refined to ~4,638 units. Recent autumn/winter demand (P33-P35) confirmed at ~400 units/period. The OR backend remains paralyzed by ghost in-transit inventory, requiring mu_hat >6000 to trigger replenishment.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn/winter regime (P33-P36 avg: 385 units/period). The primary operational challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' \u2013 lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, and P29 that total approximately 4,638 units. These units are 'In-transit' but will never arrive, causing the OR backend to believe the pipeline is full and preventing new orders. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value representing (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory. Using L=2 (promised) and current demand (~400/period), the required coverage is 3 * 400 = 1200 units. Adding the 4,638 ghost units, the mu_hat must be > 5838. I will set mu_hat to 6500 to ensure a robust safety stock (z*sigma) while accounting for the high volatility in the current peak season. Recent arrivals (P32, P36) show lead times of 1-2 periods, confirming the logistics channel for new orders is active despite historical losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost inventory floor remains ~4,638 units. Peak season demand (Oct-Nov) is stable at ~400 units/period. Logistics for new orders are functional with lead times of 1-2 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 156231001 is in peak autumn/winter demand (tights). Recent demand (P33-P37) shows a consistent high regime averaging ~398 units/period. The primary challenge is the systemic 'ghost inventory' in the OR backend's pipeline. Based on historical data, the in-transit amount of 5779 units significantly overstates actual reliable stock. We identify 'ghost' units from lost orders: P1(228), P3(274), P4(369), P10(647), P13(744), P14(238), P17(720), P19(720), and P29(349), totaling 4289 units previously, now reconciled with the current in-transit of 5779. The actual reliable pipeline is likely only the P34(751) and P37(737) orders. To trigger an order, mu_hat must exceed (ghost inventory + current safety stock + anticipated demand for L+1 periods). Given ghost inventory is ~4291 (5779 - 751 - 737) and demand is ~400/period, we need a mu_hat floor starting at roughly 5500. We explicitly set mu_hat to 6800 to ensure the backend places a replenishment order for approximately 1000 units, accounting for the 274 on-hand and the ~1488 reliable in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory floor refined to approximately 4,291 units (confirmed lost: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29). Recent logistics for new orders show lead times of 1-2 periods. Steady peak demand of ~400 units/period holds through late October.

Logistics for new orders have improved, showing lead times of 1-2 periods, but the system remains burdened by a significant 'ghost' inventory of lost historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29) totaling approximately 4,291 units. This ghost inventory is incorrectly counted as 'In-transit' by the OR engine, preventing it from placing necessary replenishment orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to exceed this floor. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered for the upcoming week and to maintain a service level for the peak season demand (~383 units/week), mu_hat is set to 6400 (which accounts for the ghost inventory floor of 4291 + 3 periods of expected demand, where (1+L)*383 \u2248 1149). This explicit setting forces the OR engine to recognize a deficit despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Current ghost in-transit inventory is confirmed at 4,291 units (lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29). Recent logistics show stable lead times of 1-2 periods. Peak season demand (Nov-Dec) is sustaining an average of ~383 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak winter demand season (November-December). Current on-hand inventory is 382. The 'In-transit' figure is significantly inflated at 5,787 units due to a series of lost historical orders. My analysis confirms 4,375 'ghost' units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) and likely P29 (349 units), totaling ~4,724 ghost units. To trigger any replenishment from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set as an 'explicit' value that encompasses the ghost inventory (4,724) plus the forecasted demand for the lead time and review period. Recent demand (P34-P39) averages ~354 units/period. With a Lead Time (L) of 2, the required 'real' base stock is ~1,062 (3 periods of demand). Thus, mu_hat is set to 5,800 (4,724 + 1,076) to ensure the backend generates an order of approximately 400-500 units to maintain service levels during peak season. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals show lead times of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost in-transit inventory refined to ~4,724 units (including P29). Sustained peak season demand (Nov) is averaging ~354 units/period (+100% vs early Autumn). Logistics for new orders are stable at 1-2 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-18. We are in the late-autumn/early-winter demand peak for 20 denier tights. Recent demand (P36-P40) has stabilized at an average of approximately 337 units/period. The pipeline remains heavily inflated by ghost inventory. Total 'In-transit' is 5,787 units. Based on historical data, approximately 4,724 units are long-lost 'ghost' units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, and P29). Subtracting these from the current 5,787 'In-transit' leaves roughly 1,063 units of legitimate pipeline inventory (primarily the P38 order of 747 units and recent adjustments). To trigger a new order, since on-hand is low (111), the backend's base_stock must be set above the total In-transit of 5,787. I will set mu_hat to 7,200 to cover approximately 3 periods of peak demand (~1,000 units) plus the 5,787 ghost/pipeline floor. This ensures the OR backend issues a replenishment order to maintain stock through the winter season. Lead time for viable deliveries is currently stable at 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost in-transit inventory is confirmed at ~4,724 units. Logistics for active orders (P35-P39) are functional with lead times of 1-3 periods. Demand remains in a high-season regime averaging ~337 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 156231001 (20 denier tights) is in its peak late-autumn/winter season. Current demand (P37-P41) is averaging ~327 units/period. The primary constraint remains the 'ghost' in-transit inventory. Pipeline shows 7089 units, but historical analysis confirms that approximately 4,724 units are lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29). Subtracting these lost units from the pipeline (7089 - 4724) leaves an 'active' pipeline of ~2,365 units. These active units include orders from P34 (751), P38 (747), and P41 (1302). Note that P34 (ordered Sept 30) is now 7 periods overdue and likely lost, further increasing the ghost inventory to ~5,475 (4724 + 751). The OR backend is paralyzed by this high 'In-transit' figure and will not order unless mu_hat is set significantly above the ghost floor. To ensure availability for the remaining 5 periods of the game, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to offset the ghost floor plus cover 3 periods of peak demand (327 * 3 = 981). Using an explicit mu_hat of 6500 (Ghost Floor ~5475 + Demand 981) to force the necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed ghost in-transit inventory increased to ~5,475 units as the Period 34 order (751 units) is now 7 periods overdue and considered lost. High-season demand (Nov) remains stable at ~325-350 units/period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' (20 denier tights) is in its peak demand season (late autumn/early winter). Recent demand (P42) surged to 461 units, likely due to Black Friday or typical late November retail behavior. The current system state shows 0 on-hand inventory and 7089 units in-transit. Based on historical carry-over data, approximately 5,475 of these units are 'ghost' inventory (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, and now P34, which is 9 weeks overdue). These ghost units are lost but continue to inflate the pipeline inventory, preventing the OR backend from placing new orders unless mu_hat is set above this floor. To trigger ordering and provide coverage for (L+1) periods, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Ghost Inventory \u2248 5,475) + ((L+1) * Expected Demand \u2248 3 * 375) \u2248 6,600 units. Sigma_hat is calculated to handle the increased volatility seen in recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory floor refined to ~5,475 units. Demand spiked to 461 in P42, confirming high-season volatility. Current logistics show lead times of 1-3 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Dec 9, 2019 (Period 44). The product is 20 denier tights, which are currently in their peak winter season. Recent demand (P33-P43) has averaged ~327 units/period, despite a lower demand of 200 in P43 (likely due to the previous period's stockout). The primary constraint remains the 'ghost' in-transit inventory, which has increased to 5,475 units. This figure represents orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, and P34 that the OR backend still considers 'active' in-transit even though they are confirmed/highly likely lost. The current total in-transit is 5,787 units, meaning only 312 units (5,787 - 5,475) are actually 'live' pipeline. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR engine, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value that covers the ghost inventory floor plus approximately 3-4 periods of peak demand (L+1 coverage where L=2). I am setting mu_hat = 6800 to ensure we bypass the ghost inventory threshold and maintain stock for the final winter periods. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=11) to account for holiday-season volatility.

Carry-over insight: Current ghost in-transit inventory is confirmed at 5,475 units (lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). Peak season demand continues to average ~327 units/period.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (2019-12-16), we are in the peak season for 20 denier tights. Recent demand (P41-P44) has averaged ~328 units. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 5,787 units, but historical analysis confirms a massive 'ghost inventory' of units that will never arrive. These lost orders include P1 (228), P3 (274), P4 (369), P10 (647), P13 (744), P14 (238), P17 (720), P19 (720), P29 (349), P34 (751), and P38 (747), totaling approximately 5,787 units. Essentially, the entire current 'In-transit' pipeline consists of ghost inventory. To trigger any combined replenishment for high-season demand, mu_hat must be set above this ghost floor. I will set mu_hat to 6,800 to cover the ~5,800 ghost units plus roughly 1,000 units (representing ~3 weeks of peak demand at ~330/week) to ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order. Logistics for non-lost orders remain stable at a lead time of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory updated to ~5,787 units (including P38). Replenishment remains contingent on mu_hat exceeding this floor. Peak season demand (Dec) continues to average ~330 units/period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-23, peak winter season for 20 denier tights. Demand remains high, with the P45 demand spike at 468 units. The logistics environment is characterized by significant 'ghost' inventory\u2014historical orders that are lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure, preventing the OR engine from placing new orders. Confirmed ghost orders include P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34, and now likely P38 (ordered P38, now P46 start, 8 periods elapsed). Total ghost inventory is approximately 6,065 units (matching the current In-transit balance). To trigger a replenishment order, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value exceeding this 6,065 ceiling plus the safety stock requirement for the prompt 2-period lead time. I am setting mu_hat to 7,500 to offset the ~6k ghost units and provide coverage for approx 1,500 units (roughly 3-4 weeks of demand). Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Ghost in-transit inventory is confirmed at 6,065 units (lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34, P38). Replenishment is only possible if mu_hat is explicitly set above this floor. Peak winter demand remains strong, averaging ~320-450 units/period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-30. Demand for 20 denier tights remains high during the winter peak season, averaging ~396 units/period over the last 10 periods (P37-P46). Inventory is currently zero. The major constraint remains the systemic 'ghost' in-transit inventory, currently totaling 6,065 units across lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34, P38). To trigger new replenishment from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set above this ghost inventory floor plus the desired safety stock. I have calculated mu_hat based on the winter demand average (~400/period) over (L+1)=3 periods, plus the ghost floor: (3 * 400) + 6065 = 7265. Logistics for active orders (recent arrivals in P43 and P18/38) confirm that functional lead times are between 1-3 periods, so L is set to calculate.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost in-transit inventory is confirmed at 6,065 units (lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34, P38). Winter demand peak is sustained at avg ~400 units/period (P37-P46).
