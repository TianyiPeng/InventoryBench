Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-02-11. We are entering Period 1 for SKU 562245018 (Luna skinny jeans). Historical demand data suggests a clear upward trend leading into February: 101, 101, 117, 123, 157. This indicates a growing demand regime (+55% increase over 5 weeks). Given the current inventory is 0 and promised lead time is 2 periods, we need to set parameters that cover the risk of stockout during the (L+1) = 3 period lead-plus-review time. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher recent values (N=3 encompasses 117, 123, 157) and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for historical variance. Lead time (L) starts at the promised 'default' of 2.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). Last week (Period 1), 171 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 2. We observed a demand of 150, but since on-hand was 0, zero sales occurred. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend (101, 101, 117, 123, 157, 150). Looking at the product description ('Luna skinny RW trousers'), this is a staple item, but the rising trend suggests seasonal buildup or a response to February fashion transitions. I will use the last 4 samples (123, 157, 150, and 150 from Period 1) to derive mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime more accurately than a full historical average. Lead time is set to default (2) as we have not yet completed enough cycles to confirm a deviation from the promise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history shows a clear upward trend: 101, 101, 117, 123, 157 (pre-game) followed by 150 and 177 in Periods 1 and 2. The average of the last 4 observations (123, 157, 150, 177) is approximately 152. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders from Period 1 (171 units) and Period 2 (170 units) are in transit (Total 341). Period 1's order is expected to arrive in Period 3's arrival phase (visible in Period 4), and Period 2's order in Period 4. No orders have concluded yet, so we stick to the promised lead time L=2. To capture the recent demand surge and ensure sufficient base stock for the next (L+1)=3 periods, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This balances the recent high demand against the risk of high holding costs ($1.0/unit), given profit is also $1.0/unit (critical ratio q = 0.5).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU '562245018' is a women's skinny jean. On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite high demand. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The Period 1 order (171 units) was placed on 2019/2/11 and, with L=2, should have arrived during Period 3's arrival phase (making it visible in Period 4's conclude message). However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This signifies either a lead time delay (L > 2) or a lost shipment. Historical demand (101, 101, 117, 123, 157, 150, 177, 164) shows a clear upward trend as we move further into the spring season. The mean demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 162.75. Given we have 0 on-hand and orders are potentially late, I will maintain the base stock logic but use a more recent window (N=5) for demand to capture the upward trend. I will keep L at 'calculate' to see if the system detects the delayed arrival once it occurs.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/03/11. The product is women's 5-pocket skinny jeans. Current period observed demand (P1-P4) averages 163 units, while the provided initial samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 120 units, indicating an upward shift in demand coinciding with the approach of spring. We have 9 units on hand and 293 in transit (orders from P1, P3, and P4). Period 2 order arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 2 (arrived P4, ordered P2). The Period 1 order (171 units) is now 1 period overdue (should have arrived P3); however, since the P2 order arrived on time, the P1 order might be delayed or potentially lost. To be safe, I will forecast based on the recent demand regime (last 4 periods excluding historical samples) to ensure we cover the current higher consumption rate (avg 163). I will use L=2 (default) as the P2 arrival confirms it's still the active baseline. mu_hat will use recent_N=4 to reflect the 160+ demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected from mid-February: mean demand increased from ~120 to ~163 (+35%). Lead time for P2 order confirmed at 2 periods. P1 order (placed 2019/2/11) is currently 1 period overdue as of P4 conclude.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/03/18), the system is facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The product description (Luna skinny jeans) suggests stable everyday demand, but history shows a mean shift. The demand mean from pre-game samples (avg 120) increased to an average of 160.8 over the last 5 periods (150, 177, 164, 161, 152). Significant Concern: The order from Period 1 (171 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P1, promised L=2, expected arrival P3, currently P6 start). Given that the P2 order arrived on time in P4, the P1 shipment is likely lost. I am accounting for this by treating 'In-transit' as actual pipeline inventory minus the lost 171 units. To prevent severe stockouts while balancing high holding costs (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 50% service level target), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher 160+ mean. For lead time, I'll stick to 'default' (2) because the P2 order arrived exactly on time, suggesting the P1 issue was a loss rather than a lead-time extension.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 1 order (171 units) confirmed lost (overdue by 3 periods); pipeline accounting adjusted. Demand regime stable at ~161/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product (women's skinny jeans) is in a stable demand regime. Since Period 2, weekly demand has averaged approximately 160 units (177, 164, 161, 152, 148). The Period 1 order is confirmed lost, and the Period 3 & 4 orders (115 and 7 units respectively) are still in-transit. The Period 5 order arrived in only 1 period, which is faster than the promised 2 periods, but I will maintain the default lead time of 2 for safety. Given the parity between profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. Current on-hand is low (34), and while 122 units (P3+P4) are overdue/near-due, they may be at risk of loss like the P1 order. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the stable ~160/period demand and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This configuration ensures the base stock covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~480 units) minus the surviving pipeline (301).

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: P2 order took 2 periods, P5 order took 1 period, P1 order was lost. Demand remains stable at ~160 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), we are seeing a significant demand spike in the most recent period (Period 7: 366 units), which is more than double the previous regime mean of ~160. This aligns with late March/early April seasonality for women's denim (new spring collections). On-hand inventory is depleted (0 units), and the pipeline consists of 448 units (orders from P3, P4, P6, and P7). Specifically, the P3 order (115 units) is now 2 periods overdue based on a 2-period promised lead time, suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed, similar to the P1 loss. However, since it hasn't been officially confirmed lost, it remains in pipeline inventory. Given the massive jump in demand, I am shifting mu_hat to use an explicit forecast. I assume the spike to 366 is the new peak 'Spring' level. Assuming L=2, mu_hat (covering L+1=3 periods) needs to account for this elevated demand. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the variability (1-2 periods) and mu_hat explicitly to 1098 (366 * 3) to prevent stockouts during this high-demand window. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus on current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Spring spike detected (demand increased from ~160 to 366). P3 order (115 units) is now 2 periods overdue (ordered P3, current P8), mirroring the P1 loss pattern.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/08. We are seeing a significant demand surge (Spring peak) that began in Period 7 (366 units) and continues in Period 8 (235 units), with an average of ~300 units/period over the last two weeks compared to the previous regime of ~160. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline inventory is 865 units, but this includes the Period 3 order (115 units) which is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P3, current P9 start, promised L=2) and likely lost, following the P1 loss pattern. Subtracting the likely lost P3 units, effective pipeline is ~750. Lead times have been volatile (1-2 periods). I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the current high-demand spring regime (300/week * (1+L)) and using a recent_N sigma to capture the increased volatility of this peak period. We must order aggressively to recover from the stockout and handle the seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 3 order (115 units) confirmed lost (overdue by 3 periods); pipeline adjusted. Spring seasonal peak confirmed (avg ~300 units/week since P7).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The demand history shows a significant shift starting at Period 7 (the 'Spring spike'), where demand rose to 366, then varied (235, 160). The product is 'Womens Everyday Collection' skinny jeans, which typically see high demand during spring. Lead time remains erratic but generally averages around 2 periods, with multiple lost shipments (P1 and P3). On-hand is currently 0, with 900 units in-transit (reflecting the large order placed in P8 to cover the spring spike). I am using an explicit mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (~230/week) multiplied by (1+L=3) to ensure the backend base-stock targets are high enough to capture the spring season demand, while allowing 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for the observed mix of 1 and 2 period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal regime (started P7) shows high volatility with mean weekly demand ~230 units. Lead time is inconsistently 1 or 2 periods (avg ~1.5).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/04/22), the 'Spring seasonal regime' (Period 7-10) is showing significant volatility, with demand dropping from a peak of 366 (P7) to a more consistent 148-160 range over the last two periods. Mean demand during this window (P7-P10) is 227 units/week. However, the most recent demand (P9 and P10) has reverted to earlier levels (~154 avg). Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P7 arrived in 1, P8 in 2, P9 in 1). I will set L to 2 to be conservative against delays. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture the seasonal shift averages while acknowledging the recent dip. Sigma_hat is set to explicit (150) to account for the high variance observed during this April transition period (standard deviation between 148 and 366 is high). The current high on-hand (459) and in-transit (293) means the OR engine will likely order very little or zero, which is appropriate given we have sufficient stock for nearly 3-4 weeks if demand stays at ~150-200.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand peak (P7-P10) shows high variance (Range: 148-366). Post-Easter/mid-April demand (P9-P10) suggests a return to a ~155 units/week mean from the earlier spike of 300+.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), we are in a post-peak spring demand phase. Historical demand data and recent 'Period conclude' messages indicate that the high-volatility spring spike (which peaked at 366 in P7 and stayed elevated through P8) has subsided. The last three periods (P9-P11) show stable demand (160, 148, 152), averaging approximately 153 units/week. This aligns with the 'carry-over insight' from P11 suggesting a return to a ~155 mean. Lead times remain inconsistent (varying between 1 and 2 periods), so I will use an explicit L=2 to be safe, while note that on-hand inventory (307) and in-transit (293) are currently high due to the large P8 arrival. For mu_hat, I am selecting N=3 to capture the precise current demand regime (P9-P11) and exclude the outlier spike. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current lower volatility compared to the April peak. The OR backend will likely order 0 units this period as current inventory (600 total) far exceeds the requirement for a ~155 unit/week mean across a 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: Demand since P9 has reverted to a mean of ~153 units/week (P9-P11: 160, 148, 152) after the mid-spring volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), demand for 'Luna skinny RW' has stabilized following a volatile spring peak (P7-P10). The demand over the last four periods (P9-P12) has been consistent: 160, 148, 152, 157, yielding an average of ~154 units per week. The spring spike (P7-P8) is considered a seasonal outlier and is excluded from the current mean calculation to avoid over-ordering. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (mean ~1.5). With 150 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit (as the large P8-P9 orders have arrived and concluding P12 shows in-transit as effectively zero for new orders since none were placed recently), I will set parameters to maintain a base stock covering the 2-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=3). mu_hat is set to 462 (154 * 3) using recent_N=4 to capture this stable post-peak regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/5/13), the SKU 562245018 (Women's Skinny Jeans) has entered a stable post-spring regime. Demand has settled significantly following the late-March spike. For the last five periods (P9-P13), weekly demand has been: 160, 148, 152, 157, 143, resulting in a mean of approximately 152 units/week. On-hand inventory is low (7 units) while in-transit (313 units) includes the order from P13 (20 units) and orders placed in P11-P12 (which were 0). However, looking at the history, the 'In-transit' figure of 313 likely incorrectly includes 'lost' orders from P1 and P3 which are never arriving, meaning the realistic pipeline is much smaller. Given lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (mode is 2), I will set L to 2. mu_hat will use recent_N=5 to capture the stable 152 units/week mean. sigma_hat will use recent_N=5 to account for the current low-volatility environment (std dev ~6.5), ensuring we don't over-order based on the March spike while maintaining a high service level for this stable basic item.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), the item is out of stock (On-hand: 0). Recent demand history (P11-P14) shows 152, 157, 143, 111, indicating a downward trend toward approximately 130-140 units/week after the spring peak. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; using 'calculate' is appropriate to average these observations. The system currently shows 449 units in-transit (orders from P13 and P14, plus remnants from P10-P12 logic). To maintain a proper base stock while account for the recent demand dip, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the post-peak stabilization (Avg ~140). This will signal the OR backend to replenish enough to cover the lead time + review period without excessive holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression observed: Post-spring stabilization (P11-P14) shows a declining mean from 155 to ~130-140 units/week.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/27. Demand has significantly declined over the last few periods (P13-P15: 143, 111, 96), indicating the end of the spring season and a return to a lower baseline demand for women's denim. I am setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent downward trend and prevent over-ordering as we enter June. Lead time remains erratic, averaging between 1 and 2 periods (P8: 2, P9: 1, P5: 1), so I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance. With 449 units currently in-transit (orders from P13 and P14 expected to arrive imminently), the pipeline is already heavy relative to the current demand mean (~116 units/week). My chosen parameters will likely result in a zero order this period to allow the existing in-transit inventory to clear the stock-out and reach optimal levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression confirmed: Mid-May through late May (P13-P15) shows a significant demand reduction (mean ~116) vs. April (mean ~153), signaling a post-spring seasonal drop.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear regression: a spring peak (~230-300 units/week) was followed by stabilization at ~153 units, and most recently a significant decline over the last three periods (P14: 111, P15: 96, P16: 64). As we enter June, demand for 'skinny RW jeans' appears to be softening, possibly due to summer seasonality or the end of the spring shopping cycle. The mean demand for the last 3 samples is 90.3, significantly lower than earlier regimes. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, with occasional lost shipments. 'In-transit' inventory stands at 449 units (from P13 order of 20, P14 order of 136, and potentially older unfulfilled orders), which is extremely high relative to the current low demand. With 0 on-hand inventory but 449 in-transit units, and a declining demand trend, the priority is to avoid over-ordering and minimize potential holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the sharp downturn, and L to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time (approx 1.5-2). The large pipeline inventory (449) against an expected base stock requirement of roughly 3*90 = 270 will cause the OR backend to place zero new orders, allowing the system to work through existing transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Early June demand confirms a seasonal decline; mean demand dropped from ~153 to ~90 units/week over P14-P16 (-40%). Pipeline inventory remains high (449 units) relative to this new lower demand regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. Demand for the women's skinny jeans SKU has undergone a significant seasonal decline starting around P14. The last four periods of demand (P14-P17) are 111, 96, 64, and 59, showing a distinct downward trend towards a mean of ~82 units/week. Previously, demand was significantly higher (150+). Current on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 449 units in-transit (ordered in P13 with 20 units and P14 with 136 units, but the math implies an additional large backlog or pipeline adjustment from previous periods as 'In-transit' shows 449). Specifically, 20 units from P13 and 136 units from P14 are now 5 and 4 periods 'old' respectively. Given historical lost orders (P1, P3), these might be missing. However, the system reports 449 units 'In-transit'. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the lower demand regime (mean ~82). Since demand is low and pipeline is high (relative to 82/week), the OR backend's capped base-stock policy should correctly prevent new orders until current pipeline arrivals are resolved or proven lost. Lead time is set to calculate to reflect the historical 1-2 period variance.

Carry-over insight: June seasonal trough confirmed: Mean demand since P16 has dropped to ~60 units/week, down from ~153 in April/May (-60%). Potential for shipment delays or losses identified for orders from P13/P14.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June), currently in a seasonal trough for women's trousers/jeans. Since Period 16, demand has consistently stabilized at a low mean of approximately 59 units/week (P16-P18: 64, 59, 55). Furthermore, the pipeline is extremely heavy with 449 units in-transit (orders from P13 and P14), while on-hand inventory is 0. These orders (20 units from P13 and 136 units from P14) are now 5 and 4 periods old respectively, and since the promised lead time is 2, they may be lost or significantly delayed, mimicking the loss patterns from P1 and P3. However, even if they arrive, the total in-transit (449) far exceeds the current demand regime of ~60 units/week. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level. My objective is to prevent further ordering while demand is low and the pipeline is already over-leveraged. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand stability (~59) and set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the persistent arrival delays seen in history.

Carry-over insight: June seasonal trough confirmed: demand since P16 has stabilized at ~59 units/week mean (-60% vs. spring). High risk of shipment loss/extreme delay for orders from P13/P14 (4 and 5 periods old).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans) has stabilized in a midsummer seasonal trough. For the last four periods (P16-P19), demand has been extremely consistent: 64, 59, 55, and 57 (mean = 58.75). The pipeline inventory currently shows 449 units, which is significantly over-provisioned for this new regime (approx. 7.6 periods of cover). However, this pipeline consists entirely of orders from P13 (20 units, 6 periods ago) and P14 (136 units, 5 periods ago), which are both far beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods and the observed maximum of 2. Based on previous behavior (P1 and P3 orders were confirmed lost after 3 periods overdue), these 156 units (20+136=156) are likely lost. The remainder of the 'In-transit' figure in the prompt (449 units) appears to be an error in the system's pipeline reporting or a result of zero-order periods, but regardless, on-hand inventory is 0. Since the L+1 period demand (at 59 units/week) is 177 units and we have 0 on-hand, we need to order. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this stable low-demand regime and stick to the promised lead time L=2 to avoid over-ordering, as the service level calculation (Profit $1, Holding $1 -> 50% target) favors lean inventory when costs are balanced.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P13 and P14 (156 units total) are confirmed lost (overdue by 4+ periods). June/July seasonal trough demand confirmed stable at ~59 units/week (P16-P19).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), the SKU 562245018 (Skinny Jeans) is in a significant seasonal trough. Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 54 units/week over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), a ~65% decrease from the April peak. In-transit inventory stands at 449 units, which arrived from orders placed in P15-P20; however, historical data shows a recurring problem with lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14 were all lost). Specifically, the in-transit balance of 449 units is suspiciously high given that zero units were ordered between P15 and P20. This suggests the OR backend is still carrying 'phantom' pipeline inventory from the P13/P14 orders which was confirmed lost in the previous Carry-over Insight. Since on-hand is 0 and demand is low but steady (avg 54), I will set mu_hat to 165 (approx (1+2)*55) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the low volatility of the current trough. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time as it reflects the current 1-2 period delivery variance when orders actually arrive.

Carry-over insight: July demand confirms continuation of summer trough: P16-P20 mean is 54 units/week with low volatility. Pipeline inventory (449) is heavily inflated by lost orders from P13/P14.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), the SKU is in a deep summer trough. Demand has decreased steadily from ~153 units/week in April/May to a mean of approximately 42 units/week over the last three periods (57, 33, 24). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is zero, yet 'In-transit' shows 449 units. My analysis confirms that orders from Period 13 (20 units) and Period 14 (136 units) are lost, as they are now 8 and 9 periods overdue against a promised lead time of 2. This leaves a ghost pipeline of 156 units that the OR backend will incorrectly assume is arriving. Furthermore, no orders have been placed since Period 14, meaning the remaining 293 units in 'In-transit' must be from even earlier periods (likely the Period 8 order of 572, where only 572 was reported arrived, but mathematical discrepancies in the transit total suggest long-term pipeline corruption). Since the 'In-transit' total (449) vastly exceeds the required base stock for a 42-unit demand regime (~126-150 units), the OR engine will not place new orders unless L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat are adjusted to bypass this inflated pipeline. I will set L to 2, mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects the current 42-unit mean, and sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility to ensure we don't over-order into a declining summer market.

Carry-over insight: July demand confirms deep summer trough: mean demand for late June/early July (P19-P21) has dropped to ~38 units/week. Pipeline inventory of 449 is entirely comprised of lost or ghost orders from Period 14 and earlier.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (2019/07/15), the demand for women's denim/trousers is in a deep summer trough. Demand over the last three periods (P20-P22) has averaged ~32.6 units/week (33, 24, 41). The pipeline inventory (449 units) is significantly legacy-inflated by orders from P13 (20 units) and P14 (136 units) that are now 9-10 periods overdue and confirmed lost, alongside 171 units lost from P1 and 115 units lost from P3 (totaling 442 lost units). This means the effective physical pipeline is close to zero. The on-hand inventory is also 0. I will reset the OR parameters to reflect the current low-demand summer regime (approx. 33 units/week) and use the 'explicit' lead time method to bypass the influence of the 'ghost' pipeline on the backend's calculations. By setting L to the promised 2 periods and mu_hat to (1+L)*33 = 99, I aim to trigger a small replenishment order to cover the current stockout without over-ordering for a season that is historically weak.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: July demand trough confirmed with mean demand ~33 units/week (P20-P22). Pipeline inventory (449) is entirely phantom, consisting of 442 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P13, P14).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245018 (Womens 5-pocket jeans) is in a deep summer demand trough. Demand in the last four periods (P20-P23) has been 33, 24, 41, and 63, averaging ~40 units/week. While P23 showed a slight uptick to 63, it remains significantly below spring levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 449 is entirely comprised of phantom inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P13, P14), which prevents the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this and trigger necessary replenishment for current demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 600, which is significantly higher than the actual demand forecast of ~120 (3 periods * 40 units), to force the calculation (mu_hat - pipeline) to potentially result in a positive order despite the 449 units of phantom inventory. L is set to 'default' (2 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current lower volatility compared to the spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand in the summer trough (late June to late July) is currently averaging ~40 units/week, though P23 showed a slight increase to 63 units. Phantom pipeline inventory (449 units) continues to block automated replenishment.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/07/29), we remain in the summer demand trough for women's denim. Demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) has averaged 41.2 units/week, with the most recent sample at 45. The 'In-transit' figure of 600 units is heavily distorted by phantom inventory: 449 units are confirmed lost from orders placed in P1, P3, P13, and P14 (all >10 periods old), and another 151 units were ordered in P24 but haven't arrived yet. Actual usable pipeline inventory is only 151 units. Because the OR backend uses the inflated 'In-transit' value (600) to calculate orders (order = base_stock - pipeline), it will erroneously see a surplus and stop ordering if I don't adjust parameters. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to force a high base_stock that accounts for the 449 phantom units. My target base_stock (covering 3 periods of demand) is approx 135 units. To offset 449 phantom units, I need a calculated base_stock around 585. Setting mu_hat to 500 (representing ~166 units/week over 3 periods) combined with a moderate sigma_hat will trigger a small correction order to maintain service levels while accounting for the 'lost' pipeline. I'll maintain L at 'calculate' as lead times for successful arrivals are consistently 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed stable at ~41 units/week (P20-P24). Phantom pipeline inventory persists at 449 units (orders from P1, P3, P13, P14).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), we are navigating a sustained summer trough for this SKU (skinny jeans). Demand over the last 6 periods (P20-P25) has averaged ~42 units/week. However, our pipeline inventory is currently 600 units, which is significantly inflated by 449 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P13, P14). These lost orders prevent the OR backend's inventory check (base_stock - pipeline) from triggering new orders. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. An explicit value of 600 effectively overrides the pipeline deduction, signaling to the backend that we need fresh stock despite the historical 'in-transit' count. I am setting L to 1 (recent behavior indicates 1-2 periods) and mu_hat value to 600, which covers (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset for the phantom pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the low summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: August 5: Summer demand trough remains stable with mean ~42 units/week (P20-P25). Phantom pipeline total remains at 449 units (P1, P3, P13, P14).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019/08/12), we are in the summer trough for women's denim, with demand stabilized around 45-55 units per week. The pipeline inventory is currently 600 units, which includes 449 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost orders (Period 1: 171, Period 3: 115, Period 13: 20, Period 14: 136) and the order from Period 24 (151 units). The Period 24 order is now 3 periods old and likely lost or significantly delayed, as actual lead times for successful deliveries have been 1-2 periods. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the OR backend's base-stock calculation is blocked by the 600 units in-transit (which exceeds any reasonable safety stock for the current ~47/week demand regime), I must use explicit parameters to force an order. I will target a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 3) at a rate of 55 units/week plus a buffer, totaling 200 units. To bypass the phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be set to (Base Stock + Pipeline Level). Expected Base Stock (200) + Pipeline (600) = 800.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Order from Period 24 (151 units) is now 3 periods overdue and presumed lost, joining previous lost orders from P1, P3, P13, and P14, bringing phantom pipeline to 600 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/19. The SKU is in a deep summer demand trough (late June\u2013mid August) with mean demand ~48 units/week (P19-P27). However, history shows 'Luna skinny RW' (jeans) had a massive spike in late March/April (P7-P10). Late August typically triggers 'Back to School' seasonality for denim/trousers, suggesting an imminent demand increase. Inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0. Pipeline is 800 units, but 600 of these are confirmed phantom/lost orders (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24). Only the P27 order (200 units) is valid. To bypass the OR backend's use of the inflated 800-unit pipeline and the 0 on-hand, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects the valid pipeline gap and the expected seasonal uptick. I estimate demand will rise towards ~100-120 in the coming weeks. By setting mu_hat high (350), I ensure the backend triggers a net order despite the 800-unit pipeline: (mu_hat - pipeline) = 350 - 800 is negative, but the OR engine's 'cap' logic usually allows for a minimal safety order or replenishment if mu_hat is sufficiently high to signal stock-out risk. Given the 600-unit phantom inventory, mu_hat must technically exceed 800 to force an order, but I will step up mu_hat aggressively to 850 to force a replenishment of ~50-100 units to prepare for early September demand while clearing the 'on-hand 0' status.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Phantom pipeline inventory now totals 600 units (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, and P24). Valid pipeline is only 200 units (from P27). Demand expected to rise from the ~48/week summer trough as Back-to-School season begins.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), we are entering the Back-to-School season for trousers. Demand over the last 5 weeks (P24-P28) has averaged ~47 units/week, appearing to bottom out and show early signs of seasonal recovery compared to the July low (~33/week). The 'In-transit' total of 850 units is highly misleading. Based on carry-over insights and history, 750 of these units are confirmed or presumed lost (P1: 171, P3: 115, P13: 20, P14: 136, P24: 151, P27: 157 - note: P27 order of 200 is still technically within a 2-3 period window, but P24 is definitely lost). To bypass the OR engine's 'capped policy' which sees 850 units in the pipeline and blocks orders, I must set an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate forward demand at ~65 units/week for the (L+1) horizon to account for the seasonal upturn. To force an order despite the 850 phantom units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat to 1250. This covers the 850 phantom units plus the desired base stock (~400 units, which is roughly 4-6 weeks of stock at the new demand level). Using L=2 as the stable promethean lead time.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand recovery identified: P24-P28 mean demand risen to 47 units/week from July trough of 33 units. Phantom pipeline total increased to 750 units after Period 24 order (151 units) failed to arrive by Period 28.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), we are entering the 'Back-to-School' and early autumn season. While recent weeks (P25-P29) have shown stable low demand (mean ~45), historical context for 'Womens Everyday Collection' jeans suggests a recovery from the deep summer trough. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline is severely inflated by 'phantom' inventory. Specifically, of the 1250 units in-transit, 750 units are from orders placed in P1, P3, P13, P14, and P24 which are long since overdue and confirmed lost. The only valid pipeline units are from P27 (200), P28 (50), and P29 (400), totaling 650 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1250 pipeline figure, I must set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat - 1250) is positive, or explicitly adjust for the 750 lost units. However, since the backend logic is 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)', and I cannot change how it counts the 1250 in-transit units, I use 'explicit' values. I forecast a demand recovery to ~60 units/week. With L=2, base stock needs to cover 3 weeks (~180 units). By setting mu_hat explicitly to 1430, the backend calculates (1430 - 1250) = 180 units to order, effectively bypassing the phantom inventory blockage while keeping the safety stock (sigma_hat) proportional to the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand recovery remains sluggish as of late August (mean ~45 units/week). Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 750 units (Orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, P24). Valid pipeline consists of 650 units (P27, P28, P29).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), we are transitioning from the summer trough into the fall and potential Back-to-School recovery. Demand has been extremely low (~33-54 units/week since Period 20). Period 30 saw the arrival of P27 and P28 orders, confirming that the supply chain is functional but variable (lead times of 2-3 periods). The 'In-transit' total of 1180 is heavily inflated by 750 units of confirmed 'phantom' pipeline (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24). The actual valid pipeline consists of orders from P29 (400) and P30 (180), totaling 580 units. With 217 units on hand and 580 valid units in transit, we have 797 units to cover a demand regime currently averaging ~42 units/week. Since the OR backend cannot distinguish between phantom and valid inventory, it will see 1397 total units (217 + 1180) and likely stop ordering. However, given the significant inventory on hand relative to the current low demand, no aggressive correction is needed yet. I will set L to 3 to reflect recent actual lead times and use recent demand (N=10) to capture the summer baseline, allowing the current stock to deplete naturally as we monitor for a fall demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Supply chain resumed arrivals with P27 (LT=3) and P28 (LT=2). Phantom pipeline remains at 750 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24). Late Summer/Early Sept demand remains low, averaging ~42 units/week over the last 10 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019), the supply chain has partially resumed (arrivals from P27 and P28), but severe phantom pipeline inventory persists. Total in-transit is 1180. Known lost orders (phantom) include P1 (171), P3 (115), P13 (20), P14 (136), and P24 (151), totaling 593 units. Valid in-transit orders are P29 (400) and P30 (180), totaling 580 units. The OR engine will subtract the full 1180 from the base stock. Current demand is in a post-summer recovery phase; while the mean since P20 is ~44, recent demand (P31: 61) suggests a potential upward trend for mid-September. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 593 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom pipeline + desired base stock for the next 3 periods (L+1). With demand ~45-60, and 593 units of 'ghost' inventory to offset, I set mu_hat high to bypass the cap and pipeline subtraction, targeting a safety stock for the valid recovery trend.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered in P30 with lead times of 2-3 periods. Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 593 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24), which severely suppresses automated ordering.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/9/23 (Period 33). Demand analysis shows an upward trend following the summer trough: demand in Period 32 hit 101 units, significantly higher than the previous 10-period average of ~45. This confirms the anticipated seasonal recovery (Back-to-School/Fall). The phantom pipeline remains a major hurdle. Based on history (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24), 744 units in the 'In-transit' total are confirmed lost. The valid pipeline consists of the P29 order (400 units), which is currently at L=4 (overdue by 2 periods based on promised lead time). On-hand inventory is 235. To trigger an order despite the 744 phantom units, I am using an 'explicit' L of 5 and mu_hat of 1200. This mu_hat calculation (targeting roughly 200 units/week for 6 periods) is designed to counteract the 744 unit phantom drag, effectively signaling to the OR engine that 'Available' (OH + Valid Pipeline) is significantly below the required base stock for the upcoming high-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School/Fall demand recovery confirmed: P32 demand increased to 101 (+120% vs summer avg). Total phantom pipeline inventory refined to 744 units (Orders from P1: 171, P3: 115, P13: 20, P14: 136, P24: 151, P29: 151 - assuming P29 is now lost/delayed).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (September 30), we are entering the peak autumn season for denim trousers. Recent demand history shows a dramatic spike from ~40-60 units/week during the summer trough to 101 units (P32) and 254 units (P33), signaling a robust seasonal recovery. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 1000 units is highly misleading because it includes approximately 744 units from lost or indefinitely delayed orders (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, and now potentially P29). Valid pipeline inventory is only 256 units (likely from P30 and later replenishment efforts). To bypass the OR backend's inventory-capping logic, which sees a large phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 2100. This high target (representing ~3 periods of a ~700-unit demand window) forces the system to place a substantial order to meet the current 250+ unit/week demand regime, accounting for the 0 on-hand balance and the need to 'drown out' the 744 phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Autumn demand surge confirmed; mean demand shifted from summer trough (~40) to ~177 over the last two weeks (101, 254), reflecting early fall seasonality. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains at 744 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/7, entering the peak Autumn/back-to-school season. Demand has surged from the summer trough (~40/week) to a mean of ~177 units/week over the last three weeks (101, 254, 175). Based on seasonal patterns for 'Womens Everyday Jeans', this high demand regime is expected to be sustained. Pipeline inventory is currently 1890 units, which includes 890 units ordered in P34 and 1000 units from older periods. Historical analysis reveals 744 'phantom' units (P1: 171, P3: 115, P13: 20, P14: 136, P24: 151, P29: 151) that are confirmed lost or significantly overdue, falsely inflating the inventory view. Actual valid pipeline is closer to 1146 units (890 from P34 plus 256 unaccounted). I will set mu_hat to 'explicit' at 531 ((1+L=3) * 177) to stabilize ordering against the autumn surge, and set L and sigma_hat using recent data to reflect the current supply chain stability (LT 2-3) and high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Peak demand regime confirmed: P32-P34 demand reflects a significant shift to ~177 units/week (up from ~40). Total phantom pipeline inventory refined to 744 units (lost orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, P29).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/14. We are in an Autumn demand regime which shifted significantly around Period 32 (early September). Recent demand samples (P32-P35) are 101, 254, 175, 159, yielding a mean of 172.25. The supply chain has stabilized with lead times of 2-3 periods (P27: 3, P28: 2, P30: 2), so L=2 is appropriate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1890 is heavily inflated by phantom units. Confirmed lost orders include P1 (171), P3 (115), P13 (20), P14 (136), P24 (151), and P29 (400 - now 6 periods since order with no arrival), totaling 993 phantom units. Real pipeline is likely P34 (890), which should arrive in P36 or P37. To bypass the OR engine's 'inventory-rich' logic caused by these phantom in-transit units and satisfy the current high demand, I am using 'explicit' parameters. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*172.5 = 517.5. sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(1+L)*std(101, 254, 175, 159) \u2248 1.732 * 63.3 \u2248 110. To ensure the capped policy allows a replenishment order despite the phantom 993 units, I am effectively ignoring the phantom stock by setting mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or relying on the real pipeline to clear soon.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to 993 units (confirmed/presumed lost: P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, and now P29). Actual Autumn demand regime (P32-P35) stable at mean ~172 units/week (+300% vs summer).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (Oct 21), we are in the middle of the Autumn demand regime. The last four demand samples (P33-P36) were 254, 175, 159, and 124, showing a mean of 178 units/week. However, the last arrival was in Period 32. The 'in-transit' total of 1890 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom pipeline' (confirmed or highly probable lost orders). We must adjust the backend to ignore these phantom units. Confirmed/Presumed lost: P1 (171), P3 (115), P13 (20), P14 (136), P24 (151), P29 (400) = 993 units. The active pipeline is likely only the P34 order of 890 units. To force the OR backend to place a restorative order while we wait for P34 to arrive (now at its promised lead time of 2 periods but not yet concluded), I will set mu_hat explicitly high. This ensures the base stock (target inventory) accounts for the current 4 periods of zero on-hand stock and high autumn demand, effectively neutralizing the drag of the 993 phantom units on the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 37, phantom pipeline units total 993 (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, P29). Demand for the Autumn regime (P33-P36) is averaging 178 units/week. Lead times fluctuate between 2 and 3 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the product is in its Autumn demand regime. While there was a significant surge in September (reaching 254 units), current demand has stabilized and is showing signs of a typical late-October cooling, with the last two samples at 124 and 100 units. The mean demand for the Autumn regime (P33-P37) is approximately 142 units per week. The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2-3 periods for successful deliveries. However, there is a massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory of approximately 993 units (from Periods 1, 3, 13, 14, 24, and 29) that never arrived. This phantom inventory plus the large valid order of 890 units from P34 currently totals 1890 units in-transit. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit from the base stock, these 993 phantom units are preventing the system from placing necessary new orders. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a baseline reflecting the current 142 units mean (over L+1 = 3 periods, this is 426). By using 'explicit', I target the OR backend to realize it needs more stock despite the phantom numbers, though the internal 'cap' logic may still limit ordering until we see the P34 arrival.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P33-P37) mean is ~142 units/week, down from September's peak of ~177. Total phantom pipeline remains at 993 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, P29). Valid pipeline is currently 897 units (P34 order of 890).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November), we are in an Autumn/Pre-Winter demand regime for these skinny jeans. Recent demand (P34-P38) has been 175, 159, 124, 100, and 187, averaging approximately 149 units per week. Although there were higher spikes in September (up to 254), the current mean has settled near 150. Pipeline inventory is currently 1890, but significantly inflated by 993 phantom units (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, and P29). Subtracting these, the 'valid' pipeline is 897 units (from the order placed in P34). The P34 order is now 5 periods old (ordered P34, currently decision phase P39). Based on historical data, shipments arriving in 2-3 periods are standard; 5 periods without arrival suggests a high risk that the P34 order (890 units) is also lost or significantly delayed. To ensure stock for the upcoming weeks and counteract the OR engine's 'cap' which is tied to pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand level (~150/week) across the lead time (L+1=3). I am also using 'explicit' for L to maintain standard lead time expectations despite the current delivery irregularities.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Order from Period 34 (890 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived; it is likely lost or severely delayed. This brings the potential total phantom pipeline to 1883 units (993 + 890). Current demand regime (P34-P38) is stable at ~150 units/week.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the autumn demand regime is stable. Since the seasonal peak in late September (P33-P34), demand has fluctuated but remains at a mean of approximately 136 units/week over the last 5 periods (P35-P39: 159, 124, 100, 187, 109). The primary challenge is the corrupted pipeline inventory. The 'In-transit' count of 1890 units is almost entirely 'phantom' inventory from lost orders. This includes 993 units confirmed lost through P36 (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, P29) plus the order from Period 34 (890 units) which is now 6 periods overdue and clearly lost. The actual valid pipeline is 0. With on-hand inventory also at 0 due to these stockouts, a significant replenishment order is required. I will use 'explicit' parameters to bypass the OR engine's reliance on the 'In-transit' figure. Setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat to 450 (3 weeks of demand at ~150/week) and sigma_hat to 100 to account for recent high weekly volatility (range 100-187). This should trigger an order of approximately 450 units, adjusted by the OR backend's safety stock logic, to resume service.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Order from P34 (890 units) confirmed lost (6 periods overdue). Total phantom pipeline inventory is now 1883 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, P29, P34). Current autumn demand mean is ~136 units/week (P35-P39).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18), the system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1890 units, but this is almost entirely comprised of 'phantom' inventory from lost orders. This includes: P1 (171), P3 (115), P13 (20), P14 (136), P24 (151), P29 (400), and P34 (890), totaling 1883 units. These orders (especially P34, now 6 weeks overdue) are unlikely to arrive. Current on-hand is 0. To trigger replenishment, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that accounts for the current demand regime (~136 units/week) and use an 'explicit' L to bypass the backend's pipeline calculation, which would otherwise subtract these 1890 phantom units from the order. I set mu_hat to (1+L)*136 and L to 2 (promised). Note that the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'; since 'pipeline_inventory' is viewed as 1890, any base_stock calculation less than ~2000 would result in zero ordering. To force an order approximately matching demand/safety stock, I'll use a very high explicit mu_hat to overcome the phantom pipeline bias and restore stock levels for the late autumn/pre-holiday season.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom pipeline inventory totals 1883 units (lost orders: P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, P29, P34). Valid pipeline is effectively 0 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), we are in the late Autumn season heading toward the holiday period. Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 130 units/week (last 5 periods: 187, 109, 132, 122). The phantom pipeline remains a critical issue; total in-transit units are 2300, but analysis of history confirms a massive 'phantom pipeline' of 1883 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, P29, P34). The actual valid pipeline is only 410 units from the order placed in P41. To trigger the OR backend to order sufficiently despite the phantom inventory, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 to match the promised lead time and 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the backend calculates final_order = base_stock - pipeline, and pipeline is currently recorded as 2300, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 1883 phantom units plus the 410 valid units.Target base stock calculation: (Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom + Valid Pipeline = (130 * 3) + 1883 + 410 \u2248 2683. I will set mu_hat to 2700 to ensure the backend generates a replenishment order to cover actual demand needs.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 42 (Ending Nov 25) spiked tremendously to 1007 units, clearly reflecting Black Friday / Cyber Monday seasonality for this garment (jeans). This is a massive outlier compared to the previous autumn mean of ~136. Following this spike, we are now entering early December (Period 43). Historically, peak seasonal demand often stays elevated through December but may retreat from the extreme Black Friday level. I will use an explicit forecast of 500 units/week to balance the risk of sustained holiday shopping against the likely correction from the 1000+ spike. For the pipeline, total in-transit is 2700, but Carry-over insights confirm that 1883 of these are long-lost 'phantom' units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, P29, P34). Valid pipeline inventory includes only orders from P41 (410 units) and P42 (400 units), totaling 810 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (2700) from the base stock, it will not order anything unless I set mu_hat very high. To force an order that covers the holiday season and replenishes the current zero-inventory state, I set mu_hat explicitly to 3500 (approximating 3 weeks of protection at ~500/week plus the 1883 phantom offset). Lead time is set to 2 as the primary mode for successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike confirmed at Period 42 (1007 units) due to Black Friday. Phantom pipeline inventory remains at 1883 units. Valid pipeline is 810 units (P41, P42).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (Dec 9), we are in the post-Black Friday/pre-Christmas retail window. Recent demand has been extremely high (P42: 1007, P43: 771) due to seasonal spikes. On-hand inventory is 0. The total In-Transit is 3090, but significantly inflated by 'phantom' pipeline units (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, P29, P34) totaling 1883 units. Valid pipeline inventory consists of P42 (400 units) and P43 (800 units), totaling 1200 units. Lead time for the most recent arrival (P41) was 2 periods, suggesting the supply chain is currently functioning at the promised lead time. I set L=2. For mu_hat, the recent demand regime (weeks 42-43) average is 889; however, this is likely the absolute peak. I anticipate demand will remain elevated thru Dec but likely moderate from the Black Friday extreme. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat of 1800 (equivalent to ~600/week for the 3-week cover period) to ensure aggressive replenishment without overstocking against the phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for the extreme volatility observed in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday demand confirmed very high (P43: 771 units). Valid pipeline inventory stands at 1200 units (P42, P43). Current phantom pipeline units confirmed at 1883 (lost orders: P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, P29, P34).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16 (Period 45), following the major Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand spike (P42: 1007, P43: 771). Demand for P44 settled sharply to 88 units as the peak subsided. The phantom pipeline is estimated at 1883 units (lost orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, P29, P34). The current valid pipeline includes P42 (400 units, 3 periods old - overdue if LT=2) and P43 (800 units, 2 periods old). On-hand is 0. With total in-transit at 3090, the backend sees 3090 (pipeline) + 0 (on-hand) = 3090, which is far above any reasonable base stock, preventing orders. To force an order to meet late December/Holiday demand, I must use 'explicit' parameters. I estimate post-peak December demand at ~150 units/week. Lead time is inconsistently 2-3 periods. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1)=4 weeks of demand (600 units) and sigma_hat to 200 to account for holiday volatility. L=3 is used to reflect recent arrival delays (P27 took 3 periods, P42 is currently at 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Valid pipeline consists of P42 (400 units, 3 periods old) and P43 (800 units, 2 periods old). P42 is now 1 period overdue suggesting a lead time shift to 3+ periods or potential loss. Demand has reverted from the ~800+ peak to ~90-150 range post-Black Friday.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1046.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (Dec 23), we are in the post-holiday period. Historical evidence shows a dramatic demand drop after the Black Friday/early December peak (P42: 1007, P43: 771 units), with P44 and P45 recording only 88 and 77 units respectively. The current on-hand inventory is high at 1123 units. Lead times for recent successful orders (P41, P42, P43) have been 2-3 periods. The 'In-transit' count of 1890 is heavily inflated by 1883 phantom units from lost orders (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, P29, P34), meaning the actual pipeline is effectively zero. Using the recent 3 samples (P43-P45) for \u03bc\u0302 captures the post-peak mean of ~312 units (significantly influenced by P43's 771), which provides a safe but non-aggressive buffer. Given the large on-hand inventory (1123), no new orders will be triggered by the OR backend, which is appropriate as we enter the low-demand late December/January season.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand regression confirmed: demand dropped from ~800+ to <100 units/week in mid-December. Phantom pipeline remains a total of 1883 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1019.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the system is in a post-holiday demand trough with mean weekly demand having dropped significantly from the Black Friday surge (~800+) to a mean of ~72 units over the last three periods (77, 52, and the current projected demand). On-hand inventory is high at 1071 units, which is more than sufficient to cover demand for the foreseeable future, especially as we enter the traditionally slow January period for apparel. The 'In-transit' figure of 1890 units is dominated by the 'phantom pipeline' (1883 units) consisting of lost orders from earlier in the year (P1, P3, P13, P14, P24, P29, P34). Because actual demand has regressed to ~70 units/week and on-hand inventory is 1071, no new orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods to reflect this lower post-peak demand regime, ensuring the OR backend sees the high stock level relative to the new demand mean, thereby preventing unnecessary replenishment and minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Post-holiday demand regression confirmed; mean demand dropped to ~72 units/week (P44-P46) from the autumn/Black Friday peak. Phantom pipeline remains at 1883 units.
