Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-02-11. We are looking at a women's straight-cut blouse (upper body garment). Historical demand was zero for the first two weeks in January, then jumped to 13 and peaked around 27 in late January/early February. This likely reflects the start of the spring fashion season and preparations for warmer weather. With only 5 data points, the 'recent_N' method where N=3 captures this recent upward surge (13, 27, 26). The promised lead time is 2, and since we have no historical arrivals yet, I will use 'default' for L. mu_hat will use recent_N=3 to account for the current demand regime of ~22 units per period (multiplied by 1+L=3 in the backend). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to capture the volatility of this new regime.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the product description (Women's Blouse) and historical demand, there is a clear upward trend: demand went from 0 to 13, 27, 26, and jumped to 60 in Period 1. This suggests post-winter seasonality/new collection launch. Promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the order of 35 units placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible in P4). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 35 in transit. We lost 60 sales in Period 1 due to being out of stock. For mu_hat, the mean of all 5 samples (0, 0, 13, 27, 26) + the recent jump to 60 suggests we are in a higher demand regime. Given the jump, I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the 27, 26, and 60 samples to better capture the trend (average ~37.6). Since we cover (1+L) periods, the backend will calculate (1+2)*37.6. For sigma_hat, N=3 will reflect the increased volatility from the recent surge. L is kept at default (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 3 (2019-02-25), the product is a 'Straight-cut blouse' which is a seasonal item prone to spring demand spikes. Historical data from Jan/early Feb showed very low demand (0-27), but Period 1 and 2 saw a dramatic surge to 60 and 146 respectively. This represents a clear regime shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 105 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (35 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 resolution and should be visible in Period 4. I will adjust mu_hat using the last 2 samples (mean = 103) to reflect this new high-demand regime following the winter lull. I will set L to 'default' as there is no evidence yet to suggest the promised 2-period lead time is being missed, though the stockouts in P1 and P2 were due to zero starting inventory.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Feb 11 (Period 1): demand jumped from <30/week to 60-146/week (+300%+), likely due to seasonal spring transition for blouses.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The product is a women's blouse, which is entering its spring seasonal peak. Historical demand samples (up to Feb 4) showed very low activity (0, 0, 13, 27, 26), but a major regime shift occurred starting Period 1 (Feb 11) with demand recording 60, 146, and 102 units. The average demand across these last 3 periods is 102.67. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The order from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) is expected to arrive during the current Period 4. In-transit inventory is 309, which aligns with previous orders (35+70+204=309). Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, we have lost sales in Periods 1-3. For Period 4, L is set to default (2). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (102.67 * (1+2) = 308). Sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent high volatility (std dev \u2248 43 * sqrt(3) \u2248 74.5).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). The SKU is a 'Straight-cut blouse' which is seeing a significant seasonal demand surge as we enter spring. Historical demand since the regime shift (Period 1) has been 60, 146, 102, and 104, averaging 103 units per week. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 4, the order from Period 2 (70 units) arrived exactly as scheduled (lead_time=2). However, the order from Period 1 (35 units) is now 2 periods overdue (should have arrived in Period 3) and is likely lost. Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 239 (Period 3 order of 204 units + Period 1 order of 35). Because we've stocked out every single period, the observed demand (avg 103) is the true signal. I will set L to 'default' (2) as the Period 4 arrival confirmed the 2-period window. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the post-shift mean of 103. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the high volatility (std dev ~35) seen in this new regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level to capture this high-profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1 implies a 50% critical fractile, but the order cap will allow more if variance is high).

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Lead time confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4). Period 1 order (35 units) is likely lost as it is 2 periods past expected delivery.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18 (Period 6). The SKU is a 'Straight-cut blouse', which explains the sharp demand increase since February (spring season lead-in). Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged 101.4 units/week (60, 146, 102, 104, 95), a massive jump from the initial zero/low-demand phase. I have confirmed a Lead Time of 2 periods (P2 order arrived in P4), but the Period 1 order (35 units) is now 3 periods overdue and clearly lost. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 309 units in-transit (P3: 204, P5: 70, plus the new order from this period). The P3 order of 204 units should arrive during Period 5's resolution (visible in P6's starting inventory). Since I need to satisfy demand for the next (L+1) = 3 periods, and the regime has stabilized around 100 units/week, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current spring demand level while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation ~32). Setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 2 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product (women's short-sleeve blouse) is entering the spring season. Historical demand since mid-February has stabilized at a high level, averaging 97.6 units per week (min 60, max 146). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to high demand outpacing intermittent arrivals. The Period 1 order (35 units) is confirmed lost. Recently, lead times have been volatile: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods, but Period 5 order arrived in only 1 period. In-transit inventory is 239 units (Period 3 order of 204 + Period 5 order of 70 - 35 units already arrived from Period 5). Note: The game history shows Period 5 order arrived in Period 6 (LT=1), while the Period 3 order (204 units) is still in-transit and should arrive shortly. Given Profit = Holding Cost ($1), the OR target service level is 50%, aiming for a base stock that covers the mean demand over (L+1) periods. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the high-demand regime and default lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P2 arrived in 2 periods, P5 arrived in 1 period. Sustained high-demand regime (avg ~98) confirmed since Feb 11.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 1st (Period 8). The product is a women's blouse, which has been in a high-demand regime since mid-February (Period 1). Average demand over the last 7 periods is 98.7 units, showing relative stability around the ~100 range. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant backlog of demand (sold < demand in P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7 due to stockouts). In-transit inventory is 293 units, comprising orders from Period 3 (204 units), Period 7 (54 units), and a likely-lost order from Period 1 (35 units). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P2 arrived in 2, P5 arrived in 1). According to the lead time definition, the 204 units ordered in Period 3 are severely overdue (expected arriving P5 or P6); however, they are still counted in 'In-transit'. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=7 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (avg ~99). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to capture the demand volatility (std ~26) which, combined with unit-to-unit profit/holding cost parity (q=0.5), will lead the OR backend to target the median demand across the lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product (short-sleeved blouse) is in its peak spring season. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 243 units in-transit. Looking at the history: The Period 1 order (35 units) is definitely lost. The Period 3 order (204 units) is now 6 periods old (promised 2) and is highly likely lost or severely delayed; since later orders (P5, P7) have already arrived, I will treat the P3 order as a permanent loss to avoid the OR backend under-ordering. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized at an average of 99.4 units per period (95, 79, 105, 114, and Period 3/4 context). Actual lead times have been shorter than promised (1-2 periods), with the last two arrivals taking only 1 period. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand period while accounting for lost pipeline inventory, I'll use L=2 (promised) but base mu_hat on the recent high-demand regime (N=5).

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 3 order (204 units) confirmed as lost/indefinitely delayed (6 periods elapsed, later orders arrived). Standard lead time currently fluctuates between 1-2 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. We are in a high-demand regime for this 'short cap sleeve blouse' (mean demand ~98 units/week) that began in February. Lead times have been volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P7 arrived in 1, P5 in 1, P2 in 2), while orders from P1 and P3 are clearly lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (299 units) consists of orders from P8 (4 units), P9 (56 units), and historical lost units (35 + 204 = 239). Because the OR backend assumes all in-transit units will arrive, it will severely under-order if we don't account for the 239 lost units. To counteract this, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to include current demand for (L+1) periods plus the volume of lost orders that the OR engine thinks is still coming. Demand forecast: (1+L=3) * 98 = 294. Adjusted mu_hat = 294 (forecast) + 239 (lost) = 533. This forces the system to order to cover actual demand despite the ghost inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for this blouse has stabilized in a high-demand regime since mid-February, averaging approximately 97 units per period (N=10) with considerable volatility. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0, sold < demand) because pipeline reconciliation is difficult due to lost orders (P1, P3). In-transit inventory of 458 units is inflated by these lost orders (35 + 204 = 239 units); the OR engine sees this 458 in-transit and likely undershoots orders. To compensate, I will use recent_N for demand (N=10) and lead time (N=4) to capture the current state. I am keeping L as 'calculate' as the actual performance (1-2 periods) aligns with the promised 2 periods on average, but the OR backend needs to recognize that the 239 'phantom' units are not arriving.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation confirmed: Orders from P1 (35) and P3 (204) are lost/indefinitely delayed, totaling 239 units that should be ignored when considering 'in-transit' availability. Current demand regime (approx 97/period) holding steady through April.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU remains in an stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a sustained high-demand regime averaging approx 97 units per period since Feb 11. Analysis of history confirms that orders from Period 1 (35 units) and Period 3 (204 units) are definitively lost/indefinitely delayed, totaling 239 phantom units in the 'in-transit' count (Total in-transit 458 - 239 lost = 219 actual in-transit from Period 10). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (average approx 1.5). To compensate for the 239 lost units that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. My calculation: (1+L) * Mean Demand + Lost units. With L=2 (promised), (1+2)*97 + 239 = 530. This 'over-ordering' via mu_hat ensures the base-stock target covers the current pipeline deficit caused by the lost shipments, returning the system to a healthy inventory position for the late-spring blouse season.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are managing a 'Straight-cut blouse' SKU. Historically, this product saw a demand regime shift in February (Period 1), jumping from near-zero to an average of ~94 units/period (range 60-146). The current lead time (L) fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods. Critically, we have confirmed 'lost' shipments from Period 1 (35 units) and Period 3 (204 units), totaling 239 units in the reported 'in-transit' figure (530) that will likely never arrive. Effective pipeline = 530 - 239 = 291 units. On-hand is currently 0. Demand in the most recent periods (P11-P12) shows a slight cooling (96, 60), but the spring/early summer season for short-sleeved blouses suggests demand will remain significant. I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the high-demand regime while reflecting the recent cooling, and use explicit lead time L=2 to be conservative given the stockout history. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers approximately 3 periods of demand (~280 units).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation persists: 239 units (from P1 and P3) are lost and must be subtracted from 'In-transit' when evaluating stock levels. Current demand regime (Feb-May) average is ~94.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), we are dealing with a women's short-sleeve blouse. Demand has historically been in a high regime (avg ~94) since Feb 11, but the last two periods (60 and 40) suggest a possible deceleration as we move past the early spring peak. Pipeline inventory is currently 530 units, but 239 units (from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost/delayed for over 10 periods. The 'effective' in-transit is therefore 291 units (530 - 239). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent deliveries (P8, P9) show lead times of 1-2 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. Given the recent demand drop (60, 40), using a recent 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat will capture this cooling trend (avg ~57) while still accounting for recent history, preventing massive over-ordering against a inflated pipeline. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed in May: Period 12-13 average dropped to 50, compared to the Feb-Apr average of ~97. Monitoring for a sustained seasonal shift.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20, 2019. We are observing a significant demand deceleration from the high-spring regime (avg ~97) to an early summer lower-demand regime (avg ~44 over the last 3 weeks). The 'In-transit' quantity of 458 includes 239 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Effective pipeline is 219 (from P10) + 0 = 219. Adding on-hand (40), our total effective inventory is 259 units. Given the new demand regime of ~44, we are currently overstocked (effectively covering ~6 periods). I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the decelerating demand and 'default' for sigma_hat. The OR backend will likely not place an order due to the high pipeline, which is optimal until the P10 order arrives and we realize current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: May levels (P12-P14) average 44 units, a ~55% drop from the Feb-Apr spring peak (avg 97). Effective pipeline inventory (Total In-transit minus 239 lost units) is currently 219 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which experienced a spring demand peak (avg ~97) from Feb-Apr and has now transitioned into a lower early-summer regime. Demand for the last 4 periods (P12-P15) has been 60, 40, 32, and 19 units respectively, confirming a significant downward trend as the peak season ends. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this deceleration in mu_hat. Regarding inventory, the In-transit total of 458 units includes 239 units from P1 and P3 that are confirmed lost. The 'effective' pipeline is therefore 219 units (from P10). These 219 units are expected to arrive shortly (ordered P10, now P16, L=2-3). On-hand is 21. Total effective inventory (21 + 219 = 240) significantly exceeds the projected demand for the (L+1) horizon (approx 3 * 38 = 114). The backend OR logic will correctly see the 239 lost units as 'in-transit', which would normally suppress ordering. Since we are overstocked relative to the new lower demand regime even without the lost units, no corrective action (explicit L or mu) is needed yet to force an order; we must let the on-hand and arriving units clear first.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3rd. We are in a confirmed low-demand regime for 'blouses' following the spring peak. Demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has averaged 33.8 units/period, significantly lower than the ~97 average of the spring. The most recent three periods (P14-P16) show demand of 32, 19, and 18, indicating further deceleration or stabilization at a lower level. On-hand inventory is 3. Total in-transit is 458 units, but 239 units (from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 219 units (primarily the P10 order of 219). Given we have an effective pipeline of 219 units and current demand is low, we are significantly overstocked relative to current sales. My objective is to prevent further ordering by the OR backend. I am setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat (N=5) to reflect the mean demand of the current regime (~33.8 * 3 = 101.4 total for L+1), and sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the volatility of this lower regime. The backend will calculate base_stock (roughly 101.4 + safety stock), see the pipeline of 219, and correctly emit an order of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed through May into June: Demand averaged 33.8 over P12-P16, down from 90+ in Spring. Effective pipeline remains inflated by 239 lost units (P1, P3).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 10 (Period 18), the product (short cap sleeve blouse) has transitioned out of its Spring peak. Demand has significantly decelerated over the last 6 periods: P12 (60), P13 (40), P14 (32), P15 (19), P16 (18), P17 (15). Using the last 6 periods for mu_hat (N=6) captures this downward trend, resulting in an average demand of 30.7 units/period. The pipeline remains inflated by 239 units from P1 and P3, which are confirmed lost. The current visible 'In-transit' is 458, but the 'effective' in-transit is 219 (458 - 239). With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 219, and a forecast for the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) of roughly 92 units (30.7 * 3), the OR backend (base stock policy) will compare 219 against the calculated base stock. Given that 219 already likely exceeds the required stock for this new low-demand regime, the system should naturally stop ordering to avoid excessive holding costs as summer progresses.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline in June: P16-P17 dropped to average 16.5, confirming the end of the Spring peak. Effective pipeline (Total In-transit minus 239 lost units) is 219 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), demand for this short-sleeved blouse has hit a summer trough. The demand over the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 18, 15, and 11, respectively, confirming a low-demand regime (mean ~14.7) compared to the spring peak (>90). The 'In-transit' quantity of 458 includes 239 units from P1 and P3 that are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 219 units (458 - 239), which are the units ordered in P10. Given a lead time of 1-2 periods, these P10 units are extremely overdue (8 periods late) and may also be lost, but following conservative logic, they still sit in the pipeline. With effective inventory (219) significantly exceeding the current demand forecast (L+1 * 14.7 \u2248 44), a replenishment order is not needed. I will set the parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime and standard volatility to allow the system to utilize existing pipeline stock.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed for June: P16-P18 demand averaged 14.7 units (-85% from spring peak). Overdue P10 order (219 units) is now 8 periods late and should be treated as potentially lost in future periods if no arrival occurs by P21.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for this blouse SKU has entered a significant summer trough, with the last 4 periods (P16-P19) averaging 17.5 units, compared to the spring peak of ~95. The current 'In-transit' of 458 units is heavily inflated by lost or severely delayed orders: P1 (35), P3 (204), and P10 (219). These three orders alone total 458 units, meaning there is effectively ZERO reliable stock in the pipeline. However, despite the zero on-hand inventory and empty real pipeline, the backend OR logic sees 458 units in-transit. Since 458 units is far above any reasonable base stock for a 17.5 units/period demand regime (Base Stock would be around 17.5 * 3 = 52.5), the OR engine will not place new orders unless I counteract the pipeline inflation or significantly increase parameters. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the target service level is 50%, which is very low. My goal is to maintain minimal stock to avoid high holding costs during this low-demand summer phase while acknowledging that the current pipeline is 'ghost inventory'. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current trough and set lead time to explicit=2 to reflect the promised lead time despite recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory of 458 units (P1: 35, P3: 204, P10: 219) is confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed as of P20; actual reliable pipeline is 0. Summer demand trough (June) localized around 17.5 units/period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are observing a significant demand spike in the most recent historical period (P20 demand = 156), which likely indicates the start of a summer retail peak or mid-season promotion, following the June trough. The Carry-Over Insights confirm that the current In-transit balance of 458 units (comprising orders from P1, P3, and P10) is entirely lost or indefinitely delayed, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0. With On-hand also at 0, a new order is urgently needed to meet this rising demand. To allow the OR backend to place an appropriate order, I am setting mu_hat to 'explicit' at 260 units (reflecting the recent jump to 156 plus anticipation of sustained high demand over the L+1 window) and L to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure we cover the lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 80 to account for high volatility during regime transitions. By declaring the 458 units as lost via the OR parameters (effectively ignoring them in the logic), the backend will calculate a base stock that triggers a fresh order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 20: Demand spiked to 156 units (up from average ~17), signaling the start of a summer peak. Reliable pipeline inventory remains 0; previous in-transit units (458 total) from P1, P3, and P10 are confirmed lost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8), demand has surged significantly (P20: 156, P21: 238), confirming a summer peak for this short-sleeve blouse. The average demand over these two periods is 197. The pipeline of 458 units (from P1, P3, and P10) is confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed, meaning the reliable in-transit inventory is 0 and on-hand is 0. With a profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, roughly aiming for the mean demand. Given the sharp upward trend and seasonality, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the (L+1) period of the current high-demand regime, forecasting 200 units per period. Since lead times have historically fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, I will use lead time 'calculate' to reflect historical performance and provide a buffer for the OR engine, while sigma_hat is set to 50 (explicit) to account for high volatility observed during regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed July: P20nd P21 average 197 units (+1000% from June trough). Previous pipeline (458 units) remains lost; reliable inventory position is effectively zero.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a July summer demand peak for the 'Straight-cut blouse' (SKU 660726001). Demand over the last three periods (P20-P22) has been 156, 238, and 129, averaging 174.3 units per period. This follows a significant trough in June (avg ~17). The current inventory position is critical: On-hand is 0, and the 'In-transit' of 600 units contains 458 units (from periods 1, 3, and 10) that are over 10 periods late and confirmed lost. The only reliable in-transit order is the 142 units placed in Period 22. In Period 23, we expect demand to remain high. To account for the summer peak and the massive pipeline inflation caused by lost orders, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods (L+1) of the current peak demand (avg 174.3 * 3 = 523). Given L=2, the total pipeline requirement is approximately 523. Since the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' (600) from the 'base_stock', and 458 of those are ghosts, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that is high enough to force an order despite the 458 lost units. By setting mu_hat to 742, and noting the 600 in-transit, the system should aim for a base stock around that level, triggering an order of roughly 142 units to replenish the stock for the current demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility of the recent peak.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed summer peak July: P20-P22 demand averaged 174.3. Pipeline remains inflated by 458 lost units (P1, P3, P10); actual reliable pipeline is only the P22 order (142 units).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer peak for blouses, with demand averaging 158.5 units over the last four periods (P20-P23: 156, 238, 129, 111). The current date is July 22, 2019. Inventory management is complicated by significant pipeline inflation: orders from P1 (35), P3 (204), and P10 (219) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed, totaling 458 phantom units. The total 'In-transit' visible to the OR backend is 600, but only 142 units (ordered P23) are reliable. The remaining 458 units in the pipeline must be neutralized. To address the current demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the summer peak. Lead time (L) is set to 1 period, consistent with the most recent arrival (P22 order arrived P23). Because the OR backend subtracts the phantom 458 units from its base_stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force a higher base stock that compensates for these lost units while ensuring we provide sufficient stock for the high summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed reliable pipeline is only orders from Period 23 onwards. Pipeline inflation of 458 units (P1, P3, P10) continues to distort standard OR logic.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (July 29), we are in a high-demand summer peak for this blouse SKU. The demand in the last five periods (P20-P24) has been 156, 238, 129, 111, and 198, averaging 166.4 units/period. The pipeline is currently reporting 744 units in-transit, but 458 of these (from P1, P3, and P10) are confirmed lost/overdue. The reliable pipeline consists only of orders from Period 23 (142 units) and Period 24 (144 units), totaling 286 units. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P22 arrived in 1 period, P23 has not yet arrived). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this peak despite the 458-unit pipeline inflation, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 500. This is calculated as (1 + Lead Time of 2) * current average demand (approx 167), plus a small buffer to account for the lost units being subtracted from the inventory position in the backend logic. Sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for high volatility (ranging from 111 to 238) during this period.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand sustained: P20-P24 average is 166.4 units. Reliability of 'In-transit' remains compromised by 458 lost units (P1, P3, P10).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. We are in a summer demand peak for this blouse SKU. Demand over the last 6 periods (P20-P25) has averaged 158.33 units (156, 238, 129, 111, 198, 118), which is significantly higher than the June trough (~17 units) but slightly lower than the July peak. The 'In-transit' total of 744 units is heavily distorted by 458 units from P1, P3, and P10 that are confirmed as lost. The actual reliable pipeline consists only of the orders from P23 (142 units) and P24 (144 units), totaling 286 units. Since the P23 order did not arrive in P24 or P25, actual lead time is at least 2 periods. To ensure the OR backend places an order that covers the summer peak while accounting for the lost units, I will set L to 3 (effectively compensating for the 458 lost units by extending the lookahead and pipeline requirements) and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat (N=6 corresponding to the start of the summer peak in late June).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 12, 2019. We are in a summer demand peak for this SKU (Straight-cut blouse). Demand from Period 20 to 26 has averaged 155.5 units per week, significantly higher than the June trough. The 'In-transit' count is 602, but historical evidence confirms that 458 units (from P1, P3, and P10) are lost/indefinitely delayed. Therefore, the reliable pipeline is 144 units (ordered P24), which should arrive soon given recent lead times vary between 1-3 periods (P23 arrived in 3 periods, P22 in 1). With 4 on-hand and 144 reliable units in-transit, we have 148 units to cover a 3-period window (L+1). Given current demand averaging ~155/period, we are under-stocked. I will set mu_hat to capture the recent summer peak (last 7 periods) and adjust sigma_hat to account for high volatility (std of last 7 periods is ~43, sqrt(3)*43 \u2248 75).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak (July-August) confirmed: Avg demand P20-P26 is 155.5 units. Lead time remains variable (1-3 periods). Pipeline loss total remains 458 units (P1: 35, P3: 204, P10: 219).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 19, 2019. We are in the middle of a sustained summer demand peak (July-August) for this blouse SKU. Demand in the current regime (P20-P27) averages 155.5 units per period. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0. The 'In-transit' figure is 602. However, based on our carry-over insights, 458 of those units (from P1, P3, and P10) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Furthermore, the order from P24 (144 units) is now at lead time = 3 (due originally in P26 or P27), similar to the P23 order which arrived after 3 periods. This indicates a current reliable lead time of 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this high demand despite the 'phantom' inventory, I am setting L to 3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (starting at P20) and sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 24 (144 units) is delayed beyond promised lead time, reinforcing the observed lead time shift to 3 periods seen in Period 26. Reliable pipeline is now 144 units (P24), as the 458 units (P1, P3, P10) remain lost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29 (late August), we are managing an SKU with a persistent 'lost' pipeline issue. The total In-transit is 602 units, but history confirms that 458 of these (from Periods 1, 3, and 10) are lost. The remaining 144 units are from Period 24 (now 5 periods late, whereas recent arrivals ranged from 1-3 periods); while potentially delayed or lost, this order is the only 'reliable' portion of the pipeline. Demand from the summer peak (July-August) is still substantial, with a 7-period average (P22-P28) of 127 units. However, recent demand shows a slight downtrend (99, 96). I will use a 7-period average (recent_N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current summer regime while accounting for the recent deceleration. Sigma_hat is set to default to cover the high summer volatility. Given recent arrivals (1, 3 periods), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the current lead time delays and help the OR engine place orders despite the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (since OR backend uses total in-transit).

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Final confirmation of pipeline distortion. Out of 602 in-transit units, 458 are definitely lost (P1, P3, P10). The order from Period 24 (144 units) is now 5 periods late and may also be lost. True reliable pipeline is effectively 0.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019-09-02), the SKU is currently in a high-demand regime that began in late June/July, though demand has tapered slightly in August (avg ~90 units/period over the last 3 weeks: P27-P29). The most critical issue is pipeline distortion: out of 602 units 'In-transit', 458 units (from P1, P3, P10) are definitively lost, and the order from P24 (144 units) is now 6 periods late, indicating it is also likely lost. Therefore, the reliable pipeline is effectively 0. Since on-hand is 0 and no arrivals are expected, a significant order is needed. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the summer demand levels (avg ~126), and set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed lead time lengthening and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 0-inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Reliable pipeline confirmed at 0 units. In-transit units from P1, P3, P10 (458 total) and now P24 (144 units) are treated as lost. Total pipeline loss is 602 units. Demand has stabilized at a lower 'post-peak' level of ~90 units/period for late August.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9), demand has stabilized at a lower post-summer-peak level. The demand for the last four periods (P27-P30) averaged approximately 89.5 units (99, 96, 83, 80), showing a consistent descent from the July peak. Regarding inventory, the 'In-transit' total of 602 units is entirely unreliable: 458 units (from P1, P3, P10) are definitively lost, and the 144 units from P24 are now 7 periods overdue (6 periods past promised lead time), meaning the reliable pipeline is 0. With on-hand inventory also at 0, an immediate order is necessary to meet the current demand regime. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods). mu_hat is set using N=5 to capture the recent stabilization around 90 units per period. sigma_hat is also set to N=5 to account for the reduced volatility in this post-peak phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Reliable pipeline inventory remains 0. The P24 order (144 units) is now 7 periods late and is added to the list of lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P24), totaling 602 units lost. Demand is currently in a steady post-summer-peak regime averaging ~90 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (Sept 16), demand has stabilized into a post-summer-peak regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 91.4 units/period, down from the summer peak average of ~160 but significantly higher than the spring/summer troughs. The pipeline is heavily distorted: of the 602 units 'In-transit', 458 are definitely lost (P1, P3, P10) and the 144 units from P24 are now 8 periods overdue and also considered lost. Consequently, the reliable pipeline is effectively zero, and on-hand inventory is 0. With L=2 and high service level requirements (Profit=Holding), the OR backend needs to place a substantial order to cover the 3-period lead-time + review window (1+L). I will set mu_hat to reflect the current 91.4 average and sigma_hat based on the recent stability, while allowing lead time to remain at the default promised 2 periods (as recent arrivals showed high variability between 1-3). Since the engine subtracts the 602 units from its order calculation, I must use 'explicit' values to force an order that accounts for the fact that those 602 units are missing.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: In-transit inventory of 602 units (P1, P3, P10, P24) is fully confirmed lost; reliable pipeline is 0. Demand regime for September is stable at approximately 91 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for this blouse SKU has entered a stable regime following the summer peak, averaging approximately 91 units per period (Periods 27-32 demand: 99, 96, 83, 80, 99, 59). In-transit inventory stands at 876 units, but 602 of these (from Periods 1, 3, 10, and 24) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. This leaves a reliable pipeline of 274 units (ordered in Period 32), which corresponds to the 'In-transit' figure of 876 minus 602 lost units. To ensure the OR backend places an order that accounts for these losses, I will set mu_hat explicitly. A 3-period coverage (L+1, where L=2) at ~91 units/period equals ~273 units. Since the reliable pipeline already contains 274 units, the capped policy should naturally moderate ordering unless demand surges. I will use 'explicit' for L to acknowledge the recent volatility and 'recent_N' for demand parameters (N=6) to capture the post-summer stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total lost pipeline inventory confirmed at 602 units (P1, P3, P10, P24). Reliable pipeline as of P33 is 274 units (from P32).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (September 30), the demand for this SKU remains in a post-summer steady state, averaging approximately 89 units per period over the last five weeks (P29-P33). The primary operational challenge continues to be the massive pipeline distortion. There are 876 units reported 'In-transit', but 602 of these are definitely lost (P1: 35, P3: 204, P10: 219, P24: 144). The only reliable shipment is the 274 units ordered in Period 32. Based on the 2-period lead time, this order should arrive during Period 34 and be visible in the Period 34 conclude message. To manage this in the OR backend, I will set 'L' to the promised 2 periods. Since the backend includes the 602 lost units in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, it will likely not order anything unless I set a very high base stock (mu_hat). I am targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~267 units). However, because the backend subtracts the full 876 'In-transit' units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that offsets this ghost inventory to trigger any potential orders if the P32 shipment fails to fulfill needs. For this period, I anticipate the P32 arrival (274 units) will satisfy immediate demand, but I use a recent_N strategy for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current 90-unit regime for future planning.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: 602 units total (P1, P3, P10, P24) are confirmed lost and distorting the pipeline. Current demand regime (late Sept) stable at ~90 units/period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019/10/07), the SKU 660726001 (Straight-cut blouse) is in a post-summer-peak stabilization phase. Recent demand (Period 32-34) has been 59, 107, and 22, averaging 62.7 units per period. This follows a steady September regime of ~90 units/period. The current 'In-transit' figure is 876 units. However, consistent history shows that 602 units are lost (P1: 35, P3: 204, P10: 219, P24: 144). The reliable pipeline is only the order from P32 (274 units). Given the Promised Lead Time of 2, the order from P32 should arrive during Period 34 or 35. Since it hasn't arrived by the end of P34, it is expected in P35. To avoid excessive holding costs during this decelerating phase, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the trend of 59-107-22 while acknowledging the previous ~90 level, balancing the risk of a temporary dip against the stock already in transit.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 660726001 (Women's Blouse) is currently in a post-summer demand deceleration. Demand dropped significantly in October, with Period 34 and 35 recording 22 and 27 units respectively, down from the ~90/period observed in September. The actual lead time remains variable, with the most recent arrival (P32 order) taking 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 602 units refers to shipments from P1, P3, P10, and P24, which are strictly confirmed as lost based on multiple subsequent arrivals (e.g., the order from P32 arrived while these remain outstanding for 11-34 periods). Consequently, the reliable pipeline is 0. On-hand inventory is 247, which covers approximately 8-9 periods of current demand (~27/unit). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P32-P35) to capture this downward shift. I will set L to 3 to reflect the most recently observed actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting October (P34): Weekly demand dropped to ~25 units, an 80% decrease from the summer peak and 70% decrease from the September steady state (~90).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 660726001 (a short-sleeved blouse) has entered a low-volume autumn regime. Since Period 34 (September 30), weekly demand has dropped significantly to an average of 23 units (22, 27, 20), consistent with the seasonality of a summer-weight garment in October. I currently have 227 units on-hand, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 9-10 weeks of inventory. The 'In-transit' count of 602 units relates entirely to lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 10, and 24, as confirmed in previous carry-over insights; therefore, the reliable pipeline is 0. Given the high on-hand balance relative to the current low demand regime, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new low-demand state (~23 units/period) and sigma_hat likewise to reflect the reduced volatility. Lead time is set to calculate (historical average) as recent deliveries (P23, P32) have shown a shift towards 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime floor: October (P34-P36) demand stabilized at ~23 units/period, down from ~90 in September. On-hand inventory (227) is sufficient for ~10 periods at current rates.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the demand for this blouse SKU has entered a low-season regime. Since Period 34, demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 24.5 units per period (P34-P37: 22, 27, 20, 29). This represents a significant seasonal drop from the September levels (~90) and the Summer peak (~160). Currently, there are 198 units on-hand. With a demand forecast of ~25 units per period, the existing inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 8 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' value of 602 units consists entirely of historical orders from Periods 1, 3, 10, and 24 that are confirmed lost/delayed and will not arrive. Although the backend logic assumes these units will eventually arrive, the high on-hand inventory relative to the current demand floor means no new orders should be triggered. I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat) and lead time (L) to reflect the current low-demand regime to prevent unnecessary ordering while the system works through the excess on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed late-autumn demand floor: October (P34-P37) demand is stable at ~25 units/period, down significantly from previous regimes. Total lost pipeline remains at 602 units (P1, P3, P10, P24).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, entering the late autumn/pre-holiday season. Demand for this short-sleeve blouse has reached its annual floor, stabilizing at approximately 25 units per period during October (P34-P38). On-hand inventory is 170 units, which covers nearly 7 periods of demand at the current rate (170 / 25 = 6.8 periods). The 'In-transit' figure of 602 units persists but is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P24). Consequently, the reliable pipeline is zero. Given the holding cost of $1.00/unit and the upcoming end-of-year season, I will keep mu_hat aligned with the recent low-demand regime to prevent any further ordering, as the existing stock is more than sufficient. I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable late-autumn floor (P34-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product (a short-sleeved blouse) has transitioned into a low-demand winter regime. Demand over the last 6 periods (P34-P39) has averaged 22.7 units per period, with the most recent sample at 10 units, indicating a possible further decline as winter deepens. On-hand inventory is currently 160 units, which covers approximately 7 periods of demand at the current average rate. There is a persistent pipeline distortion: 602 units (from P1, P3, P10, and P24) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed and should be ignored for replenishment logic. Given the high on-hand stock and the low seasonal demand for a summer-style blouse, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime using the last 6 samples (N=6) to ensure the OR backend recognizes the shift from the higher September levels. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Sustained winter demand floor confirmed: Nov 4 (P39) demand dropped to 10 units, continuing the low-demand regime (~23/period) established in October for this short-sleeved blouse.

Demand has dropped from an average of ~25 units/period in October to ~9 units/period in the last two weeks (P39-40). With 152 units on-hand, we have enough stock to cover over 15 periods at the current demand rate, meaning no new orders are necessary. The pipeline of 602 units (P1: 35, P3: 204, P10: 219, P24: 144) is confirmed lost based on multiple carry-over insights and will not arrive. Lead time remains approximately 2-3 periods, but is currently irrelevant due to the significant overstock relative to winter demand.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor confirmed: November demand (P39-40) has further decelerated to an average of 9 units/period, down from the October average of 25. High on-hand inventory (152 units) relative to this low demand negates the need for any replacement orders for the foreseeable future.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (short-sleeved blouse) is currently in a winter demand floor regime. Since Period 39 (early November), demand has hit a bottom, averaging approximately 9 units per period (P39-41: 10, 8, 9). This follows a previous low-demand regime in October of ~25 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 143 units, which provides approximately 15-16 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 602 units comprises orders from Periods 1, 3, 10, and 24, all of which are months past their promised lead time and are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed as per historical analysis. These should be ignored by the OR controller. Given the high stock-to-demand ratio and the seasonal unlikelihood of a demand spike for a short-sleeved blouse in late November/December, no new orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect this stable, low-demand floor using the 'recent_N' method (N=3) to capture the most recent deceleration.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are in a confirmed winter demand floor for this short-sleeved blouse. Recent demand (P39-P42) has been very low: 10, 8, 9, and 33 units, averaging 15 units per period. The spike to 33 in P42 is still well below the seasonal peaks seen in Spring (~97) and Summer (~166). On-hand inventory is 110 units. At the current average demand of 15 units/period, this inventory covers approximately 7 periods, which is significantly more than the (L+1) requirement (where L=2). The 'In-transit' of 602 units comprises shipments from P1, P3, P10, and P24 that have been confirmed lost over many periods of observation; thus, the reliable pipeline is 0. Given the high on-hand stock and low seasonal demand, no new orders are necessary. Parameters for mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N=4 to capture the winter trough profile.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (Nov-Dec) remains low for short-sleeved SKU, averaging 15 units/period (P39-P42). On-hand inventory is sufficient to cover demand through the end of the year.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '660726001' (short-sleeved blouse) is currently in a deep winter demand trough. December 9th (Period 44) demand remains very low, with an average of approximately 15 units per period over the last five weeks (P39-P43). Current on-hand inventory is 101 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the projected demand for the remaining 4 periods of the simulation (approx 40-60 units total) without any risk of stockouts. The 'In-transit' quantity of 602 units (from P1, P3, P10, and P24) is confirmed lost and does not impact the reliable inventory position. No additional orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect this low-demand regime using recent data (N=5) to ensure the OR backend does not calculate a high base stock based on historical summer/spring peaks.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16 (Period 45), approaching the end of the year. Demand for this short-sleeved blouse is in a sustained winter floor regime, averaging approximately 13.5 units/period over the last 6 weeks (P39-P44). On-hand inventory is currently 88 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 6.5 periods of demand at this rate. Given that there are only 2 periods remaining (P46 and P47) after this decision, existing stock is more than enough to satisfy late-December demand without further ordering. The 'In-transit' figure of 602 units remains distorted by confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P24) as documented in carry-over insights. Parameters are set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect this low-volume end-of-season regime, ensuring the OR backend sees a low base stock requirement that is already met by on-hand inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (short-sleeved blouse) experienced a major demand spike in Period 45 (115 units), likely a pre-holiday or early-season anomaly given the previous winter floor was ~15 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 602 units is confirmed lost (orders from P1, P3, P10, P24). The reliable pipeline is zero. Given the proximity to the end of the year and the recent volatility, I will use a conservative forecast that balances the recent spike with the general winter floor. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (approx. late Oct to now) to capture both the floor and the recent spike (average ~31/period), and use a slightly higher volatility estimate (explicit sigma) to account for the Period 45 surge. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P32 order arriving in 3 periods) suggest variability beyond the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Unexpected demand spike (115 units) in Period 45 during the winter floor regime; monitoring if this is a holiday peak or a shift toward early spring demand. Total pipeline loss remains 602 units (P1, P3, P10, P24).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '660726001' (short-sleeved blouse) is entering the end of December/early January. We have observed a significant demand spike in the last two periods (P45: 115, P46: 71), which sharply deviates from the previous winter floor of ~15 units. This is consistent with the early spring transition observed in February 2019 (P1) where demand jumped from <30 to 60-146. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the 602 units 'in-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P10, P24). Consequently, the OR backend sees a huge pipeline but zero actual incoming stock. To force an order and capture this early spring demand, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate mean demand (mu_hat) for the lead time (L=2) plus review period (1) as 240 units (targeting ~80/period based on recent volatility and historical transition levels). Since we have 0 reliable pipeline, the OR engine (Base Stock - Pipeline) will trigger a substantial order to replenish stock for this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Early spring demand shift confirmed: P45-P46 demand averaged 93 units, echoing the shift seen in Feb 2019. Total lost pipeline remains at 602 units (P1, P3, P10, P24), necessitating manual parameter overrides to bypass inflated 'in-transit' figures.
