Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Brit Baby Tee'. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a clear upward trend: 55, 60, 66, 88, 108. The mean of all 5 samples is 75.4, but the most recent two weeks average 98, suggesting a significant demand ramp-up as we move towards spring. The promised lead time (L) is 2. My target is to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand. Using the recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat captures the recent acceleration (avg: 87.3), leading to an expected demand of ~262 over the lead period. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture historical volatility during this growth phase. No delivery history exists yet, so L is set to 'default'.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee', a basic short-sleeved top. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 55, 60, 66, 88, 108 (last 5 weeks). The demand in Period 1 was 98. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (124 units) has not yet arrived. With a promised lead time of 2, we expect that order to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 4. The current demand regime is trending upwards as we move toward spring. Using recent_N=3 for the demand forecast captures this growth (avg of 88, 108, 98 is ~98). \u03bc_hat = (1+L)*forecast = 3 * 98 = 294. \u03c3_hat is set using recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this growth phase.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand for this 'Brit Baby Tee' (a short-sleeved, fitted T-shirt) has shown a significant upward trend over the last 7 weeks (55, 60, 66, 88, 108, 98, 162). This sharp increase, especially the jump from 98 to 162, suggests a shift into Spring/Summer seasonality. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 and 2, making our demand signal a 'true demand' observation but resulting in $0 revenue. We have 239 units in transit (124 from P1, 115 from P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods; \ub530\ub77c\uc11c, the P1 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of this period (Period 3) and be visible in the Period 4 start. To account for the clear upward regime shift, I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent local demand growth (avg of 108, 98, 162 \u2248 122.6), and keep L at default (2). Since standard deviation is also increasing with the mean, a recent_N window for sigma_hat is appropriate to ensure the OR backend sets a high enough safety stock to prevent further stockouts during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand growth detected starting late January/early February, likely seasonal for Spring/Summer items (Short sleeves/Baby Tee). Demand rose from a mean of ~60 to ~160 in 7 weeks (+166%).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved jersey top), which is currently entering its peak Spring/Summer season (early March). Current demand is significantly higher than the initial January samples, averaging ~131 units over the last 3 weeks (98, 162, 134) compared to the ~75 average in late January. Despite zero arrivals so far, this is consistent with the promised lead time of 2 periods: the Period 1 order (124 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 4, and the Period 2 order (115 units) in Period 5. Since we haven't seen a 'conclude' message for Period 1's arrival yet (as Period 4 is just starting), lead time is assumed to be the promised 2 periods (L=2). I will set mu_hat using the last 3 weeks' average to capture the recent demand surge and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect higher volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved jersey top), which is currently seeing a seasonal demand surge as we enter March (Spring). Demand over the last 4 visible periods (98, 162, 134, 111) averages ~126 units/week, significantly higher than the initial January data (avg ~75). I have 4 units on-hand and 326 in-transit (orders from Period 1 and Period 3). In Period 4, an order from Period 2 arrived with exactly the promised lead time of 2 periods (arriving after 2 periods). I expect the Period 1 order (124 units) to be either lost or significantly delayed since it should have arrived in Period 3 (conclude) or Period 4 (conclude). Given the recent demand volatility and the 'tight' inventory (on-hand=4), I will use the most recent demand regime (last 4 weeks) to set mu_hat. I'll use L=2 (promised) as the Period 2 order arrived as expected, suggesting the network isn't permanently broken yet.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time reliability check: Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2), however, Period 1 order (124 units) is now overdue (should have arrived Period 3), suggesting potential lost shipment or specific batch delay.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved jersey top), which matches the seasonal demand increase observed in March as spring approaches. Current date is March 18. Demand has remained strong (avg ~123 over the last 3 periods), though it peaked earlier at 162. Importantly, the Period 1 order (124 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P1, promised P3, currently P6 start). This shipment is likely lost. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 416 units in transit (excluding the likely lost P1 order). To recover from the lost shipment and meet current demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods of demand (avg ~132) to capture the higher seasonal regime. I will keep L at 2 (promised), as P2 confirmance suggests the process is generally stable despite the one-off loss. Sigma_hat is set using recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 1 order (124 units) confirmed lost (4 periods overdue since promised arrival in P3). Seasonal demand floor for 'Brit Baby Tee' stabilized around 125-135 units/period for March.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the 'Brit Baby Tee' is experiencing high spring demand. Demand in Period 6 was 182 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization around 130, indicating a potential late-March surge. On-hand inventory is 0. Recent delivery history: Period 2 order arrived in P4 (L=2); Period 5 order arrived in P6 (L=1); Period 1 (124 units) is confirmed lost; Period 3 (180 units) and Period 4 (22 units) orders are still in transit and overdue/due respectively. Total pipeline is 340. Given the demand variability (123 to 182 over the last few weeks) and the lost shipment, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 samples to capture the recent growth trend and ensuring a higher safety stock. I will use 'calculate' for L as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (ignoring the lost shipment).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge detected in late March: Period 6 demand reached 182 units, up from the established ~130 average (+40%). Lead time variability noted: Period 5 order arrived in L=1, while Period 2 took L=2.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product 'Brit Baby Tee' is exhibiting strong seasonal growth as we enter the spring season. Demand has escalated from ~130 units in early March to 182 and 205 in the most recent two weeks. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) due to high demand and the loss of the Period 1 order. Lead times have shown variability: L=2 for Period 2, but L=1 for Period 5. The Period 3 order (180 units) is now overdue (placed P3, promised P5, currently P8), suggesting another potential lost shipment or delay. Pipeline inventory (180 from P3, 14 from P6, 118 from P7) totals 312, but if the 180 units are lost, we are severely under-supplied. I will set L to 'calculate' to account for variability and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent surge (avg ~174/week). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Average weekly demand increased to ~193 units in late March (Period 6-7). Potential second lost shipment: Period 3 order (180 units) is 3 periods overdue as of Period 8.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/04/08), the SKU (Brit Baby Tee) is entering peak spring demand. Analysis of recent demand (P6: 182, P7: 205, P8: 221) shows a clear upward trend, with the average of the last 3 periods being 203 units. Regarding inventory, we currently have 0 on-hand. In-transit reconciliation shows 440 units: P3 (180), P4 (22), and P8 (114), plus the P1 order (124) which is confirmed lost. Specifically, individual orders are arriving with lead times of either 1 or 2 periods (P5 took 1, P6 took 2, P7 took 1). However, the P3 order (180 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P3, expected P5), suggesting it is also lost. To prevent further stockouts given the rising demand and unreliable pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a forecast that accounts for the current 200+ unit demand regime over the (L+1) window. I will set L to 2 to maintain the promised safety buffer, while acknowledging the high risk of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand peak confirmed in April, exceeding 200 units/week (last 3 weeks average: 203). Second lost shipment highly likely: Period 3 order (180 units) is now 4 periods overdue.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are in the middle of the Spring demand peak for the 'Brit Baby Tee'. Recent demand (Periods 6-9) has averaged 198.5 units/week (182, 205, 221, 186), showing a sustained shift from the earlier average of ~130. Inventory management is challenged by lost or delayed shipments: the Period 1 order (124 units) and now the Period 3 order (180 units) appear lost (the latter is 5 periods overdue relative to its P4 promised arrival). Consequently, the current on-hand inventory is 0. 'In-transit' is 639 units (comprising Period 4, 8, and 9 orders), but the backend OR engine counts all in-transit units toward the base stock calculation, which might suppress ordering if it doesn't know some units are lost. To compensate for the high stockout risk and sustained demand peak, I am increasing mu_hat to 600 (approx. 200 units/period for L+1 = 3 periods) using the 'explicit' method, and setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time (currently ~1.5 periods across successful arrivals). Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for recent high demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Second lost shipment confirmed: Period 3 order (180 units) is now 5 periods overdue since P4 promised arrival and 10 periods since ordering. Demand remains in high-regime (avg ~200/wk) for April.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the product 'Brit Baby Tee' is in a high-demand spring regime. The average demand over the last four periods (Period 7-10) is 204.5 units per week, which is consistent with the seasonal peak for short-sleeve basics in April. We currently have 107 units on-hand and 355 units in-transit. Two orders (Period 1 and Period 3) are confirmed as lost shipments and have been accounted for in the pipeline calculations. Lead times have been volatile, alternating between 1 and 2 periods (P8 order took 2, P9 order took 1). I will set the lead time parameter L to 2 to be conservative for the (L+1) coverage required. Given the high stock-out risk seen in history and the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current 200+ unit/week rhythm, and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. This ensures base stock targets reflect current seasonal velocity.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee', which is experiencing high seasonal demand in April/May. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a high demand of 267 in Period 11. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 528 units, consisting of orders from Period 10 (29 units) and Period 11 (173 units), plus potentially others not yet concluded. However, two previous orders (Period 1 and Period 3) have been confirmed lost, which the OR backend does not account for. Current demand is in a high-growth regime (avg of last 4 periods \u2248 220). To compensate for the high demand and the lost units that the OR engine still thinks are in-transit, I am setting mu_hat explicitly based on the (L+1) horizon (3 periods * ~220 = 660) and using a recent_N sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in the recent surge (e.g., the jump to 267). Lead time remains variable (1-2 periods), so I will use calculate to average recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Late April demand surged to 267 units, increasing the April weekly average from ~200 to ~220 (+10%).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6) marks the beginning of May. The 'Brit Baby Tee' (Short sleeve jersey basic) is entering its peak seasonal demand as weather warms. Historical demand shows a clear upward trajectory: April averaged ~220 units/week, with the last two weeks reaching 267 and 229. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory due to high demand and historical shipment losses (Period 1 and Period 3 orders). Lead times have been volatile, alternating between 1 and 2 periods. To ensure we capture the May peak while accounting for potential inventory gaps, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P10-P12 avg: 234) to reflect the high-regime demand of ~234 units/period, multiplied by (1+L). Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N=3 to capture recent volatility. L=2 is maintained as the standard lead time, though recent arrivals suggest L=1 is possible, the backend logic for base_stock - pipeline requires the longer estimate to ensure sufficient safety stock against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: May entry confirms sustained high-demand regime for short-sleeve basics, with late April/Early May weekly average stabilizing at ~234 units (+7% vs April avg).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee', a seasonal basic. Current date is mid-May, aligning with high seasonal demand for short-sleeved tops. Demand in the most recent periods (P11-P13) has shown high volatility (267, 229, 128) but maintains a high regime average (~208 over the last 3 weeks). The sharp drop in Period 13 demand (128) might be a temporary fluctuation or a sign of the regime stabilizing at a lower level after a peak; however, given the seasonality, I will use a 3-week average to smooth this. Lead times have been fairly stable at 1-2 periods recently (P11 arrived in 2), though history shows two lost shipments (P1 and P3). On-hand inventory is low (45), and there is a significant In-transit pipeline of 574 units (P12 order of 177, P13 order of 42, and likely a large backlog of previously lost/delayed items that the OR engine needs to account for). Setting mu_hat to the recent 3-period average and sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility to ensure service levels during this high-demand season.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee', a seasonal basic which has transitioned into its late spring demand peak. The latest historical data shows a demand regime stabilization. After a significant surge in late April (P11 demand: 267), the demand for the first half of May has normalized but remains high (P13: 128, P14: 171). Note that the drop in P13/P14 demand follows two periods of stockouts in P11/P12, which may be masking true demand or reflecting a slight seasonal cooldown. However, the 10-period average (P5-P14) is ~194 units, and the 5-period average (P10-P14) is ~200 units. Lead times are consistently L=1 or L=2 (excluding confirmed lost shipments from P1 and P3). For Period 15, on-hand inventory is 51 and in-transit is 507. To maintain a healthy service level for the (L+1) horizon (approx 3 weeks), I am using a recent_N approach for demand to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, opting for N=5 to focus on May/Late April behavior.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Brit Baby Tee' (a short-sleeved basic) is currently in a high-demand late-spring/early-summer season. Periodic observations show that demand in May has stabilized at a high level, although individual weeks fluctuate (P13: 128, P14: 171, P15: 178). My recent average (P11-P15) is approximately 195 units/week. Since P13-P15 show a slight cooling from the late-April peak (267), but remain high, a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 captures the current seasonal regime. The SKU is currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). Total in-transit is 628, consisting of orders from P4 (22, very likely lost/overdue), P10 (29, very likely lost/overdue), P13 (42), P14 (110), and P15 (121). Note: The 628 in-transit figure provided by the system suggests additional older orders (P1, P3 etc.) might still be counted in the pipeline despite being flagged as lost. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (Avg: 1.5). I will use 'recent_N' for Lead Time (L) to reflect the recent behavior and 'recent_N' for demand parameters over the last 4 periods to set a base stock that covers the current 190+ units/week trend while accounting for the high volatility (sigma).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved basic), which is currently in its peak summer season (June 3). Demand remains in a high regime, but has shown significant variability recently (P14: 171, P15: 178, P16: 239). The mean demand over the last 3 periods is approximately 196 units. Despite 'on-hand' being 0, there is a large 'in-transit' volume of 628 units (from orders in P13: 42, P14: 110, P15: 121, and P16: 0 but P13-15 are still trickling in). Specifically, the P13 order (42) and P14 (110) are now due/overdue based on L=2. Historical lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods; I will use 'calculate' to reflect this 1.5 average. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility summer environment while accounting for the recent demand spike in P16. The high in-transit amount will likely trigger the OR backend's cap or result in a small order to prevent excessive holding costs given the current 1:4 holding-to-profit ratio.

Carry-over insight: In-transit pipeline is currently very high (628 units) as of P17, which represents approximately 3 periods of high-regime demand; monitoring for potential upcoming overstocking if demand doesn't maintain >200 levels.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10), we are in the peak season for a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeve jersey basic). Recent demand history (Periods 11-17) shows a persistent high-regime demand averaging approximately 201.7 units per week, although sales have been frequently constrained by stockouts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but the pipeline is high with 507 units in-transit (orders from P14 unknown, P13 unknown, P12 arrived, but notably we had orders of 42 (P13), 110 (P14) and potentially others still in the pipeline). The Period 16 and 17 orders were 0 units, likely to let the pipeline catch up. Given the high demand and the goal of managing stockouts without overshooting as we approach mid-summer, I will set mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (last 7 periods). Lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I'll use L=2 to be conservative for safety stock calculations. Sigma_hat will be updated to reflect recent volatility to ensure the OR engine maintains an appropriate buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~200 units/week for May/June (Periods 13-17 average: 183 observed, but frequently stock-out limited; actual demand average of last 7 periods is 201.7).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), we are in a high-demand regime for the 'Brit Baby Tee'. Historical demand from mid-April through early June (Periods 11-18) shows an average demand of approximately 211 units per week (267, 229, 128, 171, 178, 239, 199, 151). The lower numbers in Period 13 and Period 18 likely reflect either inventory stock-outs or natural fluctuations, while the peaks reach 240-270. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 674 units in transit. The in-transit pipeline (ordered in P13, P14, and P18) is intended to cover the L+1 window. Specifically, the orders from P13 (42), P14 (110), and P18 (167) are active, while older orders from P1-P12 have already concluded or been deemed lost (P1 and P3). For Period 19, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 8-period mean (~211) to account for the consistent high-season demand for jersey basics. The OR backend will reconcile the 674 units in-transit against the target base stock. Given lead time variability (alternating between 1 and 2 periods), I use 'calculate' for L. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' over the same 8-period window to capture the current volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 20 (late June). The 'Brit Baby Tee' is a seasonal summer staple. Demand has stabilized in a high-regime (L7 average ~192 units). Recent lead times have fluctuated between L=1 and L=2 (P18 arrived in L=1, P15 in L=2). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 507 units in-transit (orders from P13, P14, and P19 are either overdue or pending). Specifically, orders from P13 (42 units) and P14 (110 units) are significantly past their promised L=2 arrival, which is concerning but not yet confirmed as lost. If those shipments are indeed lost, the pipeline is thinner than it appears. However, given the current high in-transit count relative to the ~200 weekly demand, the OR backend's inventory cap should naturally moderate ordering. I will use a recent_N of 7 for demand parameters to capture the current summer baseline (approx 200/wk) while staying responsive to the slight dip observed in Period 18-19.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of July 1st (Period 21), the 'Brit Baby Tee' (a summer staple short-sleeve top) is entering its peak seasonal period. Demand has remained consistently high, with the last 5 periods (P16-P20) averaging 196.4 units despite frequent stock-outs. The current on-hand inventory is 0, while the in-transit pipeline is 594 units, primarily consisting of large orders from P13 (42 units), P14 (110 units), and P20 (87 units), with several units likely from unaccounted/potentially lost historical orders which the OR logic needs to accommodate. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime of ~200 units/week. Given the mix of L=1 and L=2 arrivals in the history (most recently L=1 in P19), I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to average historical lead times. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a sufficient buffer for the high seasonal volatility (~25-30 units std dev).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Demand stabilized at ~200 units/week for June (Periods 17-20 average: 185.7 observed, but actual demand consistently near 200). Pipeline density remains high, requiring careful monitoring to prevent overstocking as the season progresses past July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486001' (Brit Baby Tee) is a summer-seasonal item currently at its peak. Demand has remained in a high regime for several months (April-June), with a recent average (Periods 17-21) of approximately 183 units observed, though frequent stock-outs suggest true latent demand is closer to 200 units. The current date is July 8th; we expect peak demand to persist through July before a likely late-August tapering. Inventory is currently precarious with 0 on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 676 units (accounting for orders from P20, P21, and the recently signaled/expected arrivals). Two historical shipments (P1 and P3) are confirmed lost. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P18 arrived in 1, while others took 2). I will set L to 2 to be conservative for safety stock. mu_hat is set using N=5 to capture the stable high-summer mean (~200 per week), and sigma_hat is set similarly to handle the observed late-season volatility. The pipeline (676) is high, but given the stock-outs, the OR engine needs to maintain a target that ensures arrival for the remaining peak weeks.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15), we are transitioning into the late summer phase for the 'Brit Baby Tee'. Period 22 observed demand was 154 units, following 172 units in Period 21. This indicates a cooling off from the spring/early summer peak which frequently exceeded 200 units. The 4-week moving average (P19-P22) is approximately 179.75, compared to the previously established 200+ regime. Additionally, current inventory is constrained: on-hand is 0, and we have a significant pipeline of 589 units (orders from P21-P23 plus earlier undelivered stock). Given the 'Jersey Basic' nature of the product, demand likely won't crash but will taper. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering approx. one month) to capture this downward trend (average ~174/wk). Sigma is kept at recent_N=5 since volatility remains relatively stable even as mean shifts. Lead time calculation is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability between 1 and 2 periods observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand softening: Period 21-22 demand averaged 163 units, down from the June average of ~200 (-18%), indicating a transition from peak summer demand for the Brit Baby Tee.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Brit Baby Tee' (a short-sleeve summer basic) is showing a clear post-peak softening in demand as we move into late July (Period 24). Demand has dropped from a June average of ~200 units/week to a July average of ~148 units/week (last three weeks: 172, 154, 120). This follows a typical seasonal cycle for summer-specific apparel. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but the in-transit pipeline is very high at 507 units (due to significant orders placed in Periods 22 and 23 which haven't arrived yet). These incoming units represent over 3 weeks of current demand coverage. To avoid overstocking during the seasonal decline, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent three-period average (~148 units per period, scaled by (1+L)) and sigma_hat using recent volatility to maintain service levels without excessive holding costs. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P20, P21) have adhered to the promised 2-period window or 1-period arrivals (P19).

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal decline confirmed: July demand average dropped to ~148 units (Period 21-23), a 26% decrease from the June peak of ~200.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (late July), the 'Brit Baby Tee' is clearly in a seasonal decline phase. Demand has dropped from a June peak of approximately 200 units/week to a July average of 144 units/week (last 4 periods: 172, 154, 120, 130). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 507 units in-transit. Given the recent demand drop, 507 units represents over 3.5 periods of coverage at the current rate of ~140 units/week. Since the base stock level (1+L) * mean demand would be roughly 3 * 140 = 420, and we already have 507 units in the pipeline, any further orders would likely lead to excessive holding costs as the season winds down. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the downward trend (approx 144), L to default (2), and sigma_hat to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. The OR engine's capped policy should naturally result in a zero order given that pipeline (507) > base_stock (~420-500).

Carry-over insight: End-of-season decline for short-sleeve basics confirmed: July demand floor established at ~144 units/period, a ~28% drop from June peak (~200). Pipeline inventory (507) currently exceeds expected 3-week demand requirements.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), the 'Brit Baby Tee' is deep in its end-of-season decline. Late July demand has fallen sharply, with the last observed value at 86 units, confirming a transition from the ~200 peak to a sub-150 floor. The pipeline is currently extremely bloated at 507 units (including the delayed P13 order of 42, P14 order of 110, and others previously missing), which represents over 4 periods of supply at the current demand rate (~120 weighted avg). With zero on-hand inventory but a 507-unit pipeline, any further ordering would significantly increase holding cost risk as the product heads into late summer. I will set the lead time (L) to 2 (promised). Demand (mu_hat) is set using recent_N=5 (capturing the July decline), and sigma_hat is set to default to reflect recent volatility. The pipeline will absorb all of this, resulting in zero new orders to prevent overstocking.

Carry-over insight: August demand entered a sharp seasonal decline: late July demand (P25) dropped to 86 units, a 57% decrease from the June peak. Pipeline inventory (507) now represents a significant overstock risk relative to the new lower-demand regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeve basic) is currently experiencing a sharp seasonal decline as we move into mid-August (P27). Demand has dropped from a June peak of ~200 units/week to just 54 units in P26, a 73% decrease. We current have 0 on-hand inventory but a very large pipeline (in-transit) of 507 units. Given the new low-demand regime (estimated mean ~60-80 units), the pipeline already covers approximately 6-8 weeks of demand, which is far beyond the (L+1) = 3 week planning horizon. Current pipeline alone poses a major overstock risk. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 3-period regime (P24-P26: 130, 86, 54) to capture the accelerating downward trend, while maintaining L at calculate to monitor lead-time stability. No new orders should be placed until the pipeline is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Sharp seasonal decline confirmed for August: demand dropped to 54 units (P26), a 73% reduction from the June peak (~200). Pipeline of 507 units now represents multi-month overstock risk.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Brit Baby Tee) is in a sharp seasonal decline as of mid-August. Recent demand for Periods 25-27 has been 86, 54, and 56 units respectively, confirming a low-demand regime (average ~65 units/week) compared to the summer peak of ~200. There are currently 507 units in-transit (remaining from orders in Periods 13, 14, and potentially others not yet concluded). Given the current demand forecast of ~65 units/period and a lead time of 2, the pipeline of 507 units covers nearly 8 weeks of inventory. This poses a significant overstock and holding cost risk. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this collapse in demand and prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders, as the pipeline inventory vastly exceeds the required base stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Brit Baby Tee) is in a sharp seasonal decline as we move into late August. Demand has stabilized at a much lower regime, with the last three periods showing 54, 56, and 59 units respectively (mean ~56). I have a significant pipeline inventory (In-transit) of 507 units from orders placed during the high-demand June/July period. These units will eventually arrive and far exceed the current demand requirements for the next several weeks. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to profit ($4.0/unit), and the current overstock risk, the OR backend must not place any new orders. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3-period regime to reflect this lower demand, while the OR logic's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will ensure a zero-order output since 507 >> demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: August demand regime shift confirmed: demand stabilized at a significantly lower floor of ~56 units/period (Periods 26-28), down ~72% from the June peak. Pipeline inventory (507 units) creates a substantial overstock risk for the remainder of the season.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Brit Baby Tee) is a seasonal short-sleeve basic that is currently in a late-season low-demand regime. Demand has stabilized at approximately 55-60 units per period for the month of August (P26-P29: 54, 56, 59, 61), following a sharp decline from the June peak of ~200. The current in-transit pipeline is extremely high at 507 units, which was ordered during the peak season and represents approximately 8-9 weeks of supply at the current demand rate of ~60 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a significant number of units eventually expected to arrive from the pipeline (assuming they are not lost like the P1 and P3 orders), there is a high risk of overstocking if further orders are placed. The goal is to allow the pipeline to clear and transition to on-hand inventory before placing new orders. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (mu_hat based on the last 4 periods) to prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary replenishment while the pipeline is so large.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift: Demand stabilized at a floor of ~60 units/period throughout August (P26-P29), down 70% from summer peak. High pipeline (507 units) poses continued overstock risk as the season ends.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486001' (Brit Baby Tee) is a seasonal short-sleeve basic that has transitioned from a summer peak (~200 units/week) into a late-season trough. Demand in Period 30 dropped significantly to 29 units, confirming a sharp decline from the ~60 units/period floor observed throughout August. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 507 units. These units represent orders placed during June/July that have experienced significant delays or are arriving in a single late batch. Given the current demand (29 units) and the average demand over the last 5 periods (~52 units), the 507 units in transit represent roughly 10-17 weeks of supply. This creates a severe overstocking risk. No new orders (order=0) have been placed since Period 21 to mitigate this. I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (~52 units) while keeping the lead time at default. The OR backend will naturally suppress further ordering because the pipeline inventory (507) far exceeds the calculated base stock required for the new low-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift: Demand dropped to 29 units in P30, a ~50% decrease from the August floor (~60 units/period) and an 85% decrease from the June peak (~200). Pipeline of 507 units now represents a critical overstock risk exceeding 15 weeks of current demand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Brit Baby Tee) is in a sharp post-summer decline as of mid-September. Demand in the most recent period (P31) was 38 units, and the average for the last two periods (P30-31) is 33.5 units. This follows an August floor of ~60 units, confirming a sustained downward shift. More critically, there is a massive in-transit pipeline of 507 units. These represent the delayed shipments from Period 4 (ordered P4, P10, P13, P14), which were previously assumed lost but are now physically 'In-transit' in the system's ledger. This pipeline covers approximately 15 weeks of current demand (507 / 33.5). To prevent catastrophic overstocking and maximize profit by minimizing future holding costs, no new orders must be placed. mu_hat is set using N=3 to capture the most recent local demand floor (avg ~42), though the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend combined with the huge pipeline will naturally result in an order of 0. L is set to default (2).

Carry-over insight: September demand floor established at ~33 units/period (P30-31), down from August's ~60. Pipeline inventory of 507 units exists; the OR controller must maintain zero ordering to bleed off this excess during the seasonal transition.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Brit Baby Tee' is deep in its seasonal decline as we move into late September. Demand has stabilized at a floor of approximately 30 units per week (periods 30-32 show 29, 38, and 28 units respectively). There is a significant in-transit pipeline of 507 units. These units represent older orders that have been delayed or stuck in-transit. If these units arrive, they would cover over 15 weeks of current demand, leading to severe holding costs. Therefore, the strategy remains to place zero new orders. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to zero, I ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation results in zero orders, effectively allowing the system to attempt to bleed off the existing pipeline should it ever arrive.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor confirmed at ~32 units/period (P30-P32), representing a 45% drop from August levels and an 84% drop from the June peak. Pipeline of 507 units remains the primary inventory risk.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sep 30), the 'Brit Baby Tee' has concluded its summer seasonal peak and is currently in a late-September low-demand regime, averaging ~32 units per period (P30-P33). The primary operational challenge remains the high 'In-transit' pipeline of 507 units. These units represent orders from the late-spring/early-summer high-demand period (specifically from P13, P14, and P16 which never arrived as confirmed by the conclude log gaps) that are now effectively extremely late or lost shipments. However, the OR backend sees them as 'In-transit' and subtracts them from the base stock calculation. Even if these units were to arrive, they would now create a massive overstock given the current demand floor is 84% lower than the June peak. To ensure the backend places zero new orders, I continue to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4-week window (N=4), reflecting the current stabilized low demand (approx 32/period). This results in a base stock significantly lower than the 507 units already in the pipeline, forcing a natural bleed-off of inventory without new procurement.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The product (Brit Baby Tee) has entered a clear seasonal decline. Demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34: 29, 38, 28, 32, 37) has averaged 32.8 units per week, consistently much lower than the summer peak of ~200. There is a very large pipeline of 507 units currently 'in-transit'. Based on lead-time history, some of this pipeline might be lost (P1 and P3 orders), but even assuming only half remains, 507 units represents over 15 weeks of current demand. Until this pipeline is resolved (either arrives or is confirmed lost), we must maintain zero ordering to avoid major overstocking and holding costs as we move further into the off-season. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 reflects the current low demand regime, and the backend capped policy will naturally result in zero orders given the high pipeline (PI) relative to base stock.

Carry-over insight: October entry confirms a stable low-demand regime for the Brit Baby Tee at ~33 units/period (P30-P34 average: 32.8), down 84% from June peak. Massive pipeline (507 units) remains the primary inventory risk; if these arrive, significant overstock will occur.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 36 (mid-October). The 'Brit Baby Tee' is a seasonal short-sleeve item that has moved into its post-summer low-demand regime. Average weekly demand over the last 6 periods (P30-P35) has stabilized at approximately 31 units per period. The critical constraint remains the in-transit pipeline of 507 units. This represents approximately 16 weeks of supply at current demand levels. There is substantial risk that this pipeline consists of the lost shipments from Period 1 (124 units) and Period 3 (180 units) that may finally arrive, or other late-season orders. Because on-hand is 0 and we are frequently stocking out, we technically need units, but the OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will correctly see the 507 units in transit and prevent ordering as long as the base stock target is lower than 507. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (~33/week) to ensure the OR engine does not place new orders, allowing the existing pipeline to eventually satisfy on-hand needs if/when those units arrive.

Carry-over insight: October demand floor confirmed at ~31 units/period (P30-P35 average), continuing the 85% decline from June peak (~200). Pipeline of 507 units remains the dominant inventory risk.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Brit Baby Tee (short-sleeve cotton jersey) remains in a stable low-demand autumn/winter regime. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P30-P36) is approximately 31.1 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 0; however, there is a massive in-transit pipeline of 507 units. These units represent approximately 16 weeks of inventory at the current demand rate. While these shipments are significantly overdue (some dating back to earlier in the season), if even a partial arrival occurs, it will lead to significant overstocking and high holding costs. Therefore, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (using recent_N=7 to capture the September/October stabilization), while L remains at the default promised lead time. The ordering strategy remains at zero (driven by the high pipeline vs. low demand) to prevent further exposure to overstock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486001' (Brit Baby Tee) is deep in a low-demand seasonal trough as of late October (Period 38). Demand from Period 30 to Period 37 has averaged approximately 32.5 units per week, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~200. The primary operational constraint remains the 507 units currently in-transit. This pipeline originated from early-season orders (notably Period 1's 124 units and Period 3's 180 units) which were flagged as likely lost between Periods 5 and 10. Given the on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline (507 units) represents over 15 weeks of current demand, I must continue to prevent new orders to avoid massive overstocking should any of these delayed units eventually arrive or if the OR backend assumes the pipeline is fulfilling base stock requirements. Setting L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised lead time) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 (capturing the stable September-October floor) will minimize the base stock level, keeping the order quantity at zero.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486001' (Brit Baby Tee) is entering November, typically a low-demand period for short-sleeve jersey basics. Recent demand (P30-P38) has stabilized at a floor of approximately 32 units/period. The critical factor remains the 'In-transit' pipeline of 507 units (likely consisting of the lost P1 and P3 orders of 124 and 180 units respectively, totaling 304, plus other undelivered stock). If these units arrive, they would cover over 15 weeks of current demand. Even if they are confirmed lost, the current on-hand is 0 and demand is low. However, to prevent any new ordering by the OR backend while we wait for this massive pipeline to either arrive or be reconciled, I will keep mu_hat and sigma_hat low. Setting mu_hat to a recent_N of 9 (P30-P38) captures the low-demand regime (~33 units). No orders should be placed because base_stock (calculated from these low demand parameters) will be far below the 507 units already in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime for short-sleeve basics remains stable at the low floor established in September/October (~32 units/period, P30-P38 avg).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeve ribbed cotton) is in a deep seasonal low, with a stable demand regime of ~30 units/period established since September (P30-P39 mean: 31.6). There is an extremely high 'In-transit' pipeline of 507 units. These units represent orders placed during the summer peak (likely the 'missing' shipments from P1 and P3, or other system-level pipeline anomalies totaling 507 units). If these 507 units arrive now, they would cover more than 15 periods of current demand, leading to significant holding costs. Therefore, the priority is to bleed off this pipeline and prevent any new orders. I will keep L at 'default' (2) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect the current low-demand regime. This combination of a low base_stock target and a high pipeline inventory will cause the OR backend to output an order of 0 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486001' (Brit Baby Tee) remains in a stable low-demand late-autumn regime. Period 40 demand was 22 units, consistent with the November floor of approximately 23-30 units/period (P35-P40 average: 27.6). There is an massive in-transit pipeline of 507 units. These units represent orders from very early in the year (including Period 3) that have not arrived for over 30 periods. While these are likely lost or indefinitely delayed, the OR backend logic considers 'In-transit' as future supply. With an expected demand of ~28 per week, the 507 units in pipeline represent over 18 weeks of supply for a game that only has 7 periods remaining (ends at P47). Any additional orders would only increase holding costs if they were to arrive. Therefore, I am maintaining parameters that result in zero new orders by ensuring the base stock calculation (mu_hat) is significantly lower than the pipeline inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a deep seasonal trough (late November) with demand averaging ~21 units/period over the last 4 weeks (P38-P41). On-hand inventory is 0, but there is a massive 'in-transit' pipeline of 507 units. While historical indicators suggest these units from Period 13-15 are very likely lost (they are over 25 periods overdue), the OR backend still calculates 'pipeline_inventory' as 507. Because the base_stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) for the current low-demand regime (~21 units/week) will be significantly lower than 507, the capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) will result in zero orders. This is the correct strategic action to avoid overstocking in case any of those shipments eventually arrive, and to minimize holding costs while the item is out of season.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019 (Period 43). The product is a short-sleeved 'Brit Baby Tee', which is a seasonal summer basic. Demand has remained in a low-regime floor since September, with the most recent 5 periods (P38-P42) averaging 23.2 units/week. Inventory remains at 0 on-hand, but there is a massive stalled pipeline of 507 units. These units represent approximately 21 weeks of current demand. Although these orders are significantly overdue (many from the Period 1/3 lost batches or mid-season orders), they remain listed as in-transit. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00) and the end-of-season context, any additional order would likely result in purely holding cost losses. I am maintaining the ordering at zero by keeping parameters oriented toward the current low consumption and allowing the existing pipeline (if it ever arrives) to attempt to satisfy the minimal demand. mu_hat is set to reflect the most recent regime (N=13, covering late-September to present) to ensure the base stock calculation stays below the 507 units already in the system.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime established: average weekly demand for late Nov/early Dec has further softened to ~22 units/week.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (Dec 9), we are in the middle of a low-demand winter regime for the 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeve summer item). Demand has further softened in December, with Period 43 recording only 16 units. The most critical issue remains the 507 units currently in-transit. These units have been in the pipeline for over 4 months (since approx. P26) and represent a massive overstock risk compared to the current demand of ~22 units/week. If these units ever arrive, we will have over 20 weeks of inventory. Given the current on-hand is 0 and the pipeline is extremely heavy (507 units), no new orders should be placed. I am setting L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand environment, which ensures the OR backend's base-stock calculation remains far below the existing pipeline inventory, resulting in a zero order.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime established: current weekly demand has softened to ~21 units/week (P40-P43 average), down from the ~32 units/week seen in Oct/Nov.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (mid-December), the 'Brit Baby Tee' continues to experience its seasonal low-demand regime, with the most recent four-week average dropping further to ~19 units per period (Periods 41-44: 18, 28, 16, 15). The dominant factor remains the 507 units in-transit. These units represent orders from Period 1 and Period 3 (originally 124 and 180 units) and other subsequent orders that have failed to conclude for over 30 periods. Based on the game mechanics, these units are effectively lost or permanently delayed, but as they remain in the 'In-transit' bucket, they prevent the OR engine from placing new orders if I set standard parameters because the pipeline (507) far exceeds any reasonable base stock for a 20-unit demand regime. Given that on-hand is 0 and demand is currently ~20 per week, I must continue to maintain an order quantity of 0 to avoid potential massive overstocking should those lost units suddenly arrive (unlikely, but the holding cost vs profit trade-off remains risky). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current December softening, and use default L.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime established: current weekly demand has softened to ~19 units/week (P41-P44 average), continuing the winter season low for short-sleeve basics.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). Demand for the 'Brit Baby Tee' (a short-sleeve summer staple) is in its annual trough, with recent weekly demand averaging approximately 19-21 units (P41-P45). The SKU has been out of stock for several months, yet the system reports a persistent 'In-transit' pipeline of 507 units. These units represent orders from prior periods (likely P1 and P3, which were flagged as potentially lost) that have never concluded. Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline from the base_stock to calculate orders, the presence of these 507 units\u2014which significantly exceeds even the summer peak demand requirement\u2014will naturally prevent any new orders from being placed. This is currently the desired outcome, as ordering short-sleeve basics in late December while already theoretical overstocked would lead to excessive holding costs and potential obsolescence. I will maintain the mu_hat and sigma_hat at levels consistent with the current low-demand winter regime to ensure no accidental orders are triggered if the pipeline logic shifts.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. This is the final period of the game (Period 47). The product is the 'Brit Baby Tee', a short-sleeved basic item which has clearly passed its summer peak. Demand has stabilized in a very low winter regime, with an average of approximately 21 units per week over the last 7 periods (P40-P46). Inventory management remains critical due to a persistent 'In-transit' pipeline of 507 units. These units consist of two significantly overdue shipments from Period 1 (124 units) and Period 3 (180 units) that were never 'concluded' and likely represent lost stock, or massive seasonal delays. However, even if they were to suddenly arrive, they would represent over 24 weeks of current demand. On-hand inventory is 0, and because we are at the final decision point of the simulation, the focus is on matching the immediate demand without adding further to the overstock risk should the pipeline conclude. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low consumption rate for the final period.
