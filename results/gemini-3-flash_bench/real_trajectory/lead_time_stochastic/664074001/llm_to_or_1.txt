Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). There is no history yet. The historical demand samples provided (last 5 weeks) are: 82, 52, 45, 99, 108. This averages to 77.2 units/week with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. The product description (Charlie Top) suggests a women's tailoring/jersey item, which may see increased demand as we move closer to spring and summer, particularly in mid-February. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the coverage horizon should be L+1 = 3 periods. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the provided historical average and volatility. The backend will set the base stock to cover mean demand plus a safety margin based on the service level derived from the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1). Expected pipeline inventory is 0, so the OR backend should generate an initial stocking order.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's 'Charlie Top', a jersey cr\xeape garment. Looking at historical demand (Jan-Feb), the mean is 77.2 units (range 45-108). Period 1 demand was high (105), confirming a potential upward trend or seasonal peak in mid-February. On-hand inventory is 0, and 124 units are in-transit (ordered Period 1). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, these 124 units are expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible in P4). To prevent further stockouts while waiting for arrivals, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (including the recent 105 and 108) to capture the current higher demand regime. L is kept at 'default' (2) as we haven't confirmed any deviation yet. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's boat-neck top with pleated trims. Historical demand (Jan-early Feb) averaged ~77 units. However, recent demand in P1 (105) and P2 (188) shows a significant upward trend, likely due to the approached Spring season and associated updates in women's apparel. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders from P1 (124 units) and P2 (155 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (visible in P4 start). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in P1 and P2. To capture the recent demand spike, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the latest demand (108, 105, 188) more heavily. For L, I retain 'default' as we haven't yet confirmed any deviation from the promised 2-period lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Historical demand (P1-P3) shows a significant increase from pre-game samples (avg ~77) to current game rounds (avg ~145). This coincides with approaching the Spring season for a 'straight-cut top in airy jersey cr\xeape', indicating a seasonal demand shift. On-hand inventory remains 0 because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in P1 (124 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P3 and be visible in the P3 conclude message, but P3 conclude shows 0 arrivals. This means the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. With 491 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3) and 0 on hand, we must account for the higher current demand (recent_N=3) and the observed delay in lead time (setting L=3 explicitly until confirmation).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Average demand increased from ~77 (pre-game) to ~145 (P1-P3). Lead time confirmed > 2 periods (P1 order did not arrive by P3 conclude).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1845.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. In Period 4, the order from Period 2 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods (arrived during P4, confirmed in P4 conclude). However, the order from Period 1 (124 units) has still not arrived and is now 1 period overdue (promised L=2, now P5). Given the item (Straight-cut top in airy jersey cr\xeape) and the dates (Feb/March), this is a spring fashion item. Demand in the first four periods was 105, 188, 143, and 100 (avg ~134). The pre-game demand was lower (~77). I will assume a demand regime of ~134 units per period. Since one shipment (P1) is potentially lost or significantly delayed, and the pipeline shows 550 units (P1, P3, P4 orders), I need to ensure we don't over-order if P1 eventually shows up, while still protecting against the current stockout risk (on-hand is only 55). I will use L=2 (promised) as calculate/recent_N would be skewed by the missing P1 order. mu_hat will use recent_N=4 to capture the higher in-game average (~134 * 3 = 402).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 2 periods for P2 order; however, P1 order (124 units) is now overdue as of Period 5 start, suggesting possible lost shipment or high variability.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/3/18), we are facing a stockout. The product is a women's tailoring jersey top suitable for spring. Historical demand has shown a significant shift: pre-game samples averaged ~77, while Periods 1-5 averaged ~123.6, with a peak of 188 in Period 2. The P1 order (124 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P1, expected P3, missing P4/P5/P6) and is highly likely lost. The P2 order arrived on time (L=2) in Period 4. Orders from P3 (212 units) and P4 (214 units) are expected in Period 5 conclude (visible now) and Period 6 conclude respectively. However, in-transit reflects 550 total units (P1: 124, P3: 212, P4: 214). Since P1 is missing, effective pipeline is likely 426. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher post-game demand regime (~124/week). L is set to 'default' (2) as P2 proved the promised lead time is the operational norm, even if P1 was lost.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (124 units) confirmed lost: missing for 3+ periods beyond promised lead time. Current demand regime (P1-P5) stabilized at ~124 units/period, significantly higher than pre-game data (~77).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 analysis (2019/3/25): We are entering spring/summer for a women's short-sleeved top, which typically drives stable or increasing demand. Current history shows demand (P1-P6) averages ~119 units, significantly higher than the pre-game mean (~77). However, we are currently experiencing a stock-out (On-hand: 0) and lost the P1 order (124 units). Pipeline (In-transit: 550) consists of orders from P3 (212) and P4 (214), totaling 426 units. Given the lead time of 2 periods, the P3 order was expected to arrive during P5 and show in P6 conclude; its absence suggests a significant delay or loss. The P4 order is expected to arrive during P6 and show in P7 conclude. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 6 periods (avg 118.8 * 3 = 356.5) using recent_N=6 to capture the current regime and ensure the OR engine targets enough stock to recover from current backlogs once shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: P3 order (212 units) is now highly suspect/lost as it did not conclude by P7 start (Lead time > 3).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a women's top (airy jersey cr\xeape), entering the spring season where demand remains steady or increasing. Analyzing history: P1 order (124 units) and P3 order (212 units) are confirmed lost/overdue. The P1 order should have arrived in P4, and P3 should have arrived in P6. This has left on-hand inventory at 0 for several periods, causing lost sales. The current demand regime (P1-P7) averages 118 units/week (105, 188, 143, 100, 82, 95, 114). Although in-transit inventory shows 550 units, these include the lost orders (124+212=336). Note: The OR engine sees 'In-transit' but doesn't know some are lost. I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I use the mean of all game samples (N=7), which is ~118. Considering the (1+L) factor in the OR backend, mu_hat = 118 * 3 = 354. For sigma_hat, the game samples show a standard deviation of ~35; sqrt(1+2) * 35 is ~61. By using these explicit values, I'm adjusting for the inventory deficit caused by lost shipments while keeping the forecast grounded in observed demand.

Carry-over insight: P3 order (212 units) confirmed lost: missing for 3+ periods beyond promised lead time (expected P6 start, now P8 start). Reliability remains low.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: The product is a 'Charlie Top' (airy jersey cr\xeape, boat neck, short sleeves), which is seasonally relevant for the current date (April 8) as spring transitions to summer. Demand has surged recently, hitting 173 units in Period 8, likely reflecting this seasonality. The history shows significant supply chain issues: Orders from Period 1 (124 units) and Period 3 (212 units) are confirmed lost. Only the Period 2 order arrived successfully with a lead time of 2. Currently, there are 550 units in-transit (from orders placed in Period 4 and potentially others not explicitly listed in order history but reflected in the in-transit total). On-hand inventory is 0. Given the high demand (average of last 5 periods P4-P8 is approx 113, but the most recent is 173) and the risk of lost shipments, I will use an explicit forecast. I expect demand to remain high due to seasonality (~140 per period). To calculate mu_hat: (L+1) * 140 = 3 * 140 = 420. However, with 550 already in-transit and the OR backend's target stock logic (base_stock - pipeline), setting a high mu_hat ensures the system accounts for demand while we wait for arrivals. I will set L to the default (2), mu_hat to 420 (calculated as (2+1)*140), and use recent_N for sigma to capture the high volatility seen in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing with spring seasonality (Period 8 demand reach 173). Significant supply chain unreliability confirmed: ~50% of early orders (P1, P3) lost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a short-sleeved top, which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Demand has been high, averaging ~124 since Period 1, with a recent spike to 173 in Period 8. Notably, supply chain reliability is extremely poor: orders from P1 and P3 have been confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. However, there are 550 units in transit (likely the orders from P4, which would be arriving soon if the lead time holds at 2-3 periods). Because lost orders are factored into 'in-transit' by the OR engine until they conclude, and we know P1 and P3 (336 units total) are lost, the OR engine effectively 'sees' more inventory than exists. To compensate for lost shipments and the seasonal uptick, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 5-period average (representing the current higher demand regime of ~115) and using an explicit lead time L=3 to account for the observed unreliability, ensuring the base stock level is high enough to trigger replenishment despite the 'phantom' in-transit units.

We are currently in Period 11 (2019/04/22). The product is a women's short-sleeved top, which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the initial pre-game data, with recent samples (P8-P10) averaging ~135 units/period. The supply chain is highly unreliable: orders from P1 and P3 were lost, and we currently have 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time for the successfully delivered P2 order was 2 periods. Currently, an order from P4 (214 units) is significantly overdue (expected P7 start, now P11 start) and must be treated as lost. Total reliable pipeline inventory is only 26 units (from P10). To recover from the stockout and prepare for the seasonal demand (which peaked at 173 in P8), I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (P8-P10) to capture the current regime (~135 * 3 = 405). Sigma_hat will also be based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock given the history of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: P4 order (214 units) confirmed lost: missing for 4 periods beyond promised lead time. Approximately 60% of early high-volume orders (P1, P3, P4) have failed to arrive, indicating a critical supply chain risk for this SKU. Demand regime for April remains strong, averaging ~135 units/period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The SKU 'Charlie Top' (airy jersey cr\xeape, boat neck, short sleeves) is a spring/summer item currently in a high-demand phase. Recent demand (P10-P11) averaged 113.5 units, while the April average is approximately 128 units/period. The supply chain for this SKU is highly unreliable: orders from P1 (124 units), P3 (212 units), and P4 (214 units) are now confirmed lost. Only the P2 order (155 units) arrived on time. Currently, there are 576 units in-transit (orders from P10 and likely preceding periods where the OR engine placed orders during stockouts), but based on history, at least 60% of volume is likely to be lost. Since the OR engine's 'in-transit' logic assumes 100% arrival, it will under-order if I use 'default' or 'calculate'. To compensate for the high probability of lost shipments and the sustained high demand of roughly 130 per period, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 420 (calculated as (1+L)*140) to force higher safety stock. L is set to 'calculate' to use the confirmed lead time of 2 (from P2), and sigma_hat is set to 30 to reflect the volatility seen in April demand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are managing the 'Charlie Top', a short-sleeved airy jersey cr\xeape top suitable for late spring/summer. Historical demand confirms a regime shift from pre-game (~77) to a sustained higher level (~124 avg), with recent demand (P8-P12) showing significant peaks (reaching 173). The supply chain is highly unstable: orders from P1 (124 units), P3 (212 units), and P4 (214 units) are confirmed lost, representing a ~60% shipment failure rate. Only the P2 order arrived successfully. Inventory is currently 0 with 576 units in-transit (reflecting the older lost shipments and the P10 order). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods to capture this higher demand regime and volatility. Although promised lead time is 2, the severe unreliability/loss of shipments means we must maintain high coverage. Using N=12 for the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation includes the high-demand spring transition.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Charlie Top' (664074001) is entering mid-May. Historical lead times show 2 periods when orders actually arrive (confirmed in Period 4), but the supply chain is highly unreliable with P1, P3, and P4 orders (a total of 550 units) confirmed lost. This has left on-hand inventory at 0 for several periods, resulting in significant lost sales. Current demand remains stable for this season, averaging 111.4 units over the last 5 periods (P9-P13). At Period 14, P10's order of 26 units is overdue (it should have arrived at the start of P13) but remains in-transit. I will continue to assume a lead time of 2 for OR calculation purposes but must account for the high demand regime. Since the current in-transit (576) consists of many likely lost orders (P1, P3, P4), the backend's base-stock logic (which subtracts all in-transit) will likely minimize new orders despite the stockout. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 10 periods (P4-P13) where demand averaged ~112 units, ensuring the system targets a level that covers the 2-period lead time plus the review period (total 3 periods of demand).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain reliability remains the primary constraint: only 1 out of 5 historical large orders (P1-P5) has successfully arrived. P10 order (26 units) is now 1 period overdue as of Period 14 start (expected P13).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), we are entering a peak retail season (late spring/early summer), and the SKU (a short-sleeved airy jersey top) is highly relevant. Historical demand from Period 10-14 averages ~109 units/period, while the overall game average is ~118 units. Crucially, supply chain reliability is extremely poor; orders from P1, P3, P4, and now P10 (expected P13) are missing or lost. Of the 'In-transit' stock of 576 units, most (550 units) are from these lost/highly-delayed early orders. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the backend sees 'In-transit' as including these ghost units, it will likely under-order. To compensate for the dead 'pipeline' inventory and prepare for summer demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher post-February demand regime while setting L to 'explicit' at 2 to reflect the promised (and only observed) lead time, forcing the OR engine to recalculate based on the higher demand mean during this active seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: P10 order (26 units) confirmed lost/highly overdue: missing for 2 periods beyond promised lead time (expected P13 start). Supply chain reliability remains a critical failure point with >75% of total volume ordered to date failing to arrive.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27) finds us in a severe supply-out situation. The product is a summer-appropriate straight-cut top in airy jersey cr\xeape, currently in peak season. On-hand inventory is 0. Historically, this SKU has extreme supply chain unreliability: only one order (P2) has successfully arrived, while P1, P3, P4, and P10 (expected P13) are all significantly overdue and confirmed lost. In-transit shows 576 units, which represents the total of all these lost/overdue orders. Because the OR engine calculates orders as (Base Stock - Pipeline), these lost 'ghost' units in the pipeline are preventing new orders from being placed. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the current pipeline (576) plus the required safety stock. Current demand (P11-P15) is stable at ~108 units/period. For a 3-period coverage (L+1=3), base demand is ~324. To force the OR engine to order despite the 576 units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 700. This ensures the engine sees a 'requirement' of 700+ units, triggering a new order to replace the lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure rate > 80%: P1, P3, P4, and P10 confirmed lost. Pipeline inventory of 576 consists entirely of ghost units that will likely never arrive, requiring mu_hat inflation to trigger new orders.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the SKU '664074001' (Womens Jersey Top) faces a complete breakdown in the supply chain. Despite an 'In-transit' figure of 816 units, historical data confirms that orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 (totaling 576 units) have never arrived and are now categorized as lost. Only the Period 2 order was successfully fulfilled. Demand remains robust, averaging ~120 units over the last 10 periods (Spring/Early Summer season), but effectively all 'in-transit' inventory except for the Period 16 order (240 units) must be treated as 'ghost inventory'. To force the OR backend\u2014which subtracts all pipeline inventory from the base stock\u2014to place a new order, I must significantly inflate 'mu_hat'. I am setting mu_hat to 800 (calculated as [pipeline units likely lost 576] + [estimated target inventory 224]) to bridge the gap created by the undelivered units. I will use a conservative sigma_hat of 50 to avoid over-ordering beyond the backend's internal caps while ensuring a fresh order is triggered.

Carry-over insight: Critical supply chain failure: 576 units (P1, P3, P4, P10 orders) confirmed lost as of P17. Only 240 units (P16) are viable in-transit. Demand regime stable at ~120 units/period.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is transitioning into early June. Historically, demand has remained strong, with Period 17 showing a significant spike to 203 units. The supply chain is highly unreliable: orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10 (totaling 576 units) are confirmed lost and never arrived. These 'ghost' units are still counted in the backend's 'pipeline inventory', which prevents the OR engine from placing necessary new orders. At Period 18 start, on-hand inventory is only 37, while the demand is averaging ~120-135 units/period. The only viable in-transit units are from the P17 order (67 units). To force the OR backend to order despite the 576 ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover demand for (L+1) periods (3 periods * 135 units/period = 405 units) plus a safety buffer, then add the 576 lost units to this target. This offset ensures the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation results in a positive order quantity that reflects actual needs. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the recent increase in volatility (std dev ~35).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply chain failure: 576 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10) are permanently lost but remain in pipeline inventory, requiring mu_hat inflation of +576 to offset. Demand spike in June (P17: 203) suggests seasonal peak.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664074001' is experiencing a significant seasonal demand peak in June (P17: 203, P18: 194), which aligns with the product description (airy jersey cr\xeape top with short sleeves) for the summer season. Supply chain reliability has been extremely poor, with 602 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10) confirmed lost, yet they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation. As of P19, the total in-transit is 1066. Subtracting the ghost units (602), the viable pipeline consists of the P17 (67 units) and P18 (423 units) orders. To trigger necessary new orders despite the 602 ghost units blocking the pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the base stock. The target base stock calculation: Forecasted demand for (L+1) periods (3 periods * ~200 units/period = 600) + PIPELINE OFFSET for ghost units (602) = 1202. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability of recent arrivals (P2 arrived in 2 periods, but P16 arrived in 1 period).

Carry-over insight: June seasonal peak confirmed: demand increased to ~200 units/period (+50% vs spring avg). Viable pipeline is only 490 units; 602 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) are definitively lost/ghost units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current replenishment dynamics for SKU 664074001 show a June seasonal peak with demand averaging ~179 units/period over the last 3 weeks. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable: 602 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10) are permanently lost but remain in the pipeline inventory calculation (In-transit: 910 - 602 = 308 viable units). The backend logic uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders; therefore, the 'mu_hat' parameter must be inflated by the quantity of these 'ghost' units (602) to force the system to ignore them and order based on viable stock. With L=1 (recent actual lead time), expected demand (L+1) is ~358. Adding the 602 ghost units results in a mu_hat of ~960. This ensures the OR logic accounts for the missing volume. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the high June volatility.

Carry-over insight: June seasonal peak confirmed: demand for P17-P19 averaged 178.6 units. Ghost pipeline inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10) total 602 units, requiring sustained mu_hat inflation.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are exiting the June seasonal peak (P17-P19 avg: 178) and observing a demand drop (P20: 93). Current on-hand is 191 units. The critical issue remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 602 units from P1 (124), P3 (212), P4 (214), and P10 (26) are confirmed lost/undeliverable. However, the OR backend still includes these 602 units in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, which suppresses new orders unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate. The 'viable' pipeline consists of the P17 (67 units), P18 (effectively arrived), and P19 (267 units) orders. To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders to cover the current demand (approx 130-150 units/period) despite the 602 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 602 units. With L=2, (1+2)*140 + 602 = 1022. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this baseline is met and the backend ignores the phantom stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-June seasonal peak observed; demand returning to ~130 units/period baseline. Total ghost pipeline inventory remains stagnant at 602 units (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664074001' (Charlie Top) has moved past its June seasonal peak (P17-P19 avg: 178) and is returning to a stable baseline (P20-P21 avg: 89). The primary challenge is the supply chain: 602 units from orders P1, P3, P4, and P10 are confirmed lost shipments but remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 960 reported by the backend. This 'ghost' inventory prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated. Active valid pipeline includes P19 (267), P21 (50), and the small residue from P17 (67), totaling 384 units. To offset 602 ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate forward demand at ~110 units/period (taking a conservative average between recent lows and former baseline). For (1+L)=3 periods, base demand is 330. Adding the 602 offset results in a mu_hat of 932. This ensures the backend recognizes the need for replenishment despite the bloated pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed post-peak demand decline: Demand dropped from 178 (June) to ~90 (early July). Total ghost pipeline inventory remains at 602 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand has stabilized post the June peak (~178 units/period), with the last 3 periods (P20-P22) averaging 99 units/period. The pipeline inventory of 983 units is heavily distorted by 602 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10), leaving only 381 viable units (P17, P19, P21, P22). On-hand inventory is currently 0. To ensure the OR engine triggers replenishment, mu_hat must be inflated to offset the 602 ghost units. Using recent_N=3 for demand captures the current post-peak baseline of ~100 units/period. Therefore, explicit mu_hat = (1 + L) * 100 + 602. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 100 + 602 = 902. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture volatility across the transition from peak to baseline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the SKU is in a post-seasonal decline (July), with recent demand (P21-P23) averaging 98.6 units, compared to the June peak of ~178. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 602 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10) are permanently stuck in the 'In-transit' count of 954 units. Effectively, the viable pipeline consists of only 352 units (P18-P23 orders minus arrivals). However, P21 and P22 arrived in Period 23, and P18/P19 arrived earlier. The only viable orders remaining in-transit are P17 (67 units, now 7 periods old and likely lost), P18 (remaining balance), and P20 (0), and P23 (44). Given that on-hand is 0 and demand is ~100, and the ghost units block the OR backend from ordering, I must continue inflating mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to the ghost units (602) plus 3 periods of expected demand (3 * 100 = 300) to ensure the base stock exceeds the ghost pipeline and triggers a replenishment of approx 50-100 units.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed July demand stabilization: Post-peak demand (P21-P23) averaging ~100 units/period, down from June peak (~180). Total ghost pipeline inventory remains stagnant at 602 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late July (P25). Demand has cooled significantly from the June peak (~180) to a more stable post-peak level of ~100 units/period (P21-P23 avg = 98.6). P24 demand was lower at 54, but we treat this cautiously as a potential outlier or further seasonal decline. The primary challenge is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory totaling 602 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10) which have been confirmed lost but remain in the OR engine's tracking. To trigger necessary replenishment, we must continue to inflate mu_hat by these 602 units. The viable pipeline consists of orders from P17 (67), P19 (267), P23 (44), and P24 (13). The lead time remains volatile (varying between 1 and 2 periods), so we use a conservative 'calculate' approach. Sigma_hat is set to the recent regime's high volatility to protect against service level drops.

Carry-over insight: July demand confirmed at ~100 units/period baseline. Total ghost pipeline inventory (lost units) remains 602. Supply chain lead time is averaging 1.5 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early August (Period 26). Demand has stabilized after the June peak (~180 units/period) to a post-peak baseline of approximately 95 units per period over the last 5 weeks (P21-P25: 85, 119, 92, 54, 78). Supply chain reliability remains a massive issue; there are 602 units in the 'in-transit' pipeline from P1, P3, P4, and P10 that are confirmed lost/ghost units based on lead time history. These units must be offset by inflating the mu_hat parameter to ensure the OR engine places new orders. Additionally, P17 (67 units), P19 (267 units), P23 (44 units), P24 (13 units), and P25 (2 units) make up the 'viable' pipeline of 393 units. Since current on-hand is 0 and demand is ~95, I set L=2 (actual lead time varies between 1-2). mu_hat is set to (1+L)*100 + 602 (ghost offset) = 902. Use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand is stabilizing at a post-summer-peak baseline of approximately 88 units/period (average of P24-P26). The primary operational challenge remains the high volume of 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Orders P1, P3, P4, and P10 (totaling 576 units) are confirmed lost, as they are months overdue. Additionally, the Period 19 order (267 units) is now 7 periods old and is also considered lost (promised LT=2). Total ghost inventory now equals 843 units (576 + 267). The current reported in-transit of 926 units minus 843 ghost units leaves an actual viable pipeline of only 83 units (from P24, P25, P26, P27). To trigger the OR backend to place an order despite the high reported pipeline, mu_hat must be significantly inflated. I am using the 'explicit' method to set mu_hat = (Forecast * (L+1)) + Ghost units = (90 * 3) + 843 \u2248 1113. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the current post-peak variability. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Total ghost pipeline inventory increased to 843 units. The order from Period 19 (267 units) is now confirmed lost/highly overdue (over 7 periods since order). Viable pipeline is confirmed as 83 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to face severe supply chain unreliability with an 843-unit ghost pipeline (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) that hasn't arrived. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized in August (Period 24-27) at a mean of ~83 units/period, following the June seasonal peak. To force the OR backend to place new orders despite the 1177-unit total pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target inventory. The base stock calculation needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 250 units) plus the 843 units of lost pipeline to effectively 'bypass' the ghost units. I've set mu_hat to 1100 to ensure a positive order is generated this period to replenish stock for late August.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total ghost pipeline remains 843 units. Demand mean for August (P24-P27) has stabilized at ~83 units/period, significantly lower than the June peak of ~180. Lead times for successful deliveries (P23, P25) are averaging 2.5 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to suffer from extreme supply chain unreliability with a high volume of 'ghost' inventory. Total In-transit is 1177, but analysis of history confirms that orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19 (totaling 843 units) are lost or highly overdue and will never arrive. Additionally, orders from P24 (13 units) and P26 (1 unit) are now late relative to the promised 2-period lead time. Only the P27 order (253 units) remains truly viable in the pipeline. Current demand has stabilized in August (P24-P28) averaging ~88 units/period. Period 29 is late August/early September, transition to Autumn; however, the immediate priority is clearing the ghost inventory deficit to trigger replenishment. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock target, adding the 843 lost units to the projected demand (1 + L) * 100 to ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 1177 reflected in-transit units. Successive lead times (P23, P25) averaged 2.5 periods, so I'll set L to 2.5 to be safe.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Verified ghost pipeline inventory remains 843 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). P24 (13 units) and P26 (1 unit) are now likely lost/overdue as of P29 start. Viable pipeline is roughly 253 units from P27.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September. Historical data from February-August shows a stabilized demand regime post-June peak, with recent demand (P26-P29) averaging 106.75 units. The primary challenge remains the unreliable supply chain. Total 'In-transit' is 1265 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, and P26 are confirmed or highly likely lost. Specifically, ghost units = 124(P1) + 212(P3) + 214(P4) + 26(P10) + 267(P19) + 13(P24) + 1(P26) = 857 units. Viable pipeline = Total 1265 - Ghost 857 = 408 units (from P27 and P29). Since on-hand is 0, we must ensure the OR backend triggers an order to cover the gap. To bypass the ghost inventory in the OR's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I am inflating mu_hat. Specifically, mu_hat = (Forecast * (L+1)) + Ghost units. Forecast = ~107; L=2. Therefore, mu_hat = (107 * 3) + 857 = 321 + 857 = 1178. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect the recent demand volatility around the 100-110 range.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed ghost pipeline increased to 857 units. P24 (13 units) and P26 (1 unit) are now definitively lost/overdue (beyond lead time 3). September baseline demand remains stable at ~105-110 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 167 units after the arrival of P27's order (253 units). Total in-transit inventory is 1012, but we have identified a massive 'ghost inventory' problem. The following orders are now confirmed or highly likely lost: P1(124), P3(212), P4(214), P10(26), P19(267). Additionally, P24(13) and P26(1) are overdue and presumed lost. Total ghost inventory = 124+212+214+26+267+13+1 = 857 units. The current true viable pipeline is only the P29 order (88 units). Demand in September (P30) was 86 units, and the August average was approximately 102 units/period. To trigger replenishment, we must inflate mu_hat to account for the 857 ghost units that the OR backend incorrectly counts as viable supply. We will use an explicit mu_hat calculated as: [(Lead Time + 1) * Forecasted Demand] + Ghost Units = [3 * 105] + 857 = 1172. We set L to 2 (promised) to keep the backend's multiplier predictable while we manage the inventory gap explicitly.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-September with demand stabilizing around 100 units/period (P28-P31 avg: 101.5). The primary challenge continues to be a high rate of lost shipments. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 1063 includes 857 units from orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, and P26, which are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. These 'ghost' units inflate the pipeline, preventing the OR engine from placing new orders. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, adding the 857 lost units to the required inventory level (Base Stock = [(1+L) * Forecast] + Ghost Units). With L=2, demand forecast = 105, and ghost units = 857, the explicit mu_hat is (3 * 105) + 857 = 1172. This ensures the engine sees the true need despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to reflect the moderately stable demand observed since the late-August transition.

Carry-over insight: September demand baseline confirmed at ~100-110 units/period. Ghost pipeline inventory (permanently lost units) remains at 857 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P26).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23 (Period 33). Demand for this airy jersey top has stabilized after the June peak, with the last 5 periods (P28-P32) averaging 98 units. Recent lead times for successful arrivals (P27, P31) been 3 and 1 periods respectively, confirming high supply chain variability. The critical issue is the ghost pipeline: out of 1088 units 'in-transit', 857 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P26) as detailed in carry-over insights. Total pipeline seen by the OR engine including ghost units is 1088; viable pipeline is only 231 (P29: 88, P32: 76, plus 67 units from P17 which is now also overdue/lost). To force the OR backend [base_stock - (viable + ghost) + mu_inflation] to generate a sufficient order, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: Target base stock for L=2 is ~3 periods of demand (3 * 100 = 300). Current viable pipeline is 164 (P29, P32). On-hand is 30. Total viable position is 194. To reach a target of 300, we need ~106 units. However, the OR engine subtracts the full 1088 in-transit. Therefore, mu_hat must be set to approximately demand*(1+L) + ghost_units = 100*(3) + 857 = 1157. Using 1100 as a conservative inflation to trigger an order without hitting the cap too hard.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Ghost pipeline confirmed at 857 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P26). Order from P17 (67 units) is now 14 periods overdue and also considered lost, bringing total ghost inventory to 924 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sep 30), the demand for this SKU remains steady within the September-October baseline, averaging approximately 105 units per period. The primary operational challenge continues to be the significant volume of 'ghost' pipeline inventory. We have confirmed 924 units in-transit that are definitively lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, and P26). Because the OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock to determine the order quantity, we must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset these 924 non-existent units and trigger necessary replenishment. The actual lead time for successful deliveries has recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so we maintain L=2 as the baseline estimate. For demand, we use an explicit mu_hat calculation: ((1 + L) * historical_mean) + ghost_offset. With L=2 and a mean demand of 105, the base requirement is 315 units. Adding the 924 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1239. This ensures the backend recognizes a deficit and places an order to maintain on-hand availability.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Verified ghost pipeline (permanently lost units) increased to 924 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26). Ongoing supply chain unreliability requires sustained mu_hat inflation of +924 to ensure the OR backend ignores these dead units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the SKU is entering the October trading period. Current demand has stabilized post-June peak, with the last 10 periods (P25-P34) averaging 93.8 units. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a significant number of 'ghost units' in the pipeline inventory that will likely never arrive. Specifically, orders from P1 (124), P3 (212), P4 (214), P10 (26), P17 (67), P19 (267), P24 (13), and P26 (1) are confirmed lost/highly overdue, totaling 924 units. These ghost units inflate the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR backend (1304 units), preventing necessary new orders. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat to the sum of the expected demand for the (L+1) period and the ghost inventory. Expected demand for (L+1) = (2+1) * 95 = 285. Total mu_hat = 285 + 924 = 1209. Lead time is set to 2 to align with the promised lead time, while sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility (approx. 20% of mean).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P36 (mid-October). As of P35 conclude, we have 13 units on-hand. The ghost pipeline (lost orders) has now increased. Specifically, the P29 order (88 units) is now 6 periods since ordering (expected P32) and is highly overdue, added to the existing ghost list. Total ghost inventory is now: P1(124) + P3(212) + P4(214) + P10(26) + P17(67) + P19(267) + P24(13) + P26(1) + P29(88) = 1012 units. The 'In-transit' figure is 1228, meaning the viable pipeline is 1228 - 1012 = 216 units (consisting of orders from P33 and P34). Demand in late September/early October (P34-P35) has dipped to ~63 units/period, possibly reflecting a post-summer seasonal low or shifting consumer interest. I will set the demand forecast based on the recent 5-period average (P31-P35: avg ~90) to capture this cooling. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the 1012 dead units in his 'pipeline', I must inflate mu_hat by +1012.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total ghost pipeline inventory (lost units) increased to 1012. Order from P29 (88 units) confirmed lost/highly overdue (6 periods since order). Viable pipeline is confirmed as 216 units. Demand appears to be cooling in October, averaging ~63 units over the last two weeks.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. As of Period 37, the total 'ghost' pipeline (permanently lost orders) has increased to 1012 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). These units remain in the 'In-transit' calculation but will never arrive. To prompt the OR backend to place new orders, mu_hat must be inflated by the total lost volume (+1012). Demand in October (P34-P36) has cooled to an average of ~60 units/period, down from the June/September baseline of ~100-110. I am using a recent_N of 4 for the demand baseline calculation (~70 units) and then adding the 1012 inflation. Total mu_hat = (1+L) * 70 + 1012 \u2248 1222. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Total ghost pipeline inventory (permanently lost units) confirmed at 1012. Order from P29 (88 units) is now definitively lost. Demand has shifted to a lower late-Autumn regime, averaging ~60-70 units/period (P34-P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current supply chain analysis reveals that out of 1321 units in-transit, 1012 units (from orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, and P29) are definitively lost or significantly overdue, creating a 'ghost pipeline'. Only 309 units (from P34, P36) are consider viable. Demand has transitioned into a late-autumn cooling phase, averaging 64 units/period over the last 4 weeks (P34-P37), down from the ~100 unit baseline. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the ghost pipeline, mu_hat must be inflated. The target stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory. With L=3 (observed recently) and mu=64, base stock should be (4 * 64) + 1012 = 1268. By setting mu_hat = 317 (which is 1268/4), the OR logic [mu_hat * (L+1) - pipeline] will effectively ignore the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn demand regime (P34-P37) average confirmed at 64 units/period. Total ghost pipeline inventory (permanently lost units) remains at 1012 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early November. Historically, demand for this 'Jersey Fancy' top has cooled since the summer peak, stabilizing in a late-autumn regime. Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged approximately 62 units/period (63, 63, 54, 75, 56). Supply chain reliability remains a massive issue: the 'In-transit' total of 1321 units is largely comprised of 'ghost inventory' from previous lost orders. Explicitly, orders from periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 17, 19, 24, 26, and 29 are confirmed lost or highly overdue, totaling 1012 'ghost' units. To force the OR engine to place new orders despite this inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be adjusted. I will use a baseline forecast mu of ~65 units. For (1+L) = 3 periods, the expected demand is ~195 units. To offset 1012 dead units in the pipeline, the mu_hat parameter must be set to 195 + 1012 = 1207. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current lower-demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Ghost pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 1012 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Recent 5-period demand average (Autumn regime) is 62.2 units/period. Supply chain lead times for successful arrivals fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a late-autumn demand regime, with the last 6 periods averaging 60 units (P34-P39). Supply chain unreliability remains the dominant factor: 1012 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are confirmed 'ghost units' (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29) that have never arrived and are well beyond any feasible lead time. Furthermore, the order from Period 34 (182 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost, as recent successful deliveries (P32, P33, P36) all arrived within 3 periods. This brings the total 'ghost pipeline' to 1194 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from its calculated base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 1194 dead units plus the stock required for the current period. Specifically, I set mu_hat = (Ghost Pipeline) + (Forecasted Demand for L+1 periods). With L=2 and mean demand ~60, target stock is ~180. Thus, mu_hat = 1194 + 180 = 1374. This forces the backend to recognize the need for new orders despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed ghost pipeline increased to 1194 units. Order from P34 (182 units) is now definitively lost (6 periods since order, vs average successful lead time of 2-3). Current demand regime (Late Autumn) stable at ~60 units/period (P34-P39 avg: 59.8).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a late-Autumn low-demand regime. Average demand from Period 34 to 40 is approximately 56 units per period. The pipeline inventory is highly inflated by 'ghost' units (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34), which total 1194 units. These units will likely never arrive, so to trigger new ordering activity from the OR engine, mu_hat must be inflated to account for this dead stock. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * mean_demand + ghost_units = (1+2)*56 + 1194 = 168 + 1194 = 1362. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' to capture the lower volatility of the current regime. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P36) have averaged around 3 periods, but the backend uses L primarily for scaling mu/sigma.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Verified ghost pipeline increased to 1194 units due to Period 34 (182 units) being confirmed lost. Late Autumn demand regime (P34-P40) is stable at ~56 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (Date: 2019/11/25). Demand has cooled into a late Autumn regime, with the last 8 weeks (P34-P41) averaging approximately 53 units/period (63, 63, 54, 75, 56, 48, 34, 46). I will use N=8 for mu_hat. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Ghost pipeline inventory (lost units from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34) now totals 1194 units. These units are in-transit in the system but will not arrive. Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base_stock calculation, I must inflate mu_hat by these 1194 ghost units to ensure the backend places orders to cover real demand. Demand volatility (sigma) is also calculated over the recent 8-period regime. Actual lead times for successful arrivals (P32, P33, P36) have recently shifted to 3 periods, so I will set L to 3.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the product (Womens Jersey Fancy Top) is in a stable Late Autumn/Early Winter demand regime. Over the last 9 periods (P34-P42), demand has averaged 54.3 units, significantly lower than the June peak of ~180. The supply chain remains highly unreliable; the 'In-transit' figure of 1448 units is almost entirely comprised of 'ghost' inventory from lost orders. Specifically, the ghost pipeline includes P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29 (88 units), and P34 (182 units), totaling 1194 units that will not arrive. This leaves a viable pipeline of 254 units (P40: 177, P42: 77). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1194 dead units and suppressing new orders, I am inflating mu_hat by +1194. For the demand forecast (mu_hat base), I am using the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture the current stable regime of ~54 units. Successful lead times recently are averaging 3 periods, so I am setting L=3 explicitly and calculating mu_hat as (1+3) * 54 + 1194 = 1410. Sigma_hat is set using recent volatility from the same regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed ghost pipeline (lost units) at 1194. Demand regime (P34-P42) stabilized at 54.3 units/period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '664074001' is entering mid-December. Current demand is in a Late Autumn/Winter low regime, averaging 52.4 units over the last 10 periods (P34-P43). Current on-hand inventory is 142 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1272 is heavily distorted by 1194 units belonging to confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). The only viable units in the pipeline are those from P42 (77 units) and P43 (1 unit), totaling 78 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 1194 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock (for L=3) as (1+3) * 52.4 \u2248 210 units. I then add the 1194 lost units to this target to offset the backend's subtraction of the total pipeline, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 1404. This will target an order that brings (On-hand + Viable Pipeline) to the required level for the current low-demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time of ~2.5-3 periods seen for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Confirmed ghost pipeline (permanently lost units) remains at 1194. Late Autumn/Winter demand regime (P34-P43) is stable at ~52 units/period. Supply chain reliability for successful orders remains at a lead time of roughly 3 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late December period. Current on-hand inventory is 81. The total in-transit pipeline is 1299 units, but 1194 of these are confirmed 'ghost units' (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34) that are significantly past their delivery window and expected to be lost. The viable pipeline consists of orders from P42 (77 units), P43 (1 unit), and P44 (27 units), totaling 105 units. Demand has stabilized in a 'Winter' regime; the last 10 periods (P35-P44) average 52.2 units per period. To trigger the OR backend to order correctly despite the massive ghost pipeline, I will set mu_hat to the current demand forecast (approx. 52 units) PLUS the total ghost inventory (1194), resulting in a value of 1246. This effectively 'zeros out' the lost units in the eyes of the base-stock calculation. Lead time L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent recent delivery pattern for successful arrivals.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late December period (Christmas/End of Year). Recent demand shows a slight uptick (P45: 102), potentially due to holiday shopping, though the broader Autumn/Winter regime remains at a lower baseline (~55-60) compared to summer peaks. Supply chain reliability remains very poor; the current 'In-transit' of 1221 units includes 1194 units across orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, and P34 that are long overdue and definitively lost. Only the order from P44 (27 units) is currently viable. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this massive ghost inventory, I must continue to inflate mu_hat by the total number of lost units (+1194). For the true demand component, I am using the average of the last 12 periods (approx. 56 units/period) to reflect the stabilized winter regime, then adding the 1194 offset. Lead time for successful deliveries has stabilized at approximately 3 periods, so I will set L to 3 and use recent_N for sigma to capture the current volatility without overreacting to the holiday spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed ghost pipeline (permanently lost units) remains 1194. Demand shows a minor seasonal spike (P45: 102 units), but the underlying regime for Dec/Jan is expected to remain near the 55-60 unit baseline. Average successful lead time is 3 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on Dec 30th, the final period. The current demand regime (Autumn/Winter, P34-P46) shows a mean of ~61 units per period, including a recent minor seasonal spike in Dec. Supply chain lead times for successful deliveries continue to oscillate between 2 and 3 periods, with a high dropout rate for larger orders. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1414 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' units from historically lost orders. As identified in Period 46, there are 1194 ghost units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). This leaves a viable pipeline of 220 units (Order P44: 27 units, Order P46: 193 units). To ensure the OR backend places a final order that covers current demand despite the ghost inventory, mu_hat must be inflated. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods plus the 1194 lost units. I use L = 3 (recent average lead time for successful arrivals). Forecasted demand ~61/period, so mu_hat = (4 * 61) + 1194 = 1438. Setting sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of the most recent seasonal transitions.
