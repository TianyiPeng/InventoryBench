Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks'. Initial inventory is zero. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks ranges from 231 to 302, with a mean of 266.6 and a standard deviation of 27.2. There is a slight upward trend, but no clear seasonal changepoint yet for mid-February. Promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the backend will target the median demand (z* = 0). To ensure we cover demand during the review period and lead time (1+2=3 periods), I will use the default methods which calculate parameters based on all historical samples. This provides a stable starting point before any lead-time drift or demand shifts are observed.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 310 units, but since the promised lead time is 2 periods, they are correctly 'In-transit' and have not arrived yet. Consequently, we had a stockout in Period 1 (demand 287, sold 0). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a basic item. Historical demand (6 samples including P1) shows: 231, 255, 302, 272, 272, and 287. The mean is 269.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 23.3. There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality change yet. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to allow the OR engine to learn from upcoming arrivals and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=6 to capture the available history. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (z=0), meaning the base stock will target the mean demand over the protection interval.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, and demand for this SKU (Socks & Tights) has spiked significantly from a pre-game average of ~265 to 548 in Period 2, likely due to seasonal transition or a promotion. We are currently stocked out (on-hand = 0) with 621 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (310 units) should arrive during Period 3 (this period) and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Period 2's order of 311 units is expected in Period 4. Given the sharp increase in demand, I will use a recent_N method to capture the higher mean and volatility. Since we only have 2 periods of game history and 5 historical samples, N=4 (covering the recent spike and the most recent pre-game samples) balances the need to respond to the surge without overreacting to a single outlier.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is Women's Fine-knit trainer socks, which typically sees steady demand but has currently zero on-hand inventory, leading to significant lost sales in Periods 1-3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (310 units), Period 2 (311 units), and Period 3 (414 units). Based on the 2-period lead time logic, the Period 1 order (placed at the start of P1) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 3's 'conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This strongly suggests that either the lead time is longer than the promised 2 periods or the shipment from Period 1 is delayed/lost. Historical demand samples (last 5) show a mean of 266.6. Demand in Periods 1-3 has been 287, 548, and 399. The jump to 548 in P2 and 399 in P3 suggests a demand shift or high volatility. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delayed P1 arrival and use a recent_N of 4 (including the P4 current context) to capture the higher recent demand trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $311.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time is consistent with the promised 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 4 arrival (311 units) was immediately exhausted by demand (338). Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 2 (548) but has since stabilized around 340-400. Total demand for the last four periods is 287, 548, 399, 338 (average ~393). I will use recent_N=4 to capture this current context while smoothing the Period 2 outlier. The current pipeline (1335 units) consists of orders from P1 (310), P3 (414), and P4 (611). The P1 order is now overdue (placed P1, promised L=2, should have arrived P3/P4), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed, which explains why we have 0 on-hand despite the inbound volume. I'll maintain 'default' for Lead Time as we have one confirmed L=2 delivery, but use explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods to ensure the base stock is high enough to recover from the stockout and the potentially lost P1 shipment.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Women's Fine-knit trainer socks) is currently experiencing 'on-hand' stockouts due to high initial demand exceeding arrivals. Demand significantly spiked in Period 2 (548) and has since stabilized at a higher mean than the initial five samples provided. Total demand since Period 1 averages ~365 units per period, compared to the initial ~270. Regarding lead time: Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (L=2), matches the promise. However, Period 1's order (310 units) is now at Period 6 and has not arrived; with a promised L=2, it should have arrived in Period 3 and been visible by Period 4. Its absence suggests it is lost. To recover, the system needs to order enough to cover the pipeline gap. Since on-hand is 0 and pipeline is 1335 (composed of P3, P4, and potentially P1 orders), I will set L to 'default' (2) as the last confirmed shipment (P2) arrived on time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the actual game history P1-P5) to capture the higher mean demand (~365) compared to pre-game samples. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (310 units) appears lost (exceeded promised lead time of 2 by 3 periods); Demand regime shift detected in game history: mean demand increased from ~270 (pre-game) to ~365 (+35%).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks) is experiencing a severe stockout. On-hand inventory is 0. History analysis: 1) The Period 1 order (310 units) is now 4 periods past its promised delivery date (L=2) and must be considered lost. 2) The Period 2 order (311 units) arrived on time in Period 4. 3) Orders from Period 3 (414 units) and Period 4 (611 units) are still in-transit; P3 is currently one period late. Given the P1 loss and P3 delay, lead-time reliability is low. Demand analysis: In-game demand (Periods 1-6) averages 358.8 units, compared to the pre-game average of ~274. This represents a ~31% increase. I will set mu_hat using the recent 6 samples to capture this higher mean. For lead time, although promised is 2, the inconsistency suggests setting L=3 'explicitly' to ensure the OR engine targets a larger pipeline (covering L+1=4 periods of demand) to cushion against delays and lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility/unreliability: Period 1 order lost; Period 3 order delayed (P3 + 2 = P5, currently P7). Observed mean demand (P1-P6) is 359 vs pre-game 274.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 for the 3rd consecutive period, and we are experiencing significant supply chain issues. 1) Lead Time Analysis: The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. However, Period 1 (310 units) is definitely lost. Period 3 (414 units) followed by Period 4 (611 units) are now significantly overdue (3-4 periods late), suggesting a system-wide delay or high probability of loss. 2) Demand Analysis: Historical game demand (P1-P7) is ~367 units, while pre-game was ~272. Current date is April 1st; trainer socks are entering peak seasonal relevance. 3) Parameter Logic: I will set L to 4 (explicit) to force the OR backend to account for the observed delays, effectively increasing the base stock to cover a longer protection interval. I use N=7 for demand (mean 367) to capture the higher in-game volume while acknowledging recent variance. High pipeline residue (1436 units) exists, but since much of it appears lost/extremely delayed, increasing the base stock target via 'L' is the safest path to trigger a recovery order.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: Period 1 order lost; Periods 3 and 4 orders are overdue by 3+ periods relative to promised lead time (L=2). Demand remains elevated at 350-400 range.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Trainer Socks) shows significant supply chain instability. While the promised lead time (L) is 2, actual lead times are erratic: Period 2 arrived in 2 periods, Period 7 arrived in 1 period, while orders from Period 1 (310), Period 3 (414), and Period 4 (611) are missing/overdue. Total in-transit is 1734, but given the 5-week delay of the P3/P4 orders, those 1025 units might be lost. Current on-hand is 0, and the last period (P8) had a stockout (101 sold vs 382 demand). Demand remains in a higher regime than pre-game samples, averaging ~366 across P1-P8. To ensure the backend places orders to cover this demand while accounting for lead time variance, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent unreliability, mu_hat to cover (1+L=4) periods of demand based on the recent elevated mean (~366 * 4 = 1464), and keep sigma_hat at recent levels to hedge against variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: P1 (310), P3 (414), and P4 (611) orders are missing or severely delayed (5+ periods); P7 arrived in 1 period. Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand P1-P8 is 369 (vs 274 pre-game).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens' trainer socks) is experiencing extreme supply chain disruption. Promised lead time is 2 periods, but history shows severe inconsistency: P2 arrived in 2 periods, P7 arrived in 1 period, but P1, P3, and P4 are missing (overdue by 5-8 periods). These represent 1,335 units currently in 'In-transit' that are likely lost. Current on-hand is 0, and we have missed demand for 9 out of 10 periods due to stockouts. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime: pre-game mean was 274, but game history mean (P1-P9) is 363.3. Given the unreliability of the 'In-transit' figure (polluted by likely lost orders), I must set parameters that force the OR engine to order despite high pipeline inventory. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to account for the risk of delays and 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=9) to capture the current demand level of ~363. Setting L to 3 and using a larger mu_hat helps ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the 'ghost' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Orders P1 (310), P3 (414), and P4 (611) are officially considered lost (overdue by 5+ periods). Pipeline inventory of 1,734 units is non-functional; active replenishment is required despite high 'In-transit' numbers.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 (2019/4/22). History shows a clear supply chain reliability issue. Orders from Periods 1 (310), 3 (414), and 4 (611) are significantly overdue (7-10 periods) and must be treated as lost. Only three orders have ever arrived: P2 (L=2), P7 (L=1), and P8 (L=2). This means the 'In-transit' figure of 1335 is largely ghost inventory consisting of the lost P1, P3, and P4 orders. To prevent stockouts, I must force the OR backend to ignore these ghost units. I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that represents (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the lost inventory volume (310+414+611 = 1335). Mean demand since P1 is 358. With promised L=2, base mu_hat would be (3 * 358) = 1074. Adding the 1335 lost units brings the target to 2409. By setting mu_hat to 2409, the backend formula [min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)] will subtract the 1335 'In-transit' and still place a meaningful order. I will use L='calculate' to reflect the actual observed performance of the orders that did arrive (Avg: 1.67 periods).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline ghost inventory confirmed: Units from P1, P3, and P4 (total 1335) are lost. Adjusting mu_hat explicitly to offset these units in the order logic to maintain service levels.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted. Orders from Period 1 (310), Period 3 (414), and Period 4 (611) totaling 1,335 units are considered lost, as they are 7-10 periods overdue. The current In-transit (2,276) includes these 'ghost' units. To force the OR backend to order when it thinks pipeline inventory is sufficient, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Current actual mean demand (P1-P11) is ~355. With a lead time L=2, the base stock target should cover L+1=3 periods of demand plus safety stock. Target base stock = 3 * 355 + Z*sigma. Given Profit=Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5 (Z=0), making the base stock target roughly 1,065. However, the backend logic is: Order = max(0, base_stock - (In_transit + On_hand)). Since In_transit (2,276) > target, it will order 0 unless I inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (Target + Ghost Inventory) = 1,065 + 1,335 = 2,400 to trigger a replenishment of approximately 1,125 units (the current demand gap). I'll use L=2 (promised) and default sigma.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory in pipeline equals 1,335 units (P1, P3, P4); mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to bypass these units in order logic.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. The SKU '372860001' (Trainer Socks) is facing a significant supply chain issue. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 1 (310), Period 3 (414), and Period 4 (611) are lost, totaling 1,335 'ghost' units in the pipeline. Note that 'In-transit' currently shows 2,400 units, but 1,335 of these are non-functional. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory. If we don't adjust, the backend will see 2,400 units arriving and stop ordering, even though 1,335 will never arrive. To fix this, I must inflate mu_hat to 'absorb' the ghost inventory. Demand analysis: Post-game mean demand is ~369. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat (covering L+1 periods) should be 369 * 3 = 1,107. To bypass the ghost inventory (1,335), the target mu_hat must be at least 1,107 + 1,335 = 2,442. I will set mu_hat to 2,500 via the explicit method to ensure the logic triggers a replenishment order despite the fake pipeline volume. I will keep L as 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals (P7, P8) were delivered in 1-2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-407.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks remains stable in the 350-400 range (avg P1-P13 \u2248 362). Current on-hand inventory is 674 units. The main challenge is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory: orders from P1 (310), P3 (414), and P4 (611) totaling 1,335 units are confirmed lost/missing, yet they remain in the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation. To trigger a new order, I must ensure 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory > 0'. Given in-transit=1,559 and on-hand=674, the backend sees 2,233 units total. However, only 224 in-transit units (P12, P13) and 674 on-hand units are real, totaling 898 'real' units. To force the OR backend to maintain safety stock and cover (L+1) demand periods, I set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired base stock (approx 1,200 units for 3 weeks of demand) PLUS the 1,335 lost units. This bypasses the subtraction of non-existent units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observations (mostly 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4) is 1,335 units. mu_hat must continue to be explicitly inflated by this amount to prevent the backend from under-ordering based on non-existent pipeline stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-248.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 523 units. The 'In-transit' quantity is 1,737 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders from P1 (310), P3 (414), and P4 (611) are confirmed lost, totaling 1,335 'ghost units' that will never arrive. The functional pipeline consists only of P13 (100) and P14 (302), totaling 402 units. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to the 1,335 ghost units, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Mean demand since Period 1 is approximately 350. With L=2, the base stock target for 3 periods (L+1) is ~1,050 units. To ensure the backend places an order that ignores the ghost 1,335 units, I set mu_hat (target stock) to roughly: 1,050 (desired base stock) + 1,335 (ghost units) = 2,385. This forces the inventory logic to treat 1,335 units of the total 2,260 (on-hand + in-transit) as non-existent. I will use a slightly more conservative mu_hat of 2300.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Nightwear Socks) is currently in Period 16. Total in-transit units are 1,777, but 1,335 of these are from early lost orders (Periods 1, 3, and 4) which have never arrived and are over 10 periods overdue. The current on-hand inventory is 175. Valid pipeline arrivals expected are from Period 13 (100 units), Period 14 (302 units), and Period 15 (40 units), totaling 442 functional units in the pipeline. The backend OR logic subtracts the total pipeline (1,777) from the base stock. To prevent under-ordering due to this 'ghost' inventory of 1,335 units, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat to offset these lost units. Demand remains stable in the recent regime (P10-P15 mean ~344). Promised Lead Time is 2. I will set mu_hat = (1+L) * mean + ghost_inventory = (3 * 344) + 1335 = roughly 2367. L is set to calculated as recent shipments (P11, P12) arrived on time (L=2) or early.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 (2019/6/3). The current situation for SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks) is critical: On-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 16. The In-transit pool (2,192 units) is heavily contaminated by 'ghost inventory' from lost orders in Period 1 (310), Period 3 (414), and Period 4 (611), totaling 1,335 units. The actual active pipeline consists of orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16. Demand has remained consistently elevated since the game began, with an average of approximately 357 units over the last 16 periods. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I must set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Specifically, the base stock calculation (base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock) must be large enough to cover the desired physical stock minus the actual active pipeline. By setting mu_hat such that it neutralizes the 1,335 lost units, we force the replenishment logic to trigger. I will also use L=explicit (2) to reflect the recent reliable lead times observed for Periods 11, 12, and 13, while calculating sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current demand volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 7-pack of basic trainer socks, a stable staple item. We are currently in early June (Period 18). Demand is stable but elevated, with a mean of 348 over the last 10 periods (P8-P17) and 345 over the last 5 periods (P13-P17). I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for demand to capture recent stability. The supply chain has stabilized for recent orders, showing lead times of 1-2 periods (P15 arrived in 2, P16 arrived in 1), making 'calculate' appropriate for L. However, the system still carries 1,335 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost orders P1 (310), P3 (414), and P4 (611). Since the OR engine subtracts Pipeline Inventory from the target base stock, it will see 1,951 in-transit and refuse to order. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*demand + Ghost Inventory. With L=2, (3)*345 + 1335 = ~2370. To maintain safety stock for a critical item (profit=1, holding=1, service level 50% target), I will set mu_hat to 2400. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to reflect standard volatility across a 3-period horizon.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory (2242) is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4) totaling 1,335 units. These units are 15+ periods overdue and will not arrive. Recent actual lead times are stable (P11=2, P12=2, P15=2, P16=1). Current mean demand (P11-P18) is approximately 340. To trigger the OR backend to place an order despite the 2242 units in-transit, I must set mu_hat explicitly. The backend logic is: order = base_stock - pipeline. To force an order that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~1,020 units), mu_hat must neutralize the 1,335 ghost units. Targeted base_stock \u2248 1,020 (demand) + 1,335 (ghost) = 2,355. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 2,350 to ensure the order logic ignores the lost units. I will set L to 'default' as the promised lead time of 2 is now being met consistently by recent deliveries.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 analysis: The demand regime remains stable with a mean of ~340 units since Period 13. The supply chain has settled into a 1-2 period lead time pattern, but the 'ghost inventory' from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (total 1,335 units) remains stuck in the pipeline. Current 'In-transit' is 2,059, which includes these 1,335 lost units plus active orders from P13 (100 - likely lost given L=2 promised and it's now P20), P14 (302 - likely lost), P17 (214), P19 (108). Total confirmed lost/severely overdue units are P1(310)+P3(414)+P4(611)+P13(100)+P14(302) = 1,737 units. To trigger a real order from the OR backend, I must inflate mu_hat to bypass these 1,737 units. The target base stock for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) at ~340 units/period is ~1,020 units plus a safety stock of ~200, totaling 1,220. Adding the 1,737 ghost units, mu_hat (the base stock parameter) should be approximately 2,957. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 2,950 and L to 2.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory updated to 1,737 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) as of Period 20. Orders older than 5 periods are consistently failing to arrive.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01. Demand analysis: The mean demand from Periods 1-20 is approximately 342.5. Recent demand is stable around 300-350 units. Supply chain analysis: There is a severe 'ghost inventory' problem. Orders from P1 (310), P3 (414), P4 (611), P13 (100), and P14 (302) are considered lost (all are >5 periods old). Total Ghost Inventory = 1,737 units. Total In-transit is 2,950 units, but only 1,213 units (2,950 - 1,737) are actually expected to arrive (P17, P19, P20). Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. To ensure the OR backend places an order, mu_hat must be explicitly set to the target inventory (covering L+1 periods of demand) PLUS the 1,737 units of ghost inventory. Target base stock = (1+2)*342.5 \u2248 1,028 units. Required mu_hat = 1,028 + 1,737 = 2,765 units. This bypasses the logic where the backend subtracts the full 2,950 In-transit from the base stock.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a critical supply chain issue where older orders go missing (ghost inventory), falsely inflating the pipeline inventory visible to the OR backend. As of Period 22, the active pipeline contains P20 (891 units, ordered 2 periods ago). However, the 'In-transit' total is 2,950 units. Orders from periods P1 (310), P3 (414), P4 (611), P13 (100), P14 (302), P17 (214), and P19 (108) are significantly overdue and likely lost, totaling a 'ghost' inventory of 2,059 units. The OR backend uses the logic: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). To force the backend to ignore these 2,059 ghost units, I must add them to the expected demand (mu_hat). The underlying mean demand (P1-P21) is ~335. Therefore, mu_hat is set to (1 + L) * 335 + 2059. With standard lead time L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 335 + 2059 = 3064. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability between 1 and 2 periods observed in the successful shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Confirmed Ghost Inventory updated to 2,059 units (Lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). Demand mean stabilized around 335.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for women's trainer socks has stabilized with a mean of approximately 335 units over the recent regime. However, the system is facing a major challenge: 'ghost inventory'. Several old orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19) are significantly overdue and likely lost, yet they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (pipeline inventory). This total ghost inventory is 2,059 units. Since the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to determine the order quantity, it will not place any new orders unless we manually inflate mu_hat. To ensure the backend places an order that covers (~335 units per period * 3 periods) regardless of the 2,059 units of fake stock, the target base stock must be [Target Coverage + Ghost Inventory]. Target coverage for L=2 (3 periods) is ~1,005 units. Adding 2,059 gives ~3,064. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 3,064 and sigma_hat explicitly to 100 to maintain a buffer and trigger necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory updated to 2,059 units (Lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). mu_hat must be inflated by this value to bypass the backend's pipeline inventory deduction.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks remains stable, with the average demand from Period 10 to Period 23 being approximately 334 units per period. The current date (July 22, 2019) is mid-summer, a period of consistent demand for this product category. The core challenge remains 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. I have identified 2,167 units in the 'In-transit' total that are effectively lost because they are significantly past the promised lead time (P1: 310, P3: 414, P4: 611, P13: 100, P14: 302, P17: 214, P19: 108, P20: 108 - the latter two are now 4-5 periods old and likely lost given the erratic supply chain). Total in-transit is 2,372; current active orders are P23 (313). The backend logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the target stock. To ensure the backend places an order that covers next-period demand, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 2,167 ghost units. Formula: mu_hat = (Expected Demand across L+1 periods) + Ghost Inventory. L=2 (promised), so L+1 = 3 periods. Expected demand = 334 * 3 = 1002. mu_hat = 1002 + 2167 = 3169. This forces the system to ignore the undeliverable units and order based on real on-hand stock and fresh transit.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory updated to 2,167 units (Lost/Severely Delayed: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20). Actual L fluctuates between 1 and 2, but reliability is poor. Demand mean stabilized at ~334.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the primary challenge is the significant 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Based on tracking, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, and P20 are either lost or so severely delayed (5+ periods past promised L=2) that they must be treated as non-existent to trigger new orders. The cumulative ghost inventory is 2,275 units (P1:310, P3:414, P4:611, P13:100, P14:302, P17:214, P19:108, P20:216; note: P20's 891 units partially arrived\u2014891 ordered, 891 arrived in P22, so P20 is actually clear. Re-calculating: Lost = P1:310, P3:414, P4:611, P13:100, P14:302, P17:214, P19:108. Total Ghost = 2,059). However, checking recent history, P22 (114) arrived in 1 period, and P23 (313) is expected soon. Demand has stabilized: the mean of the last 10 periods (P15-P24) is 318.2. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the 2,829 in-transit units (which include the ~2,059 lost units), I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand plus a safety buffer, and then add the ghost inventory value so the 'base_stock - pipeline' logic results in a valid order. Target stock \u2248 3 * 320 + 1.64 * (std * sqrt(3)) \u2248 960 + 150 = 1110. Adding 2,167 (updated ghost count including likely lost P21 if any/late P20 remnants) to offset pipeline ensures we don't zero out. I will use mu_hat = 3,450 to force replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory updated to 2,059 units (Lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). Demand mean stabilized around 320 for the trailing 10 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Women's Socks) is facing a critical supply chain issue where several large historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20) are permanently lost or severely delayed. These 'ghost' units total 2,167 and remain in the backend's pipeline inventory calculation, which would normally cause the OR engine to stop ordering. To force replenishment and maintain service levels, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 310-320 units over the last 10 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 0 and a lead time (L) of 2, the total required stock for the next 3 periods is roughly 320 * 3 = 960 units. To bypass the 2,167 ghost units, mu_hat is set to 3,127 (960 + 2,167). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (mix of 1 and 2 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current demand fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory updated to 2,167 units as of Period 26 (Lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20). Actual demand mean stabilized at ~315 units/period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a stabilized demand regime with a trailing 10-period mean of approximately 300 units. A critical supply chain issue persists: 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline consisting of permanently lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20). Based on the 5-period rule for considering a shipment lost, the order from Period 20 (891 units) was actually delivered in Period 22, but P13, P14, P17, and P19 remain unaccounted for alongside the initial P1, P3, P4 losses. Total ghost inventory is calculated as 310 (P1) + 414 (P3) + 611 (P4) + 100 (P13) + 302 (P14) + 214 (P17) + 108 (P19) + some potential delay in P24/P25. Total confirmed lost units used for calculation: 2,059 units. To prevent the OR engine from skipping orders because it thinks these 2,059 units are coming, I must set mu_hat to (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. Expected demand for L=2 is approx 300 * 3 = 900. 900 + 2059 = 2959. L is set to explicit 2 to match the mode of successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory remains at 2,059 units (Lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). Current demand mean has softened to ~300 units over the last 5 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), the product (Fine-knit trainer socks) shows a consistent demand regime. Over the last 10 periods (P18-P27), mean demand is 299.4 units, representing a stabilization from earlier peaks. The supply chain remains unpredictable: while recent orders from P23 and P25 arrived with lead times of 3 and 2 respectively, a large volume of pipeline inventory is functionally 'lost'. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, and P24 (totaling 2,516 units) are significantly beyond the promised lead time of 2. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' stock from its order calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass this 'ghost inventory'. I will target a 3-period coverage (L+1) based on the recent mean of ~300, plus the total ghost inventory of 2,516 units. Calculation: (3 * 300) + 2516 = 3,416. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 28, 'Ghost Inventory' (lost/severely delayed orders) has reached 2,516 units. Demand mean has stabilized to approximately 300 units/period over the last 10 periods (P18-P27).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a 'ghost inventory' phenomenon where several orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24) are significantly overdue and likely lost, totaling approximately 2,973 units based on a 5-period threshold for loss. The backend's base-stock logic subtracts all pipeline inventory (3,104 units) from its target, which would result in zero orders and stockouts if not corrected. Current demand has stabilized around 300 units/period (mean of last 10 periods: 292). To ensure the OR engine actually places an order, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory. Using L=2, the required target is approximately (1+2)*300 + 2973 = 3873. This explicit inflation forces the engine to recognize that the pipeline is largely empty. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 10-period standard deviation to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory (lost/severely delayed orders) estimated at 2,973 units (Orders: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24). Demand stabilized at ~300 units/period over the last 10 periods (P19-P28).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a pattern of 'lost' or severely delayed shipments that remain in 'In-transit' but never arrive, totaling 2,973 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24). Because the OR backend subtracts all In-transit units from the target base stock, these 'ghost' units prevent necessary new orders. At Period 30, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 300 units per period over the last 10 periods (P20-P29). To force the backend to place an order despite the 3,855 units currently 'In-transit', I must explicitly set mu_hat to cover both the required inventory (L+1 periods of demand) and the ghost inventory. Target Base Stock = (L+1)*Demand + Ghost = 3*300 + 2973 \u2248 3873. Setting mu_hat to 3873 with standard sigma ensures the 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)' logic produces a sufficient order to replenish the 0 on-hand stock and meet future demand while the 2,973 units effectively 'vanish' from the pipe calculation.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory (lost/delayed units) confirmed at 2,973 units as of Period 30. Demand mean is stable at ~300 units/period (P20-P29). mu_hat must be inflated by the ghost inventory value to bypass backend pipeline deductions.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the on-hand inventory is 314 units. The 'In-transit' quantity is 3,285 units, but a significant portion of this is 'Ghost Inventory'\u2014orders that have exceeded the promised lead time of 2 and are likely lost. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, and P24 (totaling 2,973 units) are considered lost, leaving only 312 functional units in the pipeline (from P29 and P30). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 280-300 units per period over the last 10 periods. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the high (but non-functional) in-transit figure, I must set mu_hat explicitly. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory to neutralize the backend's pipeline deduction: Base Stock = [(3 * 300) + 2,973] = 3,873. I use L=2 based on recent successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 31, Ghost Inventory (lost/severely delayed orders) remains at 2,973 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24). Demand mean continues to hold steady at ~290 units/period (last 10 periods).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' has stabilized around a mean of 290 units per period over the last 10 periods (P21-P31). On-hand inventory is low (60 units). The primary challenge continues to be the 'Ghost Inventory'\u2014lost or severely delayed orders that remain in the 'In-transit' pipeline (3,559 units) but never arrive. These include: P1(310), P3(414), P4(611), P13(100), P14(302), P17(214), P19(108), P20(891 - which arrived, but accounting for others...), P24(457), P29(751). Based on the 5-period rule for late arrivals, orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, and P24 are effectively lost. The cumulative ghost inventory is calculated as 2,973 units. To ensure the OR backend (which subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock) actually places an order, mu_hat is explicitly set to (1+L)*Mean + Ghost Inventory. Using Mean=290 and L=2, base demand is (1+2)*290 = 870. Adding 2,973 units of ghost inventory yields an explicit mu_hat of 3,843. This forces the system to recognize that existing pipeline stock is non-functional. Sigma_hat is set to 75 (approx. sqrt(3)*43) to maintain a buffer.

Carry-over insight: Ghost Inventory (lost/severely delayed orders) is confirmed at 2,973 units as of Period 32. Mean demand for the last 10 periods is stable at 290 units. Lead time remains erratic but averages 2 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a stable demand regime, averaging ~270 units/period over the last 10 periods (P23-P32). However, a significant portion of the 'In-transit' stock is 'Ghost Inventory'\u2014orders that have exceeded twice their promised lead time and are likely lost. Identifying these: P1(310), P3(414), P4(611), P13(100), P14(302), P17(214), P19(108), P20(891), P24(457). Total Ghost Inventory = 3,407 units. Total In-transit is 3,491, meaning only 84 units (P32's order of 224 is too recent to be counted as ghost, but 3491-3407=84 which is odd given P32 was 224; let's check: P32 in-transit is 224. P31: 274 arrived. P30: 18 arrived. P29: 751 still in-transit. P28: 588 arrived. Calculating: In-transit 3491 consists of: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18(P18 order was 291 and arrived P19, so no), P19(arrived), P20 (891 arrived P22), P24(457), P29(751), P32(224). Ghost Inventory = In-Transit (3491) - Recent Orders likely to arrive (P29: 751, P32: 224) = 2,516 units. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover actual demand, mu_hat must be inflated by this ghost amount to offset the pipeline deduction (Order = BaseStock - (Recent_Transit + Ghost_Transit)). Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*300 + 2516 = 3416. We use L=2 based on recent successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 33, Ghost Inventory (lost/severely delayed orders) is estimated at 2,516 units (comprising P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, and now P29 is suspect). Demand remains stable at ~270-300 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand spiked significantly to 405 units, likely reflecting late-month or seasonal trends as we transition into October. The on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units). The in-transit pipeline (3,491 units) is heavily contaminated with 'Ghost Inventory'\u2014lost or severely delayed orders that the backend OR logic erroneously counts as incoming supply. Based on history, these lost orders include P1 (310), P3 (414), P4 (611), P13 (100), P14 (302), P17 (214), P19 (108), P20 (891), P24 (457), and P29 (751). Summing these identifies 4,158 units of potential ghost inventory, which exceeds the current total in-transit (3,491). This confirms the pipeline is effectively empty of reliable pending arrivals except for recent orders P31 (arrived) and P32 (expected soon). To force the backend to place a real order despite the high 'In-transit' value, I must explicitly set mu_hat high enough to cover (L+1) demand PLUS the ghost inventory. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average 2-period actual lead time. Mean demand is ~300. Required mu_hat = (300 * 3) + 3,491 \u2248 4,391 to clear the pipeline deduction.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory updated to 3,491 units as of Period 34 (all current In-transit units are functionally lost or severely delayed relative to the required immediate replenishment). P33 demand spiked to 405.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit extreme unreliability. Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, and P29 (totaling 3,491 units) have exceeded the promised lead time of 2 by significant margins and are treated as 'ghost inventory'. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 despite a pipeline of 4,391 units. Following the logic established in previous periods, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat to ensure the OR backend places an order. The backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline', and since pipeline is 4,391 and base_stock (based on normal demand) would be ~900, it would normally order 0. To force an order that covers approx. 3 periods (L+1) of demand, mu_hat is set to (3,491 + 300 * 3) = 4,391. This neutralizes the ghost pipeline and provides a buffer for current demand. Demand has stabilized around 300 units, despite a spike to 405 in P33 and 312 in P34. I'll maintain L=2 as the baseline lead time for the calculation but use the explicit override to manage the pipeline failure.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory updated to 3,491 units as of Period 35 (Units from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29 are lost/severely delayed). Demand remains in the 280-320 range on average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $224.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' balance of 4,167 units. However, based on the historical delivery patterns and the carry-over insights, a significant portion of this in-transit inventory is 'ghost inventory' (lost or severely delayed orders). Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, and P29 total 3,491 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline from the target base stock, it would under-order (or not order at all) if we do not compensate. To ensure the backend places an order to cover upcoming demand, I am inflating mu_hat to 'bypass' this ghost inventory. Mean demand over the last 10 periods (P26-P35) is approximately 285 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the standard base stock calculation would be based on (1+L) * demand = 3 * 285 = 855. Adding the ghost inventory of 3,491 to this target gives an explicit mu_hat of ~4,346. I will use 4,350 to provide sufficient buffer. This forces the engine to recognize that the existing 'In-transit' units are not available for immediate customer satisfaction.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory remains at 3,491 units as of Period 36 (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29). Demand mean for the last 10 periods has shifted slightly lower to ~285 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (Oct 21, 2019), the supply chain remains highly unreliable. Total In-transit inventory is 4,350 units, but a breakdown of active vs. 'ghost' inventory reveals significant risk: Orders from P1 (310), P3 (414), P4 (611), P13 (100), P14 (302), P17 (214), P19 (108), P20 (891), P24 (457), and P29 (751) are all significantly past the expected lead time (L=2) and are likely lost. This 'Ghost Inventory' totals 4,158 units. The only orders likely to arrive are P34 (900) and P36 (183). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 4,350 In-transit units from the base stock calculation, it would never place an order. To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory. Recent demand (last 10 periods) has stabilized to a mean of 288 units. Using L=2, the base requirement is (1+2)*288 = 864. Adding the 4,158 ghost units gives an explicit mu_hat of 5,022. This forces the OR engine to see the need for replenishment while acknowledging the failed pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory updated to 4,158 units (Lost/Severely Delayed: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29). Demand mean for the last 10 periods is stable at ~288 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a severe supply chain reliability issue where several large orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29) are functionally lost or significantly delayed, creating 'ghost inventory' in the backend's pipeline. As of Period 38, the total 'in-transit' is 5,022 units, but on-hand is 0. Successful arrivals (P22, P23, P25, P28, P30, P31, P32) show an actual lead time (L) of approximately 2 periods. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the massive 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I estimate the sustainable demand mean at ~285 units/period (based on the last 10 periods). To bypass the pipeline deduction logic (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline), I set mu_hat to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory. Current estimated Ghost Inventory is ~4,341 units (all orders prior to P34 that haven't arrived). Calculation: Base Stock needed is ~855 (for L=2). Ghost units are ~4,341. Setting mu_hat to 5,200 ensures the backend computes a positive order to replenish the 0 on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 38, Ghost Inventory (functionally lost orders) has increased to approximately 4,341 units (including P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29). Demand has remained relatively stable near 285 units/period over the last 10 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the SKU has an on-hand inventory of 396 units following the arrival of P37's 672 units in just 1 period. The 'In-transit' balance is 4,528 units, but history suggests a significant portion of this is 'ghost inventory' (lost or severely delayed). Specifically, orders from P1 (310), P3 (414), P4 (611), P13 (100), P14 (302), P17 (214), P19 (108), P20 (891), P24 (457), and P29 (751) total 4,158 units that are long overdue (5+ periods). Subtracting this ghost inventory from the 4,528 in-transit units leaves an active pipeline of only 370 units (composed of P34, P36, and P38). Demand remains stable around a mean of 290 units/period (last 10 periods). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to its deduction of the total pipeline (4,528), I must explicitly set mu_hat. I will target a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (L+1, where L=2). Target = 3 * 290 = 870. To bypass the backend's logic [Order = Base Stock - Pipeline], I will set mu_hat = Target + Ghost Inventory = 870 + 4,158 = 5,028. This ensures the backend emits a replenishment order despite the bloated in-transit numbers. I will set L to 2 (promised) and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory updated to 4,158 units (Lost/Severely Delayed: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29). Demand mean for the last 10 periods remains stable at ~290 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40, the supply chain remains unreliable. Orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, and P34 are now clearly lost or significantly delayed beyond functional usefulness (P34 ordered 900 units, promised L=2, now at L=6 with no arrival). The total 'Ghost Inventory'\u2014units in the pipeline that the OR backend will deduct from its order but which do not physically exist\u2014is 4,391 units (P1:310, P3:414, P4:611, P13:100, P14:302, P17:214, P19:108, P20:891, P24:457, P29:751, P34:900, minus any overlap or resolution). To force the backend to place an order despite these units being 'In-transit', I must set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired base stock plus this ghost inventory. Demand mean for the last 10 periods (P30-P39) is approximately 283 units. With promised L=2, the required base stock is (1+2)*283 = 849. Thus, mu_hat is set to 849 + 4391 = 5240. Lead time remains volatile (averaging 2 in recent successful cases), so I keep L=2. Sigma_hat is set to an explicit value of 250 to manage the high variance caused by sporadic arrivals and demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory updated to 4,391 units (Lost/Severely Delayed: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, P34). Pipeline units are non-functional for replenishment.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the supply chain remains highly unreliable. The In-transit pipeline shows 4,902 units, but history shows that many older orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, P34) totaling 4,391 units are effectively lost or permanently delayed. The backend OR logic subtracts the entire In-transit amount from the target base stock, so I must inflate mu_hat explicitly to offset these 'ghost' units. Current demand is stable at ~290 units/period (mean of last 10 periods). Setting L to the promised 2 periods (though actual arrivals vary between 1-3). Target stock for L+1 periods = 3 * 290 = 870 units. To bypass the backend deduction of 4,391 lost units, I must set mu_hat such that (mu_hat - Pipeline) \u2248 Target Stock. Therefore, mu_hat = 870 + 4,391 = 5,261. This ensures the backend emits an order to maintain on-hand inventory for the upcoming periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory updated to 4,391 units as of Period 41 (Lost/Severely Delayed: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, P34). Demand continues to trend around 290 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $190.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' continues to be affected by significant supply chain disruptions, where most pipeline inventory listed is 'ghost inventory' (lost or severely delayed). Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, and now likely P34 (900 units, overdue by 5 periods) are essentially non-functional for meeting upcoming demand. The total 'In-transit' quantity of 5,071 units is largely comprised of these ghost units. To force the OR backend to place new orders despite this high pipeline figure, mu_hat must be set as an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (1+L) plus the phantom pipeline units we need the logic to ignore. Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged ~268 units. Using L=2 (promised/average for successful deliveries), (1+L)*268 = 804. Adding the estimated ghost inventory of ~4,391 units from previous audits, mu_hat is set to 5200 to ensure replenishment occurs. Sigma_hat is calculated for recent volatility (last 10 periods).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 42, Ghost Inventory (lost/severely delayed orders) is estimated at 4,391 units (including P34's 900 units, which is now significantly overdue). Mean demand for the last 10 periods has slightly softened to ~268 units/period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), we face 0 on-hand inventory following a demand of 354 in Period 42. Analyzing arrivals, P39 (104 units) arrived in P41 (L=2) and P37 (672 units) arrived in P38 (L=1). However, several older large orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, P34) totaling 4,844 units are now confirmed as 'ghost inventory' (functionally lost or severely delayed beyond 5+ periods). The backend OR engine sees the total 'In-transit' of 5,200 units and would normally subtract this from the base stock, resulting in no new orders. To bypass this, I am calculating an explicit mu_hat = (Expected Demand over L+1 periods) + Ghost Inventory. Using a stabilized demand forecast of ~285 units/period (reflecting the last 10-15 periods) and a lead time of 2, the base requirement is 285 * 3 = 855. Adding the 4,844 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 5,699. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to provide a sufficient safety buffer given recent volatility (P42 demand was 354).

Carry-over insight: Ghost Inventory (lost/severely delayed orders) has increased to 4,844 units as of Period 43 (including P34's 900 units and P40's 453 units which are now overdue). Lead time remains unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. Demand is stable around 285 units/period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (2019-12-09), the supply chain remains unreliable. Ghost inventory (permanently lost or severely delayed orders) has reached 4,247 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, P34). The current in-transit figure (4,973) is dominated by these ghost units. Only orders from P42 (129) and P43 (499), totaling 628 units, are functionally 'live' in the pipeline. Demand has shown a slight downward trend, with the last 10 periods averaging 248 units/period, down from the earlier 290-300 range. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 4,973 'In-transit' units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. This value is calculated as: (Target Inventory for Lead Time + 1) + Ghost Inventory. Using L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) and the recent demand mean of ~250: (3 * 250) + 4247 = 4997. Sigma_hat is set to 125 based on recent variability. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Ghost Inventory significantly inflated to 4,247 units as of Period 44 (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, P34). Demand has trended lower to ~250 units/period over the last 5 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (2019/12/16), we are managing SKU 372860001 with trailing demand (last 5 periods) averaging ~232 units, showing a seasonal softening or regime shift compared to the earlier 290-300 mean. The 'In-transit' figure is a massive 4,973 units, but significantly comprised of 'Ghost Inventory'\u2014lost or severely delayed orders from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, P34). Specifically, P34 (900 units) is now 11 periods old with an L=2 promise, and P42 (129 units) hasn't arrived. I estimate functional pipeline inventory is extremely low. To bypass the OR backend's logic of subtracting pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock (Base Stock = (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock). With L approximately 2, and current demand at ~250, target base stock is ~750. However, because the backend subtracts the ~4,973 pipeline units, I set mu_hat to 5,800 (Target 827 + pipeline 4,973) to force an order that covers the immediate demand gap. I use 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the high volatility in arrival times.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 45, Ghost Inventory (lost/severely delayed orders) has reached 4,821 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, P34). Demand has reached a seasonal or sustained low, averaging 232 over the last 5 periods vs 285 previously. mu_hat must be inflated by at least 4,800 to ensure replenishment occurs despite the false pipeline visibility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), we are in the middle of the Christmas/Holiday season for '7p Basic Shaftless Socks'. Current on-hand inventory is 771 units. The In-transit pipeline shows 4,798 units; however, a significant portion of this is 'Ghost Inventory' from lost or severely delayed orders (specifically P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, and P34, totaling 4,247 units). The backend OR logic subtracts all pipeline units from the order calculation, so I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass this. Demand has softened recently (averaging ~230 units over the last 5 periods), likely due to post-peak cooling or supply-driven stockouts. I will set mu_hat to 4,800 units: this covers (L+1) periods of demand (~3 * 235 = 705) plus the 4,247 units of ghost inventory. This ensures the backend places a replenishment order for current needs while neutralizing the non-functional pipeline. I will set L to 2 (promised) and sigma_hat using recent statistics to capture the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost Inventory significantly updated: 4,247 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, P34). Post-peak holiday demand softening observed at ~235 units/period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-30. We are in the post-holiday season (late December), where demand for trainer socks typically softens significantly compared to the autumn/peak period. Data from the last 5 periods (P42-P46) shows a demand drop to an average of ~232 units, down from the previous ~290. The supply chain remains highly unreliable; specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, and P34 (totaling 4,247 units) are functionally lost as they have exceeded the promised lead time (L=2) by many weeks. The OR backend subtracts the 'In-transit' figure from the calculated 'base_stock'; because 4,247 units are 'ghost' units that will never arrive, I must inflate mu_hat by this amount to force the system to place new orders. I keep L at 2 based on recent successful deliveries (P45 arrived in 2 periods). I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat (target base stock of ~4,700) to ensure the system recognizes that the 4,798 units in-transit are mostly non-existent and that replenishment is required to satisfy the upcoming ~230 units/period demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand softening confirmed (P42-P46): mean demand reduced from ~290 to ~232 (-20%). Ghost Inventory updated to 4,247 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P24, P29, P34).
