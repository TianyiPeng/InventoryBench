Demand over the last 5 weeks (recorded as sample data) has been: 154, 119, 124, 88, 117. This averages approximately 120 units/week. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are currently 0, I need to place an order to cover the demand during the lead-time period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed today (P1) will arrive during P3 and be usable/visible at the start of P4. Therefore, I must cover demand for P1, P2, and P3 (L+1 periods).

Since this is a knitwear item, we expect demand to gradually taper as we move toward spring, though it remains relevant in late February. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, I ordered 360 units. Based on the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 arrives in Period 3 (P1 + 2) and will be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently (Period 2), I have 0 on-hand and 360 in-transit. I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 periods) before the next order placed today reaches inventory in Period 4. Total demand to cover: P2 (~80) + P3 (~80) + P4 (~75) = 235 units. The existing 360 units in-transit (set to arrive in P3) should cover this demand. Since I have 0 on-hand and a confirmed stockout in P1/P2 (until arrival), I want to avoid massive overstocking once it arrives. However, since the current inventory is 0 and the first shipment hasn't arrived, I will place a smaller follow-up order to maintain a rolling pipeline for P5/P6, assuming demand stays around 75-80 units/week.",

According to the lead-time definition, the P1 order (360 units) should arrive DURING Period 3 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start. My pipeline (on-hand 0 + in-transit 440) must cover demand for P3, P4, and P5 (L+1 periods). Expected demand for 3 periods is ~312 units (3 * 104). The current pipeline of 440 units is sufficient to cover this with a safety buffer.

Lead Time Analysis: Promised Lead Time is 2 periods. The P1 order of 360 units (placed Feb 11) should arrive DURING P3 and be visible in P3 conclude. Since P3 conclude shows arrived=0, and there is no confirmation of arrival, the P1 order is either delayed or the actual lead time is 3+ periods.

Since March (P5), demand has been 46, 46, 55, 52, and 23. The most recent period (23) suggests a further seasonal decline as temperatures rise.

Period 42 demand was 149, while the previous few periods hovered around 100. Given the date (Dec 2), we are in a high-demand window but likely past the initial autumn surge. On-hand inventory is 261. In-transit reflects 2420 units, but 1820 are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P26, P29, P34), leaving an effective pipeline of 600 units (P38: 250, P40: 200, P41: 150). The P38 order (250 units) is now at L=5 and is significantly overdue, suggesting it may also be lost. If we exclude P38, effective in-transit is 350. My target inventory for (L+1) periods (approx 3 weeks) at ~130 units/week is ~390 units. With 261 on-hand and 350 in reliable transit, I am well-covered for the immediate future. To avoid excessive holding costs as we likely approach the end of the peak season in the coming weeks, I will place a small order to maintain safety stock without over-committing.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Order P38 (250 units) is now likely LOST (ordered P38, today P43, lead time 5 periods vs promised 2). This brings total suspected lost units to 2070.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a soft, fine knit jumper, a seasonal item that typically peaks in mid-autumn (Sept-Oct) and maintains steady demand through early winter (Nov-Jan) before declining in spring. Current demand analysis: Period 42 showed 149 units (Black Friday effect) and Period 43 returned to a baseline of 71 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is approximately 102 units/period, but excluding the P42 spike, the underlying December demand seems to settle around 70-95 units. Inventory Assessment: On-hand inventory is 540 units. Pipeline check: In-transit is 2120 units. However, previous insights confirm that orders P1, P3, P26, P29, P34, and P38 (totaling 2070 units) are highly likely lost as they are significantly beyond the lead time. Actual effective in-transit is 2120 minus 2070 = 50 units (the P43 order). Therefore, Total Effective Pipeline = 540 (On-hand) + 50 (In-transit) = 590 units. With an estimated demand of ~90 units/period and a lead time of 2-3 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand, approximately 360 units. Current stock (590) is sufficient to cover the next 6+ periods of demand, even accounting for variability. Ordering more now would only increase holding costs unnecessarily as we approach the end of the game (Period 47). No order is placed.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a soft, fine-knit jumper, making it highly seasonal for autumn and winter. We are currently at Period 45 (Dec 16). Historical demand for this period and the start of the game (Jan/Feb) suggests high season demand ranging from 80-150 units, though the very recent trend (P43-44) shows a cooling to 60-70 units. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47), the primary objective is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs and capital lock-up. Current on-hand inventory is 480 units. Expected demand for the remaining 3 periods is approximately 180-240 units total (based on current 60/period avg). Additionally, there is a massive in-transit pipeline of 2120 units, largely consisting of 1820-2070 units that are confirmed or highly suspected as lost (P1, P3, P26, P29, P34, P38). Even excluding lost units, valid in-transit units from P43 (50 units) are expected to arrive in P45 or P46. Given the current 480 units on hand easily cover the maximum expected demand for the rest of the game, no further orders are required.",

  "rationale": "The product is a soft, fine knit jumper, highly seasonal for the autumn/winter period. We are currently at Period 46 (Dec 23), in the middle of winter. Demand has cooled from the Oct/Nov peak (which reached ~180-300) to a more stable December level (averaging ~63 units/period over P43-P45). World knowledge suggests that after Dec 25, there is often a post-holiday sales dip or a clearance phase before spring lines begin. The Current on-hand inventory is 471 units. Given the recent demand average of ~63, this covers approximately 7.5 periods of demand. Even with a safety stock buffer, current inventory is high relative to the cooling demand regime. The pipeline shows 2070 units 'in-transit', but historical carry-over insights confirm that at least 2070 units (P1, P3, P26, P29, P34, P38) are highly likely lost based on extreme delays compared to the promised 2-period lead time. No new orders have been placed since P43. With the current inventory of 471 units and the expected continued cooling of demand post-Christmas, there is no need to order more units, as we risk excessive holding costs for a seasonal item approaching the end of its peak season.",

Demand has been declining steadily from the Oct peak (~180) through Nov (~100) and Dec (averaging ~58 in the last 4 weeks). With on-hand inventory at 429 units and current demand around 50-60 units per period, the current stock covers approximately 7-8 weeks of sales. Given that demand for knitwear typically drops further in late winter/early spring (as seen in the earlier history where demand fell to ~10-20 units by April), we are heading into a period of high holding cost risk if we over-order. The pipeline is currently clear of live orders (confirmed lost: P1, P3, P26, P29, P34, P38).
