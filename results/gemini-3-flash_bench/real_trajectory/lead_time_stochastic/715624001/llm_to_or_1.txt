Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for SKU 715624001 shows a clear upward trend in the last two weeks: 215 (Jan 28) and 302 (Feb 04), compared to the earlier baseline of 22-53. This product (Becka hoodie) is likely entering a peak seasonal period as consumers look for comfortable jersey basics in early spring. The promised lead time is 2, so the coverage period is L+1 = 3 periods. Given the rapid increase in demand, a simple average of all data points (avg: 125) would severely under-forecast current needs. I am choosing a recent_N strategy (N=2) for demand to capture the current high-growth regime (avg of last two: 258.5) while allowing the OR engine to calculate the 3-period coverage. Sigma will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility of this higher demand level.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Becka hoodie', a jersey basic item. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 37, 22, 53, 215, 302, and now 131. Note that the Period 1 demand (131) was lower than the preceding weeks (215, 302), possibly due to stockouts (on-hand was 0). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 360 units placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive in Period 3 (arrival resolution phase) and be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 360 in-transit. Given the recent demand surge (averaging ~216 over the last 3 samples), I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. Since L=2, mu_hat represents (1+L) periods, so 3 * 216 = 648. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility seen in the transition from late January to February.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a basic hoodie. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: Jan 7 (37), Jan 14 (22), Jan 21 (53), Jan 28 (215), Feb 4 (302), and the most recent concluded periods (Feb 11, Feb 18) both had a steady demand of 131. This suggests a post-winter stabilization or a shift from the peak seen in late Jan/early Feb. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the orders from P1 and P2 (lead time 2) have not yet arrived. The order from P1 is scheduled to arrive during Period 3 and will be visible in the P3 conclude message. To calculate mu_hat, I will use the last 3 samples (302, 131, 131) to capture the recent stabilization. With L=2, the backend will compute mu_hat as (1+2) * mean(302, 131, 131) = 3 * 188 = 564. Sigma_hat is set to default to reflect the recent volatility accurately.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a jersey hoodie (Becka hoodie). Historical demand shows a significant jump starting late January/early February (215 on Jan 28, 302 on Feb 4), likely due to seasonal transition into spring where light sweatshirts are popular. However, recent demand reports for Period 1-3 (131, 131, 76) suggest a stabilization or slight cooling after the initial peak. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 856 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (360 units) should have arrived during Period 3 and been visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message if the lead time was exactly 2 periods. Since 'arrived=0' was reported for Period 3 conclude, the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or there is a 1-period buffer delay in reporting. Given the 'critical timing example' in the instructions, an order placed in Period 1 arrives DURING Period 3 and is visible in 'Period 3 conclude'. Since it didn't arrive, I must assume a slight delay or that the lead time is actually 3. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect this reality and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the recent high-volume regime (averaging ~170 over the last 5 samples) while accounting for the lower recent counts.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The Becka hoodie is a basic garment, but we see a significant demand spike in late January/early February (215 units on Jan 28, 302 on Feb 4) which has since subsided to lower levels (131, 131, 76, 48 in the last four weeks). This suggests a post-winter clearance or early spring transition peak that is now cooling off. Current on-hand is 311, with 617 in-transit. The order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2), but the order from Period 1 (360 units) has not yet been reported as arrived in any 'conclude' message, despite being past the promised lead time of 2. I suspect the Period 1 order might be delayed or potentially lost. Period 2's arrival suggests the lane is functional. For demand, the recent 4 samples show a clear downward trend (avg ~96). I will use recent_N=4 to capture this cooling demand regime to avoid over-ordering, while keeping lead time at 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead time of 2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a 'Becka hoodie', which typically sees high demand in winter/early spring, but starts to taper off as weather warms. Historical demand analysis: Early Jan (37-53), late Jan/early Feb (215-302) showed a major spike. However, the last 5 periods (P1-P5) show a significant downward trend: 131, 131, 76, 48, 49. It appears the seasonal peak for this basic jersey item has passed. Inventory Status: On-hand is 262. In-transit is 617, which includes the Period 1 order (360), Period 3 order (137), and Period 4 order (120). Note: Period 1 order (360) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P1, today is P6, promised L=2), suggesting a possible lost shipment or significant delay. Current Pipeline: 617 (in-transit) + 262 (on-hand) = 879 units. Given recent demand ~50/week, our current stock covers many months. We need to throttle ordering. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent low demand regime (~58 avg) and L=default (2).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Period 3: Average demand dropped from ~130 (P1-P2) to ~58 (P3-P5). Period 1 order (360 units) is overdue (5 weeks since order, promised L=2), potential lost shipment.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 7 (2019/03/25). Reviewing history, the shipment from Period 1 (360 units) is now 6 periods overdue, reinforcing the conclusion that it is a lost shipment. The shipment from Period 2 arrived on time in Period 4 (L=2). The shipment from Period 3 (137 units) was ordered with a promised L=2, so it was expected in Period 5, making it currently 2 periods overdue; it remains in-transit. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime: P3 (76), P4 (48), P5 (49), P6 (51). The average of the last 4 samples is 56. Given the current date (late March) and the product (Becka hoodie), we are likely moving out of deep winter into spring, which aligns with the observed demand drop compared to the initial samples. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 samples (N=4) to capture this new stable mean (~56 per period). L remains at the promised 2 periods for the OR backend, even though we are tracking potential losses manually in our risk assessment. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 4 samples to reflect lower volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 order (137 units) is now 2 periods overdue; combined with the P1 loss, this suggests a pattern of shipment reliability issues or extended actual lead times for this SKU.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the demand for the Becka hoodie has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 3, demand has been consistent with a mean of ~55 (48, 49, 51, 49). The seed data (late Jan/early Feb) showed much higher values (>200-300), which likely represented a post-winter clearance or seasonal peak that has now ended. Lead time observation is critical: Order P2 arrived with L=2, but Order P1 (360 units) and Order P3 (137 units) are significantly overdue (P1 is 7 weeks old, P3 is 5 weeks old), suggesting they are likely lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 162 with an in-transit pipeline of 617 (mostly comprised of the overdue/lost units). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new demand regime (approx 55/week) and keep L at default to monitor if the system can recover. The OR backend uses (1+L) * mean, so setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' will result in a base stock calculated against ~165-170 units (3 weeks * 55). Since current inventory (162) and pipeline (617) exceed this, the OR engine will likely order 0, which is appropriate given the high stock level and low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand from P4-P7 is 49.25 units/week. Shipping reliability issue confirmed: Orders from P1 and P3 are still missing as of P8 and should be considered lost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Demand for the 'Becka hoodie' has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 4, with the last 5 periods (P4-P8) showing a mean of 49.8 units (48, 49, 51, 49, 52). Orders from P1 (360 units) and P3 (137 units) are significantly overdue (8 and 6 periods respectively) compared to the promised lead time of 2; following the logic in Carry-over insights, these are treated as lost. Only the order from P4 (120 units) is considered active in the pipeline. Current on-hand is 110. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, we need to cover demand for L+1=3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~150 units. My current inventory position (On-hand 110 + P4 In-transit 120 = 230) safely covers this. I will set L to default (2), mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the stabilized low-demand regime, and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the low volatility (std \u2248 1.5) observed in this period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Demand for the 'Becka hoodie' has stabilized at a low-volume regime following a drop in early March. Calculating the mean from the last 6 periods (P4-P9), the average weekly demand is 49.83 units (48, 49, 51, 49, 52, 51). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Only one shipment (P2) has arrived successfully (L=2). Shipments from P1 (360 units), P3 (137 units), and P4 (120 units) are significantly overdue or missing; P1 is 8 periods overdue, P3 is 6, and P4 is 5. Given the promised L=2, these are increasingly likely to be lost or represent a severe break in the supply chain. On-hand inventory is 59 units, which barely covers one week's demand. To ensure continuity while accounting for the high likelihood of lost transit, I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand (capturing the stable lower regime) and 'default' for lead time (as the only successful arrival matched the promised L=2). Since 'In-transit' includes the likely lost 617 units (360+137+120), the backend's capped policy might prevent new orders unless mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the need for replacement stock. However, since the system counts all in-transit units, and I cannot manually subtract them, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to signal a high base stock requirement to overcome the 'phantom' pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Shipment reliability crisis confirmed; Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 617 units) are 5+ weeks overdue and likely lost. Demand remains stable at ~50 units/week.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/04/22), the 'Becka hoodie' continues to exhibit a stable demand regime of approximately 50 units/week (averaging 48.5 units over the last 7 periods, excluding the outliers in P1-P2). The shipment reliability crisis remains the primary operational concern. We have 617 units listed as 'In-transit', consisting of orders from P1 (360), P3 (137), and P4 (120). Given that the P1 order is now 10 weeks old (vs. promised L=2) and the P4 order is 7 weeks old, these must be treated as lost. The only order that arrived successfully was the P2 order (359 units) in P4, confirming an actual lead time of 2 periods when the system works. On-hand inventory is down to 40 units, which is below one week's average demand. Because the OR backend subtracts the 'pipeline_inventory' (617 lost units) from the base stock calculation, it will likely result in a zero order unless the base stock is set extraordinarily high. To override this and ensure a replenishment order is placed to prevent stockouts, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I am setting mu_hat = 150 (roughly 3 periods of demand at 50/wk) plus a buffer for the lost pipeline to trigger an order. I will maintain L at default (2) to reflect the demonstrated successful lead time from the P2 shipment.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/4/29), on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown a significant shift: from P4-P9, it was stable at ~50 units/week, but P10 saw a drop to 19, followed by a spike to 87 in P11 (averaging 53 over the last two weeks). The historical demand for this 'Becka hoodie' in late April/May 2019 (from the prompt samples) showed a massive jump from ~53 to 215 and then 302. This indicates a strong seasonal spring/summer peak for this hoodie SKU. Regarding logistics, shipments from P1, P3, and P4 are long overdue (9, 7, and 6 weeks respectively) and must be considered lost. The only valid pipeline inventory is the 165 units ordered in P11. To capture the upcoming seasonal spike while accounting for high logistics risk (lost shipments), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 600 (estimating a mean of ~200 over L+1 periods) and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure high service levels despite the volatility and previous system stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand surge confirmed for late April/May: demand increased from stable ~50 range to 87 in P11, aligning with historical jump to 200+ units in May. Order reliability remains poor; only P2 and P11 orders are considered viable in the pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is a hoodie, and we are entering the peak seasonal period corresponding to May (historical samples showed demand jumping to 215-302 in late Jan/early Feb, and similar surges are occurring now, with demand increasing from 87 in P11 to 129 in P12). Stock-outs have occurred due to a combination of this surge and a massive disruption in the supply chain (orders from P1, P3, and P4 are long overdue and confirmed lost; only P11 and P12 orders are reliable). On-hand inventory is 0. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate base-stock needs, but it includes the lost units (360 + 137 + 120 = 617 units). To force the backend to place an order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting 'mu_hat' to a very high 'explicit' value (800) for this week to bridge the gap and ensure a significant replenishment to cover the seasonal peak. I will use 'calculate' for lead time as the only successful delivery (P2) arrived in 2 periods (promised), and the other 'in-transit' units are likely lost rather than delayed.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge peaking in May: P12 demand reached 129, following historical pattern of 200+ units. Inventory deficit is acute due to 617 lost units (P1, P3, P4) still being counted by the OR backend as 'in-transit'.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (mid-May). Historical sales and the product description (Becka hoodie) indicate a strong seasonal demand phase (historically 200+ units in May). Recent demand from the last three periods (P11-P13) has averaged 94.67 units, showing a clear upward trend from the previous baseline of ~50. I will target a mu_hat based on the last 3 samples to capture this growth. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' figure of 794 units is highly misleading because it includes 617 units from P1, P3, and P4 which are significantly overdue (9+ weeks) and confirmed as lost (P2 and P11 arrived on schedule, suggesting shipments from those early weeks specifically went missing). To compensate for the OR backend subtracting this phantom pipeline from the order quantity, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 950. This value accounts for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~110 units/period (total 330) PLUS the 617 lost units (330+617=947) to force the solver to ignore the stuck pipeline and place a replenishment order for the coming peak.

Carry-over insight: Active demand peak: May demand is significantly higher than April, currently averaging ~95 units/week. Supply chain partition: Early orders (P1, P3, P4 totaling 617 units) are permanently lost; only orders from P11 onwards are reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1238.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-May peak for the Becka hoodie. Demand in the last four periods (P11-P14) has averaged 88.5 units/week (87, 129, 68, 70). While P13 and P14 were lower than P12, historical data for late May (samples 2019-01-28 and 2019-02-04, which represent similar transition points in the previous cycle) shows demand hitting 200-300 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 877 is highly misleading because 617 units from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline inventory is only 260 units (P13 order of 112 + P14 order of 148). Because the backend subtracts the full pipeline (877) from the base stock, it will not order enough units unless we artificially inflate the base stock parameters. To force an order that covers the May/June demand spike (approx. 200 units/week) and accounts for the 617 lost units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (Forecast Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units + Safety Stock. Forecast is ~180/week * 3 = 540. Lost units = 617. Total base stock needs to be ~1150+ to trigger a replenishment. Setting mu_hat to 1200.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time for successful deliveries (P11 and P12) remains 2 periods. The OR backend continues to over-calculate pipeline inventory due to the 617 lost units (P1, P3, P4), requiring manual base stock inflation via 'explicit' mu_hat.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are at the tail end of the May seasonal peak for the Becka hoodie. Historical demand showed a peak of ~215-302 units in late January/early February, followed by a lower stable period, and then a moderate climb in May (~70-129 units). The current 'In-transit' figure of 1515 units is severely inflated because it includes 617 units from lost shipments (P1: 360, P3: 137, P4: 120) that have not arrived and are over 10 periods overdue. The backend calculates base_stock - pipeline_inventory; with an artificial pipeline of 617, it will under-order unless we inflate mu_hat. Recent valid arrivals (P11, P12) confirm the lead time is still 2 periods. Demand has averaged ~87 over the last 5 weeks (May peak). To ensure sufficient stock for June while offsetting the 617-unit pipeline error, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. Target base stock = (Forecast Demand * (L+1)) + Pipeline Correction. Forecast = 85 units/week. Base stock target = (85 * 3) + 617 = 872. I will set mu_hat to 872/3 = ~290 per period (multiplied by 3 in backend) to ensure the system places orders despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination persists: 617 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost but remain in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation, necessitating 'explicit' mu_hat settings to force orders.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the status of SKU 715624001 is critical due to widespread stockouts despite a massive 'In-transit' balance of 1515 units. Historical analysis confirms that 617 units from early orders (P1, P3, P4) are permanently lost but still counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation. Recent delivery performance (P11, P12) confirms the actual lead time L=2 holds for successful shipments. Demand has stabilized after the May peak, with recent demand settling around 65-85 units (P12-P16, excluding a low of 64 in P16 when stock was depleted). To overcome the 617-unit pipeline ghost and trigger a replenishment order, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. The target base stock should cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) plus safety stock, around 350-400 units. Adding the 617 lost units to this target requires a mu_hat around 1000 units. This will signal the backend to order since (On-hand: 0 + Pipeline: 1515) is greater than the target, but since we are currently out of stock and demand is steady, a large order is needed to replenish after 450 units ordered in P13-P15 arrive. I am setting mu_hat = 1200 to ensure an order is generated despite the pipeline contamination.

Carry-over insight: Post-May seasonal stabilization: Demand for SKU 715624001 is returning to a stable range (~65-80 units/week) following the May peak. Pipeline contamination (617 lost units) remains the primary driver for OR parameter distortion.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10), demand for the Becka hoodie has stabilized following the May seasonal peak, with the last observed demand at 48 units. The 'On-hand' inventory is healthy at 590 units. However, the OR backend's 'Pipeline Inventory' is severely distorted by 617 units from Period 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost but still counted as in-transit (877 total in-transit minus the 112 from P13 and 148 from P14). Since Promised Lead Time L=2, the base stock formula target should cover 3 periods of demand (Period 18, 19, 20). Expected demand is ~60 units/week. Target Base Stock = 3 * 60 = 180. The backend sees: Position = 590 (on-hand) + 877 (phantom pipeline) = 1467. To avoid unnecessary ordering while maintaining a safety buffer, I will set mu_hat explicitly to keep the target base stock below the current perceived position, allowing the 590 units on-hand to satisfy demand for the next several periods while the recent orders (P13, P14) arrive.

Carry-over insight: Post-May stabilization: Demand has dropped from peak levels to ~50-60 range. 617 units from P1, P3, P4 remain in 'In-transit' indefinitely, distorting the backend pipeline calculation.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19 (2019/6/17), the SKU 715624001 (Becka hoodie) has left its May seasonal peak and settled into a stable demand regime of approximately 50-60 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 532 units, which is high compared to current demand. The In-transit figure of 877 units is heavily distorted by 617 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost but remain in the pipeline calculation. The remaining 260 visible 'in-transit' units likely correspond to orders from Periods 13 and 14 (112 and 148 units respectively), which are significantly overdue if they haven't arrived. However, since the current on-hand inventory (532) already covers approximately 9-10 weeks of current demand (~55 units/week), there is no immediate need to place new orders. To prevent the OR backend from ordering despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent stable demand (P17-P18). Although the backend subtracts the pipeline from the base stock, the high on-hand inventory (532) relative to the calculated base stock (approx 165 for 3 periods) will naturally result in zero ordered units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), demand for the Becka Hoodie has significantly cooled following the May seasonal peak. Recent demand (P19=18, P18=58, P17=48) suggests a post-peak stabilization around 40-50 units per week. The inventory position is currently high (on-hand = 514), which is more than sufficient to cover immediate demand and the 2-period lead time. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 877 is heavily distorted by 617 units from lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, and 4) which will never arrive but are still subtracted from the base stock by the OR backend. However, because on-hand inventory (514) is currently so high relative to recent demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set parameters to reflect the current lower demand regime (approx 50 units/week) while maintaining the explicit method to account for the pipeline contamination, ensuring the backend logic doesn't trigger unnecessary orders while we burn through existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: June demand has dropped significantly from May levels, averaging ~40 units/week over the last three periods (P17-P19). Pipeline contamination of 617 lost units persists.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), demand for the Becka hoodie has cooled significantly following the May seasonal peak. Demand over the last four periods (P17-P20) was 48, 58, 18, and 19 units respectively, averaging roughly 35.8 units/week. This suggests we are in a low-demand summer phase. On-hand inventory is high at 495 units. Additionally, the 'In-transit' figure of 877 units contains 617 units (from P1, P3, P4) that are confirmed lost but remain in the backend calculation. Recent successful deliveries (P11, P12, P15) maintain an actual lead time of 2 periods, consistent with the promised lead time. Given that current inventory (495 units) is more than sufficient to cover many weeks of demand at the current rate (approx. 35-40 units/week), I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the latest low-demand regime and prevent unnecessary ordering while the pipeline is still distorted by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand drop confirmed: June demand (P17-P20) plummeted to an average of ~36 units/week, down from May's peak of ~100. High on-hand inventory (495) combined with pipeline distortion (617 lost units) maintains a no-order status.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), the SKU is in a significant post-peak summer trough. Demand in Period 21 was higher (104) but the preceding four weeks (P17-P20) averaged only ~36 units/week. Even including the P21 spike, the 5-week average (P17-P21) is 49.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 391 units, which covers approximately 8 weeks of demand at the current average. Total in-transit inventory is reported as 877 units; however, 617 of these units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost, leaving a reachable pipeline of 260 units (P13: 112 units, P14: 148 units). Calculating the effective inventory: On-hand (391) + Viable Pipeline (260) = 651 units. Against an expected weekly demand of ~50, we have over 13 weeks of coverage. The OR backend's inclusion of the 617 lost units in its 'pipeline' remains a technical distortion, but the sheer volume of on-hand stock and viable pending arrivals makes ordering unnecessary and potentially costly due to holding fees. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current lower-demand regime while allowing for the recent P21 volatility, and set L to calculate to reflect the standard 2-period lead time observed for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (June-July) stabilized at ~50 units/week despite high Period 21 volatility. Effective inventory position (651 units) is extremely healthy relative to demand, rendering the 617-unit pipeline distortion (P1, P3, P4) secondary to the current overstock situation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3629.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we observed a massive and unexpected demand spike of 201 units, following a period of 104 units. This is a significant deviation from the summer average of ~36-50 units seen in June/July (P17-P20). While the Becka hoodie is a sweatshirt and typically sees peaks in colder months or late spring, this mid-July surge suggests either a clearance event, a summer sale, or a specific trend spike. Current on-hand inventory is 190. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 877 is heavily contaminated by 617 lost units (Orders from P1, P3, P4). This leaves only 260 viable units in the pipeline (Orders from P13 and P14, though these are now significantly overdue, they were never officially confirmed lost like the early batch). If we assume those P13/P14 orders are also compromised given their age (>8 weeks), the effective inventory is just the on-hand 190. However, the backend sees 190 (OH) + 877 (IT) = 1067 units. With demand spiking to 200, we must adjust parameters to ensure availability if this high demand level persists. I will use 'recent_2' for mu_hat to capture this sudden surge (Avg = (104+201)/2 = 152.5) and 'recent_2' for sigma to reflect the high volatility (152.5 units/week across L+1=3 periods = 457.5). Despite the pipeline distortion, the OR backend's inventory position of 1067 will still likely prevent a new order until the target base stock exceeds that number.

Carry-over insight: Significant mid-July demand spike detected: Demand increased from avg ~40 (P17-P20) to 152.5 (P21-P22), a 3x increase. Pipeline contamination of 617 lost units (P1, P3, P4) persists and likely now includes P13 (112) and P14 (148) which are 8+ weeks overdue, totaling 877 potentially lost units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a mid-July demand spike for the Becka hoodie, with Period 23 sales reaching 199 (stockout), following demands of 201 and 104 in previous weeks. The demand average for the last three periods is ~168 units/week. On-hand inventory is now 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 877 reflects shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 which are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods and are likely lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 877 'In-transit' units from its base stock calculation to determine orders, it will never place an order unless we provide an 'explicit' mu_hat that exceeds this phantom pipeline. To cover demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) at the current rate of ~168 units/week, we need a base stock of roughly 550-600 units. To force the OR backend to order meaningful quantities while it still believes 877 units are coming, we must set mu_hat (which acts as the base stock target) to a value higher than 877 plus our desired safety stock. Setting mu_hat to 1350 is intended to overcome the 877-unit deficit and signal an order of roughly 450-500 units to replenish inventory for the ongoing summer surge.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand spike confirmed: Demand avg for P21-P23 is ~168 units/week (vs ~40 previously). Total likely lost shipments increased to 877 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14), creating extreme inventory distortion.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant demand spike in July, with Period 21-23 averaging 168 units/week. While Period 24 demand dropped to 66, this is likely due to out-of-stock conditions or volatility rather than a return to the summer low. The primary challenge remains the OR backend's 'pipeline contamination'. The system shows 1419 units 'In-transit', but history indicates multiple lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 (877 units total). These units will never arrive but prevent the backend from ordering because it believes they cover future demand. With On-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time of 2 periods, we are losing sales. I am using 'explicit' mu_hat set to 1800 to force the backend to place a large order, effectively bypassing the 1419 units of phantom inventory to ensure new stock is dispatched. L remains at the promised 2 periods for successful recent deliveries (e.g., P15 order).

Carry-over insight: July demand spike continues to distort inventory needs; actual pipeline is effectively zero due to 877 units of cumulative lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Demand in P21-23 averaged ~168 units/week.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory, despite a major mid-summer demand surge (P21-P23 averaged ~168 units/week, though P24-P25 dipped, likely due to availability). The 'In-transit' figure of 2031 is highly misleading due to cumulative lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 totaling 877 units). Subtracting these lost units leaves a corrected pipeline of 1154 units (P15, P24, P25). However, P15 (638 units) was ordered 10 weeks ago and is clearly lost as well, bringing the total lost units to 1515. The true active pipeline consists only of P24 (542) and P25 (612), totaling 1154 units. With demand entering August, we expect sustained interest. My goal is to force the OR backend to order by setting an explicit mu_hat that exceeds the ghost 'In-transit' inventory. I will aim for a base stock levels that account for current demand (~100-150/week) while offsetting the ~1.5k units of lost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative shipment loss confirmed: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and now P15 (ordered 10 weeks ago, promised 2) are confirmed lost, totaling 1515 units of 'ghost' inventory. Only orders from P24 onwards (1154 units) are viable pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-08-12. Demand for SKU 715624001 remains high (August typically aligns with 'Back to School' prep for hoodies), with the last three periods averaging ~128 units/week. However, the inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the OR backend's 'In-transit' calculation of 2362 units is heavily distorted by 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P15 (totaling 1515 units) are confirmed lost based on the 2-period promised lead time vs. actual months of delay. Only orders from P24 (542 units), P25 (612 units), and P26 (331 units) are viable pipeline inventory (totaling 1485 units). Since lead time is 2, the P24 order is expected to arrive during P27 and be visible in P28. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 2362-unit inflated pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' high enough using the 'explicit' method. To cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) at ~130 units/week while accounting for the ~1515 unit 'ghost' deficit, the effective base stock needs to exceed 2000 units. I am setting mu_hat to 2300 to force an order that bridges the gap until the P24-P26 arrivals stabilize on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand surge confirmed in August: Demand P24-P26 averaged ~128 units/week. Cumulative lost shipments ('ghost inventory') officially updated to 1515 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15), causing severe OR backend pipeline distortion.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 28 (2019/08/19). We are in a high-demand Back-to-School season for this hoodie SKU, with Period 27 demand spiking to 322 units. The 3-period average (P25-P27) is 213 units. Pipeline inventory is severely distorted by 1,515 'ghost' units from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15). Currently, the OR backend sees 'In-transit' as 1873, but the actual viable pipeline is only 996 (P24, P26, P27). Note: P25 arrived in P27. The P24 order (542 units) is now 1 period overdue (ordered P24, promised L=2, should have arrived P26 conclude/P27 start), suggesting a potential delay or loss. To compensate for the 1,515 ghost units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a base stock that triggers an order. To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at ~215/week plus a safety buffer, I target a base stock of roughly 2500 units. Since OR uses (base_stock - pipelines), and pipeline is 1873, mu_hat = 2500 will result in a net order to replenish the gap and maintain service levels during this volatile peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: P24 order (542 units) is 1 period overdue, potentially increasing 'ghost inventory' from 1515 to 2057 units. Current peak demand regime (Aug) confirmed at ~215 units/week.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the late August Back-to-School demand peak. Observations from P27 and P28 show demand fluctuating significantly (322 in P27, 83 in P28), with a moving average of approximately 200 units/week over the last three weeks. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Specifically, 2057 units are now considered 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost: P1: 360, P3: 137, P4: 120, P13: 112, P14: 148, P15: 638, and now highly suspect P24: 542 which is 2 periods overdue). The OR backend sees 'In-transit: 2493', but only P26 (331), P27 (123), and P28 (620) totaling 1074 units are actually viable. With 207 on-hand and 1074 viable in-transit, we have 1281 actual units against a backend perception of 2600+. To force a necessary restock during this peak, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for (L+1)=3 periods at 210 units/week (Total 630) and add the 2057 lost units to the base stock calculation to offset the backend's pipeline subtraction, resulting in a mu_hat of 2687. Lead time remains set to 'calculate' to use historical successful delivery data (L=2).

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) increased to 2057 units following the non-arrival of the P24 order (542 units), which is now 2 periods overdue beyond its promised lead time. August peak demand is averaging ~200 units/week despite high weekly variance.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. The SKU 715624001 (hoodie) is transitioning from a high-demand August (Back-to-School) period into early September. Recent demand has fluctuated but averaged ~185 units/week over the last 4 periods (P26-P29). The pipeline is severely contaminated: total in-transit is 2785, but 2057 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, and now P24 which is 3 periods overdue). Effective pipeline is only 728 units (P26, P27, P28). On-hand is 144. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the expected demand of ~185/week (Base Stock for L=2 should be ~555 plus safety stock) while it incorrectly subtracts 2785 units of 'in-transit' inventory, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly high. I estimate required Base Stock at ~800 units. To force an order where (Base Stock - Pipeline) > 0, mu_hat must be set to (800 + 2785) = 3585. This 'explicit' value bypasses the pipeline math errors caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 2057 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24). P25 order arrived on time (P27), confirming that active shipments still follow L=2 when they aren't lost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September demand is stabilizing after the August back-to-school peak. Recent demand (P28-P30) has averaged ~81 units/week, significantly lower than the P26-P27 surge (avg ~265). The supply chain remains highly inconsistent: while the P27 order arrived in 3 periods and the P28 order arrived in 2 periods (both visible in P30 conclude), there is a massive volume of 'ghost inventory'. Total lost shipments now include: P1 (360), P3 (137), P4 (120), P13 (112), P14 (148), P15 (638), and P24 (542). Additionally, the P26 order (331 units) is now 2 periods overdue and highly suspect. Total ghost inventory currently being tracked by the OR backend as 'in-transit' is approximately 2057 (confirmed) + 331 (suspected) = 2388 units. With 790 units on-hand and 3005 in-transit visible to the backend, the backend will not order unless mu_hat is set explicitly to offset the 2388 units of lost stock. However, current on-hand (790) covers approximately 9 weeks of expected demand (~85 units/week), and P29 (292 units) and P30 (963 units) orders are still in a 'safe' window. Therefore, I will use recent demand (N=3) to set mu_hat, which will result in no new orders, allowing the existing on-hand surplus to deplete. L is set to calculate to reflect the mix of 2 and 3 period lead times recently observed.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) estimated at 2388 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, and P26). Current demand regime (September) has stabilized at ~85 units/week post-August peak. Real pipeline consists only of P29 and P30 orders.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we are navigating a post-peak September demand regime while managing significant inventory distortion. Current demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~85 units/week following the August surge. The primary operational challenge is the OR backend's treatment of the 'In-transit' quantity (3005 units). Based on my records, 2388 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, P26) are highly likely lost shipments that will never arrive. The 'real' pipeline consists only of P29 (292 units) and P30 (963 units). On-hand inventory is 773. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously halting orders due to 'ghost' inventory, I use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level. This inflation effectively cancels out the lost units while maintaining a base stock sufficient for the current demand regime (~85 units/week) over the review and lead period (L+1=3). Target Base Stock = (3 weeks * 85 units) + (2388 lost units) \u2248 2643 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1056.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 715624001 (Becka hoodie) has transitioned from its August 'Back-to-School' peak into a lower September demand regime. Over the last three periods (P30-P32), demand has averaged approximately 49 units/week (97, 17, 34), significantly lower than the August average of ~200. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 1,702 units following the arrival of P30's large order (963 units). The 'In-transit' figure (2,042) is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, P26, and likely P29). Specifically, the P29 order (292 units) is now at its promised lead time (L=2) and its status will be clear in the next period. However, given the current on-hand stock and the lower demand trend, the existing inventory (1,702 units) covers over 30 weeks of demand at the current rate (~50/week). Therefore, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from ordering despite the ghost inventory distortion, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the post-peak drop.

Carry-over insight: Post-August demand stabilization: Demand has dropped to an average of ~50 units/week (P30-P32). Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains a significant factor in 'In-transit' counts, but current on-hand levels (1,702) are more than sufficient for the remainder of the season.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for SKU 715624001 has stabilized post-August peak, with demand in Period 33 at 84 units following a four-period average (P30-P33) of approximately 58 units/week. This aligns with the seasonal fall-off observed after back-to-school surges. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 1,618 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 14 periods of the simulation even if demand averages 100 units/week. The 'In-transit' figure of 2,042 units is heavily contaminated by approximately 2,388 units of confirmed or highly likely lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, P26, and P29). Since current stock levels are extremely high and the season is winding down, no further orders are required. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current stabilized lower demand regime and allow the OR backend to naturally stop ordering due to the excessive on-hand inventory.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7th, 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized following the August peak, with recent demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) averaging 66 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 1,520 units, which is approximately 23 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. There are also 2,042 units in-transit, though history confirms that a significant portion of this (at least 2,388 units based on previous insights) is lost 'ghost' inventory. Despite the pipeline distortion, the physical on-hand stock is more than sufficient to meet demand through the end of the year without additional orders. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the post-peak period) and 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to use its internal tracking, knowing the high on-hand stock will prevent any unnecessary ordering.

Carry-over insight: Post-August demand (P30-P34) established a stable regime of ~66 units/week. While ghost inventory remains in the OR pipeline, physical on-hand stock (1520 units) now far exceeds the required safety stock for the foreseeable future.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a post-peak demand regime, with demand stabilizing around an average of 73 units/week over the last 5 periods (P31-P35). The physical inventory position is extremely high with 1,389 units on-hand, which is more than sufficient to cover demand for the rest of the game (12 periods remaining) given the current consumption rates. The 'In-transit' figure of 2,042 units is heavily distorted by approximately 2,388 units of confirmed lost shipments (ghost inventory from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, P26, and P29). Since current on-hand stock already far exceeds any reasonable safety stock level (Base Stock for L=2 at current demand would be roughly 250-300 units), the OR backend will correctly continue to place zero orders. I will maintain default parameters to allow the system to bleed off the excess stock.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 21, 2019 (Period 37). Demand has stabilized post-summer/back-to-school peaks, with the last 5 periods (P32-P36) averaging approximately 92 units per week. The inventory position is currently 1,272 units on-hand with an additional 2,042 units in-transit (the vast majority of which are confirmed lost 'ghost' units from periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15, 24, 26, and 29). Despite the pipeline distortion caused by these lost shipments, the current physical on-hand stock of 1,272 units is extremely high, covering over 13 weeks of current average demand. Since the game ends at Period 47 (11 periods remaining), we are significantly overstocked and should not place any further orders. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for demand parameters to reflect the current post-peak regime and 'default' for lead time, which will result in a base stock significantly lower than the current inventory position, ensuring no new orders are placed.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the current on-hand inventory for SKU 715624001 is 1112 units. Recent demand (P35-P37) shows a consistent upward trend (131, 117, 160 units/week), likely reflecting the start of the colder season suitable for hoodies. Despite this increase, the on-hand stock is extremely high relative to current demand (~7-8 weeks of coverage). The 'In-transit' figure of 2042 units consists almost entirely of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, P26, and P29). Because on-hand inventory is so high, we do not need to order and can allow the OR backend to naturally suppress orders. I will use a recent_N calculation for demand based on the last 5 weeks to capture the late autumn uptick while the system maintains the no-order status.

Carry-over insight: Late October demand regime shift: Demand increased from stabilization (~66 units) to ~136 units/week (P35-P37), likely seasonal for hoodies. Ghost inventory remains at 2388 units, but high on-hand levels (1112) mitigate the impact of pipeline distortion.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (early November), the SKU 715624001 (hoodie) is in a seasonal high-demand phase. Demand from Periodic 35-38 has averaged 125 units (131, 117, 160, 93). On-hand inventory is currently very healthy at 1019 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 2042 units is heavily distorted by roughly 2388 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, and P26), meaning the real pipeline is zero. However, with demand around 125 units/week and 1019 units on hand, we have approximately 8 weeks of stock, which is more than enough to cover the lead time (L=2) and safety stock requirements. No new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current autumn demand regime while allowing the high on-hand inventory to prevent unnecessary purchasing.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the demand for SKU 715624001 has stabilized following a late-October peak (~136 units/week in P35-P37), with recent demand averaging 87 units/week over P38-P39. The current on-hand inventory is 938 units. While the 'In-transit' figure of 2042 units is heavily skewed by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, P26, and P29/P30 which total approximately 2388 units based on previous carries), the physical on-hand stock of 938 is more than sufficient. Given the current demand (approx. 80-90 units/week) and the remaining 7 periods in the game, the total projected demand is around 600 units. Therefore, no new orders are required. We maintain 'default' settings for the OR backend, allowing the current high on-hand levels to naturally deplete against the predicted demand without triggering unnecessary new procurement.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18), we are in a late fall/early winter demand regime for the Becka hoodie. Historical data for November/December (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) suggests demand significantly increases as winter deepens, rising from ~37 to 300+ units. Recent demand (P35-P40) has averaged ~114 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 834 units. We must account for the 2,388 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, P26, and likely P29) which total more than the visible 'In-transit' count of 2,042, meaning the OR backend effectively considers the pipeline full despite these units being lost. However, with 834 units on-hand and an average demand of ~114, we have approximately 7 weeks of coverage. Given the expected sharp seasonal rise in late January/February demand seen in the historical samples, we should maintain current stock but prepare for a future surge. The 834 units is sufficient to cover the next 3 weeks (L+1) even if demand doubles. No new order is needed yet. Parameters reflect the current ~114 unit/week regime with historical variance.

Carry-over insight: Late Fall/Winter transition: Demand (P35-P40) stabilized at ~114 units/week. Historical samples suggest a major surge (>300/week) occurs in late January/February. Current on-hand (834) provides ~7 weeks of safety at current rates.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), demand has stabilized at approximately 98 units/week (average of P38-P41). The primary inventory challenge remains the 2,388 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, and P26) which are still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend. However, the physical on-hand inventory is currently 739 units. Given the current demand rate of ~100 units/week, this on-hand stock covers over 7 weeks of demand, which is more than sufficient given the promised lead time of 2 periods. Historical data suggests a major demand surge (300+ units) in late January/February, but we are currently in late November. No new orders are needed at this time as the physical stock is high relative to the lead time and current sales rate. I will maintain default settings to allow the current overstock to bleed down naturally toward the target levels, while monitoring for the anticipated year-end/early-year surge.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Demand for the Becka Hoodie is in a stabilized late-fall regime, averaging approximately 105 units/week over the last 8 periods (P35-P42). Historical data from January/February shows a major seasonal spike approaching 215-300 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 591 units. The In-transit figure of 2042 units is composed entirely of confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, P26, P29). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'in-transit' figure from its base stock calculation, it will not place any new orders unless those parameters are heavily inflated. However, with 591 units on hand and a current demand profile of ~105/week, we have roughly 5.6 weeks of stock. Given the promised lead time of 2, we are approaching the point where we need to re-order to prepare for the late January surge. I will continue to use 'explicit' mu_hat to negate the 2042 units of ghost inventory. To trigger an order that covers the current demand (105 * 3 = 315) plus the expected seasonal ramp, while bypassing the 2042 ghost units, mu_hat is set to 2600. This should result in a net order of roughly 2600 - 2042 - 591 = ~0 in this specific period, but I am raising the ceiling to prepare for the end-of-game surge.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory (lost shipments) total 2042 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, P26, P29), permanently distorting pipeline calculations.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/09), demand for the Becka hoodie (SKU 715624001) is entering the winter season. The most recent demand (P41-P43) has averaged 102.67 units/week. Historically, Jan/Feb sees a massive surge (>300/week), but we are currently several weeks away from that. On-hand inventory is 526 units, providing roughly 5 weeks of coverage at the current rate. Pipeline contamination (ghost inventory) is 2042 units, which effectively blocks the OR backend from ordering because 2,042 + 526 far exceeds any reasonable base stock for a lead time of 2. However, since the P43 order of 48 units was placed, the in-transit total became 2090, meaning the backend recognizes all old lost orders. To ensure we don't stock out during the upcoming January surge, I will continue to hold. No order is needed yet, as 526 units on-hand is sufficient for the short term. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (P39-P43) for mu_hat to capture the current winter stabilizer (~98 units/week) without over-reacting to single-period variances like the 148 in P42.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for the Becka hoodie has stabilized in the 80-110 units/week range (last 5 periods avg: 98). Historical data from January/February 2019 shows a significant surge reaching 300+ units. Current on-hand inventory is 436 units, which covers about 4.5 weeks of current demand. However, the 'ghost inventory' problem persists: 2,042 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, P26, P29) remain in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 2,090). This distortion prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To prepare for the late January surge, we must offset this 'ghost' pipeline. Since the OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline', and our pipeline is inflated by ~2042 units, we use 'explicit' mu_hat to force the base stock high enough to trigger replenishment. We target a base stock covering ~6 weeks of demand (6 * 110 = 660) plus the ghost units (2042), totaling ~2700 for mu_hat.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 715624001 (Becka hoodie) is entering late December with significant on-hand stock (251) and a very large distorted pipeline (2463 units). Historical data and previous years' samples indicate that the primary demand peak for this sweatshirt usually occurs in late January and February (historically jumping to 200-300+ units). Current demand (P45) spiked to 233, confirming the start of this high-demand winter season. The 'In-transit' figure of 2463 units is dominated by 'Ghost Inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, P26, and P29 totaling 2042 units). Real pipeline inventory is only the P45 order of 421 units (expected P47). Total effective inventory (on-hand 251 + real in-transit 421) is 672 units. To satisfy the projected seasonal surge of ~300 units/week over a 3-period lead-time + review cycle (L+1=3), we require approximately 900+ units. I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the backend's false perception of 2463 in-transit units. Setting mu_hat to 3500 ensures the OR backend recognizes a need that exceeds the total (ghost + real) pipeline, triggering sufficient replenishment for the upcoming January peak.

Carry-over insight: Late-December demand spike detected (P45 demand: 233), confirming the onset of the winter seasonal peak. Total confirmed ghost inventory remains at 2042 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, P26, P29).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering the peak demand season (January/February) for hoodies, as evidenced by the historical samples (2019-01-28: 215, 2019-02-04: 302) and recent demand spikes in Period 45 (233) and Period 46 (214). The current on-hand inventory is critically low (37 units). Total 'In-transit' is 3990, but a significant portion (2042 units from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P15, P24, P26, P29) is confirmed 'ghost inventory' that will likely never arrive. To ensure the backend places an order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My forecast for the next 3 weeks (L+1) is 1000 units (anticipating the jump to ~330 units/week seen in Feb historicals). This inflated mu_hat must cover (forecasted_demand * (L+1)) + ghost_inventory to force the OR engine to trigger a replenishment order. Current valid pipeline is only the P45 (421) and P46 (1527) orders, totaling 1948 units. L is set to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Entering January peak: Demand expected to rise from ~220 to ~300+ units/week based on historical samples. Ghost inventory remains at 2042 units, requiring explicit mu_hat adjustments to bypass backend pipeline logic.
