Average demand (\u03bc) over these 5 periods is 85.2, with a standard deviation (\u03c3) of approximately 25. Given the date (2019-02-11), we are post-Lunar New Year (Feb 5) and approaching Spring/Spring Break seasons. There's no immediate seasonal spike expected, but steady demand for basics like jeggings. Promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand starting from Period 1, I need to account for demand in P1, P2, and P3. Based on the average (85.2 * 3 = 255.6), plus a safety stock to handle the high variance (\u03c3=25), I will target a total pipeline of ~330 units. Since current On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 0, I will order 330 units to build the inventory pipeline immediately.",

While current on-hand inventory is 238, the extreme loss rate requires aggressive over-ordering to maintain service levels. Forecasting demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) at 135 units/period equals ~405 units. Given the ~50% fulfillment rate, I need a 'target pipeline' significantly higher than expected demand. Current in-transit includes P34 (likely lost), and P36 (250 units, now P+3 and should arrive soon if not lost). To maintain availability against the high risk of shipment failure and the likely November demand surge, I will place an order of 250 units.",

Given the garment's description (lightweight, skinny low-waist), demand is expected to remain low until post-holiday sales or early spring. On-hand inventory is currently high (571 units), which covers over 5 periods of demand even at the higher autumn rates, and over 10 periods at the current December rate. The pipeline is also heavily saturated with 1580 units in-transit (Orders from P34, P38, P42, P43). Even acknowledging the ~50% historic loss rate, the expected arrivals from the most recent orders (P42, P43) combined with the current surplus 571 on-hand units create a substantial overstock risk.
