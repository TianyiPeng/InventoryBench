Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 658030011 (Push Up Jeggings). There is no history yet, on-hand and in-transit are both 0. The provided demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) show a mean of 85.2 units and a standard deviation of 25.8. The promised lead time is 2. Since this is the first decision period, no 'conclude' messages exist to verify actual lead time. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the recent demand level of ~85 units/week. This translates to an expected demand over (L+1)=3 periods of roughly 255.6 units. This setup will allow the OR backend to initiate orders based on current data while accounting for variability.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Push Up Jeggings', a staple denim item. History shows demand for the last 5 weeks + Period 1: [83, 67, 107, 53, 116, 136]. The average demand is approximately 93.7 units/week. Period 1 demand (136) was significantly higher than the previous mean (~85), indicating a potential seasonal uptick or shift as we move into mid-February. Current on-hand is 0, and we lost 136 units of sales in Period 1 because we started with 0 inventory. We have 129 units in-transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 2, these 129 units are expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent higher demand trend (avg ~103), applied over the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N to reflect current volatility. L stays at default (2) as we have no evidence yet to suggest a lead time deviation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history for this SKU (658030011, Push Up Jegging) shows an average of approximately 85.2 units over the last 5 samples, with the most recent Period 1 and Period 2 demands being 136 and 103, respectively. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (129 units) is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 'conclude' message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit is 291 units (from P1 and P2). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level q = 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims to cover the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the slightly higher recent demand (avg ~92 over last 7 points) compared to the long-term historical mean (~85), ensuring we replenish sufficiently during this initial stock-out phase.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th. We are managing 'Push Up Jeggings', a staple denim item. History shows demand has been consistent (mean: 103, std: 25) with samples: 83, 67, 107, 53, 116, 136, 103, 96. Total demand over 8 weeks averages ~95 units/period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. We ordered in P1, P2, and P3. According to the 'Promised Lead Time = 2' definition, the P1 order (placed at start of P1) should arrive DURING P3 and be visible in the 'P3 conclude' message at the start of P4. However, 'P3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is likely 3 periods (arrival in P4) or shipments are delayed/lost. Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 309 (129 from P1 + 162 from P2 + 18 from P3). I will set L=3 explicitly to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of all 8 historical samples (~95) multiplied by (1+L) = 4. 95*4 = 380. For sigma_hat, I'll use the standard deviation of all samples (~25) multiplied by sqrt(4) = 50. Since Profit=HoldingCost=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand unless adjusted.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is 'Push Up Jegging' (Ladies Denim). Historical demand samples are 83, 67, 107, 53, 116. In-game demand for Periods 1-4 was 136, 103, 96, and 84. This shows a slight downward trend from an initial spike, but demand remains higher than the pre-game samples (pre-game mean ~85, in-game mean ~105). Lead time analysis: P2 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=2), which matches the promised lead time. P1 order (ordered 129 units) is significantly overdue (ordered P1, expected P3, currently P5). Given that P2 arrived and P1 has not, the P1 shipment is likely lost. Current stock: On-hand 78, In-transit 218 (P1: 129, P3: 18, P4: 71). If we assume the P1 order (129) is lost, the effective pipeline is only 89 units (18 + 71). To compensate for the lost stock and ensure the service level for (L+1)=3 periods, I will use recent demand history (N=4) to set mu_hat. Since the OR engine's pipeline calculation includes all 'In-transit' units, it still thinks we have 129 units coming from P1. I must overwrite mu_hat (explicitly) or adjust parameters to force an order that covers the gap. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure it covers the 3-period demand (approx 3 * 105 = 315) plus the lost 129 units to trigger the OR engine to restock the missing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (129 units) presumed lost: P2 order arrived on time (P4) while P1 remains outstanding.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The current stock position for SKU 658030011 is precarious: on-hand is 0, and there's a suspected lost shipment from Period 1 (129 units) which has not concluded while the Period 2 order arrived on time (2-period lead time). The In-transit total is 366. Demand has stayed relatively stable recently (Period 2-5 mean: 92.75). Since the stockout occurred at Period 5 due to the missing P1 shipment, and we are entering mid-March, I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand and sigma estimation to capture the current stable-but-tight regime. I will keep the lead time 'L' as default (promised 2) because P2 arrived exactly on time, suggesting that the P1 issue was a loss rather than a systematic lead-time shift.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), the product (Push Up Jeggings) is entering the spring season. Historical demand from the initial samples and recent performance centers around 85-100 units/period. The lead time has been inconsistent: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods (promised), Period 5 order arrived in 1 period, and the Period 1 order is significantly overdue (6 periods) and confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 64 units with 218 units in transit (Periods 3, 4, 6). To avoid over-ordering due to the lost shipment inflating the pipeline, I will use a conservative average of historical and recent demand. I set N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-lost-shipment stabilization (~85-90 units) while smoothing out the early noisy samples. L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed 1 and 2 period actual lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed lead time variability (observed 1 and 2 periods). Period 1 order remains lost and is removed from mental accounting of effective pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a staple denim item (Jegging). Historical demand samples (last 5 available: 83, 67, 107, 53, 116) have a mean of 85.2. Recent in-game demand (P1-P7) reflects a mean of approx 107, with a notable spike in P7 (160 units). Inventory is currently 0, and we have 218 units in-transit (P3: 18, P4: 71, P5: 148, minus the 148 that arrived in P6, plus P6: 0 and P7: 0 - wait, the in-transit display says 218 units, which likely counts the lost P1 units (129) and P3+P4+P5? No, calculation based on history: P3(18) + P4(71) + P5(148) = 237. If P5(148) arrived in P6, then P3+P4 = 89 units should be in transit. However, the system shows 218. 218 - 89 = 129, which confirms the P1 order is still being counted as 'In-Transit' by the OR backend. Since P1 is lost, the backend overestimates pipeline by 129 units. To compensate for this 129-unit 'ghost inventory' and the recent demand spike (P7=160), I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I forecast weekly demand at 110. (1+L) * 110 = 330. To force an order despite the 129-unit ghost pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 330 + 129 = 459. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-2 periods).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 9 (2019/04/08). On-hand inventory is 0 after stockouts in Period 7 and 8. The Period 1 order (129 units) is confirmed lost. My effective pipeline consists of Period 3 (18 units, severely delayed/lost?), Period 4 (71 units, overdue at L=4), Period 5 (148 units - arrived P6), and Period 8 (202 units). Summed 'In-transit' is 420. However, Period 3/4 orders are likely lost given previous lead times of 1-2 periods. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been volatile but averages ~108 over the last 5 periods (including a spike of 160). As it is early April, we are entering the spring season for denim jeggings, which usually sees stable-to-increasing demand. Strategy: L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of 1 and 2 periods (1.5). I will use mu_hat 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent average demand of ~108. With L=1.5, mu_hat should target ~270 units for the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to handle recent variance. The 202 units from P8 are expected in P10 or P11, so current parameters aim to stabilize the inventory position once those arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 3 (18 units) and Period 4 (71 units) orders are now heavily overdue (>4 periods) and likely lost; effective pipeline is primarily the Period 8 order (202 units).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The item is a 'Push Up Jegging L.W' with a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, resulting in a critical ratio (q) of 0.5. Current on-hand is 0. History shows significant lead-time issues and lost orders. Specifically, orders from P1 (129), P3 (18), and P4 (71) are massively overdue and almost certainly lost. This leaves the P8 order (202 units) as the only viable inventory in transit, despite the UI showing 420. Demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~94 over 14 samples including early history) with a spike in P7. Given the stockouts and lost shipments, the priority is to re-establish a healthy inventory level. I will use the promised lead time (L=2) for calculations, but set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the gap left by lost shipments. mu_hat is set to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) at a slightly higher rate (110) to recover safety stock lost to lead time reliability issues.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/04/22), the product 'Push Up Jegging' has an on-hand inventory of 151 units. Historically, we have observed significant issues with lost shipments: orders from Period 1 (129 units), Period 3 (18 units), and Period 4 (71 units) are now 7-10 periods overdue and are confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 218 units likely represents these lost units (129+18+71=218). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. Recent demand (P10) dropped to 51, following a higher average in earlier periods (~95-100). Given the lead time variability (1-2 periods) and the high risk of stockouts due to lost shipments, I will maintain a base stock level calculation using recent demand (last 5 periods, avg ~78) to account for the current demand softening while remaining cautious about supply reliability. I'll set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average lead time of 1.67 periods, and use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma to adapt to the most recent sales patterns.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: In-transit count of 218 units is entirely comprised of lost orders (P1, P3, P4); effective pipeline for planning remains 0.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU '658030011' shows on-hand inventory of 98 units. The recorded in-transit total of 218 units is composed of orders from Period 1 (129), Period 3 (18), and Period 4 (71), all of which are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 and are confirmed lost. The actual effective pipeline is zero. Historically, demand has been stable around a mean of ~87 units (excluding the outlier in Period 7), but the most recent two periods (P10, P11) show a decrease to 51 and 53 units respectively. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level target q is 0.5, meaning base stock effectively targets the median demand. To prevent over-ordering due to the high (but false) in-transit count, I need to set parameters that maintain inventory while recognizing the lost units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the somewhat lower recent demand while covering the full observed history of the SKU in this game. I'll stick with 'calculate' for the lead time as the successful deliveries (P2->P4, P5->P6, P8->P10) show a lead time mean of ~1.67, aligning well with the promised 2.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/5/6), on-hand inventory has dropped to 9 units. According to historical data and carry-over insights, the 218 units currently 'In-transit' consist of orders from Period 1 (129), Period 3 (18), and Period 4 (71), all of which are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 and are presumed lost. These lost orders artificially inflate the pipeline inventory, which would prevent the OR engine from ordering more stock if not addressed. To simulate a lead-time adjustment that forces an order despite this 'ghost' pipeline, I will set L to a high explicit value. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 94 units over the last 12 periods, but has shown a slight downward trend recently (avg of last 3 periods is 64). I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand profile (approx 66 units/period). By setting L to 6, the base stock target will increase significantly, allowing the OR engine to place an order to replenish the safety stock and cover future demand despite the 218 'in-transit' units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 658030011 (Push Up Jegging) has been relatively stable, with a recent 5-period average of approximately 69.6 units per week. The system shows an in-transit inventory of 328 units; however, based on carry-over insights, 218 of these units (orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are over 9 weeks old and must be considered lost. The only viable order in the pipeline is from Period 13 (110 units), which is expected to arrive in Period 15 (lead time 2). We are currently at zero on-hand inventory and finished Period 13 with lost sales. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current mean demand of ~70 units, scaled for the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is set to the same period to capture recent volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average lead time of seen arrivals (2, 1, 2).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been consistent with a mean of ~80 units over the last five samples. The 'in-transit' total of 328 includes 218 units from Period 1 (129), Period 3 (18), and Period 4 (71) which are long-overdue and confirmed as lost. The only viable order in the pipeline is Period 13's 110 units, which was expected in Period 15 (lead time 2), but since our decision happens before arrivals, we are currently stock-out. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' which includes all undelivered units (328), but 218 are lost. To force the engine to order sufficiently for Period 15 and beyond, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 218 'phantom' units. Given L=2 and a mean demand of 80, the normal mu_hat = (1+2)*80 = 240. Adding the 218 lost units gives a target mu_hat of 458. Recent volatility is stable, so I use recent_N for sigma_hat.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/27. Demand has been relatively stable recently, with the last 5 periods (P11-P15) averaging 72 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 458 units is misleading due to cumulative lost shipments: P1 (129), P3 (18), and P4 (71) were confirmed lost in previous insights (218 units total). Additionally, the order from P13 (110 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, despite a promised lead time of 2; given the history of losses, this must be monitored closely but is not yet definitively lost. The order from P15 (130 units) is within the lead time window. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current demand level of ~72 units/period. For L, I use 'explicit' value 2 as the promised lead time holds when orders do arrive, but since the pipeline is clogged with ghosts, I must ensure the base stock calculation reflects the reality that effective pipeline is low. By setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=5), I account for recent low volatility (Std ~13). The backend will order based on base_stock - (In-transit - Lost), and since the backend doesn't know about lost orders, I use these parameters to target an inventory level that compensates for the 'ghost' units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Period 13 order (110 units) is now overdue (3 periods since order) and risks being lost, similar to P1, P3, and P4; total presumed lost units in pipeline now reach 218 units minimum.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 17 (Date: 2019/6/3). The product is 'Push Up Jegging L.W'. Currently, On-hand is 0. The total In-transit is 458 units. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, we must categorize these units to determine our effective pipeline. Orders from P1 (129), P3 (18), P4 (71), and now P13 (110) are considered lost as they have exceeded the promised lead time of 2 periods by a significant margin (P13 is now 4 periods overdue). The only 'active' order is from P15 (130 units), which was ordered in Period 15 and is now due to arrive. Because actual lead times have varied between 1 and 2 periods (avg ~1.67) and the supply chain is highly unreliable (frequent losses), I will use an explicit L of 2 to ensure we account for the full lead-time risk. For demand, the recent mean since early April (Period 10) has dropped to approximately 65-70 units per week compared to the earlier 80-100 range. I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture this lower demand regime (approx 71 units/week). Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*71 and sigma_hat to recent_N will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers the 0 inventory position while accounting for the high risk of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Period 13 order (110 units) is now 4 periods old and officially marked as lost alongside P1, P3, and P4. Total lost units in pipeline: 328 (129+18+71+110). Effective pipeline is currently 130 units (ordered Period 15).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand over the last 10 periods (P8-P17) has averaged 70.9 units per period, showing a slight decrease compared to the early launch phase but remaining relatively stable. On-hand inventory is 77 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' count of 328 units; however, based on the history and carry-over insights, these units (from P1, P3, P4, and P13) are significantly overdue and confirmed as lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. To protect against stockouts given the recent zero-inventory periods, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N (N=10) approach to capture the current demand regime (~71 units/period) and use the calculate method for L to account for the observed volatility (1-2 periods). sigma_hat will be set using recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. Since the OR backend uses in-transit in its base_stock calculation, and the internal in-transit count is inflated by lost orders (328 units), I must use explicit values for mu_hat to 'bypass' or compensate for this phantom inventory. Calculations: L=2. Target Base Stock = (L+1)*Avg + Z*Std. Avg(P8-P17) = 70.9. Std(P8-P17) = 16.4. Target mu_hat = (2+1)*70.9 = 212.7. However, the OR backend sees 328 units in transit. To force an order when on-hand is 77 and effective pipeline is 0, mu_hat must be set high enough to overcome the 328 phantom units. Target mu_hat = 328 (phantom) + 77 (on-hand) + demand_forecast. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 550 to ensure the policy triggers an order to replenish stock for the coming periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Effective pipeline remains 0 despite 328 units showing in-transit; mu_hat must be adjusted upward to compensate for phantom inventory in OR calculations until system resolves lost shipments.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the current on-hand inventory is 22 units. The in-transit inventory of 473 units is significantly comprised of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: P1 (129), P3 (18), P4 (71), and P13 (110), totaling 328 units that will likely never arrive. The effective pipeline includes the P18 order (145 units) and no other recent orders. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to calculate orders. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 328 units of phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that adds the phantom count to the standard forecast. Recent demand (last 8 weeks since mid-April) has averaged ~63.9 units/period. A standard (L+1) forecast for L=2 would be ~192 units. Adding the 328 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 520. This forces the system to order ~145-160 units to bridge the gap while maintaining safety stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility (~16.4 units/period), and calculate for L as actual lead times remain close to the promised 2 periods (except for losses).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 658030011 has stabilized at a lower level recently, averaging around 57 units over the last 5 periods (P15-P19), compared to the higher volatility seen in early spring. Lead times have been inconsistent, with P18 arriving in 1 period (observed at start of P20), while multiple previous orders (P1, P3, P4, P13) totaling 328 units are confirmed lost. The OR engine sees 'In-transit: 353', but 328 of those are 'phantom inventory' that will never arrive. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover actual demand, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 328 units of lost pipeline. Target stock for L=2 (3 periods) should be ~171 units (57*3). With on-hand at 129 and effective pipeline at 25 (P19 order), we have 154 units. To trigger a small top-up order and maintain a buffer against the lost inventory accounting, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I use recent_N for sigma to capture the current lower volatility. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*57 + 328 = 499 to neutralize the lost units in the logic 'base_stock - pipeline'.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: In-transit inventory of 353 units contains 328 units of confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13). Only 25 units (from P19) are viable pipeline. mu_hat needs to be explicitly inflated by 328 until the system flushes the lost units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historically, demand for this '5-pocket jegging' has cooled significantly since early June (avg ~38 units/period in the last 4 periods compared to ~80-100 earlier in the year). At Period 21, on-hand inventory is 107 units, which is ample for nearly 3 periods of current demand. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 370 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments (P1=129, P3=18, P4=71, P13=110, Total Lost = 328). This 'phantom inventory' causes the OR backend to under-order or stop ordering entirely. To bypass this, I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat' by the volume of lost units (328) to ensure the base stock calculation remains high enough to trigger an order despite the 328 units that will never arrive. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals have shown variability (1 to 2 periods). Demand (recent_N=10) captures the cooling trend while balancing historical mean. Sigma is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed lost inventory in pipeline is 328 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). Effective pipeline is currently 42 units (P19=25, P20=17). Mu_hat must continue to be explicitly inflated by 328 to neutralize phantom in-transit stock in the capped policy.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand has consistently softened over the last 5 periods, averaging roughly 33 units per period (compared to 80+ in earlier periods). This is consistent with a seasonal lull for 'skinny low-waist jeggings' following the spring peak. The 'In-transit' figure of 461 units is highly misleading: it includes 328 units from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13). The effective pipeline consists only of orders from Period 19 (25 units), Period 20 (17 units), and Period 21 (91 units), totaling 133 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 461 units of stock and stopping all ordering, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to offset the 328 ghost units. I will set mu_hat = ((1 + L) * recent_demand_mean) + 328. With L=2 and recent demand (N=5) averaging 33.2 units, the base mu_hat is 3 * 33.2 = 99.6. Adding the 328 lost-unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 427.6. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * 12.8 (recent std) \u2248 22.1.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Confirmed lost inventory in pipeline remains 328 units. Only 133 units (P19, P20, P21) are reliable. Mu_hat inflation of +328 must be sustained until these units are removed from the system view.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 context: Demand is in a mid-summer low, averaging ~30 units/period over the last 4 weeks. Lead times are consistently 1-2 periods. However, the system's 'In-transit' count (444 units) is highly distorted by historical lost shipments: Period 1 (129), Period 3 (18), Period 4 (71), and Period 13 (110) are confirmed lost, totaling 328 phantom units. Currently, only the Period 19 order (25 units) and Period 21 order (91 units) are viable pipeline inventory (total 116). The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine the order size. To neutralize the 328 phantom units that the OR engine incorrectly subtracts from the order requirement, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat by +328. This ensures the engine targeting a 'physical' safety stock rather than being suppressed by impossible-to-receive inventory. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have stabilized around the predicted 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed lost inventory remains at 328 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). Total pipeline (444) minus lost (328) equals 116 units of real expected arrivals. Mu_hat inflation of +328 continues to be mandatory to ensure the capped policy orders sufficient stock.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (2019-07-22), the 'In-transit' quantity is 353 units. Based on historical data, this includes 328 units from orders placed in Period 1 (129), Period 3 (18), Period 4 (71), and Period 13 (110) which are significantly past their delivery window and suspected lost. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 353 - 328 = 25 units (from the Period 19 order, which is also reaching overdue status). The OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (353) from its target base stock. To neutralize these 328 'phantom' units, mu_hat must be explicitly increased by 328. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized around an average of 36 units/period following a decline from earlier high-sales periods. Using N=5 for recent demand context: base mu_hat = (1+L) * avg_demand = (1+2)*36 = 108. Final mu_hat = 108 + 328 = 436. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for the 'Push Up Jegging' has transitioned into a lower summer regime, with the last five periods (P20-P24) averaging 34.2 units/period, compared to the spring peak of 80+. Lead times are currently stable at 2 periods (P20 and P21 orders both arrived in 2 periods). The primary operational challenge is the significant quantity of 'phantom' inventory in the in-transit pipeline. Specifically, orders from Period 1 (129), Period 3 (18), Period 4 (71), and Period 13 (110) are confirmed lost, totaling 328 units. These units still appear in the system's 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 353; Real In-transit: 353 - 328 = 25). To prevent the OR backend's capped policy from calculating a zero order due to these phantom units, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. I will calculate the forecast based on the recent demand regime (34.2 * (1+L) = 102.6) and add the 328 lost units to the base mu_hat (102.6 + 328 = 430.6). This neutralizes the phantom inventory, allowing the system to maintain a real base stock for the current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand stabilized in a summer low regime (avg ~34 units, P20-P24). Total confirmed lost inventory remains 328 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). Mu_hat must include an offset of +328 to neutralize these phantom units in the OR solver.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 5, 2019. Demand for this SKU has transitioned into a summer regime, with the most recent sample (72 units) being an outlier relative to the previous five-period average (~34 units). I am calculating the baseline demand (mu_hat) by looking at the last 6 periods (including the spike) to remain responsive. The critical issue remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. The 'In-transit' count of 365 includes 328 units from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, 4, and 13 which are verified lost but still counted as pipeline by the OR backend. To ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock despite these 328 ghost units, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 328. This neutralizes the subtraction of lost pipeline inventory in the base stock logic (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period lead time variability and use an explicit mu_hat of 465 (approx (1+2)*45 + 328) to ensure replenishment occurs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) facing a demand of ~72 units in the last two periods, which is significantly higher than the mid-summer average of 34 units (P20-P24). We are entering August, where back-to-school or late-summer browsing often increases demand for garments like 'jegging' and 'skinny legs'. The 'In-transit' count of 465 units is heavily distorted by 328 units from old, confirmed-lost orders (P1=129, P3=18, P4=71, P13=110). These lost units act as 'phantom inventory' that prevents the OR backend's capped policy from ordering enough units. To neutralize this, mu_hat must be explicitly set to (Forecasted Demand * (1+L)) + Lost Units. Expected demand is trending toward ~70/week. With L=2, the required coverage is 3 periods of demand (~210 units). Adding the 328 lost units yields a mu_hat of 538. The reliable pipeline consists of P25 (12) and P26 (100), totaling 112 units. Explicitly setting mu_hat allows the engine to recognize the stockout and place an order to reconcile the gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand regime shift detected; demand surged from ~34 units/week (P20-P24) to ~72 units/week (P25-P26), a 100%+ increase likely tied to late summer/back-to-school seasonality. Total confirmed lost units in the system remain 328.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030011' is currently in a demand surge, likely due to back-to-school seasonality. Demand in Periods 25-27 (72, 72, 98) shows a significant increase from the summer low (~34 units). Starting on-hand is 0, and the system shows an In-transit balance of 526 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 328 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, and P13) are effectively lost and will never arrive. The 'real' pipeline consists of the orders from P26 (100 units) and P27 (73 units), totaling 173 units. To ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation (which sees 526 in-transit) doesn't suppress new orders, I must use an 'explicit' Mu_hat. The forecast for a review+lead period (3 weeks) at the current demand level (~80-90/week) would be roughly 270 units. Adding the 'lost' inventory offset of 328 leads to a target Mu_hat of 598. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility during this seasonal shift. L is set to calculate to maintain the promised 2-period average.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand surge confirmed (P25-P27 avg: 81 units vs P20-P24 avg: 34 units). Lost shipments (328 units) remain visible in system pipeline, requiring a Mu_hat offset of +328 to neutralize phantom inventory in OR logic.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a late August/early September peak (back-to-school), with the last four periods showing a sustained demand regime shift (Avg: 84 units/week, up from the summer low of ~34). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity of 598 units is heavily distorted by 328 units of confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13). To prevent the OR backend's capped policy from under-ordering due to this 'phantom' pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. The calculation for mu_hat is: (Promised Lead Time + 1) * Expected Demand + Phantom Inventory Offset. With promised L=2, expected demand=84, and offset=328, mu_hat = (2+1)*84 + 328 = 252 + 328 = 580. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility observed during this demand surge (Std dev of P25-P28 is ~13.5), scaled by sqrt(1+L), approximately 24.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. Demand since Period 25 has clearly shifted to a high-volume regime (Back-to-School/Late Summer seasonality), with an average demand of 82.8 units (samples: 72, 72, 98, 94, 78). The system currently shows 'In-transit: 598 units', but my records confirm 328 units are lost (P1, P3, P4, P13). Furthermore, the Period 26 order (100 units) is now at its promised lead time limit; if it does not arrive next period, it may also be lost. Effective 'real' pipeline is currently 270 units (P26=100, P27=73, P28=72, P25 arrived in P27). To ensure the OR backend (which sees 598 in-transit) places an order to meet the current high demand, I must continue to inflate mu_hat by the 328 'phantom' units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (avg 83) resulting in (1+2)*83 = 249, then adding the 328 offset for an explicit mu_hat of 577. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has experienced a significant seasonal surge starting Period 25 (late August/early September), likely driven by back-to-school trends. Demand in Period 30 reached 130 units, the highest since spring. The current average over the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is approximately 91 units. Lead times have remained mostly stable at 2-3 periods, although a persistent 328-unit 'phantom' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P13) remains in the system calculation. To compensate for this phantom pipeline and prevent the capped policy from under-ordering during this high-demand phase, mu_hat must be set to the forecasted demand for (L+1) periods PLUS the 328 lost units. With L=2 and mean=91, (1+L)*91 = 273. Adding the 328 offset results in a mu_hat of 601. Sigma_hat is calculated using the volatility of the recent high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P25-P30 avg is 91 units (+160% vs summer low). Period 26 order (100 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost; updating total confirmed lost units to 428 (328 previous + 100). Valid pipeline consists only of orders from Period 29 onwards (which is 0).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in a high-demand regime (Back-to-School/Late Summer seasonality), with demand in the last two concluded periods (P30, P31) averaging 127 units. The system shows 686 units in-transit, but based on carry-over insights, 428 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P26). Additionally, the P19 (25 units) order from June is also significantly overdue and likely lost, bringing the total lost count to 453 units. The effective pipeline includes P31 (233 units) and potentially some residual units, but the OR backend's capped policy will see the full 686 and stop ordering. To force an order, mu_hat must be explicitly set to (1+L)*E[Demand] + Lost_Units. With L=2 and average demand ~125, the base requirement is 375. Adding the 453 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 828. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Period 19 order (25 units) is now 13 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline updated to 453 (previous 428 + 25). Mu_hat inflation must reflect this total to ensure the OR backend ignores phantom inventory.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we are in the midst of a significant high-demand regime likely driven by back-to-school/fall seasonality (P30-P32 demand avg: 125.7 units/week). The principal challenge remains the OR backend's treatment of 'In-transit' units. Currently, the system shows 595 units in-transit. Based on historical data and lead-time tracking, 453 of these units are confirmed 'lost' or 'phantom' (P1: 129, P3: 18, P4: 71, P13: 110, P26: 100, P19: 25). The remaining 142 units are the valid pipeline from Period 32. To prevent the capped policy from under-ordering due to these 453 phantom units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as (1+L) * Forecast_Demand + Phantom_Units. With L=2, Forecast_Demand=125, and Phantom_Units=453, the calculation is (3 * 125) + 453 = 828. This ensures the base_stock calculation accounts for the high demand while effectively ignoring the non-existent pipeline inventory. For sigma_hat, I utilize recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility of this higher demand regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand has transitioned from a summer low (~34 units) to a significant autumn/back-to-school surge, with the most recent sample at 230 units and a 4-period average (P30-P33) of approximately 152 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 718 units 'in-transit'. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed lost: P1(129), P3(18), P4(71), P13(110), P19(25), and P26(100), totaling 453 units of 'phantom' inventory. Subtracting 453 from 718 leaves an effective pipeline of 265 units (orders from P32 and P33). To neutralize the 453 phantom units in the OR backend's capped policy [final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)], I must explicitly inflate mu_hat by 453 units. For the baseline demand, I am using the average of the last 4 periods (152) to capture the current high-demand regime. Thus, mu_hat = (1 + L) * 152 + 453. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 152) + 453 = 909.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand surge intensified in late September (P33 demand: 230). Total confirmed lost units in pipeline remains 453. Effective pipeline consists only of P32 (142 units) and P33 (123 units) totaling 265 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a major seasonal demand surge starting mid-August (P26+), with the last four periods averaging 151 units (P31: 124, P32: 123, P33: 230, P34: 117). We are now in October, likely approaching the peak of this regime. Current on-hand is 0. Total in-transit is 909 units, but 453 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26). The effective pipeline consists of P32 (142), P33 (123), P34 (191), totaling 456 units. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the 453 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be explicitly set to (Forecasted Demand * (1+L)) + 453. I forecast demand for the next 3 weeks at 160 units/week given the high volatility (P33 reached 230). Target mu_hat = (160 * 3) + 453 = 933. Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to handle the high variance observed in the recent demand surge (std ~55 over P31-34).

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Effective pipeline remains 456 units; mu_hat must continue to include a +453 offset to neutralize persistent phantom inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/14. Demand shows a sustained high regime following the summer low; the average from Period 30 to 35 is approximately 140 units per week. In-transit inventory is currently 791 units, but this is heavily distorted by lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26), totaling 453 units as identified in previous carry-overs. Subtracting these 453 phantom units leaves a real pipeline of 338 units (Orders from P33, P34, P35). To ensure the OR backend's capped policy doesn't stop ordering due to these persistent phantom units, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat by the total 'lost' volume (+453 units). Lead time remains variable (1-3 periods), so I use the 'calculate' method to utilize the historical average for L. I will use the recent 6 periods (P30-P35) to set the base demand forecast (~140) and then add the 453 offset.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Real pipeline consists of P33 (123), P34 (191), and P35 (24), totaling 338 units. Phantom inventory remains 453 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26). Current demand regime (P30-P35) average is ~140 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is currently in a high-demand regime, with the last 7 periods (P30-P36) averaging approximately 140 units/period (ranging 117-230). Seasonality for denim trousers typically remains strong through October and November. In-transit inventory is 703, but 453 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26). Additionally, the P34 order (191 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived; with current lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, this is the primary 'real' pipeline. To force the OR backend's capped policy to ignore the 453 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a base stock target that accounts for this offset. Calculation: Targeted base stock for (L+1=3) periods is ~420 units (3 * 140). Adding the 453 phantom units as an offset yields a mu_hat of ~873. Sigma is set to reflect the higher volatility (std ~40 during this regime).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28. Demand has shifted from a summer low of ~34 units (P20-P24) to a higher autumn regime averaging ~119 units over the last 7 periods (P31-P37). Total in-transit inventory is 821 units, but 453 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26 - all >4 weeks overdue). The effective pipeline is 368 units (P34=191, P36=59, P37=118). Since the OR backend uses total in-transit in its base-stock calculation (Min[BaseStock - InTransit, Cap]), it will perceive 453 phantom units and under-order. To neutralize this, I must explicitly set 'mu_hat' to (Demand Forecast * (L+1)) + Phantom Units. Forecasting demand at 120 units/period (recent average) and assuming L=2, the required Base Stock is 120 * 3 = 360 plus the 453 phantom units to bypass the OR's subtraction, totaling 813. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised) as recent actual arrivals (P31-P35) varied between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand remains high in the late autumn season (P30-P38 average ~128 units). On-hand inventory is 0. System 'In-transit' shows 703 units. However, based on the history of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26), a significant portion of this is phantom inventory. Specifically, the lost units are: P1(129), P3(18), P4(71), P13(110), P19(25), and P26(100), totaling 453 units. The 'real' pipeline is the Period 34 order (191) and the Period 36 order (59), totaling 250 units. The Period 34 order is now 5 periods old and highly likely lost as well, but I will wait one more period before officially including it in the offset. To force the OR backend (which relies on 'Effective Inventory = OnHand + InTransit - Demand') to order despite the 453 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period horizon (L=2 + 1) using the recent mean (~128) plus an offset to neutralize the 453 phantom units: (128 * 3) + 453 = 837. This ensures the order generated covers the high seasonal demand while ignoring the lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Period 34 order (191 units) is now 5 periods overdue and is likely lost, though not yet added to the formal offset. Total confirmed lost units used for mu_hat inflation remains 453.

Currently, 778 units are listed as in-transit, but many are confirmed lost: P1(129), P3(18), P4(71), P13(110), P19(25), P26(100), and now P34(191), which is 6 periods overdue. This brings the total confirmed lost inventory to 644 units. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy that subtracts in-transit inventory from the target stock; therefore, to ensure the OR logic orders actual stock, I must explicitly inflate the mu_hat parameter by roughly 644 units to neutralize these non-existent items. I am using recent_N (N=5) for the demand forecast to capture the current high-demand regime (~124 units/period), and then adding the 644 offset to the final mu_hat. Standard lead time of 2 is used as arrivals have been erratic but generally hover around 1-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Period 34 order (191 units) confirmed lost after 6 periods of absence. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline updated from 453 to 644 (453 + 191). Mu_hat must include a +644 offset to neutralize these phantom units in the OR solver.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, approaching the peak holiday shopping season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~115 units/week in the last six periods (P35-P40). However, the central challenge is the presence of significant 'phantom inventory' in the system-view pipeline. We have confirmed a total of 644 units lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26, and now P34). Because the OR backend uses 'In-transit' (1016 units) to calculate orders, it will incorrectly see 644 units that will never arrive, leading to severe under-ordering. To neutralize this, I am explicitly setting mu_hat to the expected demand across (L+1) periods (approx 115 * 3 = 345) PLUS an offset of 644. This ensures the OR logic accounts for current demand while effectively ignoring the lost units. I set L=2 as it remains the promised and approximate average lead time, and sigma_hat is calculated from the recent stable regime (N=6) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Period 34 order (191 units) confirmed lost after 6 periods of absence. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline updated from 453 to 644. This offset must be added to mu_hat to neutralize 'phantom inventory' in the OR backend.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), the demand regime has shifted from the high autumn peak (avg ~150 in late Oct) to a more moderate current level (avg ~95 over P39-P41). The primary operational challenge remains the high volume of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Based on historical data, several orders are confirmed lost: P1(129), P3(18), P4(71), P13(110), P19(25), P26(100), and P34(191), totaling 644 units. The OR backend includes these 644 units in its 'In-transit' accounting, which would lead it to under-order significantly if not corrected. To neutralize this, I am setting mu_hat to the expected demand for the (L+1) period (approx 285 units) plus the 644 units of lost inventory, totaling 929. This ensures the base stock level (mu + z*sigma) is high enough that the subtraction of 644 phantom units still results in a real order that covers upcoming demand. Sigma is set to reflect the higher volatility of the recent peak-to-moderate transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed lost inventory remains 644 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26, P34). Current demand regime (P39-P41) is approx 95 units/week. Mu_hat inflation of +644 must be maintained.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are entering the pre-holiday/winter period. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units over the last 4 periods (P39-P42 avg: 98.25). The most critical issue remains the massive 'phantom' in-transit inventory. As of P42 conclude, total 'In-transit' is 890 units. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', 644 of these units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26, P34). The real pipeline consists only of orders from Period 40 (238 units), Period 42 (8 units), totaling 246 units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders: order = max(0, base_stock - on_hand - in_transit). Since in_transit (890) > base_stock (likely ~300-400), the backend will stop ordering entirely unless we neutralize the 644 phantom units. I will use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to set a value that includes a 644-unit offset. Given the current demand regime (~100 units/week) and a lead time (L=2), the appropriate base demand for (1+L) periods is 300. Adding the 644 offset results in a mu_hat of 944. This ensures the OR logic 'sees' enough demand to overcome the 644 phantom units in the pipeline. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect historical average lead times and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' to capture the current volatility of the ~100 demand regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 (Push Up Jegging) is currently in a high-demand holiday/winter season. Recent demand (P41-P43: 95, 109, 44) shows a dip in the most recent period to 44, but this is likely a temporary fluctuation within a generally higher regime compared to the summer low. The most critical issue remains the massive volume of 'phantom' in-transit inventory consisting of lost orders. Based on carry-over records, the total confirmed lost units are 644 (from orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26, and P34). Current system in-transit is 706. Subtracting the 644 lost units leaves a 'real' pipeline of 62 units (matching orders from P42=8 and P43=54). To prevent the OR backend's capped policy from erroneously stopping orders due to this high phantom inventory, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that includes a +644 offset. I calculate the base demand forecast using a recent 5-period average (~80 units/period). For 3 periods (L+1), this is 240 units. Adding the 644 offset results in a mu_hat of 884. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1-3 periods). Sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' to capture recent demand volatility accurately.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. We are in the final stages of the game (Period 45 of 47). On-hand inventory is 117 units. Demand has shifted from a high autumn peak (115-150 units) to a late Q4 average of approximately 75 units (P41-P44). The system shows 706 units in-transit. Based on historical analysis, 644 of these units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26, P34). The remaining 62 units in the valid pipeline consist of orders from P42 (8 units) and P43 (54 units). Since the OR engine's capped policy subtracts the total pipeline (706) from the base stock, we must continue to inflate mu_hat by +644 to neutralize these 'phantom' units and prevent the system from under-ordering. For demand estimation, I use the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the recent slowdown in December demand (avg ~75), resulting in a base forecast of (1+2)*75 = 225. Adding the 644 offset yields an explicit mu_hat of 869. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 4 periods to capture current volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 46 (Dec 23), we are in the middle of the holiday season and approaching year-end. Historical demand for this 'Push Up Jegging' has shown a slight cooling from the late Sep/Oct highs (~140) to a more moderate Nov/Dec average of approximately 85-90 units (P41-P45 avg: 83.4). The on-hand inventory is 87 units. The reported in-transit of 690 units is still heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' from several lost shipments over the year (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26, and P34). The current total of confirmed lost units is 644 units (129+18+71+110+25+100+191). Subtracting these 644 phantom units from the 690 in-transit leaves a real pipeline of 46 units (the P45 order). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 690 units and stopping orders (due to the base stock minus pipeline calculation), I must explicitly inflate mu_hat by the amount of the phantom inventory (+644). For the base demand, I am using the recent 5-period average (~83), leading to an explicit mu_hat of (1+L)*83 + 644. With L=2, this is 3*83 + 644 = 893. Sigma is set to reflect the higher volatility seen in recent months (recent_N=10).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. Demand has remained relatively stable since November (P40-P46 avg: 85 units). On-hand inventory is low (12 units). Total in-transit is 806 units, but a large portion of this is 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments. Over the game history, we have confirmed lost orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 19, 26, and 34, totaling 644 units. These units will likely never arrive but are counted by the OR backend's capped policy as available pipeline, which would prevent it from ordering enough to meet current demand. To neutralize this, I continue to use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to the expected demand for the lead time window (3 periods, avg ~85/week = 255) plus the 644 units of phantom inventory, totaling 899. This ensures the OR logic 'sees' a requirement that compensates for the fake entries in its pipeline accounting. Sigma_hat is set to a recent window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand regime remains stable (avg ~85 units/week since P40). Phantom inventory total remains at 644 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P26, P34), requiring constant mu_hat adjustment until the game ends or the system clears them.
