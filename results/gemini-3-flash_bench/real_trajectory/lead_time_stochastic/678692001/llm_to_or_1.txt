Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is a 'DEXTER TANK', a sports vest top for ladies. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) show: 270, 196, 180, 187, 137. The mean of these 5 samples is 194. Standard deviation is approx 47.9. Demand appears to be trending downward from the first sample, settling into a range between 137-196 in the most recent 4 weeks. Given the promised lead time (L=2), we need to cover demand for (L+1)=3 periods. Using recent_N=4 for demand allows us to capture the more stable recent trend while discarding the higher outlier from 2019-01-07. L is set to default (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). In Period 1, we placed an order for 219 units. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start observation. There were no units on hand in Period 1, so all 84 units of demand were lost. The historical demand data (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a declining trend: 270, 196, 180, 187, 137. The Period 1 demand of 84 units further confirms this downward trend as we move away from January. The product is a 'sports vest top', which might see lower demand in February compared to New Year's resolution peaks in January. Moving forward, L is set to 'default' (2) as we have no evidence of delay yet. For demand (mu_hat), the most recent regime (last 3 samples: 187, 137, 84) shows a mean of 136. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent deceleration. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a sports vest top ('DEXTER TANK'). Historical demand samples from January (270, 196, 180, 187, 137) show an average around 194. However, Period 1 and 2 recorded lower demand (84, 121), though these are likely influenced by stockouts (ending inventory 0, sold 0). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Order P1 (219 units) was placed at the start of Period 1 and is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at Period 4 start). Order P2 (221 units) is expected in Period 4. Total in-transit is 440. Current on-hand is 0. Since we are in late February moving into Spring, sports apparel demand is expected to remain steady or rise. I will use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the pre-launch and initial demand signals, acknowledging that true demand realization is currently throttled by lack of stock.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU '678692001' is a sports vest top. Demand history shows 270, 196, 180, 187, 137 (pre-game) and 84, 121, 108 (concluded periods). The mean demand over the last 5 samples is approximately 127. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Orders placed in P1 (219 units), P2 (221 units), and P3 (108 units) are in-transit (Total 548). Promised lead time is 2. Per the timing rules, the P1 order (ordered P1, L=2) should arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in the P3 conclude message. However, P3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or there is a delay. Since we are in the decision phase of P4, we expect the P1 order to have arrived during P3 but it's not reflected yet, or it will arrive during P4. To prevent over-ordering while waiting for the 548 units in the pipeline, I will set L=3 (explicitly reflecting the observed delay) and mu_hat based on recent demand levels (N=5, including the last 3 game periods and 2 pre-game to capture the cooling trend).

Carry-over insight: Lead time is currently exceeding promised 2 periods; P1 order (placed 2019/2/11) not arrived by P3 conclude.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a loose-fitting sports vest top, which typically sees stable to increasing demand as spring approaches. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks: 270, 196, 180, 187, 137) show a downward trend from January, but recent game history (Period 1-4 demand: 84, 121, 108, 136) shows a recovery/stabilization phase. Lead time analysis: The Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2), but the Period 1 order (placed at the start of P1) has not arrived as of the end of Period 4, which is concerning. Either Period 1's order is lost or the lead time is highly variable. Given we have 85 units on hand and 416 (P1, P3, P4) still in transit, the primary risk is the missing P1 shipment. I will set L to 3 to account for the possibility of extended lead times or potential losses, and use recent demand (N=4 from the game history) to reflect the recent demand levels (~112 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Shipment from Period 1 (placed 2019/2/11) is now effectively 4 periods late or lost, while Period 2 shipment arrived on time in 2 periods. High lead-time variance detected.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a sports tank top, and historical data + recent demand shows a clear upward trend (Period 4: 136, Period 5: 142) compared to the initial weeks (avg ~100). On-hand inventory is currently 0, largely because the Period 1 order (219 units) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost, while the Period 2 order arrived on time. This loss created a stockout in Period 5. To recover, I need to account for the lost pipeline inventory. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~128/period). Because the Period 1 order is lost, the OR's internal 'pipeline' calculation will be inflated by 219 units (it thinks they are coming). To force the engine to order enough to cover the stockout and current demand, I will use an 'explicit' lead time of 3. Even though actual lead time for successful orders is 2, setting L=3 increases the base stock target (covering more periods) which helps offset the units 'hidden' in the dead pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (219 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed vs 2 promised). Demand regime shift: Period 3-5 average demand is 128.6, up from previous weeks (+28%).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/25. We are entering the spring season for sports apparel (Loose-fitting sports vest top), where demand typically increases. Historical demand samples from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04 showed an average of 194. From the conclude messages (P1-P6), demand has averaged 119.8. However, P4-P6 show a higher consistent demand (~135). Inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0 due to a lost shipment from Period 1 and high demand. In-transit includes orders from P3 (108 units), P4 (89 units), and P6 (155 units). The P5 order arrived in only 1 period, while the P2 order arrived in 2. The P1 order is confirmed lost. Because of the stockout (Sold < Demand in P5 and P6) and the lost P1 shipment, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (avg ~135) and set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (1+L) factor. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 135 = 405. For volatility, I will use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand variance. L is set to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the observed lead times (1 and 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 135 units/period over the last 3 periods. Lead time remains volatile (observed 1 and 2 periods), with one shipment (P1) lost entirely.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/01. The product is a 'loose-fitting sports vest top', which aligns with spring/summer seasonality where demand typically builds. Demand has shifted from early-period lows (~100) to a stable regime around 130-145 units per week. Lead time is volatile (promised 2, observed 1 and 2, but P1 order is lost). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 571 units in-transit. The OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods). Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat (P4-P7) captures the current stabilized demand regime (avg ~138). sigma_hat is set to default to robustly estimate volatility across the available history. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead-time variability (1 and 2 periods) into the base stock calculation.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Reviewing the history: demand has been very stable over the last 6 periods (P3-P8), averaging 134.5 units (108, 136, 142, 128, 145, 148), which is significantly higher than the initial samples. The product is a 'loose-fitting sports vest top', which aligns with increasing demand as we move into spring/summer. Lead times for concluded orders have been 2, 1, and 2 periods, while the P1 order is confirmed lost. Current on-hand is low (7 units) and in-transit is high (416 units, likely from P3 and P4 orders yet to arrive, though P3 is now significantly overdue). I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=6 to capture the stable higher demand regime (avg ~135). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=6 to reflect the lower volatility in this regime. This will help the OR backend maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand given the current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~135 units/period (P3-P8 average) up from earlier weeks. Seasonal relevance for 'sports vest top' high as spring progresses.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a 'Ladies H&M Sport' vest top, which typically sees rising demand during spring. Historical demand since Period 3 has averaged 128 units/period, although Period 9 dipped to 80 units (likely due to stockouts in previous periods affecting the data or a temporary fluctuation). Given the 'on-hand' is 0 and 439 units are in-transit, we must account for the lost Period 1 order (confirmed lost in carry-over) and the fact that we have been stocking out frequently. The lead time (L) has varied between 1 and 2 periods (ignoring the lost shipment). I will set L to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the regime from Period 3 onwards (including the low Period 9 to remain conservative). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Recurring stockouts (P5-P7, P9) indicate demand exceeds current pipeline efficiency; pipeline inventory of 439 units includes orders from P3 and P4 which are significantly overdue (5-6 weeks) and likely lost like the P1 shipment.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a sports vest top, which is entering its peak seasonal demand phase (Spring/Summer). Historical analysis shows a demand regime shift starting around Period 3/4. Although demand in Period 9 (80) and Period 10 (60) was lower, this was likely due to persistent stockouts leading to censored demand data (sold vs demand mismatch), as on-hand inventory was extremely low. The average demand from Period 4 to Period 8 (where stock was occasionally available or demand was higher) was approximately 139 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 428 is misleading because it includes orders from Period 1 (219 units), Period 3 (108 units), and Period 4 (89 units) - all of which are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time and are almost certainly lost shipments. Only the Period 10 order (12 units) is likely to arrive soon. To address the lost shipments and the upcoming seasonal demand, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 450 (based on a forecast of 150 units/period for L+1 periods, where L=2). I am using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the volatility of the recent high-demand/stockout period. L is set to 'calculate' to account for the observed 1-2 period lead times of successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 3 (108 units) and Period 4 (89 units) are now confirmed lost (7-8 periods elapsed), following the pattern of the lost Period 1 shipment. Pipeline inventory is significantly overstated by 416 units of lost stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we face a critical supply reliability issue. Previous carry-over insights and history confirm that orders from Period 1 (219 units), Period 3 (108 units), and Period 4 (89 units) are lost. This totaling 416 units significantly inflates the 'In-transit' count of 551, leaving only 135 units (from P10 and P11) actually expected to arrive. The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced recurring stockouts (sold=0 in P11). Demand has shifted from a high of ~140 units/period (P4-P8) to roughly 70 units/period (P9-P11). However, the product is a 'sports vest top', which remains seasonally relevant in late spring/early summer. To adjust for the lost shipments and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to perceived high pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat to a high explicit value. I will target a base stock level that covers roughly 4 periods of demand at the current average (approx 75 units/period), while subtracting the only 'real' in-transit units to flush the system. Setting L=2 (promised) but mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to force an order that compensates for the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain reliability is extremely low: approximately 60% of past order volume (P1, P3, P4) has been lost. Real pipeline inventory is 135 units, not 551.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678692001' (sports vest top) is entering its peak season (May). Recent demand levels (P9-P12) have averaged ~74 units, which is lower than the mid-spring peak but likely to rise as temperatures increase. A severe supply chain issue exists: orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 416 units) are lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 848 is highly misleading. Excluding lost stock, the real pipeline is 432 units (P10: 12, P11: 123, P12: 297). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders. Since it sees 848 instead of 432 units, it will severely under-order. To compensate for this 416-unit ghost inventory and the upcoming seasonal demand shift, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I estimate a forward demand of ~100 units/period for the (L+1)=3 period horizon, totaling 300 units; however, to force the OR backend to place an order despite the 416-unit ghost inventory bias, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 850 to ensure the backend recognizes a need for stock given the phantom 848 units in transit. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised), as recent successful arrivals (P9) were within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory data is currently unreliable: 416 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and constitute 'ghost' inventory that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available supply.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). The product is a sports vest top, which aligns with spring/summer seasonality. Demand has recently softened from high points (avg ~91 units over the last 3 periods), though we expect it to remain steady or rise slightly as summer approaches. The primary challenge is the OR backend's calculation of pipeline inventory. Orders from Period 1 (219 units), Period 3 (108 units), and Period 4 (89 units) are confirmed lost (7-12 weeks overdue) but are still being counted in the 'In-transit' figure of 826. Actual healthy pipeline inventory consists of P12 (297 units) and P13 (101 units), totaling 398 units. To force the OR backend to place necessary orders and ignore the 416 units of 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To calculate the explicit value: target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 and average demand ~100 (anticipating summer lift), target pipeline should be ~350-400 units. To offset the 416 'ghost' units, I must artificially inflate the expected demand (mu_hat) so that 'base_stock - 826' generates a positive order. Setting mu_hat to 800 (equivalent to ~266 units/period over lead time) to ensure the system replenishes despite the false pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 416 units of lost 'ghost' stock (P1, P3, P4 orders) which the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. Current healthy pipeline is 398 units (P12, P13).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/20. We are managing a 'DEXTER TANK' sports vest top. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 9 (averaging ~80 units compared to ~140 in earlier periods), likely due to post-spring seasonality or competitive shifts. The primary challenge remains 'ghost' inventory. Orders from Period 1 (219 units), Period 3 (108 units), and Period 4 (89 units) total 416 units. These have never arrived (11-14 weeks overdue) but are still counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory (In-transit: 529). This causes the OR engine to under-order significantly because it 'sees' 416 units that will never arrive. To compensate, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to force the OR backend's target base stock (calculated as mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) to exceed the ghost inventory. The healthy pipeline is currently 113 units (from Period 13) plus whatever is ordered now. By setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 950, I target a base stock high enough to account for the ~80 forecast demand across 3 periods (L+1), plus the 416 ghost units, plus a safety buffer. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to ensure the safety stock component remains meaningful despite the ghost units. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P11, P12) show lead times of 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 416 units of permanent 'ghost' stock (P1, P3, P4) that will never conclude. Forecast shifted to lower volume (~80 units/period) since Period 9.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/27. Demand has stabilized at a lower level since early April; the average demand from Period 9 to Period 15 is approximately 79.5 units per period. The primary challenge remains 'ghost' inventory: 416 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but still count towards the In-transit total (850). The 'real' pipeline consists of orders from P13 (101 units) and P15 (321 units), plus the fresh order from P16. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 416 ghost units, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset them. I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods of expected demand (~240 units) PLUS the 416 lost units, totaling 656 units. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P11, P12) have normalized to the promised 2-period lead time. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7, covering the stable lower-demand regime) to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~80 units/period (P9-P15 average). Ghost inventory (lost shipments P1, P3, P4) persists at 416 units, requiring artificial inflation of mu_hat to ensure the OR engine maintains a healthy supply.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: June 2019, 'Dexter Tank' sports vest top demand remains in a stable lower regime (avg ~81 units over P9-P16) compared to earlier months. Supply Chain Issue: 416 units of in-transit inventory (from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4) are confirmed lost and have become 'ghost inventory' that the OR backend erroneously includes in its pipeline calculation (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)). To maintain a healthy real supply, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset these 416 lost units. The OR backend uses mu_hat = (1+L) * forecasted_demand. With a promised lead time (L=2) of 3 total periods cover (1+L), a target mu_hat of ~660 (81 * 3 + 416 ghost units + safety buffer) is required to neutralize the ghost units and trigger meaningful orders. Recently, the backend has received orders from P13 (arriving) and P15 (in transit, 321 units). We need to sustain this buffer until the ghost inventory is no longer part of the calculation or real supply is sufficient. I set mu_hat to 660 and sigma_hat explicitly to capture recent volatility (standard deviation of P9-P16 is approx 11, across 3 periods ~19, setting explicit buffer at 45).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for the 'DEXTER TANK' has shifted to a lower regime compared to the early spring peak, stabilizing at approximately 85 units/period over the last 9 periods (P9-P17). The primary challenge continues to be 416 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments in P1, P3, and P4 (219 + 108 + 89). These units remain in the 'In-transit' figure (529 units total), leading the OR engine to believe the supply pipeline is healthier than it is. Real pipeline inventory is just 113 units. To compensate, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. Using the 'explicit' method, I set mu_hat = (Forecast * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. With a forecast of 85 and L=2, mu_hat = (85 * 3) + 416 = 671. This ensures the base stock calculation targets a level that accounts for the unusable ghost stock. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=9) to capture the volatility of this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~85 units/period (P9-P17 average). Permanent ghost inventory of 416 units (P1, P3, P4) persists and must be offset in mu_hat calculations to prevent stockouts.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/6/17), the demand for the 'DEXTER TANK' has stabilized at a lower regime compared to the early spring peak. The average demand from Period 9 to Period 18 is approximately 84 units per week. The critical operational challenge remains the 'ghost inventory': 416 units from orders in Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit 529 - Healthy In-transit 113 = 416 lost). The OR engine uses (net_inventory = on_hand + in_transit) to calculate orders. Currently, it sees 194 (on-hand) + 529 (in-transit) = 723 units. With a target base stock for a (2+1) period window and demand of ~84, the engine thinks we are overstocked. However, 416 units are non-existent. To force the engine to maintain enough physical stock, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide an inflated demand value that offsets the ghost inventory. Target Base Stock \u2248 (\u03bc * (L+1)) + (z * \u03c3 * sqrt(L+1)). With \u03bc=84, L=2, target is ~252 + safety stock. To prevent the engine from seeing 723 units and ordering nothing, I set mu_hat to 190 (which scales to 190 * 3 = 570 in the engine's internal logic) to bridge the gap created by the 416 ghost units, ensuring that once on-hand drops further, fresh orders are triggered despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Persistent ghost inventory of 416 units (Orders P1, P3, P4) continues to inflate pipeline inventory, requiring mu_hat to be set higher than actual demand to ensure the backend continues ordering replenishable stock.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for this sports vest top has settled into a regime of approximately 92 units/period (mean of P13-P19). However, a critical issue persists: the 'In-transit' inventory of 529 units is heavily inflated by 416 units from lost orders in P1, P3, and P4 (219 + 108 + 89). These units will never arrive but are counted by the OR engine as upcoming supply. To ensure the backend places necessary orders, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset this 'ghost' inventory. Since the formula for the order is 'base_stock - pipeline', and base_stock is roughly '(1+L) * mu_hat', I need to set (1+L) * mu_hat approximately equal to (Actual Demand * (1+L)) + Lost Inventory. With L=2, (1+L)=3. Target mu_hat = (92 * 3 + 416) / 3 \u2248 230. Setting mu_hat to 230 via the explicit method ensures that the backend realizes the current real pipeline (113 units) is insufficient to cover the demand buffer, preventing future stockouts.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), the product (Loose-fitting sports vest top) is in high summer season. Demand from Period 9 to 20 has averaged approximately 87 units/period, but has shown peaks up to 128 (Period 19), suggesting sustained summer interest. The critical issue remains the 'ghost inventory': 416 units from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4 are permanently lost but still reflect in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 529; Ghost: 416; Real: 113). The on-hand inventory is currently 0. To prevent the OR engine from stopping orders due to the inflated 529 units in transit, I must set mu_hat (target base stock) significantly higher than real demand. Real pipeline + current stock = 113 units. Target stock for L=2 should be (1+L)*mean_demand = 3 * 87 = 261 units plus a safety margin. To force an order despite the 416 ghost units, the base stock (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) must exceed 529. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 615 (representing 205 per period across 1+L=3 periods) to ensure the system places a replenishment order for roughly 100-150 units to sustain summer demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678692001 (DEXTER TANK) is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a demand of 42 in Period 21. The demand regime has stabilized between 70-100 units since Period 9, averaging approximately 85 units. However, there is a persistent supply chain issue: orders from P1 (219), P3 (108), and P4 (89) totaling 416 units are confirmed lost/ghost inventory. The backend OR engine incorrectly includes these 416 units in 'In-transit' (currently 668), meaning it perceives effectively 416 units of buffer that do not exist. To force the backend to place an order despite this ghost inventory, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of actual demand plus the ghost inventory offset. With L=2 and average demand ~85, the required base stock is ~255 units. To overcome 416 units of ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set to at least 416 + 255 = 671. I will set mu_hat to 700 to ensure a robust order is triggered and account for seasonality in July for sports apparel.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678692001' (sports vest top) is currently in a period of high seasonality transition as it is mid-July. Historical demand since Period 15 has shown significant volatility (ranging from 25 to 128 units), with a notable drop in the last two periods (42, 25). However, a significant operational hurdle exists: the presence of 416 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4) which occupy the 'In-transit' pipeline. The OR backend uses the logic 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders. Currently, In-transit is 766 units; subtracting the 416 ghost units leaves a real pipeline of 350 units (corresponding to orders from P13, P21, P22). To force the backend to place an order despite the 416 units of ghost stock it wrongly counts, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. I forecast actual demand at approximately 85 units per period (the average since P9). For a lead time of 2, the required (1+L) base mu_hat would be 255. To offset the 416 ghost units and ensure the backend continues to replenish, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 255 + 416 = 671. This ensures the engine maintains a base stock level that accounts for the fact that nearly 55% of the reported pipeline inventory is non-existent.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'DEXTER TANK' has entered a significant downward trend as we move into late July. The average demand from Period 21-23 dropped to 34.3 units, compared to the previously stabilized regime of ~85 units. This likely reflects the end-of-season decline for sports vest tops. Lead times have remained relatively stable at 1-2 periods, but the system still carries 416 units of 'ghost inventory' from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (219+108+89=416). Current in-transit is 530 units, meaning the 'healthy' pipeline is 114 units (recent orders from P23). On-hand inventory is 201 units. To prevent the OR engine from stopping orders due to the ghost stock while accounting for the lower demand, I will set mu_hat using the recent N=3 periods of demand (avg ~34) but explicitly add the ghost inventory value (416) divided by (1+L) to the forecast. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat * (1+L)) neutralizes the ghost units in 'in-transit'. mu_hat = (34 * 3) + 416 = 518. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to reflect the lower volatility in this new lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: average demand decreased from ~85 to ~34 (-60%), indicating end-of-season for this product category.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'DEXTER TANK' is a sports vest top, which is seeing a significant end-of-season decline as we enter late July (Period 25). The demand regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (Period 24) is confirmed, with the last 4 periods (P21-P24) showing an average demand of 33 units (42, 25, 36, 29), down from the ~85 units observed previously. On-hand inventory is currently 172 units, which already covers roughly 5 periods of current demand. Additionally, There is a persistent 'ghost inventory' of 416 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4) that are confirmed lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' total (530 - 416 = 114 real units in transit). The real pipeline inventory is 286 units (172 on-hand + 114 real in-transit), which is more than sufficient for the remainder of the season. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect this lower demand regime. To prevent the OR engine from ordering more due to the ghost inventory, I am keeping mu_hat at its literal forecast for the lead time, but since on-hand already exceeds the necessary base stock for 33 units/period, the engine should naturally stop ordering.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'DEXTER TANK' is a sports vest top, which is experiencing a late-summer (August) demand decline. Demand has shifted from a mid-season average of ~85 units (P9-P20) to a significantly lower end-of-season average of ~31 units over the last 5 periods (P21-P25). Additionally, the system continues to track 416 units of 'ghost inventory' from orders placed in P1, P3, and P4 that are long-lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 151 units, which covers nearly 5 weeks of current demand. Including the ghost stock, the backend sees an 'in-transit' total of 530 units (416 ghost + 114 actual from P23 and subsequent potential ordering logic). This massive overstatement of pipeline inventory by the ghost units requires me to set mu_hat high enough to 'override' the ghost stock and allow the system to order if needed, or simply let the on-hand inventory deplete naturally. Given the sharp decline in demand and healthy on-hand stock, the priority is to avoid further holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the recent low-demand regime (N=5) but must account for the 416 ghost units in the OR engine's pipeline calculation to prevent the stock level from dropping below zero in the long term, though currently, we are overstocked for the season.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'DEXTER TANK', a loose-fitting sports vest top, likely approaching the end of its summer season. Demand has significantly decreased since Period 21, averaging 27.5 units over the last 6 periods, compared to the spring average of ~85. Current on-hand inventory is 140 units, which covers over 5 weeks of current demand. Pipeline inventory (529 units) is heavily contaminated by 'ghost inventory' (416 units from P1, P3, P4) that was previously lost. Adjusting for this, the actual healthy pipeline consists of 113 units from various periods. However, the OR backend sees 'in-transit' as 529. To prevent the OR backend from seeing excessive supply and stopping all orders (should they be needed) and to account for the season-end decline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the low-demand regime shift. I will continue to set mu_hat explicitly to offset the ghost inventory (416 units) if needed, but given the current on-hand surplus (140 units) and the low end-of-season demand (avg 27.5), a naturally decreasing base_stock is appropriate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand parameters to reflect the late-summer drop-off.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~27 units/period since Period 21, confirming end-of-season decline for sports vest tops. Ghost inventory of 416 units remains but is less critical given high surface inventory and low current demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'DEXTER TANK' sports vest top, which is experiencing a late-summer (August) demand decline. Since Period 21, the demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower level, averaging approximately 26 units per period (sample: 42, 25, 36, 29, 21, 12, 18). Currently, on-hand inventory is 122 units, which covers nearly 5 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 529 units is heavily skewed by 416 units of permanent 'ghost' stock (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4) which will never arrive. The real pipeline inventory consists of the remainder (113 units), though no orders have been placed recently. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low end-of-season demand, the priority is to avoid accumulating more holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this low-demand regime, and use the default lead time (L=2) as the system has recently stabilized back to 1-2 period arrivals.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'sports vest top', which is showing a clear end-of-season decline as we move into late August (Period 29). Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 21, with the last 8 periods averaging approximately 24 units. Specifically, the most recent 3 periods show even lower demand (12, 18, 8). On-hand inventory is 114 units, which is more than enough to cover projected demand for the next 4-5 periods at current rates. The pipeline inventory of 529 units is heavily skewed by the 416 units of 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4) as detailed in the carry-over insights. However, even excluding the ghost stock, the current on-hand inventory is sufficient given the seasonal drop. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the post-peak demand regime, and using 'default' for lead time as recent arrivals (P21, P22, P23) have reverted to the promised 1-3 period window, though the OR engine's logic is less sensitive now due to the high on-hand stock relative to demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'DEXTER TANK' is in a low-demand end-of-season regime, with average demand over the last 9 periods (P21-P29) at 22.2 units. Current on-hand inventory is 105 units, which covers nearly 5 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 529 units is heavily skewed by the 416 units of persistent 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, and P4) and potentially more recent discrepancies. Specifically, in-transit (529) minus ghost stock (416) leaves 113 units of 'real' pipeline. Total real position (On-hand 105 + Real Pipeline 113) is 218 units, far exceeding the requirements for the current demand regime. To prevent the OR backend from ordering more unnecessary stock while it incorrectly believes the pipeline is full, I am using 'explicit' parameters. mu_hat is set to the current demand mean (~22) multiplied by (1+L) where L=2, totaling 66. This ensures no new orders are triggered until on-hand and real pipeline levels drop significantly.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'DEXTER TANK' is a sports vest top, which is experiencing a late-season decline as we move into September (Period 31). Demand has plummeted from an average of ~85 units/period in June to less than 10 units/period over the last three weeks (P28-P30). Average demand since the regime shift at Period 21 is ~21 units/period, but most recent samples (P28-P30) average only 7.7. I will use recent_N=10 to capture this downward trend while maintaining some safety stock. The pipeline inventory (529 units) is heavily distorted by 416 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P1, P3, P4) plus a leftover order from P13 (101 units) that hasn't arrived despite 18 weeks passing, effectively making 517 units of the 529 in-transit 'lost'. Real in-transit is likely 12 units or less, but on-hand stock (99 units) is already sufficient to cover nearly 10 periods of current demand. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are placed by the OR backend, as we are significantly overstocked for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Nearly 98% of in-transit inventory (517 of 529 units) is confirmed lost/ghost stock from P1, P3, P4, and P13. Demand has further declined to ~8 units/period, confirming deep end-of-season behavior.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (sport vest top) has entered deep end-of-season decline, with weekly demand dropping to single digits (average of ~6 units over the last 4 weeks). On-hand inventory is 97 units, which provides over 10 periods of coverage at current demand levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 529 units is predominantly composed of ghost inventory (416 units from P1, P3, P4) and potentially a lost shipment from P13 (101 units, now 19 periods overdue). Regardless of the ghost inventory, the current on-hand stock is more than sufficient. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the low-demand regime and avoid any further ordering while holding costs remain a factor. No adjustments for ghost inventory are necessary this period because on-hand stock is already excessive.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'DEXTER TANK' is a sports vest top, which is experiencing a significant end-of-season decline. Demand has dropped from ~135 units in late spring to ~8 units in late August/early September, and reached as low as 2 units in the most recent periods (P31, P32). On-hand inventory is currently 95 units, which provides over 10 weeks of coverage at current demand rates. Pipeline inventory remains heavily inflated by 517 units of 'ghost stock' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13). Given the extreme seasonal low and high existing stock compared to demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) to capture the current minimal demand baseline (~5 units/period). This will prevent any further ordering by the OR backend as current on-hand inventory is more than sufficient.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'sports vest top', which is showing deep end-of-season behavior as of late September (Period 34). Demand has crashed from ~135 units in spring to ~5 units/period currently. On-hand inventory is 90 units, which covers over 10 periods of current demand. However, the 'In-transit' count of 529 units is critically misleading because roughly 517 units are known 'ghost stock' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P13) that will never arrive. The OR backend uses (Inventory + In-transit) to decide orders; since 90 (on-hand) + 529 (in-transit) = 619, and the backend expects a demand around mu_hat, it will not order more. While we don't need more stock due to 90 units on hand, the L/mu_hat/sigma_hat parameters must reflect the current low-demand regime (Period 31-33 avg = 3 units). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this minimal demand and prevent unnecessary holding costs, while keeping L at default as lead time variance is irrelevant when inventory is excessive.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor reached: Periods 31-33 show average demand of 3 units/period. On-hand inventory (90) is sufficient for the remaining periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Ladies H&M Sport' vest top, which is highly seasonal. Current date is October 7th (Period 35), and the demand history shows a clear end-of-season decline. Specifically, demand has plummeted from ~130 units in the spring/summer peak to an average of just 3 units/period over the last 4 weeks (Periods 31-34). On-hand inventory is currently 87 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining periods of the game (up to Period 47) at the current demand rate (~3 units/period * 12 periods = 36 units). Pipeline inventory remains heavily inflated by 'ghost' stock (416 units from P1, P3, P4 and likely more from P13), but given the high on-hand volume relative to low demand, this no longer poses a stockout risk. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current deep end-of-season demand floor. No further ordering is required.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (DEXTER TANK sports vest) has reached the end of its seasonal demand cycle. Since Period 31, weekly demand has plummeted to a range of 0-5 units (average ~2.4). Current on-hand inventory is 87 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining demand for the game's duration (ending Period 47) given the current run rate. There is a persistent 'ghost' inventory of 517 units in the pipeline (from lost orders P1, P3, P4, and P13) which represents 97.7% of the 'In-transit' total. Since the on-hand stock is more than sufficient and we want to avoid further holding costs, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit low value (0) to ensure the OR engine does not place any new orders, despite the ghost inventory potentially lowering the perceived pipeline coverage. This will allow natural depletion of the 87 units on hand.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor confirmed: demand averaged ~2.4 units/period from P31-P35. Existing on-hand inventory (87) is sufficient for all remaining periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678692001 (sports vest top) is in a deep end-of-season demand floor. Demand from Period 31 to Period 36 has averaged approximately 3 units per week (2, 2, 5, 3, 0, 6). Current on-hand inventory is 81 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 11 periods of the campaign (estimated total remaining demand < 40 units). In-transit inventory of 529 units is predominantly composed of 'ghost' stock (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P13 totaling 517 units) that will never arrive. As the current stock far exceeds any foreseeable demand and the pipeline is artificially inflated by lost orders, I am setting parameters to ensure no further orders are placed. I will use a very low mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 6 periods of floor demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (678692001 - DEXTER TANK) is at its deep end-of-season floor, with Period 38 occurring in late October. Demand over the last several periods has been minimal (averaging ~2 units since P31). There are 80 units on-hand, which is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 9 periods of the game given the current demand trajectory. Furthermore, there is 529 units in-transit, 517 of which are confirmed 'ghost' stock (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P13) that will never arrive. Because on-hand inventory is already high relative to demand and the end-of-game is approaching, I will maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat at minimum levels to prevent the OR engine from placing any new orders, as any further arrivals would only increase holding costs without generating additional sales.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'sports vest top', and the current date is November 4th (Period 39). Demand has reached a stable end-of-season floor, with an average of approximately 3 units per period over the last 8 weeks (P31-P38). The current on-hand inventory is 74 units, which is significantly more than the total expected demand for the remaining 8 periods of the game (total demand likely < 30 units). The in-transit inventory of 529 units is almost entirely composed of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P13 that were lost). To prevent unnecessary holding costs and avoid further ordering, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime using the most recent 8 samples. Given the massive surplus of on-hand stock relative to remaining demand, the goal is to stop all procurement.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019 (Period 40). The product is a 'loose-fitting sports vest top', which is showing deep end-of-season demand patterns as expected for late autumn. Demand from Period 31 to 39 has averaged 3.0 units per period. With 72 units currently on-hand and only 7 periods remaining in the simulation, the current inventory is already 3.5x higher than the total projected demand for the remainder of the game (approx. 21 units). There is a persistent 'ghost' inventory of 517 units in the in-transit pipeline (from lost orders P1, P3, P4, and P13) which the OR engine incorrectly views as incoming supply. However, since on-hand inventory (72) already far exceeds any possible demand floor needed for the rest of the season, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from triggering any unnecessary orders despite the 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period window, which captures the low-demand floor of ~3 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678692001 (sports vest top) is at the very end of its seasonal lifecycle (Period 41 of 47). Current demand is extremely low, averaging ~3 units per period over the last 10 periods (P31-P40). On-hand inventory is 69 units, which is significantly more than the total expected demand for the remaining 7 periods (~21 units). There is also a persistent 'ghost' in-transit inventory of 517 units (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P13) that has not arrived for over 25 periods. Given that on-hand stock is more than double the required quantity for the rest of the game, no new orders are necessary. To prevent the OR backend from ordering, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the current floor demand, which will result in a base stock level well below the 69 units currently on hand, even with the ghost inventory inflating the pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019): We are in the final stages of the game (6 periods remaining). The product, a sports vest top, is in its deep off-season floor with demand averaging ~3 units per period since Period 31. Current on-hand inventory is 67 units, which is significantly more than the total expected demand for the remaining 6 periods (projected at ~18-20 units total). The in-transit inventory of 529 units is almost entirely comprised of 'ghost' stock (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P13 totaling 517 units) which will never arrive. Given the excessive on-hand inventory and minimal demand, no further orders are required. I will maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat at levels reflective of the current low-demand regime to prevent any automated replenishment, as the holding cost of 1.0/unit/period now outweighs the necessity of high service levels for such low volume.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (sport vest top) is in a deep end-of-season phase as of December 2nd. Demand has stabilized at a floor of approximately 3 units per period (average of the last 12 periods is 3.0 units). In-transit inventory of 529 units is heavily comprised of 'ghost' stock (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P13 totaling 517 units). Current on-hand inventory of 63 units is more than sufficient to cover the 5 remaining periods (P43-P47) even at the highest observed demand in this regime. Consequently, there is no need to place further orders. Parameters are set to reflect this low-demand state while relying on existing on-hand stock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (December 9, 2019) out of 47 total periods. The product is a 'Loose-fitting sports vest top', which is seasonally irrelevant in December. Demand has reached a stable floor, averaging approximately 2.8 units per period over the last 10 periods (P34-P43). Current on-hand inventory is 62 units, which is more than enough to cover the remaining 4 periods of the simulation (Periods 44, 45, 46, 47) even at the most optimistic demand estimates. In-transit inventory of 529 units is almost entirely composed of 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P13 totaling 517 units). To prevent the OR engine from ordering more and incurring unnecessary holding costs while ensuring it recognizes the current on-hand stock is sufficient, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the true low-demand regime, while keeping L at the default promised lead time. The high inventory relative to demand will naturally result in zero orders.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the deep end-of-season for this sports vest top. Current demand is negligible, averaging approximately 2.6 units per period since Period 36 (dating back to mid-October). The on-hand inventory of 59 units is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 2 periods of the game (Periods 46 and 47) even at the historical peak for this regime. Lead time and ghost inventory (517 units) are irrelevant now because the replenishment engine should not be triggered. No further orders are required. I will maintain parameters that reflect the current low demand floor to ensure no new orders are placed, effectively allowing the remaining inventory to satisfy the tail-end demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 of 47, entering the final two weeks of the year. The product (a sports vest top) is at the very end of its seasonal cycle, with demand averaging approximately 2.2 units per period over the last five weeks (P41-P45). On-hand inventory is 58 units, which is significantly more than the total expected demand for the remaining two periods (~4-6 units total). The in-transit inventory of 529 units contains approximately 517 units of confirmed 'ghost' stock (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P13) which never arrived. No further ordering is required to meet the minimal remaining demand. I am setting L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized, low-demand state to ensure the OR backend does not place any unnecessary orders.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the final period of the simulation. The product is a 'sports vest top', which is currently in a deep end-of-season demand floor. Over the last 15 periods (since Period 31), demand has averaged approximately 2.6 units per period, with the most recent week showing only 1 unit of demand. There is an on-hand inventory of 57 units, which is far more than enough to cover any remaining demand for this period. Additionally, the 'In-transit' figure of 529 units is heavily composed of 'ghost stock' (416 units confirmed lost from Periods 1, 3, and 4, plus an additional missing shipment of 101 units from Period 13 which is now 34 weeks overdue). Since this is the final period and inventory levels are sufficient, no further ordering is required. Parameters are set to reflect this stable, low-demand state to ensure the backend does not place unnecessary orders.
