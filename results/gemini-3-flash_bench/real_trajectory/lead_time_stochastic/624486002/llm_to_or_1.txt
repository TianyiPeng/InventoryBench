Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Brit Baby Tee', a jersey basic product. Initial inventory is zero. Looking at the five provided demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4: 47, 51, 71, 68, 66), we see an upward shift after the first two weeks, stabilizing around a mean of 68.25 over the last four weeks or 60.6 overall. Given the product is a short-sleeved basic tee, demand may continue to rise as we move toward spring. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current mean and volatility. Promised lead time is 2, and there is no historical data yet to suggest it differs from the actual lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the item description (Brit Baby Tee, short-sleeved jersey top) and the date, we are entering the pre-spring season where demand for basic tees typically starts to climb. Historically, demand for the last 5 samples was [47, 51, 71, 68, 66], averaging 60.6. However, in Period 1 (the week of 2019-02-11), we saw a significant demand spike to 86, resulting in lost sales because the initial on-hand was 0. This suggests a seasonal shift or an upward trend. The promised lead time is 2 periods; an order of 79 was placed in P1 and is expected to arrive in P3. For P2, since we have 0 on-hand and the P1 order is in-transit, we need to set parameters to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the review period (1). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the higher recent demand levels (71, 68, 66, and the observed 86 in P1), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee' (short-sleeved ribbed cotton jersey), which is a spring/summer fashion item. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averaged ~60.6 units/week. However, recent demand in Period 1 (86) and Period 2 (85) shows a significant step-up (+40%), likely due to the arrival of spring and warmer weather transitions. Current inventory is 0 with 167 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (79 units) is expected to arrive in Period 3 (viewable in P4), and the Period 2 order (88 units) in Period 4 (viewable in P5). My goal is to set parameters that reflect this higher demand regime to prevent stockouts while balancing the high holding cost (Profit $1 vs Holding $1). I'm increasing mu_hat using the most recent 2 samples to capture the 85-86 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: avg demand increased from ~60 to ~85 (+41%) as spring season begins.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a 'Brit Baby Tee', which is a spring/summer seasonal item. Historical demand showed an increase at the start of February (avg ~85), though Period 3 saw a dip to 56. I will maintain the 'recent_N' approach (N=3) for demand to reflect the most recent regime. Regarding lead time: the promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (placed 2019-02-11) should have arrived during Period 3 (2019-02-25) and been visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Since we have on-hand inventory of 0 and demand is being lost, I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect this observed delay and increase the base stock level via mu_hat (which scales with 1+L) to account for the longer pipeline requirements.

Carry-over insight: Lead time delay: Period 1 order (L=2 promised) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude, indicating actual lead time is at least 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-28.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data shows a complex lead time situation: the order from Period 2 (placed 2019/2/18) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2), but the order from Period 1 (placed 2019/2/11) is still missing as of the Period 4 conclusion (it should have arrived in Period 3 if L=2). Since the Period 2 order was fulfilled while Period 1 was not, there is a risk that the Period 1 order (79 units) is lost. Current inventory is 58 units with 215 units in-transit (Period 1, 3, and 4 orders). Demand has been volatile: after an initial surge to 86 and 85, it dropped to 56 and 30. This 'Brit Baby Tee' is a seasonal spring item; the dip in Period 4 (demand=30) might be a temporary fluctuation or a stabilization of the initial spring surge. Given the potential loss of the Period 1 order, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to increase the safety buffer and utilize recent_N (N=4) for demand to capture the higher mean of the current spring regime (avg ~64) compared to the pre-February data, while adjusting for the recent dip.

Carry-over insight: Potential lost shipment: Period 1 order (79 units) is overdue (placed P1, not arrived by P4 conclude) despite Period 2 order arriving successfully; pipeline inventory may be overstated.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Period 1 order (79 units) is confirmed lost/void as it has not arrived by Period 5 conclude, while the Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2). This loss significantly impacts the backend's calculation of pipeline inventory (it thinks 215 units are in-transit, but 79 are likely gone, leaving an effective pipeline of 136). We are currently in Period 6 (Mid-March), and the product (Baby Tee) is heading into peak spring season. Historical demand in the new regime (since late Feb) is roughly 60 units/week, though recent samples (30, 52) show volatility. To compensate for the lost shipment and prevent stockouts while the OR backend overestimates pipeline, I will set 'mu_hat' explicitly higher than the current mean to force an order. I am using L=2 (promised) since the Period 2 order validated it, but I will monitor for further delays.

Carry-over insight: P1 shipment (79 units) confirmed lost: P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2), but P1 order remains missing by P5 conclude. Pipeline inventory is likely overstated by 79 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Brit Baby Tee' is currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand 0). Analysis of lead times confirms that while L=2 (promised) was met for the Period 2 order, the Period 1 order (79 units) is officially lost as it has not arrived after 5 periods. The current 'In-transit' of 234 units likely includes these 79 ghost units, making the pipeline look healthier than it is. Demand in Period 6 spiked to 128 units (Date: 2019/3/18), likely due to the spring transition for a baby tee product. Over the last 4 periods (P3-P6), demand averaged 66.5 units, but with a significant jump last week. Given the back-to-back stockouts and the lost shipment, I must raise the base stock level significantly. I will set L to 2 (promised is generally reliable despite one loss), mu_hat to 210 (based on a revised forecast of ~70 units/week * 3 periods), and sigma_hat to 80 (to account for the high volatility observed in P6 and ensure a higher service level during spring). This 'explicit' approach for mu_hat bypasses the pipeline inflation caused by the lost 79 units because the OR engine's formula (base_stock - pipeline) will still deduct them, so I must inflate base_stock to compensate.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: P6 demand spike (128 units) confirms high volatility/seasonality for Jersey basics in late March. Historical average calculated by OR engine is likely under-forecasting current demand regime.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a 'Jersey Basic' baby tee, which is entering peak spring/summer season. Demand has spiked significantly in the last two periods (128 units in P6, 138 units in P7), far exceeding the initial baseline of ~85. Current on-hand inventory is 0. A crucial issue is the pipeline inventory: 234 units are 'in-transit', but 79 of those (from P1) are confirmed lost. The internal OR engine's 'capped policy' subtracts the full 234 units from the base_stock, which will lead to severe under-ordering unless we inflate parameters. The current demand regime (last 3 periods: 52, 128, 138) averages ~106 units/period. With L=2, mu_hat should ideally reflect (1+2)*106 = 318. However, to compensate for the 79 units 'ghost' inventory that the OR engine will subtract, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 400 (320 units for demand + 80 units offset). I will also use an explicit sigma_hat of 70 to account for high volatility seen in the recent spring spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Average demand increased to ~106 units/period (last 3 samples) driven by spring seasonality. Previous average was ~85.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Brit Baby Tee' (Jersey Basic) is experiencing a significant demand surge due to spring seasonality (latest demand 175, 138, 128). The current mean demand over the last 3 periods is ~147, vastly higher than the initial regime. We are currently out of stock (ending on-hand 0). Pipeline inventory is 381 units, but this includes a 79-unit order from Period 1 confirmed lost in Carry-over Insights (total effective pipeline = 302). Additionally, the system experienced several periods of stockouts (P1-P3, P6-P8), so demand has consistently outstripped supply. To capture the current seasonal peak and recover stock levels, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current high-demand regime (~147/period). I will set L to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P2 and P6) have arrived on time. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the high volatility observed during this transition (std dev of 128, 138, 175 is approx 24.5; sqrt(3)*24.5 \u2248 42).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average demand increased further to ~147 units/period (last 3 samples) reflecting peak spring seasonality. Previous regime was ~106.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15, 2019. We are in the peak spring season for basic jersey 'Brit Baby Tees'. Demand has increased significantly over the last three periods (P7-P9) with readings of 138, 175, and 177, averaging ~163 units per period. This confirms a sustained demand regime shift. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced several periods of lost sales due to being understocked. Current in-transit is 441, but this includes the lost 79-unit order from Period 1 (confirmed lost in P6) and an order of 215 from P8 (still in transit). To address the lost shipment inflating pipeline inventory and the high recent demand, I am using explicit parameters. I set L to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals have been consistent with this. For mu_hat, I am using a demand forecast of 165 units over 3 periods (L+1), totaling 495. For sigma_hat, I am setting an explicit value to capture the high volatility seen in recent weeks (std dev of ~18 for the last 3 samples, scaled by sqrt(3) is ~31).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: Peak spring demand confirmed with average of ~163 units/period over last 3 samples (P7-P9), up from previous ~106.

The recent demand for the 'Brit Baby Tee' (Jersey Basic) has shown a significant surge, peaking at 181 units in Period 10, with a 3-period average (P8-P10) of 177.6 units. This confirms a peak spring/pre-summer demand regime. On-hand inventory is currently 45 units. The P9 order arrived early (lead_time 1), while the P8 order arrived as promised (lead_time 2). There are no current indications of new shipment delays, although a 79-unit order from Period 1 remains lost and is inflating the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. To compensate for the lost units being counted in the pipeline and the high demand, I am using an explicit mu_hat reflecting the current peak (approx. 178 units/period * (1+L)) and an explicit sigma_hat to account for high volatility (std dev of last 5 periods is ~27, adjusted for lead time). I will use the promised lead time (L=2) as recent arrivals have been 1 or 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Peak spring demand sustained with a 3-period average of 177.6 units (P8-P10), significantly higher than March averages. Lost P1 shipment continues to inflate pipeline inventory calculations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 11 (304 units) spiked significantly, reinforcing the shift towards peak spring/summer seasonality for this jersey basic item. The 3-period demand average (P9-P11) is now 220.6 units, up from the previous ~178 forecast. The actual lead time remains generally 2 periods (with frequent variations like 1 period in P10). However, the system's pipeline inventory is still inflated by the 79 units from the lost Period 1 order (which remains 'In-transit' but will never arrive). To compensate for the pipeline overestimation and the massive demand increase, I am using 'explicit' L=3 to trick the OR engine into holding more safety stock and 'explicit' mu_hat based on the current 220/period run rate. This addresses the 0 on-hand inventory and the lost 79 units while preparing for sustained high-season demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Significant spike to 304 units; 3-period average increased to 220.6 units (+24% from previous regime). Peak summer demand for jersey basics confirmed.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), we are entering the pre-summer peak for Jersey Basics. Demand has been highly volatile: P11 saw a peak of 304, followed by a drop to 157 in P12. The most recent 3-period average (P10-P12) is 214 units, while the 5-period average (P8-P12) is 199. Given the seasonality and the fact that we currently have 0 on-hand inventory, I am setting mu_hat to cover the higher end of recent demand to prevent stockouts during this volatile period. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent shifting average (approx 214 per week). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to better capture the significant volatility observed in April. A key concern is the 'In-transit' of 814 units. This includes the confirmed lost P1 order (79 units) and a large pipeline (P11=220, P12=325). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock; to ensure an order is actually placed despite the inflated pipeline, I am using 'explicit' L=3. Increasing L increases the base stock (1+L), helping to offset the 79 'phantom' units from the lost P1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Demand volatility high in late spring. March-April avg was ~100-150, but May transition shows risk of 300+ peaks. Lost P1 shipment (79 units) continues to distort pipeline inventory calculations.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '624486002' (Brit Baby Tee) is currently in a high-demand spring/summer phase. While the demand in Period 13 (78 units) was significantly lower than the preceding spike (304, 157, 181), current in-transit inventory (636 units) includes orders from Period 12 (325 units), Period 13 (42 units), and the confirmed lost shipment from Period 1 (79 units). The OR engine's internal 'pipeline inventory' calculation is likely inflated by 79 units (Period 1), which causes it to under-order. To compensate for this distortion and maintain service levels during late spring, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (average of P11-P13 = 179.67 units/period) to reflect current volatility and ensure the base stock calculation remains robust against the missing P1 stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high for Jersey basics in May; after a spike to 304 (P11), demand moderated to 78 (P13), suggesting lumpy late-spring patterns. P1 shipment (79 units) remains lost, continuing to artificially inflate pipeline inventory calculations.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), the SKU is entering the late spring/early summer season. Demand for 'Jersey Basic' T-shirts has become highly volatile but shifted significantly higher than the initial baseline. The recent 5-period average (P10-P14) is 165.4 units, though this includes a major peak of 304 and a low of 78. In-transit inventory (311 units) is currently high, but 79 units from the Period 1 order remain lost, as confirmed by later orders (P2, P6, P8, P9, P11, P12) arriving within 1-2 periods while P1 remains outstanding. This lost shipment artificially inflates the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, leading to consistent under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values. I will base mu_hat on the average of the last 5 demand samples (165.4) multiplied by (1+L), and adjust for the lost units by adding them back into the target base stock. Calculation: (1+2)*165.4 + 79 = ~575. For sigma_hat, I will use a value that reflects the high recent volatility (std dev of last 5 periods is ~89), scaled by sqrt(1+L). Calculation: sqrt(3)*89 = ~154.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/05/27), we are transitioning out of peak spring demand into early summer for this 'Jersey Basic' baby tee. Recent demand has stabilized after the late April/early May fluctuations, with the last three periods showing 78, 107, and 129 units respectively. The average of these three periods is 104.7 units. The 79 units from Period 1 remain confirmed as a lost shipment, which artificially inflates the 'In-transit' count (311 units) used by the OR backend. Actual pipeline inventory is 232 units (311 - 79). To compensate for the pipeline distortion and ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) horizon, I am setting an explicit mu_hat. Using a 3-period average of ~105 and a lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 315. To counteract the 79-unit pipeline overstatement and maintain a safety buffer against historical volatility (\u03c3 ~ 75-100), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 400. This logic forces the OR engine to place an order despite the phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 85 (approximate historical deviation in this regime) to handle potential late-spring demand spikes.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 624486002 is a summer-oriented 'Brit Baby Tee' (Jersey Basic). We are entering June, and recent demand confirms a high-demand regime, with P16 seeing 211 units. The 5-period average (P12-P16) is 136.4, but this includes a dip to 78 and a peak of 211. Crucially, the P1 shipment (79 units) is definitively lost, and the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes it, leading to a consistent under-ordering. The current 'In-transit' is 311 units (P1: 79, P13: 42, P15: 0, P16: 0 but P12 and P11 orders are arrived). Wait, recalculating pipe: Arrived: P11 (220), P12 (325). Open orders: P1 (79 - lost), P13 (42). In transit shows 311, likely including the P13 (42) and potentially others from P14-P16 if the OR suggested orders I can't see. Given the ending on-hand of 20 and high demand, I need to force a higher base stock to compensate for the phantom 79 units in the pipeline. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+L)*180 (approximating 3-period average and upcoming summer peak) to ensure the backend places an order despite the pipeline inflation.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Brit Baby Tee' (Jersey Basic) is in its peak summer season (June). Demand in the last three periods (P15-P17) has averaged 172 units/period (129, 211, 176). On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 17. Looking at the supply chain: P14-P16 had no orders, and the P17 order of 209 units is in transit (L=2 promised). Total in-transit is 520 units. However, this in-transit figure includes the 79 units from Period 1 that are confirmed lost (as noted in carry-over insights), meaning the functional pipeline is 441 units (520 - 79). To set OR parameters: 1) L=2 (promised), as recent arrivals (P10, P13, P14) have followed L=1 or L=2. 2) mu_hat: Using N=4 for the current high-summer regime (P14-P17 avg = 155.75 * (1+2) = 467.25). 3) sigma_hat: Demand volatility is significant (StDev of last 4 periods \u2248 46.5), so sqrt(3)*46.5 \u2248 80.6. This configuration ensures the base stock (approx 548 units) accounts for the current demand level while the OR engine subtracts the (overstated) pipeline, which I've partially compensated for by using a robust mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (June): Avg demand sustained at ~160-170 units/period (P15-P17 avg: 172).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17, entering late June. The SKU (Brit Baby Tee) is a summer jersey basic. Demand in June (P15-P18) has averaged 163.25 units, showing consistency with the summer regime identified in Period 18. Specifically, the last 4 periods were 129, 211, 176, 137. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0), and in-transit is 520 units. However, we must account for the lost P1 shipment (79 units) which the OR engine still treats as pipeline inventory. Additionally, recent arrival history (P10, P13, P14) confirms that the actual lead time L=2 is functioning reliably now, despite the early loss. To ensure the backend places an order that bridges the gap created by the stockout and the 'phantom' 79 units from P1, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the summer demand mean (~163). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to allow the formula (1+L) to calculate for 4 periods of demand, effectively bypassing the pipeline distortion and ensuring upcoming demand is covered until the P17 order (209 units) arrives in P19 conclude.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (June 24th), we are in the peak summer demand season for jersey basics. The demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) has averaged approximately 163 units/period (129, 211, 176, 137, 160). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit of 653 units includes: the lost P1 order (79 units), P17 order (209 units), and P19 order (133 units). This totals 421 units. The additional ~232 units in the 'In-transit' figure suggest backend OR logic may be holding phantom orders or accounting for recent unlisted placements. The P1 shipment (79 units) remains lost after 19 periods, and its inclusion in the pipeline inventory artificially reduces order quantities. To counter this and the systemic stockouts (ending inventory 0 in 4 of the last 4 periods), I will use 'explicit' methods to raise the base stock level. I am targeting a base stock that covers the 2-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=3) at the current demand rate of ~163. Calculation: 163 * 3 = 489 units. I will set mu_hat to 489 to ensure the backend aims for this throughput, while keeping sigma_hat high to account for the volatility seen in jersey demand (ranging from 78 to 304).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. Demand for this Jersey Basic T-shirt (624486002) has been consistent throughout June, with an average demand of 155.7 units over the last three periods (P18-P20: 137, 160, 170). The SKU is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity is 653, which includes: P1 (79 - confirmed lost), P13 (42), P17 (209), P19 (133), and unknown previous residues. Since the P1 shipment of 79 units is confirmed lost and still inflates the pipeline, the effective pipeline is ~574. With a promised lead time of 2, we need to cover demand for Period 21, 22, and 23 (L+1 = 3 periods). Given July is peak summer, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period average (approx 160/period) to reflect current summer stability. Sigma remains high due to recent volatility. I will use 'explicit' for L to account for the systemic inflation of the pipeline by the lost P1 units: by setting L higher than actual, I compensate for the OR engine's belief that those 79 units are arriving, preventing premature order capping.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (July) stable at ~160 units/period (P16-P20 avg: 170.8). Lost P1 shipment (79 units) remains in pipeline inventory, requiring explicit adjustment or higher targets to avoid stockouts.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is the 'Brit Baby Tee', a jersey basic likely influenced by summer seasonality in July. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 653 units, but Period 1 (79 units) is confirmed lost, effectively making real pipeline 574 units across L=2. Demand has been stable in its summer regime: recent demand (P19-P21) is 133, 170, 187, averaging 163.3 units. Given the seasonality and 'In-transit' including a lost shipment, the OR backend's default base stock calculation (which subtracts the full pipeline) will under-order. To compensate, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I forecast a demand of 170 per period. Over (L+1)=3 periods, this is 510 units. However, to account for the 79 units 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline and the current stockout (on-hand=0), I will set mu_hat to 550 to ensure the backend places an order that bridges the gap until the P19/P17 shipments arrive.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 624486002 (Brit Baby Tee) is a summer-seasonal jersey basic. Current demand (July) has stabilized at a high regime. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is approximately 155.6 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there is a significant pipeline of 653 units. However, history reveals that the P1 order (79 units) is definitively lost, and recent orders from P17 (209 units) and P19 (133 units) are overdue relative to the promised 2-period lead time, suggesting a lead time extension or a cluster of shipment delays. The OR engine calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the lost 79 units remain in the 'In-transit' figure, the engine will under-order unless I compensate. I am setting L to 4 (explicit) to reflect recent delivery delays and using 'recent_N' (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current 150-160 unit demand regime. To account for the 79-unit ghost inventory in the pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 857 (calculated as [1+L]*155.6 + 79 = 5 * 155.6 + 79 \u2248 857) to force the backend to ignore the lost units and maintain stock for the actual demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability: Recent orders (P17, P19) are significantly delayed (>4 periods), confirming the previously noted P1 loss wasn't an isolated event. Pipeline inventory is currently inflated by 79 units from a confirmed lost P1 shipment.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with on-hand units at 0 and significant replenishment delays. Current pipeline inventory (857) includes a 79-unit lost shipment (P1) and several overdue orders: P17 (209 units, 7 periods ago), P19 (133 units, 5 periods ago). Normal lead time is 2, but these orders are clearly delayed or lost. Demand for 'Brit Baby Tee' (Jersey Basic) remains relatively stable in the mid-summer regime, with recent demand (P21-P23) averaging 149 units. To compensate for the 79-unit phantom inventory (lost P1 order) and ensure the OR engine targets a high enough base stock despite the ballooned in-transit figure, I will set 'L' to 4 (reflecting the observed instability) and use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock sufficient for roughly 4 periods of demand plus a safety buffer to offset the missing units. Target Base Stock = (Avg Demand 160 * 4 periods) + 79 phantom units = ~719. Using L=4, mu_hat (1+L)*mean = 5*160 = 800. This should trigger an order of sufficient size to bridge the gap if the OR engine sees 857 in-transit but 79 are dead.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: Orders from P17 and P19 are overdue by 5+ periods, significantly exceeding promised L=2. Combined with the lost P1 shipment, pipeline inventory is highly unreliable.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for item 624486002 is currently in a state of severe disruption. There have been no arrivals since Period 14. Specifically, orders from Period 17 (209 units) and Period 19 (133 units) are now 8 and 6 periods overdue respectively, despite a promised lead time of 2. Historical 'In-transit' data includes a confirmed lost shipment from Period 1 (79 units). The current 'In-Transit' of 857 units is theoretically composed of: P1 (79, lost), P3 (90, likely lost), P4 (46, likely lost), P17 (209), P19 (133), P23 (204), and P10 (some remnant or miscalculation). Given that On-Hand is 0 and demand has been steady around 130-150 units for the last 4 periods (P21-P24 avg: 144), the inventory position is critical. I will set L to 8 to reflect the actual delay seen since the P17 order was placed. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the stabilizing late-summer demand (~142 units/period). To compensate for the distorted 'In-transit' figure and the stockout risk, I am using an explicit sigma_hat set significantly higher than the standard deviation to force the OR engine to target a higher base stock, effectively 'ordering through' the pipeline noise.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: No arrivals for 11 consecutive periods (P14-P24). Lead time for active orders is now at least 8 periods (P17 order still missing). Pipeline inventory (857 units) is heavily compromised by lost or indefinitely delayed shipments spanning from P1 to P19.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain situation is critical. There have been no arrivals for 12 consecutive periods (P14-P25), despite a promised lead time of 2. All orders placed between Period 13 and Period 23 are now significantly overdue (e.g., P17 order by 7 periods, P19 by 5 periods), suggesting a systemic failure or extreme transit delays. The in-transit pipeline (1171 units) is heavily compromised by these delays and the confirmed lost Period 1 shipment (79 units). On-hand inventory is 0 and has been for several weeks. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the massive (but likely phantom/stalled) pipeline, I must set the lead time 'L' to an explicitly high value. This increases the 'base_stock' target (\u03bc\u0302 + z\xb7\u03c3\u0302) substantially. Demand has moderated from the spring peak (~220) to a summer average (P21-P25 avg: 137.8). I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture this moderation while setting L to 12\u2014reflecting the actual observed delay\u2014to ensure the ordering logic triggers.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed as of Period 26: Zero arrivals observed since Period 14 (12 periods). Actual lead time for active orders is now at least 10+ periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain showed the first sign of life in 13 periods with the arrival of the Period 23 order (204 units) in Period 26 (L=3). This breaks the 12-period blackout, though many earlier orders (from P17, P19, etc.) are still missing and are likely lost. The pipeline remains heavily inflated by these old, unfulfilled orders (79 + 209 + 133 + 42 = 463 suspected lost units). Current demand has moderated from summer peaks (approx ~120 units/period over the last 4 periods). Given the proven unreliability of lead times (L=3 most recently, but significant previous failures), I will use 'explicit' settings to bypass the OR engine's reliance on 'In-transit' data. I set L=4 to be conservative against the recent delays. I set mu_hat to 600 (approx 120 demand * (4+1) periods) and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure a robust safety buffer given the risk of multi-period stockouts seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain activity resumed in Period 26: P23 order arrived with L=3. Significant previous orders (P1, P17, P19) remain missing and should be considered lost, making the 'In-transit' count misleading.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has resumed activity with Period 23 and Period 25 orders arriving with lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively. This confirms that orders placed in Period 1 (79 units), Period 17 (209 units), and Period 19 (133 units) are lost (total 421 units). These lost units continue to inflate the 'In-transit' count (839), making the pipeline inventory seen by the OR engine unreliable. The current actual pipeline (excluding lost units) is 418 units (839 - 421). To adjust for this, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to effectively lower the base stock target relative to the inflated pipeline, or set parameters that force the logic to recognize current demand. Demand has moderated in late summer (P26-P27 avg: 75), shifting from the peak summer regime (~160-170). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend (N encompasses P25-P27) and calculate for L as performance stabilizes around the promised 2-3 range. Setting sigma_hat with recent_N=5 ensures volatility from the transition is captured.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: P23 and P25 orders arrived (L=3, L=2). Orders from P1 (79), P17 (209), and P19 (133) are confirmed lost, totaling 421 units. Demand regime shift confirmed: demand has dropped from ~170 to ~88 (P25-P27 average) as summer peaks end.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a massive collapse (P14-P25). Recent arrivals (P26, P27) show lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively, moving away from the long delays observed previously. On-hand inventory is healthy at 286 units. Demand has clearly shifted into a late-summer/early-fall cooling phase, averaging ~89 units over the last 4 periods (P25-P28), down from the summer peak of ~170. Critically, 'In-transit' is still reported as 839 units, but historical evidence from Periods 5, 17, 19, and 23 confirms that at least 421 units (79+209+133) are permanently lost. If we subtract the lost units from the in-transit total (839 - 421 = 418), the OR backend will still see a pipeline of 418 units. With a current demand of ~90 units and lead time of 2, the 'base stock' target (L+1) is approximately 270 units. Since current on-hand (286) already exceeds this, and there are still valid orders in transit (P26 order of 186 units), the engine should naturally halt ordering. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the current lower volume regime (N=4) and keep L at default since the most recent arrival was L=2.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime confirmed as of late August: average demand decreased to ~89 units (P25-P28), down from the previous summer average of ~170. Supply chain lead time has returned to promised stability (L=2 to 3).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (early September), demand for the 'Brit Baby Tee' is in a cooling phase following the summer peak. The average demand over the last four periods (P26-P29) has dropped to approximately 73 units, compared to the summer average of 170. Supply chain lead times have stabilized at 2-3 periods (P23 arrived in L=3, P25 in L=2). However, pipeline inventory is significantly distorted by legacy lost orders: P1 (79), P17 (209), and P19 (133), totaling 421 lost units. Current in-transit is 839, but adjusting for lost shipments, the 'real' in-transit is 418 (mainly from P26 and P13, though P13's 42 units might also be lost). On-hand inventory is 226, which covers over 3 periods of current demand. Because the OR engine uses total pipeline (839) in its calculation (order = base_stock - on_hand - pipeline), it will see 226 + 839 = 1065 units and stop ordering entirely. To compensate for the ~421 'phantom' units in the pipeline and set a target appropriate for the current demand regime (~73/week), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the cooling trend and keep L at default (2) as the supply chain has recovered.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Brit Baby Tee is cooling as the summer season ends, progressing into September. In Period 30, demand dropped significantly to 33 units. The 4-period average (P27-P30) is approximately 62 units, down from the peak summer average of ~170. Supply chain lead times have stabilized at 2-3 periods (as seen in the Period 27/28 concludes). Pipeline inventory (839 units) is significantly inflated by the legacy lost shipments (P1: 79, P17: 209, P19: 133, totaling 421 units). Even accounting for these losses, the effective pipeline is around 418 units. With 193 units on-hand and declining demand, the current position is sufficient to cover multiple periods. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 samples (N=4) to capture this downward trend and use an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect recent actual performance while the OR engine manages the excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend continued into September: P30 demand drop to 33 units confirms a lower regime (P27-P30 avg ~62) compared to late August (~89).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend for 'Brit Baby Tee' (Jersey Basic) shows a significant cooling as we move into September. The demand has dropped from a summer average of ~170 to a 4-period average of ~46 (P28-P31: 82, 60, 33, 18). This aligns with seasonal transitions out of summer basics. Supply chain stability has largely returned following a major disruption; recent arrivals (P26, P27) showed lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively. However, the 'In-transit' count of 839 is significantly distorted by confirmed lost shipments (P1: 79, P17: 209, P19: 133) totaling 421 units. To correct for this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: The current demand regime (last 4 weeks) averages ~48 units. Given L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 3 * 48 = 144. To bridge the 421-unit gap in pipeline inventory and avoid the OR backend under-ordering due to false 'In-transit' units, I will set mu_hat explicitly higher: 144 (forecast) + 421 (lost) = 565. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed for September: average demand dropped to ~46 units (P28-P31), reflecting the end of peak summer seasonality for jersey basics.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Brit Baby Tee has entered a clear downward trajectory as late September approaches, marking the end of the peak summer and back-to-school seasons. The last four periods have seen demand drop from 60 to 33, 18, and most recently 16 (Period 32). The current 4-period average is approximately 31.75 units. On-hand inventory is 159 units, which is quite high relative to this new demand regime. Additionally, there is a massive 'In-transit' pipeline of 839 units. As noted in 'Carry-over Insights', a total of 421 units (from P1, P17, and P19) are confirmed lost, but the OR backend still counts them. I will set the lead time L to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals have stabilized to L=2 or 3. I will use recent_N=4 for demand forecasting (mu_hat) to capture the cooling trend while avoiding extreme over-stocking. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility in the current low-demand environment. Since on-hand (159) already covers over 4 weeks of the current demand rate (~32/period), the OR engine should correctly conclude that no new orders are necessary.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed for late September/early Autumn: average demand dropped to ~32 units (P29-P32), a significant decrease from August levels (~80).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late September (2019-09-30). Demand for the 'Brit Baby Tee' (a jersey basic/short top) has significantly cooled as we transition into autumn. The last four periods (P30-P33) show a mean demand of ~24 units per period (33, 18, 16, 29). This is a dramatic decline from the summer peak averages of ~170. On-hand inventory is currently 130 units, which is enough to cover over 5 weeks of current demand. Pipeline inventory is reported as 839 units, but this is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P1 (79), P17 (209), and P19 (133), totaling 421 lost units. Adjusting for these, the 'real' in-transit inventory is approximately 418 units. Given the high on-hand stock and the continued cooling trend, no new orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current autumn low-demand regime (~24 units/period), and L=default since recent deliveries (P23, P25) have stabilized back near the promised 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand floor confirmed: Late September demand has leveled at ~24 units/period (P30-P33 average), representing a 73% drop from August levels.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Brit Baby Tee has stabilized at a low Autumn floor. Over the last four periods (P31-P34), demand was 18, 16, 29, and 20, resulting in an average of 20.75 units. This is a significant drop from the summer peak (~170) and even the late August cooling phase (~80). On-hand inventory is currently 110 units, which covers more than 5 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 839 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments (P1, P17, P19) totaling 421 units and the P26 order (186 units) which is now significantly overdue (8 periods since order), suggesting it might also be lost or severely delayed. However, even excluding all in-transit stock, the current on-hand inventory is more than sufficient. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the low-demand regime and use default lead time as recent arrivals (P23, P25) showed a return to a 2-3 period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand floor settled: P31-P34 demand average is ~21 units/period. Overdue alert: P26 order (186 units) is now 8 periods old with no arrival, likely lost in addition to original 421 units lost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/14. We are in an Autumn demand floor regime. The recent demand (P31-P35) has been extremely low: 18, 16, 29, 20, 15, with a 5-period average of 19.6 units. The on-hand inventory is 95 units, which covers nearly 5 weeks of current demand at this rate. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 839 is highly misleading due to historical lost shipments: P1 (79), P17 (209), P19 (133), and likely P26 (186), totaling 607 units. Removing these from the reported 839 leaves an estimated real pipeline of 232 units (associated with later orders, though no recent orders were placed). Since on-hand (95) + estimated real pipeline (232) is 327, and 3 periods of demand at the current rate is only ~60, no new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this low-demand state and use the promised lead time (L=2) as recent arrivals (P23, P25) returned to the L=2-3 range.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand floor confirmed (P31-P35 avg ~20 units/period). Predicted total lost units in pipeline: 607 (P1, P17, P19, P26).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Brit Baby Tee has stabilized at a low Autumn/Winter level, with an average of approximately 18 units per period over the last 5 samples (P32-P36). Currently, on-hand inventory is 83 units, which is more than sufficient to cover immediate demand (approx. 4.6 periods of cover). Pipeline inventory is listed as 839 units, but historical evidence confirms significant losses: P1 (79), P17 (209), P19 (133), and P26 (186) are considered lost, totaling 607 phantom units. Subtracting these from the 839 reported 'In-transit' leaves 232 units across other periods that may also be compromised, although P23 and P25 recently arrived normally (L=2 to 3). Regardless of the pipeline reliability, the high on-hand stock relative to the current low demand regime dictates a 'zero-order' stance to minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current floor of ~18 units/period, and use default lead time L as recent arrivals have normalized around L=2-3.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Brit Baby Tee has stabilized at a low Autumn floor, consistent with the end of the summer season. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P31-P37) is approximately 18 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 68 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of the current demand regime. Regarding the supply chain, while the most recent successful arrivals (P26, P27) showed a returned stability (L=2 to 3), the pipeline inventory of 839 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P1 (79), P17 (209), P19 (133), and P26 (186), totaling 607 units. Therefore, the 'real' pipeline is roughly 839 - 607 = 232 units. Since on-hand + 'real' pipeline (300 units) vastly exceeds 15 periods of current demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the low-demand regime and allow on-hand inventory to deplete toward the target base stock, minimizing further holding costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for the Brit Baby Tee (a short-sleeved jersey basic) has settled into a low autumn/winter regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is approximately 13.8 units per period, a significant drop from the summer peak of ~170. Pipeline inventory is currently reported at 839 units, but this is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Confirmed/likely lost orders include P1 (79), P17 (209), P19 (133), and P26 (186), totaling 607 units. Actual reliable in-transit inventory is likely closer to 232 units (839 - 607). However, with on-hand inventory at 61 units and current demand around 14 units/week, the existing on-hand stock alone covers over 4 weeks of demand. The OR backend's default base stock calculation (which includes the inflated pipeline) will naturally prevent new orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the low-demand autumn regime (approx 20 units/period) while keeping L at default to maintain the standard review cycle. This ensures we don't over-order while we bleed off existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter low-demand regime confirmed: P31-P38 average demand is ~17 units/period. Total estimated lost units in pipeline inventory: 607 units (Orders from P1, P17, P19, P26).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable low-demand Autumn/Winter regime, with an average demand of approximately 17 units per period over the last 8 weeks (P32-P39). On-hand inventory is 44 units, which covers over two periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 839 units is highly misleading due to confirmed and suspected lost shipments: P1 (79), P17 (209), P19 (133), and P26 (186), totaling 607 units. Subtracting these from the 839 in-transit leaves an estimated 232 'true' units in the pipeline (likely from more recent or un-reconciled orders). Given the current on-hand stock and the significant decline in demand since summer, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 8 to capture the current low-demand stable state while ignoring the high-volume summer data. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P26, P27) returned to near the promised L=2, balancing out previous extreme delays.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is late autumn heading into winter. Demand for the 'Brit Baby Tee' (a short-sleeved jersey basic) has settled into a low-volume floor. Over the last 10 periods (P31-P40), the average demand is 17.3 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 30 units, which covers nearly two periods of demand. However, there is a critical distortion in the pipeline inventory: the 'In-transit' figure of 839 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P1 (79), P17 (209), P19 (133), and P26 (186), totaling 607 units that will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places orders when needed despite this phantom stock, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 (promised) and 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat values. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the service level target q = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. I'll set mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average (17.3 * (1+2) = ~52) and a conservative sigma_hat. This will trigger orders once on-hand inventory drops further, bypassing the pipeline inflation.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the end of the year. Demand has stabilized in a very low-volume winter regime (mean of ~11 units per period over the last 5 weeks). Historical 'In-transit' data (839 units) is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments (607 units identified: P1=79, P17=209, P19=133, P26=186). This distortion, if left uncorrected, causes the OR engine to believe there is sufficient stock on the way, potentially leading to stockouts if demand persists above zero. However, current on-hand inventory (23) is actually sufficient for at least 2 periods given the current demand of ~11. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the low autumn/winter floor. I will use L=default (2) as recent actual arrivals (P23, P25) showed lead times of 3 and 2 respectively, returning toward promised levels after the supply chain crisis. No order is placed this period because on-hand inventory covers the immediate horizon and pipeline (even if reduced by 607) exceeds forecasted needs.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor confirmed (Nov): Average demand has dropped to ~11 units/period (P37-P41). Total confirmed lost units in pipeline inventory remains 607.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Brit Baby Tee' has stabilized in a winter low-demand regime, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) being approximately 12.8 units. The current on-hand inventory is 4 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 839 units is highly unreliable due to significant historical losses. Specifically, 607 units are confirmed lost (P1: 79, P17: 209, P19: 133, P26: 186). Based on the Game History, the last successful arrival was in Period 27. The most recent order placed (beyond the lost ones) was in Period 26, which is now 17 periods overdue and effectively lost. There are no active 'real' orders in the pipeline. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, we need to cover demand for Period 43, 44, and 45 (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the current context (December/Winter), demand is expected to remain low. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the ~13 units/period average, and use explicit L=2. To overcome the distorted pipeline inventory (839 units), which prevents the OR engine from ordering even when on-hand is near zero, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the OR engine calculates [Order = base_stock - pipeline], and base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma, I will set mu_hat to a value high enough to offset the 839 phantom units and trigger a small replenishment to meet the ~39 unit requirement (13 units * 3 periods). Setting mu_hat to 880 ensures the engine sees a need for fresh stock despite the 839 units of 'ghost' inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Brit Baby Tee has stabilized in a low-demand winter regime, with the most recent 10 periods (P34-P43) averaging 14 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and a stockout occurred in P43. While 'In-transit' shows 876 units, approximately 607 units are confirmed lost (from P1, P17, P19, and P26) and have not arrived for over 17 periods. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of approximately 269 units (876 - 607). However, the OR backend uses the full 876 in its logic, which will suppress automated ordering. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 45 (approx. 15 units/period * 3) to reflect the current winter floor while managing the distorted pipeline. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time as recent arrivals (P26, P27) returned to the 2-3 period range, allowing the engine to average these with historical actuals.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion persists: 607 units are confirmed lost (P1, P17, P19, P26) but remain in the 'In-transit' count, which may cause the OR backend to under-order unless mu_hat is adjusted high or explicit methods are used.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. Demand for 'Brit Baby Tee' (a jersey basic/short sleeve t-shirt) remains in a winter trough, with recent demand averaging ~10 units/period (P40-P44). Pipeline inventory is significantly distorted: the reported 876 units in-transit includes 607 units from orders placed in P1, P17, P19, and P26 that are long overdue and confirmed lost. The OR engine's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock target, which means these 'phantom' units prevent necessary ordering. As of P44 conclude, on-hand inventory is 0. To trigger an order for the current low-demand regime despite the 607 lost units in the pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the winter demand target (L+1 periods, where L=2) at approximately 45 units (15 units/period * 3). However, the backend will subtract the 876 units in-transit. To bypass this and ensure the OR engine sees a need for stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the phantom pipeline. Specifically, mu_hat needs to exceed the pipeline inventory (876) + the desired safety stock. Setting mu_hat to 950 explicitly will counteract the 876 phantom units and signal a need for approximately 74 units, which is sufficient to cover the upcoming 3 periods + safety cushion in this winter regime.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, representing the peak of the winter/holiday season. Demand for this 'Brit Baby Tee' (a short-sleeved jersey basic) is at its seasonal floor, with an average demand of ~11 units per period over the last 9 periods (P37-P45). The in-transit count of 913 is highly misleading due to 607 units confirmed lost from historical orders (P1, P17, P19, P26) and the accumulation of unfulfilled demand leading to stockouts. To bypass the distorted pipeline inventory and ensure the OR engine actually places orders, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Given the low-demand regime, I'll set mu_hat based on the recent average of ~11 units per period plus a small buffer for the 'short, fitted' nature of the product which might see a slight increase towards the New Year. I will set mu_hat to 45 (approx 15 units * (L+1)) and sigma_hat to 15 to maintain a safe service level while preventing high holding costs on a low-velocity item. Actual lead time has stabilized at L=2 based on the P43 arrival.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30 (Period 47). We are in a stable winter demand regime with an average demand of approximately 14 units/period over the last 5 periods (P42-P46: 19, 9, 7, 14, 18). The lead time has stabilized at L=2 based on the arrival of the P43 order. A major complication remains: the 'In-transit' count of 913 units is heavily inflated by 793 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 79, P17: 209, P19: 133, P26: 186, and likely P25: 186 or similar from that period). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which includes In-transit) in its calculation (order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Since the true pipeline is only the P45 order (74 units), but the engine thinks there are 913 units, it will not place a needed order unless the 'mu_hat' is set explicitly high to force a higher base stock that overcomes the ghost inventory. To ensure we have stock for the next 3 periods (L+1) at ~15 units/period, we need a base stock of ~45. To force an order despite the 913 'In-transit' units, \u03bc\u0302 must be set extremely high. However, to maintain a realistic forecast while anticipating the inventory distortion, I will set \u03bc\u0302 to reflect the current regime and use explicit methods to ensure the backend covers the coming periods. Since the next shipment (P45) is due this period, and it was 74 units, it should cover near-term demand once it arrives.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Confirmed lost units in pipeline inventory total 793 (Orders from P1, P17, P19, P26, and part of P25/misc). Actual active pipeline is only 74 units (P45 order).
