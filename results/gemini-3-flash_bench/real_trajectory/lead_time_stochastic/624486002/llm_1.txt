This item is a basic staple but tends to see higher demand as the weather warms. b) Demand Regime Analysis: Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a range of 47-71 units (Avg: ~62.6). The trend has moved from ~50/week in early Jan to ~67/week in late Jan/early Feb, suggesting a slight upward trend as spring approaches. c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Promised lead time is 2 periods. No orders placed yet. Following the rule: Current Period N (1), decision for Period 1, arrival in Period 1+2=3, visible in Period 4 start. d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: On-hand is 0. Demand for Period 1 will occur after this decision, leading to a stockout. e) Final Order Logic: I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (the periods before the Period 1 order arrives). However, the Period 1 demand is lost regardless. I will forecast a demand of ~65 units per period. To cover the vulnerability window (L+1 = 3 periods) plus a small safety stock due to the upward trend, I need approximately 200-220 units. Since on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0, I will order 210 units to establish stock.",

This reflects an early spring seasonal ramp-up. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory because the P1 order (210 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it should arrive in Period 3's arrival phase (visible P4). We lost 86 units of sales in P1 due to 0 inventory. Based on the trend, I forecast Period 2-4 demand to be approximately 85-90 units per week. To cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods), we need roughly 260-270 units. We currently have 210 in-transit.

The mean demand has shifted from ~60 to ~85. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order (210 units) was placed during P1, meaning it should arrive during P3's resolution phase (visible in P4). No orders have arrived yet (P2 conclude: arrived=0), which is consistent with a 2-period lead time. d) Inventory Assessment: Current on-hand is 0, and we have missed 171 units of demand due to stockouts. In-transit pipeline: 210 (due P3) + 150 (due P4) = 360 units. e) Final Order Logic: We must cover demand for the lead time + 1 period (P3, P4, P5). Forecasting ~85 units/period based on recent regime. Total needed for 3 periods = 255. Safety stock is added due to high stockout cost (lost margin + high growth potential). Target pipeline: 255 + 85 (buffer) = 340. Current inventory + in-transit = 360. This covers the next 3 weeks comfortably. However, considering the missed demand of 171 units and the transition into March (peak spring shopping), I will place a moderate replenishment order to maintain the pipeline as the P1 shipment will be 60% depleted by the time it arrives due to backlogged interest (though technically lost sales, demand often clusters when stock returns). Order of 40 units keeps the pipeline healthy for P5/P6.",

  "rationale": "Product 624486002 is a short-sleeved baby tee. Historical demand in Jan 2018 averaged ~60. Since Feb (P1), demand has been around 86, 85, and 56 (average ~76). The dip to 56 in P3 might be an outlier, but the overall trend suggests a higher spring/summer demand regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, causing lost sales in P1-P3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed: P1 (210 units), P2 (150 units), P3 (40 units). Total in-transit = 400. Based on L=2, the P1 order (210) is expected to arrive DURING P3 resolution and be visible at the start of P4's decision (wait, the 'conclude' message for P3 says arrived=0, meaning the P1 order has NOT arrived yet even though P3 has concluded). This implies the actual lead time is >= 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed. Given that P1 was ordered on 2019-02-11 and we are now at P4 (2019-03-04), if L=2, it should have arrived in P3. Since 'Period 3 conclude' says arrived=0, actual lead time is at least 3. I expect the 210 units to arrive in P4. Total pipeline (400) covers roughly 5 periods of demand at ~80/week. However, due to the high likelihood of lead time instability and the need to build a safety stock buffer after 3 weeks of stockouts, I will place a moderate order to ensure future coverage if demand continues to rise as spring progresses.",

Since P1, demand has fluctuated (86, 85, 56, 30), averaging approximately 64 units/period. The low demand in P4 (30 units) might be an outlier or early-month dip. Lead time analysis: P2 order (150 units) arrived in P4 conclude (L=2). The P1 order (210 units) is now significantly overdue (3 periods past promised, 4 periods total), suggesting it is lost. Inventory status: On-hand is 120. In-transit consists of P3 (40 units) and P4 (80 units). Pipeline = 120 + 40 + 80 = 240 units. Since promised lead time is 2, I need to cover demand for Period 5, 6, and 7 (L+1). Estimating demand at ~70 units/period (accounting for spring seasonality), the target level is 210 units. My current pipeline (240) already covers this target.

Historical data showed a baseline of ~50-70, but February/March demand has fluctuated between 30 and 86. b) Demand analysis: Recent demand (P4: 30, P5: 52) is lower than the early February spikes (~85), but looking at the historical sample (Jan: 47-71) and seasonal relevance, I expect an average of ~65 units/period. c) Lead time: P1 order (210) is lost. P2 order arrived in 2 periods (P4). P3 order (40 units) was placed in Period 3 and is expected to arrive in Period 5's conclude (visible now) or Period 6's conclude. Since P5 conclude showed arrived=0, and P3 was ordered with a 2-period lead time, it should arrive during Period 5 or 6. If it arrives in P5, it would have been in the P5 conclude; it didn't. Thus, I expect P3 (40) and P4 (80) in the pipeline soon. d) Inventory: On-hand is 68. In-transit is 360 (though 210 of this is the lost P1 order, so effective in-transit is 150: P3=40, P4=80, P5=30). e) Target: I need to cover Period 6, 7, and 8 (L+1 = 3 periods). Expected demand for 3 periods = ~195 units. Current effective inventory = 68 (on-hand) + 150 (reliable in-transit) = 218. This already covers the target.

The P6 demand of 128 indicates a new seasonal peak. For safety, I will forecast a 'high-regime' demand of 110-130 units per period. c) Lead time: P1 (210 units) is confirmed lost.

Although Period 13 demand was lower (78), the overall trend for this category is upward toward the summer peak.

In-transit consists of P12 (750 units) and P13 (150 units). Based on recent history, P12 (ordered Period 12) is expected to arrive now in Period 14 (lead time 2) or have already arrived if it was lead time 1 (though not seen yet). If P12 arrives this period, on-hand will be 792. To protect against the inconsistent lead times and possible loss of the large P12 order, while targeting a high service level for the May/June peak (estimated at ~250-300 units/period), the pipeline needs to stay robust. Total inventory (OH 42 + IT 900) = 942. With a 3-period coverage target (L+1) at a 300 unit/period rate, required inventory is ~900.

Orders from P23 and P24 have exceeded the typical 1-2 period lead time (P23 is at 3 periods, P24 at 2), indicating a current lead-time bottleneck. With OH=38 and expected arrivals stalled, a stockout risk is imminent for P26/P27. Given profit equals holding cost ($1.0), I must balance stockout avoidance with the risk of holding excess inventory as the season ends. I will order 100 units to bridge the gap until the P23-P25 pipeline (250 units) arrives, targeting a safety coverage for approx. 2-3 periods of demand.",

Current demand in November has stabilized at a floor of approximately 10-17 units per period (P39: 17, P40: 14). On-hand inventory is 0, while the in-transit pipeline (930 units) consists entirely of orders that are over 14 periods old (P24 and earlier), which are confirmed lost or effectively non-existent. However, placing new orders at this stage is highly discouraged despite the stockout: with the game ending at Period 47 and a holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $1.0, any inventory that doesn't sell within the same period it arrives results in zero or negative net reward. Given the low, stagnant demand and the risk of holding obsolete winter stock, the optimal strategy is to avoid ordering. Even if a small order was placed, the probability of it arriving in time to be sold before the game ends, without incurring excessive holding costs, is low given the unreliable historical lead times.",

Historical demand is now at a negligible floor, with the most recent period recording only 7 units. At this stage, the holding cost ($1.00) equals the unit profit ($1.00), meaning any unsold inventory carried over for even one period results in zero net profit for those units, and carrying it for two or more periods results in a net loss. There are currently 0 units on-hand and a massive in-transit pipeline of 930 units. While these in-transit units are over 14 periods old and likely lost, if any were to arrive now, they would incur heavy holding costs relative to the current demand (~7-15 units). With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (through Period 47), there is no justification for further ordering, as any arrivals would likely sit in inventory beyond the end of the game or erode all profit through holding charges.",

In the current timeline (early December), demand has stabilized at a minimal level (average ~12-15 units/period) after peaking at >300 in April/May. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), meaning any inventory held over for a single period without being sold results in zero net profit for those units, and holding for two periods results in a net loss. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 930 units consists of orders placed between Period 1 and Period 26. Since the most recent order (P26) was placed over 16 periods ago and the promised lead time is 2, the entire pipeline is confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. On-hand inventory is 0. Given the low demand regime and the high holding cost relative to profit, a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach is required to avoid holding cost erosion. However, with arrival reliability essentially at zero (no arrivals since P27), placing new orders carries a high risk of being charged holding costs for units that arrive too late or not at all. I will place a small order to cover the next few periods' expected demand (avg ~15), but given the total failure of the supply chain in recent months, the primary objective is avoiding holding cost losses on this near-obsolete item.",

Since the game ends at P47 and the 30 units from P43 will likely cover the remaining 2 periods of minimal demand (P45, P46), placing further orders is unnecessary.

World knowledge suggests very low demand for short-sleeved t-shirts in mid-winter. Inventory status: We have 16 units on-hand. The 930 units in the pipeline are confirmed lost/non-viable. Since our current on-hand inventory (16) covers the expected demand for the next period (avg ~13), and we are at the very end of the game (P46 of 47), ordering more stock would only incur holding costs without a high probability of generating additional profit before the game concludes, especially given the $1/unit holding cost versus $1/unit profit margin.

The only recent order (30 units from P43) arrived in P45 and was depleted by P46. Given that holding costs ($1.0) equal the profit per unit ($1.0), it is only profitable to carry inventory if it sells in the same period or the very next.
