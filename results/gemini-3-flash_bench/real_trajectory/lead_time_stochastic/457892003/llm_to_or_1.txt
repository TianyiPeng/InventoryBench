Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The SKU is a 'Women's Everyday Basics' jersey leggings, which typically has stable demand, though we must monitor for early spring sales. Historical demand samples (n=5) show values: 66, 73, 111, 83, 85. The mean is 83.6 and the standard deviation is 17.1. There is a slight peak on 2019-01-21 (111 units), but the last two weeks have stabilized around 83-85. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the coverage period is L+1=3. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full historical context initially, as the sample size is small (N=5).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the product (Women's Jersey Leggings) and the dates (Feb/early Spring), demand is showing a steady/moderate profile. The historical demand samples (66, 73, 111, 83, 85) plus the Period 1 demand (61) suggest an average demand of approximately 80 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (112 units) hasn't arrived yet (promised lead time is 2, so it should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at Period 4). We lost 61 units of sales in Period 1 due to zero stock. I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture the current baseline (approx 80-83 units/week) over the 5 most recent samples. For lead time, I will stick to the promised lead time (default) as we don't have enough data to confirm a drift yet. mu_hat will be set to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Feb 25th. Product is women's jersey leggings (everyday basic). Historical demand shows a slight upward trend (66, 73, 111, 83, 85, 61, 64), with some volatility in January. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (112 units) and P2 (114 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3 and will be visible in the P3 conclude message (starting inventory for P4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts in P1 and P2 (lost sales). I will set parameters based on the most recent 7 samples (including the 2 stockout periods' demand which was observed/estimated) to capture current demand levels.mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N=7 to reflect this context. Standard OR logic will then calculate the base stock to cover demand until the next order arrives (expected P5).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-04. The product is Women's Jersey Leggings (Everyday Basics). Historical demand (Jan-Feb) was steady, averaging 83.6 units/week. However, current on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order P1 (placed Feb 11) should have arrived during P3 and been visible now in the P3 conclude message, but 'arrived=0' is reported. This suggests either a lead time of 3+ periods or a lost shipment. Given the in-transit total of 233 (112 from P1 + 114 from P2 + 7 from P3), we are heavily stocked in the pipeline but starving on-hand. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are identical, the OR target service level is 50% (q=0.5, z=0), meaning the backend aims for the mean demand. Because of the missing P1 delivery, I will adjust L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the observed delay, ensuring the base stock covers an extra week of demand. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full pre-game and in-game history (avg ~81), covering February's slight trend while ignoring Jan's 111 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for Period 1 order exceeded promised 2 periods (not arrived by the end of Period 3). Setting L=3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5 (2019/3/11), we have received confirmation that the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2). However, the Period 1 order is still missing (it should have arrived in Period 3 if L=2, or Period 4 if L=3). Since the Period 2 order arrived *after* the Period 1 order was expected, and Period 1 remains unfulfilled, it is highly probable that the Period 1 shipment (112 units) is lost. I am removing L=3 from the insights as the Period 2 arrival confirms the promised lead time of 2 is actually being met for subsequent orders. Demand has been relatively stable (61, 64, 78, 48) with an average of 62.75. Given the loss of the Period 1 order, the current 'In-transit' of 183 includes 112 units that will likely never arrive, meaning effective pipeline inventory is only 71 units (7 + 64). I will use explicit values to compensate for the lost stock and ensure the SKU is replenished efficiently.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (112 units) likely lost: Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2) while Period 1 remains missing as of Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. Demand for 'Leggings in sturdy jersey' has shown a decreasing trend over the last three weeks (78 to 48 to 34), likely moving past a post-holiday peak. The order from Period 1 (112 units) is confirmed lost as the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2). The current in-transit inventory (183 units) consists of orders from Periods 3 (7 units) and 4 (64 units), plus the lost Period 1 order which the OR backend still counts in its 'pipeline_inventory'. Because the backend's pipeline is bloated by 112 units that will never arrive, the system will under-order unless mu_hat is adjusted. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the recent slowdown (averaging ~53 per week) and set L=2 as the confirmed actual lead time. To compensate for the 112-unit 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. calculation: Target Base Stock = (L+1)*Expected_Demand. (2+1)*53 = 159. However, the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline' (183) and 'on-hand' (32) from mu_hat. To force an order that covers future demand, I'll set mu_hat to 271 (159 target + 112 lost units) to offset the error.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak stabilization: last 3 periods avg 53 units/week. Reconfirmed shipment loss: Period 1 order (112 units) remains missing after Period 5, while later shipments arrived.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product (women's jersey leggings) shows a clear demand regime shift. Post-February peak (which saw demand up to 111), the demand has stabilized at a lower level: the last three periods (P4-P6) averaged 41.3 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to a stockout in Period 6 (sold 32 with demand of 42). The Period 1 order (112 units) is confirmed lost, as the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2) and subsequent periods have passed without the Period 1 shipment appearing. This loss created an inventory gap that the OR backend needs to fill. I am setting L=2 (matching the observed lead time of the Period 2 order) and using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak demand drop (avg ~41 vs pre-peak ~80). This ensures the base stock calculation doesn't over-order based on January/February highs while acknowledging the need to replenish the pipeline after the lost shipment and recent stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Post-peak (P4-P6) mean demand is 41.3 units, significantly lower than the P1-P3 mean of 67.7. Using N=3 for demand parameters.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (April 1st), the demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Leggings' has stabilized at a lower level following the early February/March peak. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is 39 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 239 units in transit. Specifically, orders from P3 (7 units), P4 (64 units), and P6 (56 units) are expected. The P3 order is now overdue (placed P3, expected P5 finish/P6 start), but since the P2 order arrived on time (L=2) and only the P1 order is definitively lost, I am treating the P3 delay with caution but maintaining L=2 for calculations. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the current lower-demand regime (averaging ~39 units/week) while ignoring the higher initial volatility. This helps prevent over-ordering during a post-peak period while waiting for the pipeline to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: P4-P7 avg demand is 39 units, down from P1-P3 avg of 67.7. Using N=4 for demand metrics. P1 order (112 units) remains confirmed lost; P3 order (7 units) is now overdue (L=5+).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing a 'Jersey Basic Leggings' SKU. Demand patterns show a post-initial-peak decline, with demand currently averaging 45.6 units over the last 5 periods (P4-P8), though Period 8 saw a spike to 72. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 183 units. However, history analysis confirms several supply chain failures: 1) Period 1 order (112 units) is lost. 2) Period 3 order (7 units) is also likely lost or severely delayed (L=6+). 3) Period 4 order (64 units) has reached L=5 and has not arrived. Only the Period 2 and Period 6 orders arrived with the promised L=2. Since the OR backend counts all 'In-transit' units, it believes the pipeline is full (183 units), when in reality at least 119 and possibly 183 units are missing. This leads the backend to under-order or not order at all. To correct this, I am using 'explicit' L=2 (since L=2 is the observed successful lead time) and setting mu_hat to a value that forces an order. I estimate next period demand + safety stock (approx 100 units) and add back the 'ghost' inventory of 183 units to bypass the backend's base-stock calculation which would subtract the 183. Formula: mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Pipeline Correction. Expected weekly demand ~50. mu_hat = (50 * 3) + 183 = 333.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Pipeline inventory (183 units) is heavily inflated by lost/severely delayed shipments from P1, P3, and P4. Effective pipeline is near zero.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/15. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for Period 9 was 40, following a high of 72 in Period 8. The demand regime over the last 6 periods (P4-P9) has shifted to an average of 46 units per week. The In-transit total of 321 units is misleading because several historical orders are effectively lost: P1 (ordered 112, now P10), P3 (ordered 7, now P10), and P4 (ordered 64, now P10) have all exceeded the promised lead time of 2 periods significantly without arriving, while later orders (P2, P6) arrived on time (L=2). Summing these losses (112+7+64 = 183) leaves an effective pipeline of 138 units (from Period 9). To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to cover the next (L+1) periods (3 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the recent 6-period mean (~46 * 3 = 138). To account for the lost stock inflating the pipeline, I will set L to 'explicit' value 2 to maintain the promised window, but I must compensate for the 'ghost' inventory. However, since the system subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, and the pipeline (321) is much higher than any realistic base stock for this demand, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to force a high enough target to trigger an order or signal the need for more stock, while acknowledging that 138 units are coming from the P9 order.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Lost Shipments: P1 (112), P3 (7), and P4 (64) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Total lost units = 183. Effective pipeline as of P10 is 138 units (ordered P9). Post-peak demand regime (P4-P9) stabilized at mean 46 units/week.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/22. The product is a basic jersey legging, a staple item. Demand analysis shows a clear shift after Period 3. From P1-P3, mean demand was 67.7. From P4-P10, mean demand has stabilized at 42.5. Recent demand in P10 was particularly low (24), but we use a longer 'recent_N' to avoid overreacting to a single point. I will use N=7 for demand metrics (P4-P10). Pipeline Inventory Check: The system shows 183 units in-transit. Based on 'conclude' history, these are orders from P1 (112), P3 (7), and P4 (64). Since later orders from P6 (arrived P8) and P9 (arrived P10) have already finished, these older units are confirmed lost. The backend OR engine uses 'In-transit' in its base-stock calculation (order = base_stock - in_transit). To force an order when the pipeline is 'clogged' with lost units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to offset these 183 'phantom' units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = (1+L)*Mean_Recent + Lost_Units. With L=2, (3 * 42.5) + 183 = 310.5. For sigma_hat, I use N=7 to capture post-shift volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Reconfirmed total lost inventory of 183 units (P1, P3, P4). Recent demand regime (P4-P10) mean is 42.5 units/week. Effective lead time for fulfilled orders remains around 2, but P9 arrived in 1 period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/29. The demand for product 457892003 (Jersey Basic Leggings) has stabilized into a post-peak regime starting around Period 4. The average demand from P4 to P11 is approximately 43 units/week. Most recently, P11 saw a demand of 50. Total in-transit inventory is listed as 197 units, but previous insights confirm that orders from P1 (112 units), P3 (7 units), and P4 (64 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 183 'phantom' units. The actual effective pipeline consists only of the order from P11 (14 units). The order from P9 arrived in 1 period, but the promised lead time remains 2. To account for the 183 lost units in the OR engine's pipeline calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period coverage (L=2 + 1) at a mean of 43 units/week, plus a safety margin for volatility. 43 * 3 = 129. However, because the backend will subtract the 'In-transit' (197) and 'On-hand' (64) from my mu_hat, I must adjust mu_hat upward by the 183 lost units to 'neutralize' them, or use a value that forces the desired order. With On-hand=64 and effectively only 14 units coming, I want to maintain a base stock around 150-160. To offset the 183 lost units in the backend's subtraction, I set mu_hat to a value that reflects (Target Base Stock + Lost Units). Target Base Stock ~ 150 + 183 = 333.

Carry-over insight: P11 conclusion: Effective pipeline excludes 183 units (P1, P3, P4) confirmed lost. Demand regime (P4-P11) remains stable with mean ~43 units/week. Lead time varies between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6, 2019. The product is Women's Jersey Leggings (Everyday Basics). Demand has shifted from an early peak (P1-P3 mean: 67.7) to a stable post-peak regime starting P4. The average demand from P4 to P12 is 42.6 units/week. Lead times are predominantly 2 periods (P2 arrived P4, P6 arrived P8), though P9 arrived in 1 period. CRITICAL PIPELINE ADJUSTMENT: There are 183 units in 'In-transit' that are confirmed lost (P1: 112, P3: 7, P4: 64). These orders are 8-12 periods old. The reported 'In-transit' of 269 units includes these 183 ghost units. The 'Effective Pipeline' is actually 86 units (P11: 14, P12: 72). To ensure the OR backend orders correctly against the true inventory position, I will set L=3 as an explicit override. Since base_stock = (1+L)*mu, setting L=3 when the effective lead time is 2 creates a 'safety buffer' that compensates for the pipeline units the backend considers present but are actually lost. Demand N=9 covers the stable regime (P4-P12).

Carry-over insight: Effective Pipeline Correction: 183 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Reported 'In-transit' must be discounted by 183 to find true replenishment status. Post-peak demand regime (P4-P12) mean is 42.6 units/week.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. The SKU is 'Fox (1)' leggings - a basic jersey garment typically yielding stable demand. Demand Analysis: The post-peak demand regime (starting P4) has stabilized. The last 10 periods (P4-P13) show an average demand of 41 units with moderate variance. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable post-peak behavior. Inventory & Pipeline Reconciliation: The system reports 255 units in-transit. However, based on the history, 183 units (P1: 112, P3: 7, P4: 64) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed as subsequent orders (P6, P9, P11) have already arrived. Subtracting these from the reported in-transit (255 - 183) leaves an effective pipeline of 72 units (ordered in P12). With 16 units on-hand and 72 in effective pipeline, the replenishment position is 88 units. This is roughly 2.1 weeks of demand (covering L=2). Lead Time: While P9 arrived in 1 period, most successful shipments (P2, P6, P11) arrived in 2 periods. I will use the promised L=2 for ordering logic.

Carry-over insight: P13 conclude: Effective inventory position must discount 183 units from reported 'In-transit' (P1, P3, P4 are lost). Current demand regime (P4-P13) mean is 41.0 units/week.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20th), we are in a stable post-peak demand regime for leggings. The current 'In-transit' figure of 183 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 1 (112), 3 (7), and 4 (64), which are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed based on the successful arrival of later orders (P6, P9, P11, and P12). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0 units. To ensure the OR engine places an order to cover future demand, I am using 'explicit' parameters for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The demand from P4-P14 (following the initial peak) shows a mean of 40.0 units/period and a standard deviation of 13.9. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, I set mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 3 * 40.0 = 120.0, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * std = 1.73 * 13.9 = 24.0. By using these values, the backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for the current on-hand position and correctly identifies the need for replenishment despite the ghost 'In-transit' units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a SKU of leggings (Everyday Basics). Historically, demand spiked in late January and February (averaging ~80), then shifted to a stable post-peak regime starting around Period 4 (March). From Period 4 to Period 15, the mean demand is 37.3 units per week, with recent demand (last 3 periods) trending even lower (avg ~23.6). We continue to account for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory: 183 units (from orders P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, as they have not arrived despite multiple subsequent orders (P6, P9, P11, P12) arriving successfully. The reported 'In-transit' of 183 units exactly matches these lost units, meaning the *effective* pipeline is 0. Since the OR backend subtracts the reported pipeline (183) from the base stock, and the base stock for a lead time of 2 and demand of ~38 would be roughly 114 (3 periods * 38), the OR engine would calculate 114 - 183 = -69 and place no order. To force a replenishment order, I must set mu_hat explicitly to override the lost units. I calculate the target base stock (to cover L+1=3 weeks) as 3 * 38 = 114 units, then add back the 183 ghost units to neutralize the backend subtraction. 114 + 183 = 297. This ensures the engine sees enough 'room' to order. L is set to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P11, P12) confirm a 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed demand decline within the post-peak regime; last 5 weeks average 24.6 units vs previous regime average of 43. Current strategy continues to adjust mu_hat to offset 183 units of lost pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P4).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/3), the demand for product 457892003 (Womens Leggings) has entered a lower-demand phase. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 25.4 units, significantly lower than the P4-P11 average of 42.5. I am setting N=5 for demand parameters to capture this recent deceleration. Regarding inventory, the backend sees 'In-transit' as 250 units, but 183 of these (from orders P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The true Pipeline Inventory is only 67 units (ordered P16). To force the backend to place an order, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. The objective is to achieve a base stock that covers the true pipeline correction: Total Needed = (Base Stock for 3 periods of demand) + 183 lost units. With mean demand at ~25, Base Stock is roughly 75. Adding the 183 lost units gives a target mu_hat of ~258. This ensures the OR logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculates (258 - 250) which results in a positive replenishment order despite the phantom inventory, while lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period delivery cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Last 5 periods (P12-P16) mean demand dropped to 25.4 units/week from previous 43.0. Continuing mu_hat adjustment to offset 183 units of lost pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P4).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019-06-10), the product (women's jersey leggings) is in a low-demand regime. The last 5 weeks average 20.2 units/period (P13-P17), and the last 3 weeks average 15.6. There is a confirmed pipeline error: the 'In-transit' quantity of 183 units consists of orders from P1 (112), P3 (7), and P4 (64), all of which are lost/indefinitely delayed. However, the OR backend's capped policy subtracts this 183 from its base stock calculation, effectively preventing any new orders from being placed. To override this, I must set mu_hat to 'explicit' and include the 183 units as an offset to the forecasted target inventory. Using a target stock for (L+1)=3 periods based on a conservative demand estimate of 22 units/week (approx mean of the low regime), the base stock should be roughly 66. Adding the 183 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 249. This trick forces the backend to see (249 - 183) = 66 as the available coverage, allowing for replenishment if on-hand inventory drops too low. Currently, on-hand is 84, so no order is likely to trigger this period, which is appropriate given the current low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 13-17 average demand is 20.2 units/week, down from previous 43. Continuing mu_hat offset of 183 units to account for lost pipeline (P1, P3, P4).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17. Demand has significantly declined over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), averaging only 17.6 units/week, with the most recent two weeks dropping to single digits (6 and 5 units). This confirms a sustained regime shift toward lower demand for 'Women's Everyday Basics Leggings' as we move into summer. The reported 'In-transit' of 183 units consists entirely of orders from P1 (112), P3 (7), and P4 (64), which are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. To trigger replenishment despite this ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for (1+L) periods of current demand (approximately 3 * 18 = 54) plus an offset of 183 to neutralize the lost units in the OR backend's inventory calculation (total mu_hat = 237). This ensures the order logic (base_stock - pipeline) handles the actual inventory gap. I am using L=2 (promised) as recent fulfilled shipments have arrived in 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P13-P18): Average weekly demand has dropped to 17.6 units, reflecting a summer seasonal low. Shipment loss of 183 units (P1, P3, P4) remains constant; mu_hat must continue to include a 183-unit offset to account for these ghost units in the 'In-transit' figure.

As of Period 20 (late June), the SKU is in a low-demand summer phase. The current 'In-transit' level of 183 units consists of confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, and P4 (112 + 7 + 64). Because these units will never arrive but still count against the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset them and avoid unwanted stockouts. The recent demand regime (P13-P19) has averaged approximately 17.5 units per week. To calculate mu_hat: I take (1 + L) periods of demand plus the lost inventory offset. With L=2, (1+2)*17.5 + 183 = 52.5 + 183 = 235.5. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) is high enough so that (base_stock - 183) results in a meaningful target inventory level. Sigma_hat is set based on the standard deviation of recent low demand to reflect reduced volatility in this season.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-01. The demand analysis shows a significant and sustained drop in volume since Period 13, averaging 14.3 units per week (P13-P20), compared to the previous regime of ~43 units. This likely reflects a summer seasonal low for jersey leggings. The system currently reports 'In-transit: 183 units', but these consist of confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed shipments from Period 1 (112), Period 3 (7), and Period 4 (64). These 'ghost' units inflate the pipeline inventory and prevent the OR engine from ordering since it assumes replenishment is coming. To fix this, I must set mu_hat to include an explicit offset of 183 units atop the actual forecast for (L+1) periods. Using a mean demand of 15 units/week and a promised lead time L=2 (L+1=3), the base forecast is 45 units. Adding the 183-unit offset results in mu_hat = 228. This forces the OR backend to see a gap between demand and available 'effective' inventory, triggering necessary replenishment. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture current low volatility.

Carry-over insight: Refined Summer Demand Regime: Period 13-20 average demand is 14.3 units/week, down from the previous regime's 43. Persistent 183-unit 'ghost' in-transit inventory requires a permanent mu_hat offset of +183 to enable ordering.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), the SKU is in a clear summer seasonal low for jersey leggings. The demand regime from Period 13-21 shows a mean of 13.6 units/week (30, 24, 17, 24, 6, 5, 15, 11, 8). The 'In-transit' figure of 183 units remains composed of three confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (112), Period 3 (7), and Period 4 (64). Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity from the calculated base stock, these 183 'ghost' units prevent the system from placing new orders. To counteract this, I must set the mu_hat parameter to explicitly include an offset of 183 units plus the forecasted demand for the lead time and review period (L+1). With an expected lead time of 2, (L+1) = 3 periods. Forecasted demand for 3 periods is roughly 3 * 13.6 \u2248 41 units. Adding the offset, mu_hat = 41 + 183 = 224. This allows the backend to recognize that new inventory is needed despite the phantom pipeline. sigma_hat is set based on recent demand volatility in this low-demand regime (N=9).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in a summer seasonal low for this SKU (leggings/tights), with demand significantly dropping. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P13-P22) is 15.1 units/week, and the last 5 periods (P18-P22) show an even lower average of 8.8 units/week. We must address the persistent inventory discrepancy where 183 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are 'In-transit' but confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from 'base_stock', these 183 'ghost' units prevent any new ordering. To bypass this, I apply an explicit mu_hat offset. Using a target lead time of L=2 (promised), the required base stock for a 3-period window (L+1) at the current demand rate (~9 units/week) is approximately 27 units. To trigger an order despite the 183-unit ghost inventory and current 40 units on-hand (Total reported position = 223), I set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired base stock (27) and the lost pipeline (183), totaling 210. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to cover demand while neutralizing the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed summer demand regime: Average weekly demand for P18-P22 is 8.8 units, significantly lower than the P4-P12 average of 42.6. Maintain +183 unit offset in mu_hat to account for confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (2019/7/22), the SKU is in a low-demand summer regime. The last 5 periods (P19-P23) have an average demand of 13.6 units, while the current period's on-hand inventory is 11 units. The most critical factor remains the 183 units tied up in 'In-transit' that are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4). Since the OR backend uses a Base Stock - Pipeline policy, these 183 'ghost' units prevent any new orders from being placed. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to include an offset equal to the lost inventory (183 units) plus the expected demand over the lead time and review period (1+L). With L=2 (promised) and current average demand ~14, the expected demand is ~42. Total mu_hat \u2248 183 + 42 = 225. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this offset is applied, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the lower volatility of the current low-demand regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 25 (2019/7/29), the SKU is entering late summer. Demand has stabilized in a 'summer low' regime. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is 16.6 units, but the most recent 2 periods show a slight uptick (29 and 30). I will use recent_N=5 for demand to capture this current trend while smoothing volatility. The 'In-transit' figure of 214 units includes 183 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost (as documented in Carry-over Insights since Period 10). The effective pipeline is actually 31 units (ordered P24). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 214 units, it will see the inventory position as significantly over-supplied and refuse to order. To force an order that covers the true demand, I set mu_hat using 'explicit' as: (Forecasted demand for L+1 periods) + (Lost shipment offset). With L=2 (standard observed), L+1=3. (3 * 16.6) + 183 = ~233. This ensures the backend (base_stock - 214) calculates a positive order amount to replenish the actual 0 on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Summer low demand regime continues (avg ~16.6 units/week). Confirmed lost shipments P1, P3, P4 totaling 183 units persist in the 'In-transit' data, requiring a +183 mu_hat offset for the backend to function.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Date is 2019/08/05. In-Transit inventory is reported as 233 units, but 183 units (from P1: 112, P3: 7, P4: 64) are confirmed lost/delayed indefinitely. The effective pipeline consists only of orders from P24 (31 units) and P25 (19 units), totaling 50 units. Demand analysis: We are in a summer low regime. Demand for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged 19.8 units/week, with a standard deviation of approximately 11.9. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to compensate for the 183 'ghost' units in-transit. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat: ((1+L) * mean_demand) + 183. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 20) + 183 = 243. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - ghost_pipeline) correctly identifies the need for fresh inventory while accounting for the low summer demand volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in a summer demand regime where demand has recently ticked up slightly (avg of P23-P26 is 30.7 units/week), though it remains lower than the spring peak. The 'In-transit' figure of 243 units is heavily distorted by 183 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, and P4), which haven't arrived in over 20 periods. To allow the OR backend to place new orders, mu_hat must be offset by +183 to neutralize these 'ghost' units in the pipeline inventory calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Excluding the lost units, the effective pipeline consists of 60 units (ordered P24-P26). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are experiencing lost sales. I will set mu_hat to (3 periods * 30.7) + 183 = 275.1 to ensure replenishment starts. L is set to 'calculate' as recent fulfilled orders (P16) showed a lead time of 1, but the promised lead time is 2.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Historical data for this product (Womens Everyday Basics Leggings) shows a significant demand uptick starting around early August (P26-P27), likely driven by back-to-school shopping. Period 27 demand reached 62 units, compared to the summer low average of ~16. As of Period 28, on-hand inventory is 0 and the 'In-transit' figure is 257 units. However, as documented in carry-over insights, 183 of these units (orders P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline consists of P24 (31), P26 (10), and P27 (33), totaling 74 units. To force the OR backend's base-stock calculation to ignore the 183 'ghost' units, I must add 183 to the mu_hat. For the underlying demand, I am using a recent N=3 (P25-P27) to capture the back-to-school pulse. Mean demand (P25-P27) = (27+37+62)/3 = 42. Adjusted mu_hat = (1+L)*42 + 183. With L=2, mu_hat = 3*42 + 183 = 309. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school seasonal spike confirmed starting Period 26 (Demand 37, 62). Adjusted mu_hat must continue to include the +183 unit offset to neutralize the persistent 'ghost' in-transit inventory from P1, P3, and P4.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), we are in a back-to-school seasonal spike. Demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) was 37, 62, and 46, averaging 48.3 units/week. This is a significant increase from the summer low of ~14 units. For the backend OR logic, I must address the 183 units 'in-transit' that are confirmed lost (from P1, P3, and P4), as they artificially inflate the pipeline inventory and prevent the system from placing necessary orders. To counter this, I use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a base stock target that offsets the lost units: Target Base Stock = [(L+1) * Expected Demand] + Offset. With L=2 (standard observed), L+1=3. Expected demand is ~48 units/week. Base stock target = (3 * 48) + 183 = 327. For sigma_hat, I use the standard deviation of recent demand (P26-P28 is ~12.5) multiplied by sqrt(L+1) \u2248 1.73, giving ~21.7. This setup ensures the OR controller targets enough functional inventory to cover the spike despite the 'ghost' units.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand spike sustained (P26-P28 mean: 48.3 units). Persistent ghost in-transit inventory of 183 units requires continued mu_hat offset.

Current date is 2019/09/02. The product is Women's Jersey Leggings. We are in the middle of a 'Back-to-School' demand spike that began around P26. Demand for the last 4 periods (P26-P29) has been 37, 62, 46, and 39, averaging 46.0 units/week. This is a significant increase from the summer low of ~14 units/week. The reported 'In-transit' of 327 units includes 183 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. The effective pipeline consists of orders from P24 (31 units), P26 (10 units), P27 (33 units), P28 (52 units), and P29 (18 units), totaling 144 units. To ensure the backend OR logic (which subtracts the full 327 units from the base stock) places an order, I must increase mu_hat by the 183-unit 'ghost' inventory. Forecast: (1+L) * mean demand + offset = (1+2)*46 + 183 = 138 + 183 = 321. I will set mu_hat to 321. Sigma is set to reflect the higher volatility observed during the spike, roughly sqrt(3) * 11 (std dev of recent 4 weeks) \u2248 19.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Women's Everyday Basic Leggings) is in a back-to-school/autumn peak regime. Recent demand (P26-P30) reflects this shift with an average of 47.4 units/week, significantly higher than the summer low of ~15 units. There is a persistent 'ghost' in-transit inventory of 183 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) that still appears in the backend's 'In-transit' figure; I must continue to apply a +183 unit offset to the mu_hat parameter so the OR engine recognizes these units as unavailable and generates replenishment orders. Current On-hand is 32 units. Arrivals in P30 (33 from P27 and 52 from P28) confirm an average lead time of 2.5 periods recently. I will use N=5 for demand parameters to capture the current seasonal elevation while maintaining the offset for lost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Autumn demand regime confirmed: P26-P30 mean demand is 47.4 units/week. Continue +183 unit mu_hat offset to neutralize confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 still appearing in IT data.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019, which is squarely in the back-to-school/autumn season for women's leggings. Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the summer low; the average demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31) is 46.8 units/week. In-transit inventory is listed as 294 units, but this includes 183 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 111 units (ordered P29 and P31). To counteract the back-end logic that subtracts the full 294 from the base stock, I must continue adding an explicit offset of +183 to Mu_hat. Using a Lead Time (L) of 2, the calculated base stock needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). With an expected weekly demand of approximately 47 units, the required base stock is ~141. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite the 'ghost' 183 units in transit, I set Mu_hat to (141 + 183) = 324. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the volatility of the current autumn demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P26-P31) mean validated at 46.8 units/week. Ghost in-transit inventory of 183 units (P1, P3, P4) persists and requires constant mu_hat offset of +183.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23 (Period 33). The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Leggings', which shows clear seasonal patterns: a summer low (approx. P17-P25) followed by a significant 'back-to-school' and autumn recovery starting around P26. Demand for the last 7 periods (P26-P32) has averaged 46.0 units/week (37, 62, 46, 39, 53, 44, 41). The 'In-transit' count of 272 is heavily distorted by 183 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost/missing. Effective in-transit is 272 - 183 = 89 units (orders from P29 and P32). To ensure the OR backend places an order, mu_hat must neutralize this 183-unit 'ghost' inventory. I will set mu_hat based on the current autumn regime mean (46) multiplied by (1+L) plus the 183-unit offset. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 46) + 183 = 321. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility from the autumn regime (N=7).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School demand regime (P26-P32) confirmed with mean ~46 units/week. Persistent ghost in-transit inventory of 183 units (P1, P3, P4) requires constant mu_hat offset of +183 to trigger replenishment.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, we are in the middle of a sustained Autumn demand regime (P26-P33). The most recent demand sample was 87 units, which is a significant spike compared to the regime average of ~47. This suggests either a peak or increasing volatility. The 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 310 units; however, 183 of these are confirmed ghost units from periods 1, 3, and 4 that will never arrive. The effective pipeline consists of orders from P26 (10), P29 (18), P32 (30), and P33 (38), totaling 96 units, plus the 31 units from P24 which are now severely overdue and likely lost as well (increasing potential ghost units to 214). To trigger the OR engine's replenishment logic despite these ghost units in the internal 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, I must inflate mu_hat. I will apply an offset of +183 to the forecasted demand. I am using recent_N=8 for mu_hat (covering the Autumn regime P26-P33) which yields an average of 51.1; adding the 183 offset gives 234.1. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*234.1. With L=2, this is 3 * 234.1 = 702.3. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Effective pipeline excludes 183 units (P1, P3, P4) confirmed lost. P24 (31 units) is now 10 periods old and likely lost, potentially increasing ghost inventory to 214 units. Demand P26-P33 mean is 51.1 units/week, with a significant spike to 87 in P33.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in the mid-autumn season for women's leggings, and demand remains strong (last 5 periods mean: 57.6). There is a significant inventory discrepancy: the 'In-transit' figure of 572 units includes 183 units confirmed lost (Periods 1, 3, 4) and 31 units likely lost (Period 24, now 11 periods overdue), totaling 214 'ghost' units. To ensure the backend OR engine orders replenishment, I must offset this ghost inventory by adding it to mu_hat. For Period 35, the base demand forecast is based on the recent regime (P31-P34 mean = 58.75). Calculation for mu_hat: (1 + L) * average_demand + ghost_offset = (1 + 2) * 58.75 + 214 \u2248 176 + 214 = 390. Sigma_hat is set using recent volatility (N=5) to handle the high variance observed in P33.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed lost shipment Period 24 (31 units), bringing total ghost in-transit inventory to 214 units (P1, P3, P4, P24). This requires a persistent +214 unit offset in mu_hat to neutralize the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 is currently in an Autumn demand regime (P26-P35) with a mean demand of approximately 54 units/week. Recent periods (P33-P35) show heightened demand (87, 63, 70), indicating a likely seasonal peak. The environment currently reports 542 units 'In-transit', but this includes significant 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments: P1 (112), P3 (7), P4 (64), and P24 (31), totaling 214 units. Subtracting these from 542 leaves an effective pipeline of 328 units (P29, P33, P34). Because the OR backend subtracts the total reported 'In-transit' from its calculated base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that incorporates an offset to neutralize these 214 units. Target base stock = (1 + L) * Forecast + Offset. With L=2 and Forecast=60 (to account for the recent upward trend), the target is (3 * 60) + 214 = 394. Setting mu_hat to 394 and sigma_hat to 30 (to account for high recent volatility) will allow the system to maintain a healthy inventory position despite the reporting errors.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment summary update: P1 (112), P3 (7), P4 (64), and P24 (31) totaling 214 units are indefinitely delayed/lost. These units remain in 'In-transit' indefinitely. Demand for P33-P35 shows a sustained spike (avg 73), signaling a late autumn peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21. We are in a high-demand autumn/late-autumn period for women's leggings, with recent demand (P33-P36) averaging 70.25 units/week. The reported In-transit inventory of 504 units contains a significant volume of 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed shipments: P1 (112), P3 (7), P4 (64), and P24 (31), totaling 214 units. Furthermore, the large order of 262 units from P34 is still in transit (3-period mark at start of P37), and based on P35/P36 arrivals having a lead time of 3, this order should arrive during Period 37. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 214 lost units as available supply and prematurely cutting off orders, I am maintaining an 'explicit' mu_hat. This mu_hat is calculated as: Forecasted need for L+1 periods (3 weeks * 70 units/week = 210) + Ghost Offset (214) = 424. This ensures the engine identifies a need to maintain the current flow despite the inflated pipeline data. Lead time L is set to 2 (promised), as calculate/recent_N would average in the outliers without accounting for the inventory loss logic.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment summary update: P1 (112), P3 (7), P4 (64), and P24 (31) totaling 214 units are indefinitely delayed/lost. These units remain in 'In-transit' indefinitely, requiring a +214 mu_hat offset. Late autumn demand (P33-P36) stabilized at ~70 units/week.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28. We are in a high-demand late autumn regime. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is approximately 74.4 units/week. Inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0, and the reported 'In-transit' of 504 units includes 214 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P24). The 'effective' pipeline is therefore 290 units (mostly from the large P34 order of 262 units). To counter the 214 lost units that remain in the backend's pipeline calculation and prevent it from suppressing new orders, I must apply a +214 offset to mu_hat. Without this offset, the OR backend would see 290 (actual) + 214 (ghost) = 504 units in transit, which far exceeds the target base stock for a ~75 unit/week demand, resulting in zero orders. By setting mu_hat to (1+L)*(74.4) + 214, the backend will correctly perceive the need for replenishment. Actual lead times recently have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I will stick with the promised L=2 for calculations but keep the volume high to ensure service levels.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand regime (P33-P37) confirmed at ~74.4 units/week, up from ~47 baseline. Persistent ghost in-transit inventory remains at 214 units (P1, P3, P4, P24), necessitating a constant mu_hat offset of +214.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04, entering the November peak demand period for leggings. Demand has shifted to a higher regime since P33, with a 6-week average of 73.5 units (P33-P38). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the reported 'In-transit' of 504 units includes 214 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P24). The actual pipeline consists of the P34 order (262 units), which has now exceeded the promised lead time of 2 periods (it's at L=5). Given the recent trend of lead times stretching to 3 periods (P35, P36) and the current delay of the large P34 order, I am setting L=3 to account for potential supply chain friction and to increase the base stock level. mu_hat is set to 514 using an explicit offset strategy: (1+L) * mean_demand + ghost_inventory. With L=3 and mean_demand=75, this is 4*75 + 214 = 514. This offset is necessary because the OR backend subtracts the full 504 'In-transit' (which includes the 214 ghosts) from the target base stock. Setting mu_hat to 514 ensures the backend recognizes a need for stock despite the inflated pipeline figure.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand regime (P33-P38) confirmed at ~73.5 units/week. P34 order (262 units) is now overdue (L=5), potentially indicating further lead time volatility or loss. Ghost inventory remains at 214 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, entering the late autumn/pre-holiday season. Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime from Period 33 to Period 39, averaging 73.3 units/week. This represents a significant increase from the previous Autumn 'Back-to-School' mean of ~47 units. The reported 'In-transit' inventory of 514 units contains 214 units of 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P24) and likely contains another 262 units from the overdue P34 order (now L=6). Because the base stock policy (base_stock - pipeline) will see 514 units in transit and refuse to order, I must continue using the 'mu_hat offset' strategy. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L)*(mean demand) + ghost inventory. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+2)*73.3 + 214 = 434. This offset allows the backend to recognize that 214 units in the pipeline are effectively non-existent, triggering necessary replenishment for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Late autumn demand regime (P33-P39) confirmed at mean ~73.3 units/week. P34 order (262 units) is now extremely overdue (L=6) and may be lost, but not yet added to ghost inventory. Total confirmed ghost inventory (P1, P3, P4, P24) remains 214 units, requiring a mu_hat offset of +214.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 is currently in a late autumn high-demand regime (P33-P40 mean: 71.5 units/week). The 'In-transit' figure of 514 units is significantly inflated by confirmed and highly probable lost shipments. Specifically: P1 (112), P3 (7), P4 (64), P24 (31), and now P34 (262 units, ordered P34 and still not arrived by P41, lead_time 7+). Total ghost inventory is 476 units (112+7+64+31+262). Subtracting 476 from the total In-transit of 514 leaves an effective pipeline of 38 units (ordered in P33 and arrived/accounted for, or P39's order). Since current on-hand is 0 and effective pipeline is minimal (just the P39 order of 10 units), we are severely under-stocked for the current demand level. I will set mu_hat using an explicit value that accounts for the mean demand over (L+1) periods plus the 476 units of ghost inventory to trigger an order through the capped policy. Expected target inventory (L=2) is ~214 units. Adding 476 ghost units requires mu_hat to be around 690 to force the backend to place a real order.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Order from Period 34 (262 units) is now confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (L=7+). Total ghost in-transit inventory increased to 476 units (P1, P3, P4, P24, P34). Current demand regime (P33-P40) mean stabilized at 71.5 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the late autumn regime (P33-P41) has stabilized with a mean of 71.3 units/week. We are currently facing a critical stockout situation (on-hand=0). The 'In-transit' figure of 680 units is severely inflated by confirmed lost shipments: P1 (112), P3 (7), P4 (64), P24 (31), and now P34 (262), totaling 476 'ghost' units. The actual effective pipeline is only 204 units (ordered P41 and possibly earlier small amounts). To force the OR backend's capped base-stock policy to trigger a replenishment order despite the inflated pipeline, I am applying a +476 unit offset to the mu_hat parameter. This effectively 'neutralizes' the ghost inventory in the backend's order logic (Order = BaseStock - IT). I am using the recent_N method with N=9 to capture the current demand regime mean (~71) and then explicitly calculating mu_hat as (1+L)*71.3 + 476. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = 3*71.3 + 476 = 689.9. Logic: (3*71) + 476 = 689.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total confirmed ghost in-transit inventory is 476 units (P1: 112, P3: 7, P4: 64, P24: 31, P34: 262). These units will likely never arrive. Continuous +476 offset in mu_hat is required to enable replenishment.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019, approaching the peak holiday season. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 118, confirming a late-year peak. The current mean demand for the late autumn/winter regime (P33-P42) is 76.3 units/week. The total confirmed ghost in-transit inventory is 476 units (P1: 112, P3: 7, P4: 64, P24: 31, P34: 262). These units remain in the reported 'In-transit' figure of 689, but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must add this 476-unit ghost inventory back into mu_hat as an offset. I will use a smoothed mean of 76 for the forecast. Therefore, mu_hat = (1 + L) * 76 + 476. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 76 + 476 = 704. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the increased volatility observed during this seasonal peak (std dev is approx 18-20, so sqrt(3)*20 ~ 35).

Carry-over insight: Late-year seasonal peak confirmed: P42 demand spiked to 118; mean demand for P33-P42 is 76.3 units/week. Total ghost in-transit inventory remains 476 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44, entering the final segment of the year. Recent demand (P33-P43) has averaged 73.3 units/week, with a late peak in P42 (118) followed by a dip in P43 (47). The total confirmed ghost in-transit inventory remains 476 units (P1, P3, P4, P24, P34). These units still appear in the 'In-transit' count (currently 528) but will likely never arrive. To allow the OR backend to place orders, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Units. With L=2 (promised and recently observed), and a forecast based on the late autumn mean (~73), mu_hat = (3 * 73) + 476 = 695. This offset effectively neutralizes the 476 units of 'ghost' inventory. sigma_hat is set based on the standard deviation of recent demand (approx 20) transformed for (1+L).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. We are in the late-year demand period. Recent demand (P33-P44) has averaged approximately 72.8 units/week. The reported In-transit inventory of 566 units is essentially composed of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments: P1 (112), P3 (7), P4 (64), P24 (31), and P34 (262), totaling 476 units. The true pipeline inventory consists only of orders from P42 (9), P43 (15), and P44 (38), totaling 62 units. To force the OR backend to place orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' count, I must maintain an explicit mu_hat offset. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*73 + 476. With L=2, mu_hat = 3*73 + 476 = 695. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 476 units that will never arrive and targets a mean-demand replenishment for the current high-demand season. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=12) to capture the higher volatility of the current autumn/winter regime.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, peaking in the holiday season. Historical data shows consistent demand around 60-80 units/week for this product (Womens Leggings) during late autumn and early winter. Last period demand was 67. Lead time remains approximately 2-3 periods. Crucial: The 'In-transit' figure of 610 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments: P1 (112), P3 (7), P4 (64), P24 (31), and P34 (262), totaling 476 units. These 'ghost' units prevent the OR engine from ordering unless mu_hat is offset. To counteract this, mu_hat is set using an explicit value. The calculation for the base stock target is: (Desired Mean Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory Offset. Based on recent demand (~70 units/week) and L=2: (70 * 3) + 476 = 686. I will set mu_hat to 686 to ensure the system places an order to cover the upcoming post-holiday period. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 120 (approx sqrt(3) * 70) to account for holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost in-transit inventory remains 476 units (P1, P3, P4, P24, P34). These are permanently lost and require a +476 offset in mu_hat to allow the OR backend to trigger new orders. Current demand regime (P33-P45) is stable at ~72 units/week during the Q4 peak.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering Period 47 (Dec 30). Demand has stabilized in a high-demand Q4 regime. Over the last 14 periods (P33-P46), the mean demand is 72.8 units/week. The 'In-transit' figure of 668 units includes 476 units from confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed shipments (P1: 112, P3: 7, P4: 64, P24: 31, P34: 262). These 476 units must be neutralized using an offset in mu_hat so the OR backend recognizes the true stock-out risk. The effective pipeline inventory is 192 units (orders from P44, P45, P46). Mean demand L+1 (3 weeks) is approximately 218 units. Adding the 476-unit offset to this base demand (218 + 476 = 694) will allow the backend to trigger necessary replenishment despite the inflated 'In-transit' data. Lead time remains approximately 2 periods, though occasionally drifting to 3.
