Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, we only have historical demand data (5 samples) and no replenishment history. The average demand across these 5 weeks is 46.8 units (50, 38, 43, 60, 43). The product is a soft sweatshirt, tending to have higher demand in winter/early spring. Given the date (Feb 11), we are in the middle of this season. Since promised lead time is 2, the pipeline needs to cover 3 periods (L+1). My strategy is to use the existing history to set a baseline. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (all samples) to establish the current regime's mean (approx 46.8 * 3 = 140.4) and 'default' for sigma_hat. 'L' is set to 'default' as we have no reason to doubt the 2-period promise yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is a seasonal apparel item. Looking at the historical demand for the past 5 weeks (50, 38, 43, 60, 43) and the first period's performance (demand=51), the average weekly demand is approximately 47.5 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, 61 units were ordered and are currently in-transit. Since on-hand is 0 and demand was 51, we had 51 units of lost sales in Period 1. We need to replenish inventory to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current review period (total 3 periods of demand). With a mean of ~47.5 and some volatility, the base stock target should be around 142.5. The system will subtract the 61 units in-transit, leading to a new order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including the P1 observation) to capture the most relevant demand mean and variance while maintaining the default lead time of 2.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand has shown a significant increase from an initial average of ~47 units (pre-game samples) to 51 and 97 in Periods 1 and 2. This represents a potential seasonal trend for sweatshirts in February/March. We have 122 units in transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since the promised lead time is 2, the P1 order (61 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase, making it visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales. I am adjusting mu_hat to account for the recent demand spike and selecting L=default (2) while waiting for confirmation of actual lead time. I will use recent_N=5 for demand and sigma to capture the recent volatility and volume increase.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 177 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (61 units) should have arrived during Period 3 and been visible at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, meaning the Period 1 order is either delayed or the lead time is at least 3 periods. Historical demand (pre-game + Periods 1-3) shows: 50, 38, 43, 60, 43, 51, 97, 58. The mean of these 8 samples is ~55. Period 2 saw a spike (97), likely a random fluctuation or early spring demand for a 'soft sweatshirt'. Given the in-transit balance (177) already covers ~3 periods of average demand (55 * 3 = 165), I will maintain the base stock logic. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the recent slight increase in mean, and an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the observed delay of the Period 1 order.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a Men's sweatshirt. Historical demand data shows a significant spike in Period 2 (97 units) compared to the initial samples (avg ~47) and recent weeks (P3: 58, P4: 44). The average demand over the 5 sample periods was ~46.8. However, recent demand (P1-P4) shows a mean of 62.5, heavily skewed by the P2 outlier. The promised lead time is 2, and the conclusion from P4 confirms an actual lead time of 2 for the P2 order. Currently, on-hand is low (17) due to late arrival of initial orders, but in-transit (187) contains orders from P1, P3, and P4. The P1 order is overdue (placed P1, expected P3, not arrived by P4 conclude). If P1 is lost, we need to ensure current orders cover demand. The target service level (q) is 0.5 (Profit 1 / (Profit 1 + Holding 1)), suggesting we shouldn't overstock aggressively. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the slightly higher recent levels (N=4) and 'default' for lead time and sigma.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a sweatshirt, which typically sees steady demand in late winter/early spring but might soften as warmer weather approaches. Current on-hand is 0, with 187 units in-transit. History shows an actual lead time of 2 periods (P4 arrival confirms P2 order). The P1 order (61 units) is now overdue (it should have arrived in P3), and the P3 order (55 units) should arrived in P5 but didn't. This suggests some shipments may be lost or significantly delayed. Total demand over the last 5 weeks: 51, 97, 58, 44, 29 (Mean: 55.8, Std Dev: 25.6). Since we have had several missing shipments (P1 and P3), I will set L to 3 to effectively increase the safety lead time/pipeline coverage in case of delays. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent downward trend in demand, and default for sigma_hat to maintain a broad safety buffer given the supply volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Reviewing the history for SKU 685813005 (Petar Sweatshirt): On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 224 units in-transit. In Period 4, an order from Period 2 arrived (lead_time=2), but the order from Period 1 (61 units) and Period 3 (55 units) have not yet 'concluded' as arrived, despite the promised lead time of 2. This suggests either longer actual lead times or lost shipments. The demand has been volatile, peaking at 97 in P2 and settling to an average of approx 47.9 across the last 11 samples (including pre-game). Currently, we are out of stock. The high in-transit amount includes potentially 'lost' or 'delayed' units from P1 and P3. To stabilize, I will use lead time L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent downward trend in demand (P2-P6 mean is approx 53) and avoid over-ordering given the high pipeline, while acknowledging that the OR backend caps orders based on the pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a soft sweatshirt, typically a seasonal item. Demand has been volatile (ranging 29-97). Looking at the history, an order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (L=2). However, orders from Period 1 (61 units), Period 3 (55 units), Period 4 (71 units), and Period 6 (37 units) have not yet 'concluded' as arrived. Total in-transit is 224. This suggests either a significant lead-time extension or lost shipments. Specifically, the Period 1 order is now 7 periods old (promised 2), suggesting it is likely lost. The Period 3 order is 5 periods old. Because the stock is currently 0 and demand is being lost, I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the only confirmed data point (L=2) while monitoring for new arrivals. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the more recent demand levels (97, 58, 44, 29, 37, 50), which average approximately 50-60 units per period. This balances against the earlier higher spikes. My parameters aim to trigger safety stock recovery given the stockout.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Reviewing history: P1 order (61 units) is lost (8 periods passed, promised L=2); P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2); P3 order (55 units) is likely lost (6 periods passed); P6 order arrived in P8 (L=2). Demand remains relatively stable between 30-60 units. Current on-hand is 0, with 187 units in-transit (P4=71, P7=0, P8=0 units were ordered, wait \u2013 Game History shows In-transit is 187). Looking at the orders placed: P1=61, P2=61 (arrived), P3=55, P4=71, P6=37 (arrived). The 'In-transit' of 187 likely consists of P1(61) + P3(55) + P4(71) = 187. Since P1 and P3 are significantly overdue, they are effectively lost. The backend OR engine sees 'In-transit' as 187, which stops it from ordering more. To force an order to cover the current stockout and future demand, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. Expected demand mean is ~47. With L=2, the total pipeline coverage needed is (2+1)*47 = 141. However, since 187 units are 'in-transit' but likely lost, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to set a target base stock that exceeds the phantom pipeline (187) plus the required safety stock, ensuring a new order is triggered.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P1 (61 units) and P3 (55 units) are confirmed lost/missing as they are >4 periods past lead time. These units remain in the 'In-transit' calculation, requiring mu_hat adjustments to trigger new orders.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), inventory is 0 and we are facing persistent stockouts despite an 'In-transit' count of 338. Analysis of arrivals confirms that orders from Period 1 (61 units), Period 3 (55 units), and Period 4 (71 units) are lost/missing (now 6-9 periods past order date, well beyond the promised lead time of 2). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 338 units of 'pipeline_inventory' from the base stock calculation, it will not order more units unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to compensate for the 187 lost units (61+55+71). Historical demand is relatively stable, averaging ~49 units per week (samples: 50, 38, 43, 60, 43, 51, 97, 58, 44, 29, 37, 50, 44, 36). To force an order that covers the current period and lead time (L+1 = 3 weeks) while bypassing the ghost 'In-transit' units, I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 450 (which accounts for ~150 units of real demand + 300 to offset the pipeline). I maintain L at 2 based on the successful deliveries in periods 4 and 8.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Confirmed order from P4 (71 units) is also lost (6 periods since order). Total lost units in pipeline: 187 (P1:61, P3:55, P4:71). These units do not arrive but block the OR engine from ordering.

The 'In-transit' pipeline is 299 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders from Period 1 (61), Period 3 (55), and Period 4 (71) are confirmed lost, totaling 187 'phantom' units that will never arrive. These phantom units prevent the OR engine from ordering because it believes pipeline inventory is higher than it is. To compensate, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1, where L=2). Since the recent demand average is approximately 40 units/period (last 5 samples: 50, 44, 36, 18 - mean ~37), a normal target would be ~120 units. However, to 'trick' the backend into ignoring the 187 phantom units and maintaining enough stock, I set mu_hat to 320 (approx 133 on-hand + 187 phantom = 320). This ensures the OR engine doesn't see a surplus. I continue with L=2 and a standard sigma_hat based on recent volatility to reflect the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Phantoms units in pipeline (187 units from P1, P3, P4) continue to suppress OR engine orders. mu_hat must be set explicitly high to offset this inventory bloat.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we face a significant inventory management challenge due to 'phantom' in-transit inventory. The backend records 299 units in-transit, but 187 of these (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost/missing as they are 7-10 periods overdue. The current on-hand inventory is 111. The recent demand (P10-11) has softened significantly to 18-22 units per week, possibly due to the spring season for a sweatshirt product, compared to the earlier average of ~47. 

To manage this, we must reconcile the pipeline. Active in-transit units: P9 (arrived), P10 (112 units). Total real inventory (on-hand + active in-transit) = 111 + 112 = 223 units. With demand around 20 units/period and a 2-period lead time, 223 units covers ~11 weeks of demand. The OR engine thinks we have 111 + 299 = 410 units. Because we have sufficient real stock for the immediate future (over 10 periods), we will allow the current inventory to deplete rather than forcing an order to compensate for lost units. We set mu_hat using the recent 3-period demand (avg ~25) to reflect the recent slowdown, which will correctly prevent further ordering until the excessive on-hand/active transit stock is consumed.

Carry-over insight: Current real inventory (223 units) plus current demand slowdown (~20-25 units/week) means no new orders are required despite the 187 phantom 'in-transit' units. The system is overstocked for the current demand regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the sweatshirt product is entering the warmer spring/summer season where demand for 'soft brushed inside' garments naturally tapers off. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged 27 units, significantly lower than the early year average of ~50. On-hand inventory is 70 units, which covers over 2.5 periods of current demand. The total 'In-transit' of 299 units includes 187 confirmed phantom/lost units (Period 1: 61, Period 3: 55, Period 4: 71) and 112 units arriving from Period 10 (which should arrive in Period 13 as lead time stands at ~2-3 periods). Due to the high on-hand levels and the impending arrival of 112 units, the system is significantly overstocked relative to the current low demand regime. I am setting L to 2 (promised), and mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the lower demand (approx 27 units/period for 3 periods = 81 total for mu_hat). No new orders are desired.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-April demand is ~27 units/week, down from ~50 units/week earlier in the year, likely due to seasonal warming. Phantom inventory continues to persist at 187 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a warm garment consistent with decreasing demand as the weather warms (moving deeper into Spring/Summer). Demand has shifted from ~50 units/week to ~27 units/week in the last four periods (18, 22, 41, 30). Total In-transit is reported as 299 units. This includes 187 confirmed 'phantom' units (P1: 61, P3: 55, P4: 71) that are lost and will never arrive, but the OR backend factors them into pipeline inventory. Actual pipeline is 112 units (from P10). On-hand is 40. Total real inventory (112 + 40 = 152) is more than sufficient to cover current demand of ~27-30/week for several periods. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure no new orders are placed while we bleed off the excess on-hand inventory, and because the OR engine's internal 'pipeline_inventory' logic is still being blocked by the 187 units. No action is needed for L or sigma_hat at this time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813005 (Petar Sweatshirt) is experiencing a seasonal demand decline as we enter late May (Spring/Summer), with recent demand averaging ~27 units (P10-P14). The current on-hand inventory is 15 units. There are 299 units 'In-transit', but 187 of these (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/phantom units. Additionally, the order of 112 units from P10 is now 5 periods past its order date (promised lead time 2); it has not arrived and should likely be considered lost, bringing total phantom inventory to 299. Since the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' includes these 299 units, and the target base stock for a lead time of 2 (3 periods of demand) at the current rate of 27 units/week is only ~81 units, the OR engine will not order anything unless we explicitly inflate mu_hat to overcome the 299 phantom units. However, given the seasonal transition away from sweatshirts, holding high inventory is risky (Holding Cost = Profit). I will set mu_hat to a value that balances the phantom inventory (299) plus a small safety buffer for the next 3 weeks (~80 units) to trigger a small replenishment if necessary, though at this stage, clearing existing real stock is the priority.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Total phantom units in pipeline confirmed at 299 (P1:61, P3:55, P4:71, P10:112). These orders are 5+ periods past promised delivery and are blocking all standard OR calculations.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a PETAR SWEATSHIRT. We are currently in late May (2019-05-27), a period of warming weather where demand for 'soft brushed inside' sweatshirts is naturally lower. Historical data from May shows a shift toward ~25-40 units/week, significantly lower than the ~50/week seen in February/March. Current inventory situation: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 365. This pipeline is severely bloated by lost/phantom shipments: P1 (61), P3 (55), P4 (71), and P10 (112). These 299 units are 5+ periods past their order date and extremely unlikely to arrive. Only the order from P15 (66 units) is genuinely in-transit. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' as a deduction from the target base stock. Because the engine sees 365 units in transit, it will not order unless mu_hat is set to a value exceeding (365 + safety stock). To trigger an order that covers (~3 periods * 35 mean) = ~105 units of real demand, I must set mu_hat to offset the 299 phantom units plus the target inventory. I set mu_hat explicitly to 450 to force the backend to place a small order despite the 365 units reported in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed phantom inventory now totals 299 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Actual mean demand in May/June regime is ~35 units/period. The order from P15 (66 units) is the only active shipment expected to arrive (L=2).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the system faces a critical inventory integrity issue. There are currently 450 units 'In-transit', but most are 'phantom units' that will never arrive. The breakdown is: 299 units confirmed lost from P1, P3, P4, and P10 (all >5 periods past delivery). The only active, viable shipments are from P15 (ordered 66) and P16 (ordered 85), totaling 151 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (last 4 periods) has stabilized at ~34.25 units/period after a seasonal dip in April. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 450 units of in-transit 'bloat', I must set mu_hat (target pipeline inventory) high enough to overcome the phantom stock. Target Stock = (Demand Over L+1) + Phantom Inventory. With L=2, demand over 3 periods is ~103 units. Adding the 299 phantom units equals 402. Currently, the in-transit (450) exceeds this, so I will set mu_hat to 500 to trigger a restock of ~50 units to meet demand for the upcoming periods while we wait for P15/P16 arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory in pipeline confirmed at 299 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Any units ordered before Period 15 that have not arrived are strictly considered lost. Only P15-P16 orders (151 units total) are considered active in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-125.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that on-hand inventory is 138 units due to the arrival of orders from P15 and P16. Demand in Period 17 was low (13 units). The 'In-transit' total of 349 units is heavily bloated by 299 phantom units from lost shipments (P1: 61, P3: 55, P4: 71, P10: 112). These phantoms block the backend OR engine from ordering unless mu_hat is set to exceed (On-hand + Phantom + True In-transit). The current true inventory position is 188 (138 on-hand + 50 from P17). The demand regime for this sweatshirt in early summer (June) is approximately 32-35 units/period. To ensure the backend places an order and compensates for the 299 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to at least (True Inventory + Phantoms + Safety Stock). Calculation: 188 (true) + 299 (phantom) + (3 periods * 35 demand per period) = ~592. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 600 to trigger a replenishment order of approximately 113 units (depending on the internal OR cap), as the item is a sweatshirt entering warmer months and we want to maintain stock without over-committing to high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Total phantom inventory verified at 299 units. Arrival of P15 and P16 orders confirms actual lead time remains inconsistent (1-2 periods). Sweatshirt demand remains stable around 35 units/period during the transition into June.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/06/17), the item (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) is in a low-demand summer regime. Recent demand over the last 4 periods (P15-P18) has averaged 27.5 units, though the late-spring/early-summer average (P11-P18) is approximately 25 units. There are 123 units currently on-hand. The 'In-transit' figure of 462 units is heavily inflated by 299 'phantom' units (confirmed lost from P1, P3, P4, and P10). Excluding these, the real pipeline contains 163 units (P17: 50, P18: 113). Total real inventory (on-hand + real in-transit) is 286 units, which covers ~11 periods of current demand. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (including phantom units) from the base_stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to neutralize this inventory bloat if I want an order. However, with 123 units on-hand and 163 legitimate units incoming against a demand of ~25-30/week, the stock is more than sufficient. I will set parameters to maintain current levels without forcing redundant orders, while adjusting for the phantom units so the logic remains sound.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 24th, 2019. The SKU 685813005 (Petar Sweatshirt) is experiencing a significant seasonal demand drop as we move deep into the summer months. Historical demand for the last five weeks (P15-P19) shows sample values of 38, 44, 13, 15, and 3. The average for this recent period is approximately 22.6 units. Inventory management is currently complicated by a massive 'phantom pipeline' of 299 units (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10) which are confirmed lost but still count towards the OR engine's pipeline inventory. The current actual inventory position is healthy: 233 units on-hand and 50 units (from P17) in-transit that are legitimately expected. This total of 283 units is far more than enough to cover the current low-demand regime (approx. 23 units/period) for the (L+1) horizon. No new orders are desired. To prevent the backend from ordering, I will set mu_hat to be very low, while keeping L at the promised lead time of 2. I'm using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to reflect the most recent summer slowdown, and explicitly setting a low sigma because the demand variance is compressed in this low-volume period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand collapse confirmed: June demand dropped significantly (avg ~10 units/period for last 3 periods), shifting the regime from the May average of ~35. Phantom inventory remains at 299 units and must be perpetually accounted for to prevent ordering errors.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The PETAR SWEATSHIRT is in a deep summer demand trough (June/July), with demand dropping to nearly zero (only 4 units sold over the last two periods). Current on-hand inventory is 232 units, which is extremely high (covering over 100 weeks at current rates). Total in-transit inventory is 349 units, but 299 of these are confirmed phantom units from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 that never arrived. The effective pipeline consists of 50 units ordered in Period 17 (overdue, 4 periods since order, possibly lost). Given the zero profit/high holding cost risk and massive overstock relative to current demand, no orders should be placed. To prevent the OR backend from ordering, I keep mu_hat low to reflect the summer regime and retain default L, effectively ensuring base_stock remains below the massive existing inventory (real + phantom).

Carry-over insight: July demand regime confirmed extremely low (~1-2 units/period), following the June drop. Total potential phantom/lost inventory in pipeline is now 349 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, and now likely P17).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is experiencing a significant seasonal demand collapse as we enter July. Historical demand for the last three periods (P19-P21) has been 3, 1, and 7 units respectively, confirming a low-demand summer regime (avg ~3.6 units/period). This is a sharp drop from the May/June average of ~35 units. Current on-hand inventory is 225 units, which is enough to cover over 60 weeks of demand at the current rate. Additionally, the system reports 349 units in-transit. Based on the consolidated history in Carry-over Insights, these 349 units are 'phantom' or lost shipments (from P1, P3, P4, P10, and now likely P17, which is 5 periods overdue). Even though the OR engine sees 574 units (on-hand + phantom in-transit) and shouldn't order anyway, I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand reality. The holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), making overstocking very expensive. No new orders are needed and none are expected to arrive.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime confirmed at extreme low (~3-7 units/period). Phantom inventory remains high at 349 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17) and is considered lost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in a summer demand trough for the PETAR SWEATSHIRT, with recent demand over the last 3 periods averaging 9 units (1, 7, 19). The 'in-transit' pipeline contains 349 phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17) which are confirmed lost as they are many periods past the promised lead time of 2. On-hand inventory is currently 206 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the current demand regime (approx 20+ weeks of stock at current rates). No new orders are needed. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 349 phantom units as real pipeline inventory (which would result in negative orders or suppressed future needed orders), I must maintain 'mu_hat' at a level that accounts for these lost units, although presently, the massive on-hand surplus makes any ordering impossible regardless. I will set L to recent observations to reflect the 1-2 period delivery speed and adjust mu_hat to be conservatively low based on the July regime.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime for sweatshirts is confirmed low, averaging ~9 units/period over the last 3 weeks. Phantom inventory remains static at 349 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17) and is considered permanently lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-186.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a warm garment clearly entering a low-demand summer phase (June-July). Current on-hand inventory is 196 units, while the most recent demand samples are 1, 7, 19, and 10 units. The average demand for the 'July' regime is approximately 9.25 units per period. The pipeline is currently bloated with 349 phantom (lost) units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17). With 196 units on hand and a demand rate of ~10 units/period, we have approximately 20 periods of supply, which is far beyond the safety stock requirement. No new orders are needed. To prevent the OR engine from erroneously ordering due to the 349 phantom units in the 'in-transit' calculation, I am setting mu_hat to a very low value. This ensures (mu_hat - pipeline_inventory) remains negative, resulting in zero new orders while we bleed off the excess stock.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25 (July 29, 2019), the inventory situation for the Petar Sweatshirt is heavily impacted by both a summer demand collapse and a significant volume of lost shipments. Demand in July has averaged approximately 11 units per period (7, 19, 10, 9), confirming a low-season regime for fleece-lined garments. On-hand inventory is 187 units, which at the current demand rate, covers over 16 weeks of sales. Furthermore, there are 349 units in 'In-transit' that are effectively 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17 that have not arrived and are well past the lead time). Because the OR engine counts these 349 units as available pipeline inventory and the on-hand stock is already excessive for the summer season, no ordering is required. We will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current 11 units/period demand regime. Since we want to ensure the engine does not order until both on-hand and phantom inventory are depleted, the parameters will remain conservative.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime for sweatshirts is confirmed at a low average of ~11 units/period (based on P21-P24). Phantom inventory remains at 349 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17) and is considered permanently lost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), the PETAR sweatshirt is in a low-demand summer phase. Recent demand (P21-P25) has averaged 13.6 units, but the last several weeks (P19-P25) show an average closer to 10 units, confirming the 'Summer collapse' noted in carry-overs. Current on-hand inventory is 164 units, which at ~10-15 units/week provides over 10 periods of coverage. There is still 349 units of phantom 'In-transit' inventory (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 17) which are long overdue and considered lost. These phantoms inflate the pipeline inventory, preventing the OR backend from ordering. However, given the significant overstock relative to summer demand, no new orders are desired. I will maintain mu_hat at a level that acknowledges the summer regime while preventing accidental orders. With high on-hand stock and a high phantom pipeline, any standard base-stock calculation will result in zero orders, which is the correct economic choice (maximizing profit by minimizing further holding costs).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (June-August) confirmed steady at approximately 10-15 units/period. Phantom inventory remains static at 349 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late summer period (August 12th). Historical demand for this sweatshirt SKU has been in a sustained low regime (June-August) with an average demand of approximately 14 units/period over the last 6 weeks (P21-P26). On-hand inventory is currently 148 units, which covers over 10 periods of the current average demand. Notably, the 'In-transit' figure of 349 units is comprised entirely of phantom inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P18) that never arrived. Because our current on-hand inventory (148) is significantly higher than any reasonable base stock level for the current demand (mu_hat for L+1 periods would be ~42 units), no new orders are required. We will set mu_hat and L to reflect the current regime while acknowledging the pipeline inventory bloat; the OR backend will naturally see (on-hand + in-transit) >> base_stock and order 0.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are exiting the peak summer trough for the Petar Sweatshirt (soft sweatshirt fabric with brushed inside). Historical demand over the last four periods (P24-P27: 9, 23, 16, 48) shows a clear upward trend as we move towards autumn. The recent jump to 48 units suggests the seasonal transition is beginning. Current on-hand inventory is 100 units. There are 349 units in 'In-transit' that are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17), which are blocking the OR engine from ordering since it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this 'phantom' inventory while anticipating increasing late-August demand, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I estimate demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) will average approximately 45 units/period as school/autumn shopping begins, totaling 135 units. However, to trigger a small safety order and bridge the phantom gap, mu_hat must be set to slightly exceed the effective inventory level. I choose an explicit mu_hat of 550 (349 phantom + 100 on-hand + safety buffer) to ensure the OR engine maintains stock for the upcoming seasonal rise.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Mid-August (P27) saw demand jump to 48 units, signaling the end of the summer low (~10-15 units) and the start of the autumn build-up. Phantom inventory remains at 349 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late August (2019/08/26), transitioning out of the low-demand summer regime into the autumn build-up for the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT'. Historical data shows demand jumped from ~10-15 units to 48 and 35 in the last two periods. I estimate the new demand mean is around 45 units/period. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is reported as 450 units, but 349 of these are confirmed 'phantom' units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17) that are 10+ weeks overdue and essentially lost. Therefore, the effective active pipeline is 101 units (from P28), and on-hand is 65. The OR backend uses (Base Stock - Pipeline), so if I use 'default' or 'recent_N', the 450 units in the pipeline will block all ordering until the end of the game. To counteract the 349 phantom units, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target Base Stock for a 3-period coverage (L=2) at ~45 units/period is roughly 135-150 units. To get the OR engine to arrive at this value while it subtracts 450, I need an explicit mu_hat of approximately 500-600. However, with 65 on-hand and 101 genuine units arriving soon, we are currently sufficiently stocked for the immediate 3 weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Late August demand (P27-P28) averaged 41.5 units, up from the summer average of ~11 units. The 349 phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17) remain in the system's in-transit count, necessitating explicit mu_hat overrides to trigger future orders.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering September (Period 30), a key season for sweatshirts. Historical data from early 2019 showed demand spikes (Feb/Mar demand reached 97), and recent weeks (P27-P29) show recovery with demand averaging 35 units/period compared to the summer low of ~10. Total in-transit is 485 units, but 399 of these are confirmed phantom/lost units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17 totaling 349, plus the P18 order of 113 arrived, but the 'In-transit' calculation in the status seems to accumulate undelivered units). Specifically, P1(61)+P3(55)+P4(71)+P10(112)+P17(50) = 349 phantom units. These units block the OR from ordering because it perceives on-hand(43) + in-transit(485) = 528 units, which is far above any reasonable base stock for a 35 unit/week demand. To force an order for the autumn build-up (Lead time L=2, covering 3 periods), I will setting mu_hat explicitly high. Target inventory should be (3 periods * 60 units/period) = 180 actual units. To overcome 349 phantom units, I must set mu_hat to approximately 530. Sigma is set to reflect the higher volatility observed in peak seasons.

Carry-over insight: September demand recovery confirmed: demand is trending towards 40-60 units/period for the sweatshirt category. Phantom/lost inventory count remains 349 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-09-09. We are in the September demand recovery phase for sweatshirts. Demand in P30 spiked to 76 units, confirming a strong upward trend from the summer lows (~10-15 units) and surpassing the late August average (~40 units). The forecast for the upcoming (L+1) periods should reflect this growth; I estimate a mean demand of 60 units per period. Regarding inventory, the 'In-transit' figure of 386 units is heavily inflated by 349 phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17) which are confirmed lost. Only the orders from P29 (35 units) and P30 (2 units) are realistically expected to arrive. With 68 units on-hand and 37 valid units in-transit, we have 105 effective units. To trigger the OR engine to order despite the 349 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 650 (accounting for 3 periods of 60 demand \u2248 180, plus the 349 phantom offset, plus a safety buffer). Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for higher volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: September demand recovery intensified in P30 with 76 units sold, suggesting a new peak regime. Total phantom/lost inventory remains at 349 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The sweatshirt category (685813005) is in a strong autumn recovery phase, with demand in Period 30 and 31 reaching 76 and 60 units respectively. The current average demand for the September regime is approximately 68 units/period. The pipeline inventory is showing 582 units, but this is heavily inflated by 399 phantom/lost units (P1:61, P3:55, P4:71, P10:112, P17:50, P29:50 - P29 is now overdue given L=2). Excluding phantom units, the real active pipeline is approximately 183 units (P31: 196 + P30: 2 - recent arrivals). On-hand inventory is critically low at 8 units. To force the OR backend to order sufficiently despite the 'phantom' in-transit bloat, I must set an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus the 399 lost units. Target base stock = (3 periods * 68 avg) + 399 lost units = 204 + 399 = 603. I will use mu_hat=603 with explicit sigma to ensure the engine places an order to cover the burgeoning autumn demand.

Carry-over insight: September demand recovery confirmed: Peak regime demand established at ~68 units/period (P30-P31). Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline increased to 399 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29) as P29 is now 3 periods old with no arrival.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in the 'Autumn Peak' demand regime for sweatshirts. Recent demand (P30-P32) has been 76, 60, and 48 units, averaging 61.3 units per period. This represents a significant recovery from the summer low. The on-hand inventory is 158 units. The 'In-transit' figure is reported at 397 units, but the Carry-over Insights confirm that 399 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and now P29) are effectively lost or 'phantom' units that will not arrive. Because the backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, it will not place a new order unless mu_hat is set high enough to cover both current demand and these phantom units. To trigger an order that maintains a safety buffer for the 60+ unit demand regime, mu_hat must be set to approximately (61 * (L+1)) + 399. With L=2, mu_hat should be around 582. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 600 to ensure the backend recognizes the need for stock despite the inflated pipeline, and sigma_hat is adjusted to reflect the increased volatility of the peak season.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime confirmed at ~60 units/period (average 61.3 over P30-P32). Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline confirmed at 399 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29). These must be offset in mu_hat calculations to allow the OR engine to place orders.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The sweatshirt category is in a clear Autumn/Winter peak regime. Period 33 demand spiked to 138 units, significantly higher than the previous estimate (~60). Looking at the history, September (P30-P33) demand has been [76, 60, 48, 138], averaging 80.5 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is depleted to 20 units. Total in-transit is 442 units, but 399 of these are confirmed phantom/lost units (ordered in P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29). These lost units block the OR engine from placing necessary orders. To force an order that covers the current peak demand (avg 80 units/period) for the (L+1) horizon (3 periods), we need a mu_hat that overcomes the 399 lost units. Target base stock = 80 units * 3 periods = 240 units. To offset 399 phantoms, mu_hat must be set to 240 + 399 = 639. Sigma_hat is increased to 120 to provide a safety buffer against the high variance observed in P33.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: September peak demand confirmed with a significant spike to 138 units in P33. Average demand for the September regime is approximately 80 units/period. Phantom/lost inventory in pipeline remains at 399 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/07. We are in the peak autumn demand regime for sweatshirts. Demand in the last two periods was 138 and 102 units, averaging 120 units/period, significantly higher than the September average of 80. Inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' count is 619 units, but 399 of these (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 17, and 29) are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. Additionally, the order from Period 33 (45 units) is now at its promised lead time but hasn't arrived (though lead times fluctuate between 1-2 periods). To trigger an order that covers the 120-unit/period demand and offsets the 399 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to approximately (1+L) * (Demand + Phantom/3). Setting mu_hat to 720 (approx 3 periods of 120 + 360 to cover phantoms) to ensure the OR engine overcomes the pipeline bloat. L is set to 2 as the baseline arrival expectation.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand spike to ~120 units/period confirmed for early October. Total phantom inventory remains at 399 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29). These 399 units must be added to the base stock calculation via mu_hat to allow new orders.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The sweatshirt demand is in a high-growth seasonal peak as we enter mid-October. The last four periods of demand (76, 60, 48, 138, 102, 98) indicate an average of approximately 87 units/period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 35. The lead time has shown some instability, with the P32 order taking 3 periods to arrive. Total In-transit is reported at 707 units. However, based on history, 444 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P1:61, P3:55, P4:71, P10:112, P17:50, P29:35, P33:45, P34:X - Wait, P33 and P34 are too recent to be phantom yet, let's recalibrate). Phantom inventory confirmed up to P29 is 399 units. P33 (45 units) and P34 (177 units) are the only likely valid shipments in the pipeline besides P35 (101). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 707 'In-transit' from the base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover (L+1) demand PLUS the 399 phantom units to trigger an order. Target base stock = ((L+1) * 110) + 399 = (3 * 110) + 399 = 729. I use mu_hat explicit to force this level.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Peak autumn demand confirmed at ~100 units/period. Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline updated to 399 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29). These must be offset in base stock calculations as they will never arrive.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the October peak demand period for sweatshirts. Demand in the last four periods has been 138, 102, 98, and 73, averaging ~103 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 73 units. The 'In-transit' count is reported as 584 units, but a significant portion of this is 'phantom' inventory from lost orders. This includes orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and now P29 and P34 (which is at L=3 and hasn't arrived). Specifically, P1(61), P3(55), P4(71), P10(112), P17(50), P29(35), and P34(177) are highly suspect or confirmed lost, totaling 561 units. To allow the OR engine to place an order despite this 584-unit 'in-transit' blockage, mu_hat must be set to cover the expected demand (3 periods at ~100 units/period) PLUS the phantom inventory. Expected Base Stock needed = (100 * 3) + 561 = 861. Setting mu_hat to 830 and slightly increasing sigma_hat to account for high demand volatility in October will trigger the necessary replenishment. Lead time L=2 is maintained as the promised value, although actual arrivals vary between 1-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline increased to 561 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29, P34). P34 (177 units) is now 3 periods old with no arrival, joining the confirmed lost shipments. Peak autumn demand continues to average ~100 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The sweatshirt category is in a peak autumn demand regime, with demand consistently averaging ~100 units/period (P34-P37: 102, 98, 73, 106). The current 'In-transit' figure of 757 units is heavily inflated by lost/phantom shipments. Based on the history, units from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29, and now P34 (ordered 4 periods ago, no arrival) are considered lost. Calculated lost units: 61+55+71+112+50+35+177 = 561 units. Active pipeline units are only from P36 (23 units) and P37 (173 units), totaling 196 units. To ensure the OR engine places an order while facing a 0 on-hand balance and 757 phantom units in-transit, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) demand PLUS the phantom inventory. Expected base stock for 3 periods (L=2+1) at 100 units/period is 300. Adding the 561 phantom units gives a target mu_hat of ~861. Setting mu_hat to 900 to ensure a robust order to meet the ongoing peak demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline confirmed at 561 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29, P34). Demand remains in peak autumn regime (~100 units/period). Only orders from P36 onwards are considered active.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 39 (early November), deep in the peak autumn/winter demand season for sweatshirts. Demand over the last five periods has been consistently high: 138, 102, 98, 73, 106, 102 (mean ~103 units/period). The current on-hand inventory is 71 units. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 727 units, but most of this is phantom inventory from lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29, and P34 are confirmed lost (lead times > 3 periods without arrival). Total lost units: 61+55+71+112+50+35+177 = 561 units. Active pipeline inventory consists of the P36 order (23 units) and the P38 order (143 units), totaling 166 units. To prevent the OR engine from being blocked by the 561 phantom units, I must continue using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) at 100 units/period (300 total) and add the 561 phantom units to effectively 'neutralize' them in the base stock logic. Total mu_hat = 300 + 561 = 861. This ensures the OR logic sees a need for real units. Sigma is set based on recent variability in this high-demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40 (2019/11/11), we are in the peak autumn/winter demand regime for sweatshirts. Recent demand (P36-P39) averages ~93.5 units/period. The pipeline is heavily congested with phantom/lost inventory. As of P40 START, 'In-transit' is 767. This comprises: P1(61), P3(55), P4(71), P10(112), P17(50), P29(35), P34(177), P38(143), and P39(63). Based on history, orders before P38 that haven't arrived are effectively lost (561 phantom units). Only P38 (ordered 143) and P39 (ordered 63) are realistic arrivals (206 units). On-hand is nearly zero (1 unit). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 767 in-transit units, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the 561 phantom units. With L=2 and mean demand ~110 (anticipating mid-November/pre-holiday spikes), base demand for (L+1) is 330. Adding 561 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 891. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to handle current spike volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline confirmed at 561 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29, P34). These orders are all 6+ periods old or significantly past promised lead time. Peak season demand remains steady at ~95-110 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 18th, 2019. We are in the peak autumn/winter demand regime for sweatshirts. Over the last five periods (P36-P40), demand has averaged 89.6 units per period, while the last ten periods (P31-P40) averaged 90 units per period. I will use N=10 for mu_hat to capture this high-volume season. Regarding the 'In-transit' inventory: the system shows 890 units, but a significant portion is 'phantom' (lost) inventory. Confirmed lost units: P1(61), P3(55), P4(71), P10(112), P17(50), P29(35), P34(177). Total phantom units = 561. Active shipments are from P38(143), P39(63), and P40(123), totaling 329 viable units. To correct the OR engine's behavior, I must set mu_hat explicitly high enough to ignore the 561 phantom units. Target Base Stock = (1+L)*mu + safety_stock + phantom_units. With L=2 and mu~90, Base Stock core is ~270 + safety. Adding 561 phantom units requires a mu_hat of approx 831 + safety. I will set mu_hat to 950 to ensure an order is triggered despite the pipeline bloat, and sigma_hat to 100 to reflect recent volatility (range 73-138).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (late November), the SKU is in a peak autumn/winter demand regime with an average demand of approximately 95 units per period over the last 5 cycles (P37-P41). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' quantity reported is 887 units. However, based on lead-time analysis, 561 units are confirmed phantom/lost (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29, P34). Additionally, the order from P38 (143 units) is now 4 periods old (promised L=2) and significantly post-lead time compared to the recent P39 arrival (L=2); I am classifying P38 as likely lost, bringing the total phantom count to 704 units (561 + 143). The truly active pipeline consists of orders from P40 (123 units) and P41 (60 units), totaling 183 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order to cover the peak season demand (~95 units/period) while accounting for the 704 phantom units blocking the logic, I must set the explicit mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory. With L=2, base stock needs to be ~285 + 704 = 989. I will set mu_hat to 950 to trigger a substantial order that accounts for the current stockout and expected upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total phantom/lost inventory increased to 704 units. P38 (143 units) is now 4 periods past order date and considered lost alongside previous phantoms (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29, P34). Demand remains stable in the peak 90-100 units/period range.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering December, typically a peak period for sweatshirts. Period 42 showed a massive demand spike (299 units), likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is ~130 units, though the P42 spike suggests a higher potential. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 950 units, but 704 of these are confirmed 'phantom' units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29, P34, P38) that are lost shipments. Real active in-transit units are only 246 (P40: 123, P41: 60, P42: 63). To trigger an order from the OR backend which sees 950 units in transit, mu_hat must be set to cover the desired base stock PLUS the 704 phantom units. Base stock target is approximately 450 units (3 periods * 150 mean demand), meaning mu_hat needs to be ~1150 to overcome the pipeline bloat. As we are nearing the game end (P43 of 47), we must ensure enough stock for the final 4 weeks while minimizing terminal holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Total phantom/lost inventory increased to 704 units. Shipment from Period 38 (143 units) is confirmed lost. Demand spiked to 299 in P42, signaling extreme peak seasonality for December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday demand season for sweatshirts. Period 42 saw a massive spike to 299 units. While Period 43 settled to 75, we expect high volatility and elevated demand as we approach mid-December. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 971, but the Carry-over Insights confirm that orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29, P34, and P38 (totaling 704 units) are lost/phantom. The OR backend subtracts the full 971 units from the base stock, effectively assuming we have nearly 1000 units coming, which is false. Actual active pipeline inventory is 971 - 704 = 267 units (orders from P42 and P43). To force the OR backend to place an order that covers the 704-unit deficit and satisfies peak demand (estimated at ~150 units/period to handle potential spikes like P42), we set \u03bc\u0302 explicitly high. Target Base Stock = (Active Pipeline Target) + (Deficit) = [(L+1) * 150] + 704. With L=2, (3 * 150) + 704 = 1154. We use an explicit L of 2 as recent arrivals (P40, P41) show lead times of 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Confirmed phantom inventory remains at 704 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29, P34, P38). December demand volatility is extreme (P42: 299 units, P43: 75 units). Only orders from P42 onwards are reliable.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak mid-December demand period (Period 45). Demand volatility is high with a major spike in Period 42 (299 units) followed by a return to ~75-100 units. The mean demand for this December regime (P42-P44) is approximately 160 units/period. The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 1046 units, but 704 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29, P34, P38). These lost units have not arrived even after 6+ periods and must be offset to trigger necessary ordering. The OR engine calculates base_stock as \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302 and orders based on (base_stock - pipeline). To offset 704 phantom units, we must set mu_hat such that the base_stock calculation exceeds 1046 (pipeline) + desired safety stock. Based on a 3-week lead time (observed L often fluctuates between 1-3), a forecast of 160 units/period over (L+1)=4 periods requires ~640 units of stock. Adding the 704 phantom units, we need a base stock of ~1344. I will use 'explicit' values to force this correction and ensure enough stock arrives for the final weeks of the year.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed phantom inventory remains at 704 units. December demand volatility is high (avg 160 units over last 3 periods due to P42 spike). Only orders from P42 onwards (63, 204, 75) are considered active.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-27.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak December sweatshirt season (Date: 2019/12/23). Demand in Period 45 was 121 units, and the 3-period average is approx 100 units/period. The total 'In-transit' quantity reported is 1075 units. However, based on history, 704 of these units are confirmed 'phantom/lost' shipments (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29, P34, P38). These will never arrive but the OR engine counts them as pipeline inventory. Additionally, the order from P44 (75 units) is still in the standard lead time window. Current real world status: On-hand (148) + Active In-transit (P44: 75 + P45: 296) = 519 units. The backend sees 148 + 1075 = 1223 units. To force the backend to maintain a base stock that covers the peak demand (approx 100 units/period) across the lead time (L=2, so 3 periods total) while disregarding the 704 phantom units, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (Demand * (L+1)) + Phantoms. With Demand ~ 110 (to be safe for Christmas/Post-Xmas sales) and L=2, base stock should be ~330. Adding the 704 phantom offset, mu_hat is set to 1034 to ensure the OR engine maintains sufficient stock. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to handle the high holiday volatility (e.g., P42 spike).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter Period 47 (end of December), the demand regime remains high but volatile. The last 4 periods show demand of 75, 106, 121, and 74 (average ~94 units/period), transitioning away from the extreme Period 42 spike. A critical operational issue persists: total in-transit inventory is 1075 units, but 704 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' stock (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P29, P34, P38) that have not arrived and are significantly past lead time. These units artificially bloat the OR engine's pipeline view. The remaining active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (75 units) and P45 (296 units). Currently, there are 74 units on-hand. To ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock of approximately 3 periods of peak demand (approx 300 units) while accounting for the 704 phantom units, mu_hat is set explicitly to offset the phantom inventory. Lead time L is set to 2 to reflect the recent average arrival pattern (2-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Lead time for the peak season (Oct-Dec) has stabilized at 2-3 periods. Total phantom inventory in the pipeline remains confirmed at 704 units. Orders from P44 (75 units) and P45 (296 units) are currently active and expected within 1-2 periods.
