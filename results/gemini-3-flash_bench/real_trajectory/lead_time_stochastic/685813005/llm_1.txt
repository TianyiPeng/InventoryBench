Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 46.8 (50, 38, 43, 60, 43), with some volatility but generally stable demand for basic apparel. Since this is Period 1, there are 0 units on hand and 0 in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive in Period 3 (P1+L=3) and be reflected in the P4 decision. I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods) before the next possible shipment arrives. Given the stable historical mean of ~47 and the seasonal nature of sweatshirts in early spring, I will forecast ~47 units per period. Target inventory for 3 periods (P1 demand + P2 demand + P3 demand) = 47 * 3 = 141 units. To account for some demand variance, I will order 150 units to establish initial pipeline and stock.",

According to the lead time of 2 periods, this shipment is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current inventory is 0 because the first order is in transit, resulting in lost sales in Period 1. Since lead time is 2, I must look ahead to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 periods). Total expected demand for those 3 periods is approximately 150 units (50/period). I already have 150 units in transit arriving for Period 3. To ensure I have stock for Period 4 and beyond, and to build a small buffer given the 100% stockout in Period 1, I will order another 100 units now.

Historical demand in Jan/early Feb averaged 46.8 units (50, 38, 43, 60, 43). However, the last two recorded periods (P1: 51, P2: 97) show a significant surge, particularly P2's demand of 97. This spike suggests either a promotion, a seasonal peak, or a shift in trend. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed: P1 (150 units), P2 (100 units). I am currently at the start of P3. According to the timeline: Order P1 (placed P1) is scheduled to arrive during P3's arrival resolution (L=2: P1+2=P3). It will not be visible until P4's start. Order P2 is scheduled for P4. Currently, on-hand is 0, and I have had 148 units of lost sales due to stockouts in P1 and P2. Total pipeline (in-transit) is 250. Expected demand for P3-P5 (the time it takes for a new order to arrive) is likely high given P2's jump. Estimated demand: P3 (approx 90-100), P4 (approx 90-100), P5 (approx 90-100). Total lead-time demand (P3+P4+P5) is ~300. Current pipeline is 250. I will order 150 units to cover the gap, account for uncertainty in the demand spike, and rebuild safety stock.",

However, current game data (P1-P3) shows a significant demand increase: 51, 97, and 58 (Avg ~69). This suggests a transition into spring demand or a higher baseline than the pre-game samples. Lead time is promised at 2 periods. Orders were placed in P1 (150 units), P2 (100 units), and P3 (150 units). According to the lead time definition: P1 order (L=2) should arrive during P3's arrival resolution and be visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4).

  "rationale": "Product 685813005 is a sweatshirt, typically relevant for late winter and early spring. Current date is 2019/3/11. Demand history shows a shift from a pre-game average of 47 to a game average of 62.5 (51, 97, 58, 44). The last period demand (44) reverted towards the historical mean, suggesting the earlier spike to 97 was likely an outlier rather than a sustained 50% increase. Lead time analysis: Period 4 conclude shows an arrival of 100 units from the P2 order with a 2-period lead time. However, the order placed in P1 (150 units) has NOT arrived by P4 conclude. Since the P2 order arrived on time (L=2) but the P1 order is missing (now 4 periods since order), I must conclude the P1 order (150 units) is likely lost. Current pipeline assessment: On-hand = 56. In-transit = 250 (P3: 150, P4: 100). The P1 order of 150 is treated as lost. Expected demand for lead time (L=2) + current period is (2+1) * 60 = 180 units. Current inventory + reliable in-transit (P3+P4) = 56 + 250 = 306. This covers the expected demand for the next 3-4 weeks.

Historical demand from the initial samples (avg 47) and game history (avg ~51, excluding the outlier 97 in P2) suggests a demand regime between 40-55 units. Recent demand was 50 units, causing a stockout because no arrivals occurred in Period 7. Looking at lead times: P2 arrived in 2 periods, P5 arrived in 1 period, and P1 was lost. In-transit inventory is 450 units: P3 (150 ordered P3, expected P5-P6, likely lost); P4 (100 ordered P4); P6 (50 ordered P6). Currently, we have 450 units in transit, but P3 (150) and P4 (100) are likely lost as they are significantly past the promised L=2 and even L=3 windows.

The demand regime has transitioned from a high of 40-50 units in early spring to a lower average of approximately 25-30 units over the last four periods (18, 22, 41, 30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 89 units. In-transit inventory is listed as 450 units; however, historical analysis in the Carry-Over Insights confirms that shipments from Period 1 (150 units), Period 3 (150 units), and Period 4 (100 units) are definitively lost. This leaves a 'real' in-transit balance of 50 units from the Period 10 order. The total effective inventory (On-hand 89 + Real In-transit 50) is 139 units. Given the declining seasonal demand and a Profit-to-Holding ratio of 1:1, holding excess stock is extremely risky. 139 units cover approximately 4-5 periods of demand at current rates.

  "rationale": "The product is a Petar Sweatshirt, currently in its peak winter demand regime (late November). Historical demand over the last 5 periods has averaged 86 units (86, 74, 93, 102, 106). With only 6 periods remaining in the game (ending Period 47), inventory management must balance avoiding stockouts during the peak while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Inventory Assessment: Current on-hand is 14. Nominal in-transit is 1120, but 940 of these are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P18, P26, P29, P34). The reliable pipeline consists of: P38 (120 units, 4 periods old - likely lost given P39 arrived in 2 periods), P40 (120 units, 2 periods old), and P41 (110 units, 1 period old). If P38 is lost, the actual reliable pipeline is 230 units (P40, P41). Expected demand for the lead time (L=2) plus current period is approximately 3 periods * 90 units = 270 units. With 14 on hand and 230 potentially arriving shortly, I need to place an order to cover the remaining periods. I will order 120 units to ensure coverage for the immediate demand surge and the coming weeks leading to the game's end, accounting for the high probability that P38 is lost.",

The date is Dec 2nd (Period 43), following a massive demand spike of 299 units in Period 42 (Black Friday week/late November). This peak suggests that while demand may stay elevated for early December holiday shopping, the absolute peak has likely passed. I expect a high but tapering demand regime of approximately 100-150 units for the next few periods. Regarding pipeline: P38 (120 units) is confirmed lost as P39 has already arrived. The 'In-transit' of 1240 contains 1060 confirmed lost units (P1, 3, 4, 10, 17, 18, 26, 29, 34, 38). The functional pipeline consists of P40 (120), P41 (110), and P42 (120), totaling 350 units. With 0 on-hand inventory and a lead time of roughly 1-3 periods, I need to order enough to cover the remaining game periods (43, 44, 45, 46, 47) considering the lag. Since the game is ending in 5 periods, and 350 units are currently in the reliable pipeline against an estimated total remaining demand of ~500-600 units, a substantial order is needed to capture the final December sales while remaining cautious of the holding cost charge at the end.",

Market context (December 9th) suggests we are past the Black Friday peak (P42, demand=299) and entering the sustained high-demand period leading up to Christmas and the colder winter months. Recent demand (P43=75) shows a return to the winter baseline of approximately 75-100 units after the seasonal peak. Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with some orders lost. Total nominal 'In-transit' is 1210, but historical investigation shows 1060 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P18, P26, P29, P34, P38). The reliable pipeline consists of P42 (120 units) and P43 (200 units). With 155 on-hand and 320 reliably in-transit, we have 475 units to cover the remaining 4 periods (P44-P47). Expected demand for these 4 periods is approximately 300-400 units (avg ~85/week). To ensure no stockouts during the Christmas peak while avoiding excessive holding costs as the game concludes, a modest order of 50 units is placed to maintain a safety buffer against lead-time variability or a late-season demand spike.",

On-hand inventory is 49 units. Nominal 'In-transit' is 1260 units, but 1060 units are confirmed lost based on historical analysis (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P18, P26, P29, P34, P38). The functional pipeline consists of orders from P42 (120 units), P43 (200 units), and P44 (50 units). Given lead times often range from 1 to 3 periods, the P42 and P43 orders (320 units) are expected to arrive in Period 45 or 46. With demand expected to stay around 100 units/week through the end of December, the available and incoming stock (49 + 320 + 50 = 419) comfortably covers the forecasted 300 units remaining in the game. Ordering more at this late stage risks high holding costs as the simulation ends in P47. Therefore, I will place a minimal order of 0 to optimize ending inventory and avoid holding costs.",

Since the game ends after Period 47, any order placed now (Period 46) with a lead time of 1-3 periods is unlikely to arrive in time to be sold, or would only arrive for the very last period, risking high holding costs on leftover stock. My current on-hand inventory is 248 units. Given the recent demand trend of ~100-120 units per week, 248 units should comfortably cover the demand for the remaining two periods (P46 and P47) without additional ordering.

However, since this is the final decision period (L=2 means orders placed now arrive in the future, but the game timeline ends), and the existing inventory (174 units) is significantly higher than the expected demand for the final week of December/early January (recent non-peak weeks have been around 74-121 units), there is no need to order more units.
