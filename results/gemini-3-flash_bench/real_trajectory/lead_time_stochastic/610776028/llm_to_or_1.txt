Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 610776028 is a 'Tilly' women's basic jersey T-shirt. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend from 0 to 27 units over the last 5 weeks, suggesting a seasonal build-up or new product launch phase. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The mean of all historical samples is 10.4, but the most recent sample is 27. Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 will better capture the current upward momentum (average of 8, 17, 27 is 17.33) compared to a simple global mean. Promised lead time is 2, so the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand regime while maintaining the default promised lead time until actual arrivals provide evidence for manual adjustment.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand was zero until late January, after which it spiked: 8, 17, 27, and finally 77 in Period 1. This suggests a clear upward trend/regime shift as we move into spring. The promised lead time is 2. The order for 33 units placed in Period 1 is in-transit and should arrive in Period 3 (P1 + 2 = P3). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 33 in-transit, but we just saw a demand of 77, indicating we are significantly under-stocked. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the recent high demand (17, 27, 77) which averages ~40 per period. Given L=2, mu_hat needs to cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. 40 * 3 = 120. Using recent_N with N=3 will allow the OR backend to calculate (1+L) * mean(17, 27, 77).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-01-21: demand grew from 0 to 77 units over 5 weeks, indicating a seasonal ramp-up for basic T-shirts.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776028 (Women's Everyday Basic T-shirt) is experiencing a rapid seasonal demand ramp-up. Demand has accelerated from 8 to 143 units over the last 5 samples. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and the last two orders (33 and 94 units) are in-transit with a promised lead time of 2. The order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 (this period), and the Period 2 order in Period 4. Given the explosive growth (77 to 143 in one week), 'default' or 'recent_N' methods using simple averages will severely under-order. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to forecast for (L+1) = 3 periods, anticipating demand to continue growing towards a peak. I project average weekly demand of ~180 units for the next few weeks, so mu_hat = 3 * 180 = 540. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 60 to reflect increased volatility during this ramp-up phase. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (2) as we have not yet observed any 'conclude' messages to suggest a lead-time shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: accelerated from 77 (2019-02-11) to 143 (2019-02-18), a ~85% WoW increase, confirming strong seasonal momentum for basics.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which is showing a classic seasonal ramp-up in early spring. Demand history shows a steady increase: 0, 0, 8, 17, 27 (pre-game) followed by 77, 143, and 176 in Periods 1-3. Currently, there is an stockout with 0 on-hand and 364 units in-transit. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (33 units) and P2 (94 units) are expected to arrive in P3 (visible in P4 start) and P4 (visible in P5 start) respectively. Note: The P1 order of 33 units did not appear as 'arrived' in the P3 conclude message. Since it was ordered in P1 with L=2, it should arrive during P3 and be reported in the P3 conclude message read at P4 start. The lack of arrival suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. I will adjust L to 3 to account for this delay to ensure the OR backend increases the pipeline buffer. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~132), as the initial zeros are no longer relevant.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time appears to be at least 3 periods, exceeding the promised 2 (P1 order did not arrive by P3 conclude).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-11 (Period 5). The product is a Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt. We are currently in a high-growth seasonal ramp-up. Historical demand has increased significantly: 0 -> 8 -> 17 -> 27 (pre-game) and 77 -> 143 -> 176 -> 143 (in-game). Although Period 4 saw a slight dip to 143, the overall trend remains strong for spring basics. On inventory: We received 94 units in Period 4 (ordered in Period 2), confirming the promised lead time of 2 periods (Period 4 - Period 2 = 2). This corrects the previous suspicion in Period 4 that lead time was longer. However, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory because demand is outstripping supply. Total in-transit is 485 (orders from P1, P3, P4). Since P1 order (33 units) did not arrive in P3 or P4, it is now overdue (lead time 4+) or lost; I will treat it as potentially lost and ensure my base stock calculation covers the next 3 weeks (L+1) of demand. I'll use recent_N=3 for demand (mean ~154) and set L to its promised value of 2.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4). Period 1 order (33 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since order) and likely lost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a Women's Everyday Basic T-shirt. Current stock is 0 on-hand with 490 in-transit. History analysis: 1) The Period 1 order (33 units) is now 5 periods old and definitively lost. 2) The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2). 3) The Period 3 order (237 units) was placed on 2019-02-25 with L=2, so it should have arrived in Period 5 (visible in Period 6 start). However, Period 5 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This signifies the Period 3 order is delayed. Period 4 (215 units) and Period 5 (5 units) orders are still within the lead time window. 4) Demand has stabilized after the initial ramp-up, with the last three observations being 176, 143, and 129 (average ~149). Setting L=2 (promised) as the delay might be a transient spike, but \u03bc\u0302 needs to reflect the current steady demand level (approx 150/week). Since we have 457 units in active pipeline (237+215+5), the OR backend will calculate the order based on this pipeline inventory. I will use recent_N=3 for demand to capture the post-ramp plateau.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 3 order (237 units) is delayed (expected P5, not arrived); Pipeline inventory monitoring is critical as on-hand is currently 0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has stabilized in the 130-180 range over the last four periods (176, 143, 129, 138). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 485 units in-transit. A critical supply issue exists: The Period 1 order (33 units) is definitely lost. The Period 3 order (237 units) is overdue (ordered P3, promised lead time 2, should have arrived by P5 conclude, still missing at P6 conclude). However, weirdly, the Period 5 order arrived in only 1 period (P6 conclude). Given the inconsistency, I will set L to 2 (promised). For demand (mu_hat), the recent 4-period mean is ~146.5. Since base_stock = (1+L)*demand_per_period, and we need to cover the current period plus the lead time (total 3 periods), mu_hat should be around 440. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this stable regime. If the overdue Period 3 order (237 units) arrives this period, it plus the Period 4 order (215 units) will total 452 units, which perfectly aligns with the required base stock. Therefore, the OR backend should naturally order near zero or very little to avoid overstocking while we wait for these large pipelines to clear.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain inconsistency: Lead times are volatile (P2=2 periods, P5=1 period, P1=lost, P3=overdue/delayed 3+ periods). Demand has stabilized at roughly 145 units/period after the initial February ramp-up.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 610776028 (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) shows significant stockout issues due to supply chain instability. Current on-hand is 0. History shows a massive order loss for P1 (33 units) and a critical delay for P3 (237 units). Demand has stabilized since late February, though P7 saw a spike to 200. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is 152.5. Total pipeline inventory is 485 units (P3: 237, P4: 215, P5-7: 33 total). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base stock, and P3's 237 units are likely stuck or severely delayed (but still in pipeline), I need to set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom pipeline, or account for the fact that promised lead time is 2, but actual reliability is low. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for demand to capture the current stable-but-high regime (~153 units/period). Lead time is volatile (1 to 2 periods, with losses), so I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to account for the recent variance spike in P7.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), the SKU 610776028 (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) remains in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with significant pipeline disruption. Demand has reached a high-volume steady state, averaging 162 units over the last 5 periods (P4-P8). Supply chain performance is highly erratic: P1 order (33) and P3 order (237) are both severely overdue and presumed lost. P2 had a 2-period lead time, P5 had a 1-period lead time, and the P4 order (215) is now overdue by 2 periods beyond its promised arrival date. The current 'In-transit' of 505 units likely reflects these ghost shipments (P1=33, P3=237, P4=215, P8=20). To prevent over-ordering due to these dead 'in-transit' units, and to account for the actual demand level, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to assume a slower arrival for future successful orders. mu_hat is set to 648 (162 units/week * (L+1)) using the average of the last 5 demand samples. sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to provide a buffer for the observed demand volatility (129 to 200).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Period 1 (33 units), Period 3 (237 units), and Period 4 (215 units) orders are missing/lost after 4+ weeks of delay. Demand stabilized at ~162 units/period (avg P4-P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the inventory situation is critical with 0 units on-hand. Historical demand analysis shows that after an initial ramp-up, demand has stabilized at a higher level, averaging 189 units over the last 3 periods (P7-P9). The supply chain is highly unreliable: orders from Period 1 (33), Period 3 (237), and Period 4 (215) must be treated as lost given they are 6-9 periods past their ordering date. Only orders from P8 (20), P9 (206), and the current pipeline (711 units total in-transit) are likely to arrive. To recover, I am setting L to 2 (promised) to trigger the OR logic, but using an explicit 'mu_hat' based on the stabilized demand average (~190 units/period) multiplied by (1+L) to ensure the system targets a base stock that covers the 3-period cycle (current period + lead time). Sigma is set explicitly to 30 following recent variance (~185-200 range). This aggressive target is necessary to overcome the 0 on-hand position and the high amount of declared 'lost' inventory in the pipeline history.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: average demand for P7-P9 is 193 units, up from the P4-P8 average of 162. Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost (4+ periods overdue).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/4/22), we see that demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has shifted after the initial seasonal ramp-up. Demand for the last three periods was 194, 184, and 130 (average 169), exhibiting some volatility but stabilizing below the P7 peak of 200. I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the demand regime since mid-March (P5-P10). Supply chain issues are prominent: orders from P1 (33), P3 (237), and P4 (215) are definitely lost (4-9 weeks overdue). The OR backend calculates pipeline inventory as on-hand + in-transit. Currently, on-hand is 96 and in-transit is 485. However, the in-transit field likely still includes those lost orders (33+237+215=485), meaning the *actual* functional pipeline is 0 units. To ensure the OR engine logic (base_stock - pipeline) triggers a necessary order to cover future demand, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for both the expected demand over (L+1) periods AND the replacement of the lost 485 units. With L=2 (promised and most common actual), we need to cover 3 periods of demand (~510 units) plus recover the 485 lost units, totaling ~995. I set L to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Actual Pipeline Correction: 485 units in-transit (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/missing; mu_hat parameter must be adjusted upward to force replacement, as the OR engine does not automatically discount stalled pipeline units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-04-29. Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt has stabilized between 130-200 units. Recent demand (P10-P11) averaged 133.5, showing a slight cooling from the late March peak of 200. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 872, but analysis of history confirms a massive pipeline write-off: P1 (33), P3 (237), and P4 (215) orders ARE MISSING (485 units total, all 7+ periods overdue). The OR engine subtracts the full 872 units from the base stock calculation, preventing new orders. To force the engine to replace these 485 lost units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. Expected demand for lead time (L=2) + current period is 3 periods of ~140 units = 420. Adding the 485 lost units to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of 905. This compensates for the 'ghost' pipeline and ensures a replacement order is triggered to meet actual demand. Lead time remains approximately 1-2 periods based on P8 and P9 arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation: 485 units (P1, P3, P4) remain in-transit but are confirmed lost. Total in-transit (872) includes these ghost units; mu_hat must be boosted by ~485 to maintain replenishment.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/5/6), the SKU remains in an out-of-stock state with 0 on-hand units. Demand has softened significantly in the last two periods (137 and 72), down from the previous stabilization level of ~193. The critical issue remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 485 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but are still counted by the OR backend as 'In-transit' (part of the 954 units). Because the OR logic uses `final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)`, these 485 ghost units prevent necessary replenishment. To force the backend to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat (which determines base_stock) to offset the 485 dead units. I'll use a recent demand average for Periods 11-12 (~105 units/period) multiplied by (1+L=3), totaling 315, then add 485 to reach an explicit mu_hat of 800. This ensures the backend sees a need for stock despite the inflated pipeline count. I maintain L at the promised 2 as recent successful arrivals (P8, P9) showed lead times of 2 and 1.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed: P11-12 average dropped to ~105 units from the previous ~193 average, possibly signaling a shift away from the early spring peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-157.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 341 units. Pipeline inventory is 567 units, but 485 of these units (orders from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost/missing based on high lead-time drift and historical analysis. Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline is only 82 units (from Period 12). Demand has significantly decelerated over the last three weeks (P11-P13), moving from an average of ~193 units to approximately 85 units (137, 72, 46). This likely signals a post-spring peak slowdown for this basic item. To account for this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this lower demand regime. To compensate for the 485 'ghost units' in the OR engine's pipeline calculation, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Predicted Demand (L=2) for 3 periods = 3 * ~85 = 255. Adding total lost units (485) to the required base stock gives an explicit mu_hat of 740. This ensures the engine orders enough to replace the lost items while recognizing the lower current demand rate. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect the current volatility in the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed: P11-P13 average demand is 85 units, a ~56% decrease from the previous P7-P10 peak average of 193. 485 units remain in-transit but are confirmed lost, requiring manual mu_hat inflation for replenishment.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts has clearly decelerated as we move past the early spring peak; demand has dropped from a peak of ~193 units (P7-P9) to an average of ~51 units over the last three periods (P12-P14). On-hand inventory is healthy at 388 units. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 485 units consists entirely of 'ghost' inventory from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are long overdue (9-13 periods) and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts all pipeline inventory from the base stock target, these 485 units will prevent any new orders from being placed even if demand rises again. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, using a value that accounts for the current demand regime (mean of ~55) across the (L+1) period of 3, plus an offset of 485 to neutralize the lost units: (55 * 3) + 485 = 650. L is set to calculated (average of observed successful deliveries). sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand significantly slowed in May; P12-P14 average is 51 units/period vs P7-P10 peak of 193 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16 (2019/05/27), the demand for women's everyday basic T-shirts has confirmed a significant slowdown following the spring peak. The average demand over the last four periods (P12-P15) is approximately 50.5 units, a sharp drop from the earlier regime of ~193 units. Inventory levels are currently healthy with 339 units on-hand, which covers over 6 periods of current demand. Regarding the supply chain, the 485 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4 orders), as they are now over 10 periods overdue. However, because on-hand inventory is high and demand has dropped, there is no immediate need to manually inflate mu_hat to trigger replacement orders. We will transition from 'explicit' inflation back to 'recent_N' to allow the OR backend to stabilize based on the new, lower demand regime. I am setting N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent deceleration while ignoring the earlier peak volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~51 units/period in May (P12-P15), confirming the end of the spring seasonal peak for basics.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a stable, post-peak regime. Over the last four periods (P13-P16), the average demand is (46+35+49+62)/4 = 48 units. The earlier peak (P7-P11) averaged nearly 170 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 277 units, which covers over 5 periods of demand at the new lower rate. The pipeline inventory (485 units) consists entirely of lost orders from periods 1, 3, and 4 (33 + 237 + 215 = 485). Because these units are flagged as 'In-transit' but will never arrive, they suppress the OR engine's replenishment logic (base_stock - pipeline). Since on-hand inventory is significantly above the required base stock for a lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage \u2248 150 units), no new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 4-period window to reflect the lower demand regime and allow the excess inventory to bleed down.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 40 units. Recent demand shows a massive spike in Period 17 (237 units), contrasting sharply with the May average of ~51 units. This suggests a new demand regime or a significant seasonal event (possibly early summer sales or specific promotions for 'Womens Everyday Basics'). The pipeline inventory of 485 units consists entirely of orders from P1, P3, and P4 that are long-confirmed as lost/ghost units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (485) from the base stock calculation, it will refuse to order unless the base stock exceeds 485 + on-hand (40) = 525. To force a replacement order and account for the new demand volatility, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I estimate the 'true' required pipeline coverage for the next 3 periods (L+1) based on the recent spike and the carry-over lost units. I set mu_hat to 660 (calculated as roughly 175 units/period average over 3 periods + 485 lost units) to bypass the pipeline calculation and trigger replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected on 2019-06-03 (P17): demand rose to 237 units from a May average of ~51 units, signaling a transition from the 'Everyday Basics' spring baseline to a summer surge or promotional event.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand following a significant demand surge in Period 17 (237 units) and Period 18 (282 units). This surge aligns with early June, likely a summer seasonal peak for lightweight jersey t-shirts. My primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Periods 1, 3, and 4 (33+237+215 = 485 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost. The current in-transit figure of 721 includes these 485 lost units. Therefore, the 'real' pipeline is only 236 units (ordered Period 18). To force the OR backend to order despite these ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock for the summer peak (approx 260 units/period) across L+1=3 periods is ~780 units. To bypass the 485 lost units in the logic (base_stock - pipeline), I set mu_hat to 1265 (780 target + 485 lost). This ensures the backend ignores the missing units and places an order to satisfy the current summer demand. L is set to calculate to take advantage of the recent 1-2 period lead times.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal peak confirmed: Demand spiked from May average of ~51 to June average of ~260 (+410%). Pipeline reconciliation continues: 485 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and must be manually offset in mu_hat calculations.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a summer seasonal peak for the 'Everyday Basics' Jersey T-shirt, with demand in June (P17-P19) averaging 239 units/period, compared to the May average of ~51 units. Period 19 demand was 197 units. Although the OR engine sees 1050 units in-transit, 485 of those (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost legacy shipments that will never arrive. To ensure the backend places orders that cover actual demand, I must manually offset these 'ghost' units. The expected base stock for a 3-period window (L+1) at current demand (~239) is approximately 717 units. Adding the 485 lost units to this target, I set mu_hat to 1200 (explicit) to force the solver to order despite the inflated pipeline inventory. I am using L=calculate to let the engine use the average observed lead time (which fluctuates between 1 and 2), and a recent_N sigma_hat (N=3) to focus on the volatility within the current June surge.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019-07-01), the SKU is in a high-demand summer peak. Recent demand (P17-P20) has averaged approximately 219 units per period (237, 282, 197, 161), a massive increase from the May average of ~51. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 1223 units, but this includes 485 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost. To trigger necessary replenishment, I must inflate mu_hat to account for these 'ghost units' that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the summer demand (~219 units/period) and add 485 units to effectively 'write off' the lost inventory. Calculation: (1+L)*219 + 485 = 3*219 + 485 = 657 + 485 = 1142. For volatility, recent_N (N=4) is used to reflect the high variance observed during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime confirmed (P17-P20): average demand is ~219 units/period. Replacement orders for the 485 units lost in Q1 are still being processed via manual mu_hat inflation.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (July 8), we are in the heart of the summer season for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Historical demand for the last four concluded periods (P18-P21) shows a summer peak average of 189 units/period (282, 197, 161, 116), though demand is beginning to taper from the June highs (avg ~240). Supply chain reconciliation remains the primary challenge: 485 units from Q1 (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, while the current total in-transit of 1223 units includes these 'ghost' units. To ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset for these missing units. Using an average demand of 185 units and L=2, the required pipeline is 555 units. Currently, the 'live' pipeline (total in-transit 1223 - lost 485) is 738 units. Since the live pipeline (738) exceeds the summer demand target (555), no new order is strictly necessary for current demand levels. However, I will set mu_hat explicitly to sustain this logic and ensure the OR engine doesn't over-order against inflated ghost inventory, using 185 as the per-period mean.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15. We are in the middle of a summer seasonal peak for womens basics. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (P17-P22) averages 184 units/period, showing significant volatility (range 111-282), matching a high-volume summer regime. Supply chain reconciliation: 485 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/missing from Q1. Also, the P19 order of 565 units is now at L=3 (expected P21-conclude, now P23-start) and is overdue. If P19 is not lost, the pipeline is 1050; if it is lost, valid pipeline is only 485. Because the OR backend cannot differentiate 'ghost' inventory from real in-transit stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure replacement for lost units. I set mu_hat based on (1+L) * mean_demand + 485 (lost Q1 units) + 565 (potentially lost P19 units). Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+2)*184 + 1050 = 1602. This ensures the base_stock calculation triggers an order if the backend perceives the 1050 in-transit as real, despite them being stagnant.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure exacerbated: Period 19 order (565 units) is now 1 period overdue (ordered P19, expected P21, not arrived by P22 conclude), adding to the 485 units lost in Q1. Total 'ghost' pipeline units equals 1050.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the SKU '610776028' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is facing a critical supply chain failure. The current in-transit inventory is 1640 units, but 1050 of these are 'ghost' units that are highly likely lost: 33 (P1), 237 (P3), 215 (P4), and now 565 (P19 - ordered P19, expected P21, still missing by P23 conclude). Demand has transitioned from a summer peak (~219 units/period in June) to a slightly lower July level (~110 units/period for P21-P23). Since the OR engine's base-stock calculation includes the full pipeline (1640 units), it will see the 1050 lost units as available and fail to place new orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated. I set L to 2 (promised). Demand mu_hat is calculated as ((1+L) * Mean Demand) + Lost Units. Using recent_N=3 for demand (~110 units), mu_hat = (3 * 110) + 1050 = 1380. This forces the engine to recognize the need for replenishment despite the bloated 'ghost' pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed as of Period 23: Total lost 'ghost' units in-transit increased to 1050 (P1: 33, P3: 237, P4: 215, P19: 565). Demand regime shifted from June peak (~219) to July stabilization (~110).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019-07-29), demand has stabilized at a lower regime following the June summer peak; the average demand over the last 4 periods (P21-P24) is 108.75 units. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: 1,050 units are confirmed 'ghost' pipeline inventory that will likely never arrive (P1=33, P3=237, P4=215, P19=565). Combined with the 590 units ordered in Period 23 (expected P25-P26), the current 'In-transit' figure of 1,640 units is severely inflated. To trigger replenishment despite this ghost inventory, mu_hat must be adjusted to account for lead time + review period demand (3 periods) PLUS the volume of lost shipments. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1,376 units, which represents 3 periods of stabilized demand (108.75 * 3 = 326) plus the 1,050 units of lost pipeline. This forces the OR engine to order enough to replace the missing stock while maintaining enough safety for current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Stabilized demand regime confirmed for July (P21-P24) at avg 109 units/period. Total confirmed lost 'ghost' units in-transit: 1,050 (P1: 33, P3: 237, P4: 215, P19: 565).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5, 2019), the demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has transitioned from the June summer peak (~219 units/period) to a stabilized late-summer regime. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is approximately 102 units/period. The supply chain remains highly unreliable; we have 1,640 units currently 'in-transit', of which 1,050 units are confirmed lost 'ghost' units (P1: 33, P3: 237, P4: 215, P19: 565). Because the OR backend treats all in-transit units as valid, these 1,050 units prevent the system from placing new orders. I must continue to manually inflate mu_hat to offset these lost units. I will set mu_hat based on the current demand (102 units/period) across the lead time plus review period (1+2=3 periods), plus the 1,050 missing units, totaling ~1,356. Sigma_hat is set based on recent demand volatility to ensure a buffer against replenishment delays.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand stability confirmed (P21-P25) at ~102 units/period. Total 'ghost' in-transit inventory remains at 1,050 units, requiring persistent mu_hat inflation for replenishment.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019-08-12), the SKU 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt is in a late-summer stabilization phase. Demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) has averaged 98 units, reflecting a clear step down from the June peak of ~219 units. The supply chain remains highly problematic: 1,050 units are currently recorded as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost (P1: 33, P3: 237, P4: 215, P19: 565). The OR engine's capped base-stock policy subtracts all in-transit units from the target inventory; therefore, to prevent a complete stockout when on-hand inventory (514) is depleted, I must inflate mu_hat by the total number of ghost units (1,050). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual volatile lead times (last arrival was 3 periods). mu_hat is set to the recent demand average (approx 100 units/period) multiplied by (1+L), then added to the 1,050 units of lost pipeline inventory. sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=6 to capture current stability.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand stability confirmed (P21-P26) at ~98 units/period. Supply chain integrity continues to fail: Period 19 order (565 units) is now confirmed lost along with Q1 orders, bringing total 'ghost' in-transit inventory to 1,050 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (2019-08-19), the demand regime has remained stable throughout July and August (P21-P27), with an average demand of approximately 97 units per period. The supply chain remains severely compromised: 1,050 units are currently recorded as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost (P1: 33, P3: 237, P4: 215, P19: 565). Since the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity from the target base stock, these 'ghost' units prevent any new orders from being triggered unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset them. Currently, on-hand inventory is 422 units, which provides roughly four periods of cover at current demand levels. However, to ensure replenishment resumes once on-hand levels drop, I will maintain an explicit mu_hat that covers the current demand forecast for the lead-time window (L+1) plus the total volume of lost units (1,050). The current demand (avg P21-P27) is ~97. For a promised lead time of 2, (1+L)*demand = 3 * 97 = 291. Adding the 1,050 ghost units gives a target mu_hat of ~1,341. Sigma_hat is set using a recent_N of 7 to reflect the lower volatility of the current stable regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period 2019/7/1 to present (P21 onwards) has stabilized into a late-summer regime averaging approximately 92 units/period (P21-P28 average). The current on-hand inventory is 317 units. Regarding the supply chain, total in-transit quantity is 1050 units, but these are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost orders in Q1 (P1, P3, P4) and a significant loss in P19 (all more than 5 periods overdue). Because the OR engine calculates orders using (base_stock - pipeline), these 1050 ghost units prevent the engine from placing new orders. I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to offset these lost units. Target base stock to cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at 92 units/period is ~276. Adding the 1050 lost units to this target gives a required mu_hat of ~1326. Since on-hand (317) > target (276), the backend will naturally not order until on-hand drops, but the inflated mu_hat ensures that once replenishment is needed, the engine won't be blocked by the 'ghost' pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P21-P28) confirmed stable at ~92 units/period. Ghost pipeline inventory fixed at 1050 units (P1, P3, P4, P19 orders) requiring persistent mu_hat inflation.

The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' has stabilized in a late-summer regime. Over the last 9 periods (P21-P29), the average demand is approximately 95 units per period. The supply chain remains unreliable with 1,050 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory (confirmed lost: P1, P3, P4, P19) that the OR engine incorrectly counts as incoming supply. Current on-hand inventory is 243 units, which covers roughly 2.5 periods of demand at the current average. To ensure replenishment despite the ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * avg_demand + ghost_units. With L=2 and avg=95, the base requirement is 285. Adding 1,050 'ghost' units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1,335. This forces the engine to place a new order once on-hand levels drop, essentially treating the pipeline as empty. sigma_hat is set to recent volatility (N=9) to handle minor fluctuations.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' has stabilized in a late-summer/early-autumn regime. Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), the mean demand is 82.3 units. The current on-hand inventory is 172 units. The in-transit inventory of 1116 units is primarily composed of 'ghost' units from lost shipments: P1 (33), P3 (237), P4 (215), and P19 (565), totaling 1050 units. The remaining 66 units in-transit are from the P30 order. Because the OR engine views the total 1116 units as valid pipeline inventory, it will not place new orders unless the base_stock calculation exceeds (on-hand + 1116). To ensure the system continues to replenish against the actual demand of ~82 units/period, I must set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the lead time plus the lost units to offset the 'ghost' pipeline. Target base stock = (1+L)*mean + ghost_units. With L=2 and mean=82, base stock should be ~246 + 1050 = 1296. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to force this replacement levels.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Everyday Basics' T-shirts has been stable at approximately 80 units/period throughout July and August (P24-P31 average is 81.1). However, the system faces a significant challenge with 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Orders from P1 (33), P3 (237), P4 (215), and P19 (565) are permanently lost, totaling 1,050 units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available in-transit stock. Current on-hand is 99 units. Without manual intervention, the OR engine will see the 1,144 units in-transit (1,050 ghost + 66 from P30 + 28 from P31) and stop ordering. To force replenishment while demand is stable at ~81 units, I must inflate mu_hat. Following the logic of offsetting the 1,050 ghost units over the (L+1) window, and using a base mean of ~81, I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 1,293 (approx 1,050 + 3 * 81). This ensures the base_stock calculation exceeds the ghost pipeline, triggering necessary replenishment orders.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline inventory confirmed stagnant at 1,050 units (P1, P3, P4, P19 orders). Demand regime for late-summer/early-fall (P24-P31) is stable at ~81 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23 (Period 33). Demand for this 'Everyday Basics' T-shirt has stabilized into a late-summer/early-fall regime, with recent demand (P29-P32) averaging approximately 64 units per period (74, 71, 73, 38). The drop to 38 in P32 may be an outlier or the start of a further seasonal decline. The supply chain remains severely compromised: 1,050 units are confirmed lost/ghost units in-transit (P1: 33, P3: 237, P4: 215, P19: 565). These units will never arrive but still count against the pipeline in the OR engine's logic. To force the engine to place necessary replenishment orders, I must manually inflate mu_hat by these 1,050 units. My forecast for the current regime (L+1 = 3 periods) is approximately 192 units (64 * 3). Adding the 1,050 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 1,242. Current on-hand is 155 and real in-transit is 71 (P32 order), totaling 226 units against a target of ~192, hence the system likely won't order more unless mu_hat is boosted. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for early fall (P29-P32) shows a further decrease to ~64 units/period from the late-summer avg of ~92. Ghost pipeline inventory remains static at 1,050 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period 2019/9/30 remains in the early fall stabilized regime detected in Period 33, with an average demand of approximately 64 units per period (based on P29-P32). On-hand inventory is 74 units. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 1,050 units across orders from P1, P3, P4, and P19 are confirmed lost but still counted as 'In-transit' (1,121 current in-transit minus the P32 order of 71 units). To ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by this 1,050-unit deficit. Without this offset, the engine erroneously believes we are overstocked. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P30, P31) show a mix of 1 and 2 periods, suggesting the supply chain has stabilized near the promised 2-period window, even though the lost units remain on the books.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019-10-07), the demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirts has entered an autumn regime, averaging approximately 64 units per period (P29-P34). The current inventory situation is complicated by 1,050 'ghost' units in-transit (Orders from P1, P3, P4, and P19) which are significantly overdue and confirmed lost. The OR engine considers these units part of the pipeline, which would normally suppress new orders. To maintain service levels, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these 1,050 units. With on-hand inventory at 30 and recent demand averaging ~64, a base stock for a 2-period lead time (L+1=3) requires ~192 units. However, to trigger a replenishment order of ~100 units despite the 1,193 in-transit (1,050 lost + 143 legitimate from P32/P34), mu_hat must be set to approximately 1,300. This ensures the OR logic [base_stock - pipeline] results in a positive order to cover actual upcoming demand while treating the ghost units as zero. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the fall stabilization, but then apply an 'explicit' override for mu_hat to handle the pipeline correction.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (Sept-Oct) confirmed stable at ~64 units/period (P29-P34). Ghost pipeline remains at 1,050 units, requiring mu_hat inflation beyond 1,050 to force replenishment.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' has stabilized in the autumn regime (Sept-Oct), with the last 7 periods (P29-P35) averaging 60.57 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 58 units. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 1,050 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P19) but still appear in the in-transit total of 1,226. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed this ghost inventory plus current on-hand. Recently arriving orders (P30, P31, P32) show a lead time average of 2 periods (2, 1, 3). For Period 36, I will use an explicit L of 2. I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the current demand (~61 units) while offsetting the 1,050 lost units to ensure the OR engine actually places an order. Target base stock = (1050 ghost) + (3 * 61 demand) + (safety stock) \u2248 1250.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' has stabilized in the autumn regime (Sept-Oct). Analyzing demand from Period 32 to Period 36, the average is approximately 49 units per period (38, 81, 44, 43, 40), aligning with the seasonal cooldown. The supply chain remains unreliable with a 'ghost' pipeline of 1,050 units (P1, P3, P4, P19) that are confirmed lost but still registered by the OR backend. Current on-hand inventory is 122 units. Total in-transit is 1,122, which includes the 1,050 ghost units and 72 units from the Period 34 order (expected to arrive in the current or next period). To ensure replenishment, mu_hat must be set to cover the ghost units plus the forecasted demand for the lead-time window (L+1). With L=2 and average demand ~50, the required functional base stock is 150. Adding the 1,050 ghost units, I set mu_hat at 1,200 (1050 + 150) to trigger necessary orders. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent low-volume stability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' has reached a stable autumn regime. For the last 5 periods (P33-P37), demand averaged 52.8 units (81, 44, 43, 40, 56), which is significantly lower than the summer peak of ~219. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower baseline while maintaining a safety buffer. The primary operational challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Total in-transit is 1122 units, but based on carry-over history, 1050 units are confirmed lost (P1: 33, P3: 237, P4: 215, P19: 565). The OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see this 1122 as available supply and stop ordering. To force replenishment of the actual required stock (accounting for the 66 units on-hand), I must set mu_hat to be 'explicit' at a value greater than the lost 1050 units. My target base stock is roughly (L+1)*Demand + Safety = 3 * 53 + 70 \u2248 230. However, to trigger any order from the solver, I must offset the 1050 phantom units. I will set mu_hat to 1250 to ensure the backend identifies a need for new orders despite the stalled pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed stable (P33-P37) at ~53 units/period. Total ghost units in-transit fixed at 1,050 (P1, P3, P4, P19); mu_hat must remain inflated above this level to bypass the OR engine's pipeline check until the game ends or units arrive.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04 (Period 39). Demand has stabilized in an autumn regime (Sept-Oct) at approximately 53 units/period (P33-P38 average). The supply chain remains unreliable with a significant amount of 'ghost' inventory: 1,050 units are confirmed lost/missing (P1: 33, P3: 237, P4: 215, P19: 565). These units are officially 'In-transit' but will never arrive, causing the OR engine to under-order unless mu_hat is manually inflated. Total In-transit is 1,209, of which 1,050 are ghost units and 72 (from P34) and 87 (from P38) are expected. The OR engine sub-routine subtracts the full 1,209 from its calculated base stock. To maintain a real-world base stock for a 53 unit/period demand with a 2-period lead time (L+1=3), the target base stock should be ~160 units. To bypass the ghost inventory subtraction, I must set mu_hat such that base_stock > 1050 + 160. Setting mu_hat to 1250 ensures the system perceives enough 'stock-out risk' to ignore the stalled pipeline and place replenishment orders. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile lead times observed (1-3 periods).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (2019-11-11), the demand for 'Everyday Basics' T-shirts is in a stable autumn regime. For the period P38-P39, demand averaged 43.5 units. The primary challenge remains the 1050 'ghost' units in-transit (Orders from P1, P3, P4, and P19) which have not arrived and are considered lost. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock calculation, so unless the calculated base stock exceeds the ghost pipeline, no new orders will be generated. With the current in-transit at 1251 (1050 ghost + P38 order 87 + P39 order 42 + P34 order 72 which is now 6 periods overdue and likely also lost), on-hand inventory is 0. To ensure replenishment for the remaining 7 periods of the game, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that offsets these ghost units. I estimate a base stock requirement of ~150 units (approx 3 weeks of demand at ~50/week) plus the 1251 ghost/delayed units to force an order that results in actual physical inventory arrival. I will use a conservative lead-time estimate of 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: P34 order (72 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, joining the previous 1050 ghost units. Total estimated 'ghost' pipeline is now 1122 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' has stabilized in an autumn regime (averaging ~43 units/period over P34-P40). However, the primary challenge remains the supply chain failure. There are 1,122 'ghost' units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P19, and now P34 which is 6 periods overdue). These units are officially in-transit in the system but physically lost. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock. To trigger a replenishment order when on-hand is 0, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than the ghost pipeline plus current demand coverage. Current ghost units (1122) + expected demand for (L+1) periods (~43 * 3 = 129) equals 1251. I will set an explicit mu_hat slightly above this to ensure a replenishment order is generated to cover the current holiday-entry demand, while keeping L at default (2) as recent successful deliveries (P32, P35, P36) averaged ~2 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019): We are entering the late autumn/winter season for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) being 41.4 units. Current on-hand inventory is 8 units. The main challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline: 1,122 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P19, and now P34). The OR engine's capped policy subtracts the total in-transit (1,382 units) from the base stock. To force an order and maintain service levels, mu_hat must be set to cover the (L+1) demand PLUS the ghost inventory. Estimated (L+1) demand is roughly 42 * 3 = 126. Total mu_hat target = 1122 + 126 = 1248. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the moderate variance in this stable regime, roughly 10% of the mean demand across the period.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Late autumn demand regime (Nov) confirmed stable at ~41 units/period (P37-P41). Total 'ghost' pipeline units now at 1,122 (P1: 33, P3: 237, P4: 215, P19: 565, P34: 72). mu_hat must be manually inflated to at least 1,248 to trigger replenishment orders.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), we are in the late autumn/winter season. Demand has been relatively low and stable, with the P37-P42 average at 44 units/period. The main challenge remains a massive supply chain discrepancy: 1,122 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P19, and P34). The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock to calculate the order. Since on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 1,382 (including the 1,122 ghost units), any mu_hat set below ~1,382 will result in a zero order. To trigger replenishment for the actual demand (approx 44 units/period), I must set mu_hat to exceed the ghost pipeline plus a safety buffer for the next 3 periods (L+1). Expected demand for 3 periods is ~132. Therefore, mu_hat is set explicitly to 1,254 (1,122 lost + 132 demand) to ensure the system places an order to cover the immediate future despite the pipeline wreckage. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but generally 2-period lead time history.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 44 (2019-12-09). We are entering the final weeks of the simulation. Demand context: The late-autumn demand regime (Nov-Dec) has stabilized at approximately 40 units/period (P37-P43 average is ~40.4). Pipeline Reconciliation: The In-transit total of 1209 units is largely comprised of 'ghost' units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34), totaling 1,122 units. Note that Period 38's order (87 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost as well, increasing the ghost pipeline to 1,209 units (matching the current in-transit exactly). This means the system essentially sees 0 units actually coming. On-hand is 142. To trigger a new order, the OR engine's logic [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] must result in a positive value. With demand at ~40 and lead time L+1=3, a normal base stock would be ~120 units. To bypass the 1,209 ghost units and maintain a safety stock of ~120 units, mu_hat must be set to at least 1,329. I will set mu_hat to 1,350 to ensure a small replenishment is triggered for the final periods, accounting for the 1,209 ghost units + 3 periods of demand at 40 units/period + a small safety margin.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: 'Ghost' pipeline inventory confirmed at 1,209 units as the order from Period 38 (87 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost, joining P1, P3, P4, P19, and P34 as lost shipments.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (2019-12-16), we are approaching the end of the simulation (total 47 periods). The current demand regime for late autumn/winter (P41-P44) is stable but low, averaging ~38 units per period. The supply chain has significant reliability issues. Total 'ghost' pipeline inventory (confirmed lost orders) has reached 1,209 units (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34, P38). The current in-transit figure of 1,226 includes these 1,209 defunct units plus a small order of 17 units from P44. With on-hand inventory at 115 units, we are covered for nearly 3 periods of the current demand (~38 units/period). However, the OR backend sees 1,226 units in transit and will not order unless mu_hat is set significantly higher than that figure (since final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)). To maintain a safety stock and cover the final two periods of the game, I will set mu_hat to 1,350. This value accounts for the ~1,226 pipeline units (mostly 'ghost') plus roughly 120 units to cover demand and safety stock for the lead time (L) + review period. Sigma_hat is set based on recent variability to manage the service level. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile history (averaging ~2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Final 'ghost' pipeline inventory confirmed at 1,209 units (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34, P38). Period 42-44 demand remains in a low-seasonal trough averaging ~38 units/period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late December holiday/winter trough (Period 46). Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has stabilized at a low seasonal level; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is approximately 35.6 units/period. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. The current in-transit total of 1256 contains significant lost shipments: P1 (33), P3 (237), P4 (215), P19 (565), P34 (72), and P38 (87), totaling 1,209 confirmed lost units. Since the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (including these ghost units) from its base stock calculation to determine the order, we must manually inflate mu_hat to offset these 1,209 units. A mu_hat of ~1,316 (1,209 + (1+L)*36) ensures the engine recognizes a need for replenishment despite the bloated pipeline. Lead times remain erratic, varying between 1 and 3 periods, so we maintain calculations based on recent observations to handle supply chain volatility.

Carry-over insight: Final 'ghost' pipeline inventory confirmed at 1,209 units (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34, P38). December demand remains in a low-seasonal trough averaging ~36 units/period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the final decision period (P47). The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has remained stable in its winter seasonal trough, with an average demand of approximately 29 units over the last three periods (P44-P46). Inventory on-hand is 57 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately two periods of expected demand. Normally, no order would be necessary. However, the system shows a massive 'In-transit' quantity of 1,256 units. Based on historical tracking, 1,209 of these units are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34, P38). The OR engine subtracts all 1,256 in-transit units from the base stock. To maintain a healthy service level for the upcoming weeks (Transition into early Spring 2020), mu_hat must be set high enough to offset both expected demand and the ghost pipeline. I will set mu_hat using the explicit method at 1,350 to ensure the engine triggers a small replenishment order for safety, anticipating the slight end-of-year/early-January baselining as seen in previous year's early data.
