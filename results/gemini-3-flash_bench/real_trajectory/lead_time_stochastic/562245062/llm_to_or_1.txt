Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Trousers). Current on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Historical demand data from the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a clear upward trend (59, 78, 96, 123, 144), indicating strong growth as we move further into the early spring season. The mean demand of all samples is 100, but the last sample is 144. To avoid stockouts in the face of this momentum, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the most recent growth spurt (average demand approx 121). The promised lead time is 2, so the system will target demand coverage for 3 periods (1+L).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18) managing SKU 562245062 (Luna skinny jeans). Historical demand (prior to Period 1) showed an upward trend: 59, 78, 96, 123, 144. Period 1 demand was 107, which is slightly lower than the most recent pre-game samples but still confirms a high demand regime (avg ~101). Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 161 in-transit (ordered P1). Since the promised lead time is 2, this arrival is expected in Period 3 (visible in P4). For parameters: 1) L=default (2 periods) as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from promised. 2) mu_hat=recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend of the last 6 samples (5 historical + P1). 3) sigma_hat=recent_N (N=6) to reflect the volatility of this same recent period. This approach ensures the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) period demand window during this growth phase.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU is 'Luna skinny RW', a women's 5-pocket jeans product. Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) showed a clear upward trend (59, 78, 96, 123, 144) as we moved towards the spring season. However, recent demand in P1 (107) and P2 (75) has decreased significantly from those peaks. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals from P1 (lead time 2) are not expected until the arrival phase of P3 (visible in P4). We have 313 units in transit (161 from P1, 152 from P2). Given the recent drop in demand compared to the early February highs, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent trend (late Jan plus P1/P2) while acknowledging the high volatility by using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat. The promised lead time is 2, and no orders have arrived yet (which is normal for L=2 in P3), so L remains at 'default'.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product (Womens 5-pocket skinny jeans) has a promised lead time of 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (161 units), Period 2 (152 units), and Period 3 (53 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests a delay or the order arriving later in Period 4. Since we have no on-hand inventory and have lost sales for three periods (starting on-hand was 0), we must ensure the base stock covers current demand and potential variability. Historical demand samples (recent 5 weeks: 59, 78, 96, 123, 144) show an upward trend, but the game history (P1: 107, P2: 75, P3: 52) shows a decrease. Given the discrepancy and the stockout, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat based on the actual observed demand in the game history to avoid over-ordering while waiting for shipments to clear, and keep L as default (2) for now to see if arrivals stabilize in Period 5.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. This SKU (Luna skinny jeans) is a staple women's item. Demand over the last 5 weeks has been [59, 78, 96, 123, 144] plus the actual demand recorded during the game: P1=107, P2=75, P3=52, P4=66. There is a clear downward trend in demand from the pre-game samples to the current game history (dropping from a peak of 144 to roughly 60-70). Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order arrived in P4). Note: The P1 order (161 units) has not arrived after 4 periods, suggesting it may be lost. I will assume the promised lead time of 2 holds for now based on the P2 arrival. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~75) vs the pre-game highs. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 4 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing a women's denim product. Looking at the history, an order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4, confirming a lead time of 2 periods. However, the order from Period 1 (161 units) has not arrived by the end of Period 5, which is 4 periods later. This suggests the Period 1 order might be lost or significantly delayed. On-hand inventory is currently low (31 units) and demand has stabilized around 60 units/week following an initial spike. The in-transit inventory (214 units) includes the potentially lost Period 1 order (161) and the Period 3 order (53). Since the 161 units are likely lost, the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation (214) is overestimated. To compensate and trigger an order, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the 161-unit deficit. Calculation: Base Stock target = (L+1)*AvgDemand + Safety Stock \u2248 3*60 + 1.65*sqrt(3)*15 \u2248 180 + 43 = 223. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (214) from base stock, I must set the mu_hat parameter high enough that (Base Stock - 214) > 0. Setting mu_hat to 350 to ensure we replenish stock despite the 'ghost' inventory in transit.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (161 units) likely lost: no arrival by P6 (expected P3). Pipeline inventory is artificially high by 161 units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). History shows a clear loss of the Period 1 order (161 units), which should have arrived in Period 3 or 4. This order is still trapped in 'In-transit', making the pipeline inventory (352) unreliable. The actual reliable pipeline is only 191 units (P3 order of 53 + P6 order of 138). Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced stockouts. Demand has stabilized after an initial spike, with the last 5 periods (P2-P6) averaging 61.2 units (75, 52, 66, 55, 58). Given the lost shipment risk and recent stockouts, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the risk of delays and to force the OR backend to increase the safety buffer. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 (avg ~61) to capture the current stable demand regime while ignoring the P1 outlier. The explicit L=3 means mu_hat should cover (1+3)=4 periods of demand. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (352) and 161 of that is ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly higher to compensate for the 161 missing units: (4 periods * 61 demand) + 161 = 405.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019-04-01). Reviewing history: P1 order (161 units) is definitely lost (7 periods since order, promised L=2). P2 order arrived in 2 periods. P3 order (53 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost. In-transit shows 421 units, which consists of P1(161) + P3(53) + P6(138) + P7(69). Since P1 and P3 are likely lost, the 'real' pipeline inventory is only 207 units (138+69). The OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' figure, so to compensate for the 214 phantom units (161+53) and avoid under-ordering while on-hand is 0, I will set an 'explicit' mu_hat. Demand is stable; last 5 samples (P3-P7): 52, 66, 55, 58, 55 (mean ~57). For L=2, mu_hat should ideally be (1+2)*57 = 171. To offset the 214 units the backend thinks we have but don't, I will set mu_hat to 171 + 214 = 385. This forces the base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 3 order (53 units) also confirmed lost (no arrival by P8, expected P5). Total lost/phantom inventory in pipeline is 214 units (P1:161, P3:53).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product 'Luna skinny RW' (womens denim) shows stable demand around 60 units/week. Lead times are volatile: P2 took 2 periods, P6 took 2 periods, but P7 arrived early (1 period), and orders from P1 and P3 are officially lost. The current 'In-transit' count of 214 units is entirely composed of these lost orders (161 from P1 + 53 from P3), meaning the pipeline is effectively empty. To fix this, I must set mu_hat using 'explicit' to bypass the backend's pipeline deduction (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Target base stock = (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2 and Avg Demand=60, (3*60) = 180. Adding a safety buffer for lead time variance and recent stockouts, I target a base stock of ~300. Since the OR engine subtracts the phantom 214 units, I set mu_hat (the calculation target) to 514 to ensure an order of ~93 is placed (300 target - 143 on-hand = 157; to get 157 when OR subtracts 214, the base_stock needs to be ~371. I will set mu_hat to 371).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory consists entirely of lost orders (P1: 161, P3: 53); actual effective pipeline is zero. Lead time is highly variable (observed 1 and 2 periods).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the inventory situation is critical due to lost shipments. The 'In-transit' quantity of 236 units is entirely composed of lost or phantom orders: Period 1 (161 units, ordered 9 periods ago) and Period 3 (53 units, ordered 7 periods ago), plus the recent Period 9 order (22 units). Since the promised lead time is 2, any order older than 3-4 periods without arrival is functionally lost. These lost orders (214 units) inflate the OR backend's perception of pipeline inventory, leading it to under-order. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat significantly using the 'explicit' method. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 58 over the last 6 periods (excluding the initial stock-out period noise). To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 174 units) plus compensate for the 214 'phantom' units that the OR backend will subtract from the target, I set mu_hat to 388 (174 + 214). This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful order. Observed lead times are 1 and 2 periods, so I retain 'calculate' for L. Sigma is set using recent_N=6 to reflect current demand volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/22. Demand is stable, with the last 5 periods (P6-P10) averaging 54.4 units. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times since P7 have been shorter (P7: L=1, P9: L=1). Crucially, the 'In-transit' quantity of 284 units is heavily inflated by lost orders from Period 1 (161 units) and Period 3 (53 units), totaling 214 units. The ONLY valid units currently in-transit are from the Period 10 order (70 units). Since the OR backend calculates the order as base_stock - pipeline_inventory, and it counts the full 284 units in the pipeline, it will likely order nothing. To force the system to order sufficient stock, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that offsets this phantom inventory. Calculations: Forecast for L+1 (3 periods) = 3 * 54.4 = 163.2. Target base stock = 163.2 + safety stock. To ensure an order is placed despite the 214 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat artificially high to 375 (~161 + additional buffer) to trigger a replenishment cycle that accounts for the current on-hand of 70 and real pipeline of 70.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (Apr 29). Demand has stabilized after an initial peak in early February, with the last 5 samples averaging 47.4 units. We have identified two lost shipments from the early periods (P1: 161 units, P3: 53 units), totaling 214 units. These remain in 'In-transit' indefinitely but will never arrive. The current 'In-transit' is 317 units, consisting of: P1 (161, lost), P3 (53, lost), P10 (70, expected this period or next), and P11 (33, expected next period or P14). To counteract the lost inventory that the OR core still believes is coming, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Base stock calculation (q=0.8): mu_hat + 0.84*sigma_hat. Target pipeline for demand (L+1=3) is ~142 units. Effective pipeline (actual units coming) is 103 (70+33). On-hand is 32. Total effective inventory is 135. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 317 in-transit from its target, I must inflate mu_hat by the lost amount (214) to force a purchase. 142 (target) + 214 (offset) = 356 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Lost shipment total confirmed at 214 units (P1: 161, P3: 53). All planning parameters must offset this phantom inventory to ensure new orders are triggered.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 13 (2019-05-06). Evaluation of item 562245062 (Womens 5-pocket jeans) shows a consistent demand decline since late January/early February peaks; the most recent 5 periods (P8-P12) average ~45 units/week. Lead time remains volatile (observed 1 and 2 periods). Crucially, the current 'In-transit' of 339 units contains 214 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 161, P3: 53) that the OR backend incorrectly includes in pipeline inventory. To ensure the backend places an order to cover the (L+1) demand window, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) and then add the 214 units of lost inventory back to that target. Calculation: Average demand (last 5) = 45. Standard deviation (last 5) = 14. L=2. Target base stock for service level q=0.8 (z=0.84) would be (3*45) + (0.84*sqrt(3)*14) \u2248 135 + 20 = 155. Adjusting for 214 lost units: 155 + 214 = 369. Setting mu_hat to 369 via 'explicit' forces the base_stock calculation high enough to offset the phantom pipeline inventory and trigger a replenishment order to protect on-hand stock (currently only 5 units).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13, 2019), the SKU (women's jeans) is out of stock (on-hand: 0). The in-transit pipeline of 352 units contains 214 units of confirmed lost inventory (P1: 161, P3: 53) that have not arrived in over 10 periods. The 'real' pipeline consists of orders from P12 (22 units) and P13 (46 units), totaling 68 units. The OR backend calculates orders using 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Since the backend is unaware that 214 units are lost, it overestimates the pipeline, leading to under-ordering. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I forecast demand at ~55 units per week (the average of the last 4 periods). With a lead time of 2, the decision must cover 3 periods of demand (L+1), which is 165 units. To trick the OR engine into ordering enough to cover the 165 units despite the 214-unit 'phantom' pipeline, I must set the target base_stock (mu_hat) significantly higher. Target mu_hat = (Desired Base Stock) + (Phantom Inventory) = 165 + 214 = 379. Lead time L=2 is used as it remains the most common arrival duration (P2, P6, P11 all 2 periods).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 15 (May 20, 2019). The product is a pair of women's 5-pocket skinny jeans. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has trended upward over the last three weeks (59, 63). Total In-transit is 376 units, but 214 of those are confirmed lost (P1: 161, P3: 53), making the effective pipeline only 162 units (P13: 46, P14: 46, and P15's proposal). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' in its base-stock calculation (order = base_stock - on_hand - in_transit). To force the backend to place an order when it sees 214 units of phantom inventory, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately that amount to elevate the base_stock target. Demand mean of the last 5 periods (excluding P1 and P2 outliers) is ~46. With L=2, (1+L)*mean = 138. To offset 214 lost units, I set mu_hat explicitly to ~350. Observed lead times are 1-2 periods; I'll use the default (2) to be safe for coverage.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are out of stock (On-hand: 0). The product is 'Luna skinny RW' trousers, which should see steady demand. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 50.6 units, but has trended upward recently (74 in P15). The 'In-transit' total is 376 units. Crucially, 214 of these units (orders from P1 and P3) are definitively lost. Additionally, the order from P13 (46 units) and P14 (46 units) are currently within the lead time window. However, with 0 on-hand inventory and the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline), the backend will not order because it sees 376 units in-transit. To force an order and mitigate the 214 lost units, I must artificially inflate the base_stock by increasing mu_hat. Expected demand (1+L=3) is ~150 units; adding 214 units suggests a mu_hat target of ~364 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to ensure the system places an order to cover current stockouts and upcoming demand, effectively ignoring the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed stockout (0 on-hand). Effective pipeline remains zero as 214 units are lost and remaining 162 are still in the 2-period transit window. Proactively inflated mu_hat to 365 to bypass the phantom inventory barrier in backend OR logic.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/3), we are in a persistent stockout (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure is reported at 393 units, which consists of: P1 (161 units - lost), P3 (53 units - lost), P13 (46 units - expected P15/16), P14 (46 units - expected P16/17), P15 (0 units), and P16 (17 units - expected P18/19), plus the order from P17. Note: The reported history shows P13 was ordered but hasn't arrived; P14 was ordered but hasn't arrived. Since P13 and P14 orders (46 units each) are now 3-4 periods old (past the promised L=2), they are also potentially lost or severely delayed. Confirmed lost: 214 units. Potential additional lost (P13, P14): 92 units. This phantom inventory blocks the backend OR engine from ordering more, as it believes we have enough pipeline. To force an order despite the phantom 214+ units, I will continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Mean demand over the last 5 samples is ~56. Base stock = (1+L) * mu + z*sigma. To clear a ~300 unit phantom barrier, mu_hat must be significantly inflated. I am setting mu_hat to 450 to ensure the policy triggers a replenishment order to capture early June demand for these everyday trousers.

Carry-over insight: P13 and P14 orders (92 units total) are now overdue (expected P15/P16), suggesting broader systemic shipping losses beyond the original P1/P3 214 units. Total probable phantom inventory in pipeline now exceeds 300 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit 'pipeline' is 459 units, but this is heavily contaminated by lost shipments. Analysis of history confirms: P1 (161), P3 (53), P13 (46), and P14 (46) are all significantly overdue and effectively lost, totaling 306 'phantom' units. The remaining 153 units (P16: 17, P17: 83, P18: 53 implied/recent) are valid. However, the OR backend logic subtracts the full pipeline (459) when calculating the order. To force an order and overcome the 306 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock should cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) plus safety stock. At a current demand average of ~50-60 units (recent mean ~55), we need roughly 165 for demand + safety. To get the OR engine to order despite a 459 in-transit signal, mu_hat must be set significantly higher than (on-hand + pipeline). Since on-hand + pipeline = 459, I am setting mu_hat to 650. This 'over-steering' is necessary to bypass the phantom inventory barrier and ensure replenishment starts arriving, as we are currently stocking out.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Phantom/lost inventory confirmed at 306 units (P1: 161, P3: 53, P13: 46, P14: 46). mu_hat must be aggressively inflated to >460 to trigger any new orders through OR backend.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Luna skinny RW' (Women's 5-pocket jeans) is currently in a severe out-of-stock state (on-hand: 0). The primary challenge is a build-up of 'phantom' inventory in-transit (lost orders) that prevents the OR backend's capped base-stock policy from placing new orders. Confirmed lost shipments: P1 (161), P3 (53), P13 (46), and P14 (46), totaling 306 units. The OR engine calculates 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)'. With a 673 unit pipeline (mostly phantom/overdue), we must inflate mu_hat to ensure (base_stock - 673) > 0. Demand is seasonally stable around 40-60 units/period. The Target Service Level is 80% (Profit 4 / (4+1)). Normal demand for (L+1=3) periods is ~150 units. To trigger any order given the 673 unit pipeline, the mu_hat parameter must be set significantly higher than the reported pipeline. I am setting mu_hat to 750 (explicit) to force the OR backend to place an order that overcomes the phantom inventory drag while allowing for immediate stock replenishment once shipments actually arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Total confirmed phantom/lost inventory in pipeline is 306 units (P1, P3, P13, P14). Mu_hat must be set above 700 to bypass this backend inventory barrier and trigger replenishment for the current stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-89.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the large order of 214 units (placed in P18) arrived with a lead time of 1, restoring on-hand inventory to 189 units. This successfully broke the stockout cycle. However, the system still tracks a massive 'In-transit' quantity of 558 units. Based on historical analysis, 306 of these units are permanently lost (P1: 161, P3: 53, P13: 46, P14: 46). The remaining 'legitimate' pipeline includes the P17 order (83 units) and P19 order (99 units), plus the new P20 order. Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline' to determine the order, and the phantom 306 units exceed the realistic 3-period demand (approx 150-180 units), I must continue to inflate mu_hat to bypass this barrier. Total units that logically satisfy demand (On-hand + Legitimate Pipeline) = 189 + 83 + 99 = 371. To trigger a replenishment that offsets the 306 lost units, mu_hat must be set significantly higher than (Actual Need + 306). Current demand is stable around 50 units/week. Setting mu_hat to 800 ensures that (800 - 558) results in a positive order value to maintain flow while we wait for the phantom units to potentially be cleared or further offset.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Recovery from stockout confirmed with 189 units on-hand. Lost/phantom pipeline inventory remains at 306 units, necessitating sustained mu_hat inflation (>750) to ensure the OR backend ignores the stuck pipeline and continues ordering.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 21 (2019/7/1). Inventory Audit: On-hand is 179 units. In-transit shows 635 units. However, based on history, 306 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P1: 161, P3: 53, P13: 46, P14: 46). Recent pipeline consists of P17 (83 units, overdue), P19 (99 units), and P20 (77 units). Total In-transit (635) - Lost (306) = 329 'active' units. The backend OR logic uses a base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and orders (base_stock - pipeline). To trigger an order when the pipeline is 'clogged' by 306 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to cover the desired base stock PLUS the 306 units. Demand is currently low (avg ~25 over last 4 weeks), but historical average is ~56. For a desired base stock of ~250 units (covering 3 periods of mean demand plus safety stock), I must set mu_hat to at least (250 + 306) = 556. Setting mu_hat to 650 ensures we bypass the phantom inventory barrier while keeping the cap elevated enough to permit new orders. Method 'explicit' is used to maintain this override.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22, the 'In-transit' pipeline for SKU 562245062 remains heavily distorted by lost shipments. The carry-over insights confirm building losses from P1 (161), P3 (53), P13 (46), and P14 (46), totaling 306 units of phantom inventory. Currently, the backend sees 170 units on-hand and 635 in-transit (Total pipeline: 805). Subtracting the 306 lost units leaves an effective total of 499 units. Average demand has dipped recently (Period 20: 10, Period 21: 9), likely a summer lull, though historical February-March data showed ~60 units/period. The OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy: order = max(0, base_stock - pipeline_inventory). To force an order despite the 306 phantom units, mu_hat must be set high enough so that base_stock (roughly mu_hat * (1+L)) exceeds the total pipeline of 805. While current on-hand (170) is sufficient for near-term lulls, long-term stability requires neutralizing the 306-unit drag. I will maintain mu_hat at 850 (explicit) to ensure the system is capable of ordering if needed, effectively telling the engine that the 306 units it thinks are coming aren't real.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), the 'In-transit' quantity is 650 units. Based on historical analysis, 306 units are confirmed lost (P1: 161, P3: 53, P13: 46, P14: 46), as they are many periods past the promised lead time of 2. An additional 99 units from P19 are now overdue (expected P21), increasing the likely phantom/lost inventory to 405 units. Another 83 units ordered in P17 (expected P19) have not arrived, though we observed a P18 order arrive in P19 (LT=1) and a P20 order arrive in P22 (LT=2). Subtracting the probable phantom inventory (405) from the 'In-transit' figure leaves a likely effective pipeline of 245 units (P17: 83, P21: 0, P22: 92, and the current P23 order). On-hand inventory is healthy at 221. Demand has significantly cooled in July (10, 9, 26 units) compared to the spring surge. To ensure the OR backend triggers any replenishment despite the 650 units of 'phantom' pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 800. This value exceeds the total pipeline and current inventory, ensuring a baseline order is generated to maintain stock levels. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to allow for modest volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Phantom/lost inventory in pipeline increased to 405 units (P1: 161, P3: 53, P13: 46, P14: 46, P19: 99 are all overdue). Effective pipeline is significantly lower than the reported 650 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-138.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 24 (July 22). On-hand inventory is 278 units, and reported In-transit is 558 units. Based on historical data, we have confirmed lost shipments for Period 1 (161), Period 3 (53), Period 13 (46), Period 14 (46), and Period 19 (99), totaling 405 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The OR backend uses 'base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat' and 'order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)'. To trigger an order when (on-hand + actual pipeline) is low, we must inflate mu_hat enough to offset the 405 phantom units. Current demand is low (approx 25-35 units/period). With L=2, the base stock for a normal scenario would be ~105. To bypass 405 phantom units + 278 on-hand = 683 units, mu_hat needs to be set significantly higher than this threshold. Since on-hand inventory is currently sufficient to cover several periods of low demand (278 / 35 \u2248 7.9 periods), we can begin to normalize mu_hat slightly but must keep it elevated to ensure future orders are not blocked as on-hand inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Phantom/lost pipeline inventory remains at 405 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). mu_hat must be maintained above 700 to counteract this barrier until on-hand inventory is significantly lower, at which point even more aggressive inflation may be required to place new orders.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 25 (Late July). Inventory is at 261 units with demand averaging roughly 22 units over the last 4 periods (P21-P24). The 'In-transit' count of 558 units is severely inflated by multiple lost/phantom shipments. Specifically, orders from P1 (161), P3 (53), P13 (46), P14 (46), and P19 (99) are all well past the 2-period promised lead time and are likely lost. This results in a total of 405 units of 'phantom pipeline' inventory. Total Pipeline (558) - Phantom (405) = 153 units actually in transit (specifically the P17 and P18 orders or more recent placements). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (558) from its base stock calculation, and we have 261 units on-hand, any base stock calculation lower than 819 (261+558) will result in zero orders. Given current demand is low (approx 20-30/week), we have sufficient on-hand stock (261 units) to cover demand for at least 8-10 periods. Therefore, we do not need to trigger new orders this period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current lower demand trend. No aggressive inflation of mu_hat is required until on-hand stock is nearly depleted.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is 220 units. Total reported in-transit is 558 units. Based on historical data, 405 units are confirmed lost or significantly overdue (P1: 161, P3: 53, P13: 46, P14: 46, P19: 99). The effective pipeline inventory is approximately 153 units (558 - 405). The OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy: Final Order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). To ensure the OR backend ignores the 'phantom' inventory and places orders when demand justifies it, I must maintain an inflated mu_hat. Demand has recently averaged around 30-40 units per week. With a 2-period lead time, a base stock to cover 3 periods would typically be around 120-150 units. However, because the backend subtracts the full 558 in-transit units, I must set mu_hat such that (mu_hat - 558) > 0 to even trigger a non-zero order. I will keep mu_hat at 700 to ensure we stay above this barrier and prevent a stockout as on-hand inventory depletes, while using recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed phantom pipeline inventory remains at 405 units. Effective pipeline is only 153 units out of the reported 558. mu_hat must stay above 700 to counteract this backend inventory barrier.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 27 (2019/8/12). On-hand inventory is 162. The reported in-transit 'pipeline' is 558 units, but 405 of these are confirmed phantom/lost units (Period 1: 161, P3: 53, P13: 46, P14: 46, P19: 99). The effective pipeline is only 153 units (ordered in P20, P22). The OR backend formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will not trigger orders unless mu_hat is set significantly higher than the phantom barrier. However, on-hand (162) + effective pipeline (153) totals 315 units, which covers over 6 periods of the current average demand (~50 units). Demand shows a slight upward trend in recent weeks (41, 58). I will maintain a high mu_hat to ensure that when on-hand inventory drops further, the phantom inventory doesn't block replenishment. We are currently well-stocked, so no urgent order is needed this period, but the parameter settings must remain defensive against the backend's miscalculation of pipeline inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 28 (Aug 19, 2019). On-hand inventory is 71 units with a reported in-transit (pipeline) of 611 units. Historical analysis confirms that 405 of these pipeline units are lost (P1: 161, P3: 53, P13: 46, P14: 46, P19: 99). The P17 order (83 units) is also now severely overdue (expected P19) and likely lost, bringing the total phantom inventory to 488 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 123 units (P20: 77 units, P27: 53 units). Note: P20 (77 units) arrived in P22, so the actual effective pipeline is just the P27 order (53 units). Therefore, out of 611 reported, approx 558 are lost. Demand is currently trending upwards (P26: 58, P27: 91). To trigger new orders and bypass the backend OR logic (which subtracts the 611 'phantom' pipeline from the base_stock), mu_hat must be set above the phantom barrier. I am setting mu_hat to 800 to ensure we replenish for the coming weeks as on-hand inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total phantom/lost pipeline inventory is now estimated at 558 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19). The OR backend's order calculation: max(0, base_stock - 611) requires mu_hat to be significantly inflated (>750) to generate any replenishment orders.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stockout (0 on-hand). Analysis of the pipeline reveals significant lost inventory: P1 (161), P3 (53), P13 (46), P14 (46), P17 (83), and P19 (99) are all far beyond any historical lead time and are likely lost. This results in 488 units of phantom inventory out of the reported 770 in-transit. The Backend OR logic uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat and orders max(0, base_stock - pipeline). With a reported pipeline of 770, mu_hat must be set above 770 to trigger any order. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged ~88 units per period. I am setting mu_hat to 950 (explicit) to overcome the 770-unit pipeline barrier and ensure a replenishment order is placed to address the stockout. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Total confirmed phantom/lost inventory in pipeline is 488 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19). The OR backend's order calculation will not trigger replenishment unless mu_hat is set above the total reported in-transit (770 units).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245062 is currently in a stockout (0 on-hand) with a highly unreliable pipeline. Analysis of 'conclude' messages confirms a massive amount of 'phantom' inventory\u2014orders that are significantly overdue and likely lost. Specifically, P1 (161), P3 (53), P13 (46), P14 (46), P17 (83), and P19 (99) total 488 units that have not arrived despite the 2-period promised lead time. The OR backend calculates order = max(0, base_stock - in_transit). Currently, 'In-transit' is 996 units (which includes P27, P28, and P29). Out of these 996 units, 488 are confirmed phantom. To trigger any order while on-hand is 0 and the backend sees 996 units in transit, the base_stock (mu_hat + z*sigma) must exceed 996. Current demand is trending around 70-90 units/period. Setting mu_hat to 1200 via 'explicit' is a targeted maneuver to force the OR backend to produce an order of approximately 200-300 units (1200 - 996), which will actually cover real demand plus a safety buffer, effectively 'ignoring' the 488 lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Phantom/lost pipeline inventory confirmed at 488 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19). Demand remains steady (avg ~80). Reported in-transit of 996 units requires mu_hat inflation >1100 to bypass the backend inventory barrier and replenish current stockout.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we have 123 units on-hand and a reported 1,033 units in-transit. A significant portion of this in-transit inventory is 'phantom' or lost. Specifically, orders from P1 (161), P3 (53), P13 (46), P14 (46), P17 (83), and P19 (99) total 488 units that are long overdue and highly likely lost. The backend OR logic uses a capped policy: order = max(0, base_stock - pipeline). To force the backend to place an order when on-hand inventory is dwindling and demand is high (~80 units/period), the base_stock (calculated as mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) must exceed the total reported in-transit of 1,033. With a current demand of ~80 and lead time of 2, a normal mu_hat would be ~240. I must set mu_hat to 'explicit' at 1200 to bypass the 1,033 unit barrier. This ensures that the backend sees a 'need' for inventory despite the large phantom pipeline, maintaining availability for this high-demand 'Womens Everyday' denim item as we enter the autumn season.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed phantom/lost pipeline inventory remains at 488 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19). Current total reported in-transit is 1,033 units. mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' >1100 to bypass this barrier and trigger replenishment orders.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32, the SKU 562245062 (Womens Jeans) shows steady demand averaging 88 units/week over the last 5 weeks (ending Period 31). The main challenge is the persistent 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. We have a reported In-transit of 1123 units, but historical evidence from 'Carry-over Insights' confirms that approximately 488 units from early periods (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19) are lost and will never conclude. This creates an artificial barrier in the OR backend's safety stock logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). To trigger necessary replenishment and avoid another stockout (current on-hand is only 22 units), I must set mu_hat (and thus base_stock) to a value higher than the reported in-transit. With total in-transit at 1123 and expected demand over the lead time (L=2) plus review period being roughly 270 (90*3), I am setting mu_hat to 1350 via the 'explicit' method. This forces the base stock above the 1123 phantom threshold, allowing the backend to place an order that covers real expected demand. Sigma_hat is set to 45 (approx 1.5x recent std) to provide a buffer for the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, on-hand inventory is 260 units. Total reported in-transit is 1,027 units, but a significant portion is confirmed lost: P1 (161), P3 (53), P13 (46), P14 (46), P17 (83), and P19 (99), totaling 488 phantom units. The remaining 539 units in-transit includes orders from P29 (226), P32 (243), and P33 (not yet visible). Current demand is stable at approximately 100 units per period. The OR backend uses the formula: order = max(0, base_stock - in_transit). With 1,027 in-transit reported, the base_stock must exceed this barrier to trigger any necessary replenishment. To maintain a safety buffer while accounting for the ~48% package loss rate and the 488 units of phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1,350. This ensures that even with the 'cap' logic and high reported pipeline, the system remains responsive to the current high demand (~100/week) and volatile lead times (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total confirmed phantom/lost inventory in pipeline is 488 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19). Demand has stabilized at ~100 units/week. mu_hat must be maintained at 'explicit' >1200 to bypass the 1000+ reported in-transit units and maintain stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $485.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a major issue with phantom/lost pipeline inventory. Currently, the system reports 1,134 units in-transit, but based on historical evidence (Periods 1, 3, 13, 14, 17, 19), at least 488 of these are likely lost. The OR backend uses a capped policy where 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)'. With a pipeline of 1,134, the 'base_stock' (mu_hat + z*sigma) must exceed 1,134 to trigger any new orders. Recent demand has surged significantly (P33 demand was 149), and the womens 5-pocket jeans category typically sees high autumn demand. To ensure continuity of supply and bypass the inventory barrier created by lost shipments, mu_hat is set to 1,350. This value accounts for the ~488 lost units plus a robust safety level for the next 3 periods (L+1) of demand at the current high rate (~150/week * 3 = 450, plus buffer). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand surge confirmed (P33: 149 units). Reported in-transit of 1,134 units requires aggressive mu_hat inflation (>1300) to ensure the OR backend triggers replenishment despite the ~488-unit phantom pipeline barrier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 starts with a stockout (0 on-hand), and demand has surged in the last two periods (149 and 131 units, avg ~140). The critical constraint is the OR backend's inventory calculation: the reported 'In-transit' is 1,281 units, but a large portion of this is 'phantom' or lost inventory. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, and P19 (totaling 488 units) are confirmed lost/overdue. Additionally, the backend logic subtracts the entire 1,281 units from the base stock to determine the order size. To trigger a replenishment order that covers sustainable demand (~140/week) plus a safety buffer, the base stock (mu_hat) must be explicitly set higher than the reported pipeline. With in-transit at 1,281 and expected demand for the lead time (L=2) plus review period (1) totaling ~420, mu_hat must be at least 1,281 + 420 = 1,701 to bypass the barrier. I will set mu_hat to 1,800 to ensure a robust order is placed while accounting for the recent demand acceleration.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand acceleration confirmed over last 2 weeks (avg 140 vs previous 100). Total confirmed phantom/lost inventory in pipeline remains 488 units, but the OR backend is now blocked by a reported 1,281 units in-transit, requiring mu_hat > 1700 to trigger replenishment.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 36. Product: Luna skinny RW jeans. Demand Analysis: Demand has surged significantly in the last 4 periods (149, 131, 115, and current week typically reflecting similar levels), moving from a base of ~80 to ~130. Pipeline Reconciliation: Total reported in-transit is 1,594 units. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', at least 488 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19). Period 33 (107 units) and Period 34 (147 units) orders are also currently within the 2-3 period lead time window and should arrive shortly. OR Strategy: To trigger replenishment through the backend (which uses base_stock - total_pipeline), we must set mu_hat (target stock) higher than the total reported in-transit of 1,594. With demand at ~130 and a lead time of 2, a normal base stock would be ~400. To bypass the 1,594 barrier, I will set mu_hat to 1,850. This ensures the OR engine sees a 'deficit' and places an order to cover current demand and replenish stock levels despite the phantom inventory noise.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand acceleration sustained over last 4 periods (avg ~130). Reported in-transit of 1,594 units contains at least 488 units of confirmed lost shipments, necessitating mu_hat > 1850 to trigger any replenishment orders in the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-141.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we have 661 units on-hand after a large arrival of 556 units (ordered P35) and 107 units (ordered P33). Demand has stabilized at a higher level, averaging approximately 130 units per week over the last four periods (P33-P36). The reported 'In-transit' is 1090 units. Based on historical analysis, there is a confirmed phantom/lost pipeline of 488 units (from periods P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19). Therefore, the effective pipeline is approximately 602 units (1090 - 488). The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - reported_in_transit. To trigger a replenishment order when we have a large phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be set above the reported in-transit amount plus the desired safety stock. With 661 on-hand, we are safe for about 5 weeks of demand, but to ensure the system continues to order as inventory depletes, I will keep mu_hat at a level that bridges the 1090 unit barrier. Given the recent demand mean of ~130 and a lead time of 2-3 periods, a base stock targeting ~1500 units is appropriate to ensure the 'cap' logic doesn't starve us of future inventory. I will set mu_hat to 1500 and use a moderate sigma_hat to maintain service levels.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38 (late October), demand for the Luna skinny jeans has stabilized at a high level, averaging 131 units over the last 5 weeks. There is a confirmed phantom/lost inventory in the pipeline totaling 488 units (from orders in Periods 1, 3, 13, 14, 17, and 19). The current reported 'In-transit' is 1090 units. Subtracting the 488 units of phantom inventory leaves an effective pipeline of 602 units. Current on-hand is 529 units. Total effective inventory is approx 1131 units. Given the lead time of 2-3 periods and weekly demand of ~131, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods, which is roughly 524 units. However, to trigger a new order through the OR backend's logic [Order = max(0, BaseStock - Reported_Pipeline)], the BaseStock must exceed the reported in-transit of 1090. Setting mu_hat to 1200 (explicit) ensures we stay above this barrier and maintain a healthy stock level without over-ordering excessively, as 1200 / (1+L) approximates our current high-regime demand while bypassing the phantom inventory offset.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand phase (last 6 periods average ~128 units/week). On-hand inventory is 416 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of demand. The reported 'In-transit' of 1,090 units includes at least 488 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19) and likely more recent delays, creating a significant barrier for the OR backend's order logic. The backend computes: order = min(base_stock - reported_in_transit, cap). To ensure the system continues to replenish as on-hand stock depletes, mu_hat must be set above the reported in-transit level to overcome the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Current mean demand (128) * (1+L) (3) = 384, but we must add enough to offset the ~488 confirmed lost units and provide a buffer for the remaining (~600) units that are currently in-transit but not yet arrived. I am setting mu_hat to 1900 to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the reported 1,090 in-transit units, effectively allowing the OR engine to place orders commensurate with actual demand needs while treating the lost inventory as a sunk cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total confirmed phantom/lost inventory in pipeline remains 488 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19). Demand has sustained at a higher level (avg ~130 units/week since Oct). Reported in-transit of 1,090 units requires mu_hat > 1500 to maintain stock and bypass the backend barrier.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. Demand has remained steady over the last 4 periods (avg ~101), though October saw a sustained higher level (avg ~130). As we enter November, we anticipate potential holiday seasonality for women's trousers/jeans. On-hand inventory is 495 units. The reported in-transit is 1359 units, which includes 488 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19). The effective pipeline is therefore 871 units. To maintain stock levels and bypass the backend barrier of the phantom pipeline (effectively ~1359 units reported), the mu_hat must be set as an explicit value to ensure (base_stock - in_transit) remains positive and leads to an order. Given current on-hand of 495 and demand tending around 100-130, and the logic that base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, I will set mu_hat to 1500 to maintain a healthy safety stock and trigger replacement orders despite the large reported in-transit volume.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to face a significant inventory management challenge due to 488 units of confirmed lost/phantom pipeline inventory (from Periods 1, 3, 13, 14, 17, and 19). These units have not arrived for over 20 periods and are skewing the OR backend's order calculation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 427 units while total reported in-transit is 1,359 units (of which 488 are phantom). The backend logic essentially calculates: order = max(0, base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)). To trigger any replenishment, the mu_hat (which drives base_stock) must be set higher than the total reported inventory of 1,786 units. Demand since October (P35) has averaged approximately 110 units per week. Although we are entering a stable period before the holiday rush, the primary goal remains to bypass the backend's barrier. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 2100 to ensure the policy remains responsive and maintains stock as the phantom inventory persists.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-25. We have 785 units on-hand and 1284 units in-transit. Based on the history, 488 units in the pipeline are confirmed lost (from periods 1, 3, 13, 14, 17, and 19). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 1284 - 488 = 796 units. Demand has cooled from the October peak (avg ~130) to a more moderate level (avg ~70 over the last two weeks). Considering we are entering late November (Black Friday week), I expect a significant seasonal demand spike. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - total_in_transit. Currently, total_in_transit is 1284. To trigger any order this period to prepare for December, mu_hat must be set higher than the sum of the desired base stock and the phantom inventory barrier. I will set mu_hat to 1500 using the 'explicit' method to ensure we maintain inventory levels despite the 488-unit leak and high reported in-transit numbers. I will use 'calculate' for lead time as several recent orders arrived in 2 or 3 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), we observed a massive demand spike to 327 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales for this 'Women's Everyday' denim SKU. Current on-hand inventory is 458 units. Reported in-transit is 1,284 units, but significant portions are confirmed or likely phantom/lost (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19 total 488 units). The OR backend calculation for order quantity is: max(0, base_stock - in_transit). With a reported in-transit of 1,284, the base_stock (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) must exceed ~1300 just to trigger any order. To prevent a stockout following the recent demand surge and to account for the ~488 units of phantom inventory blocking the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to 1350. This ensures that even with the 'phantom' barrier and current stock, the OR backend continues to replenish. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to reflect high volatility observed during promotional spikes. Lead time L is kept at 2 (promised).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed Period 42 (327 units), likely seasonal/Black Friday. Phantom/lost pipeline inventory remains at 488 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday period but still within the high-demand December holiday season. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 327 (Black Friday week) and moderated to 133 in Period 43. Total on-hand is 678. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 931, but history confirms that at least 488 units (from Periods 1, 3, 13, 14, 17, and 19) are lost/phantom shipments that will never arrive. This means the effective pipeline is closer to 443 units (931 - 488). The OR backend calculation uses the reported (inflated) in-transit of 931. To ensure we have enough stock for the remainder of December and don't trigger a stockout due to this phantom inventory barrier, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 931 units in-transit plus current on-hand. With 678 on-hand and 931 in-transit, the backend sees 1,609 units. I will set mu_hat to 1300 to ensure we don't order too much while still accounting for the expected Dec demand (~130/week) and the lost shipments. Since we are near the end of the simulation (P47), I am transitioning from aggressive inflation back toward sustaining the current healthy inventory level.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday demand remains elevated (~133 units). Total phantom/lost pipeline inventory remains at 488 units. Effective pipeline is much lower than the reported 931 units, but high on-hand levels (678) reduce the immediate need for aggressive mu_hat inflation compared to previous periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has peaked (327 units in P42 during Black Friday) and is now settling (54 units in P44). The current on-hand inventory is 624 units, which is healthy. However, the system still reports a massive in-transit pipeline of 931 units. Based on historical carry-over insights, at least 488 units of this pipeline (from P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19) are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + reported_in_transit). To prevent the backend from being 'blocked' by this 488-unit phantom barrier when on-hand inventory eventually drops, we must continue to use an inflated mu_hat. Since on-hand is currently 624, and the reported in-transit is 931, the backend perceives a total position of 1555 units. With actual demand averaging ~110 over the last 10 periods (incorporating the spike), a 'normal' base stock for (L+1=3) periods would only be ~330 plus safety stock. To ensure the backend doesn't stop ordering entirely until the on-hand is nearly gone, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1400. This provides a buffer against the 488 phantom units and allows for a smooth replenishment cycle as we approach the end of the year. L is set to calculate to reflect the high variability (1-3 periods) observed recently.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (Dec 23), the on-hand inventory is 560 units. Demand has cooled significantly from the late November spike (327 units on Nov 25), with the last two weeks showing lower levels (54, 64). We are now in a late-December post-peak regime. The reported in-transit remains high at 931 units, but as established in previous carry-over insights, approximately 488 of these units (from P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19) are effectively lost/phantom. The effective pipeline is roughly 443 units (931 - 488). Given the high on-hand levels relative to current demand (~60/week), we do not need to trigger new orders immediately. However, the OR backend logic (base_stock - reported_in_transit) will naturally output zero orders unless mu_hat is inflated beyond the 931-unit barrier. I will set mu_hat to 600 using recent_N (approx. 10 weeks) to reflect current stabilized demand levels, knowing the high reported in-transit will prevent ordering for now. This allows the system to burn through the existing 560 units of on-hand inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30). Demand has cooled post-Holiday/Black Friday (P42: 327, P43: 133, P44: 54, P45: 64, P46: 46). The historical demand for early January (based on startup samples) was roughly 60-100 units/week. Current on-hand is 514 units, which is quite high relative to the ~50-80 unit weekly demand. In-transit is reported at 931 units, but per Carry-over Insights, at least 488 units of this are confirmed lost/phantom (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19). This means effective in-transit is closer to 443 units. Total effective inventory (on-hand + effective in-transit) is ~957 units, covering over 10 weeks of demand. With the stock levels high, we do not need to fight the backend's phantom inventory barrier this period. I will move away from 'explicit' mu_hat inflation and use 'recent_N' (N=8) to capture the recent high volatility and mean (including the 327 spike and the subsequent drop), while allowing the system's high on-hand levels to naturally pause ordering.
