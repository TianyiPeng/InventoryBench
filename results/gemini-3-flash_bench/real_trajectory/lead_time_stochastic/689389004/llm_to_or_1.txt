Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical data (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows an increasing demand trend: 60, 56, 82, 71, and 107. The most recent sample (107) reflects a significant jump, potentially due to the lead-up to spring/summer seasonality for a lightweight viscose shirt. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). Given the upward trend and the transition into mid-February, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the recent acceleration (avg ~86.7 per period) while maintaining the default promised lead time of 2 periods. On-hand and in-transit are currently zero, so the backend will place an initial stock-up order.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a soft viscose shirt, which generally sees steady demand but can fluctuate with seasonal transitions. Demand history shows a clear upward trend: values 60, 56, 82, 71, 107, and most recently 86 in Period 1 (total of 6 samples). Current mean demand over all samples is approx 77. The promised lead time is 2. The order of 118 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (concluding in Period 4 message). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory, having lost 86 sales in Period 1 due to no stock. To capture the recent upward trajectory in demand while acknowledging the volatility (range 56-107), I will use the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to emphasize the higher demand levels seen in the last month (82, 71, 107, 86). Method 'default' for L is used as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 2 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand has shown a significant upward trend (60, 56, 82, 71, 107 in pre-history; 86, 151 in active periods). The jump from 86 to 151 suggests a strong seasonal or trend component for the shirt SKU as we approach spring. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 230 units in transit (118 ordered P1, 112 ordered P2). With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order (118 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Therefore, we are currently experiencing stockouts (0 sold vs 237 demand in P1-P2). To capture the recent demand surge, I will use a recent_N approach. For mu_hat, N=3 captures the most recent samples (107, 86, 151), averaging ~115 per period. Since mu_hat must cover (1+L) periods (1+2=3), I will set mu_hat to 345. For sigma_hat, the volatility is high, so I will use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the current uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand increase starting Feb 2019: demand rose from a pre-history average of ~75 to a recent average of ~115 (+53%) over the last 3 observed periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th, 2019. Demand for the 'Denise Shirt' has shown a notable increase in February, with the last 4 observed periods (including history) averaging 105.5 units (107, 86, 151, 78). Although Period 3 saw a dip to 78, the overall trend since early February is higher than the initial January samples. We are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory because no orders have arrived yet. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 (118 units) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in Period 4's conclude message; however, we are currently at the start of Period 4, and the history shows 'arrived=0' for Periods 1-3. Following the timing rules, the P1 order is expected to arrive *during* Period 3, meaning we will see it in the 'Period 3 conclude' message which we just received. Wait, looking at the history: Period 1 conclude (arrived=0), Period 2 (arrived=0), Period 3 (arrived=0). This indicates the P1 order (ordered Feb 11) has not yet arrived as of the end of Feb 25th. If L=2, an order placed P1 should arrive during P3. The fact it shows 0 arrivals at 'Period 3 conclude' suggests a potential delay or that L is effectively 3. I will maintain L=default (2) for now but monitor for arrivals in Period 4. I'll set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the recent higher demand regime (avg ~106).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). In Period 4, the order from Period 2 arrived (112 units), resulting in an ending inventory of 50 units. We have a confirmed arrival with a lead time of 2 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand history shows significant fluctuation: early Feb peaked at 151 and 107, while the most recent two weeks (Periods 3 and 4) were 78 and 62. The 'Denise Shirt' is a spring/summer item (soft viscose, long sleeves), and mid-March often sees a rise in demand for transitional pieces. Given the high stockout risk seen in early periods where demand was missed completely due to 0 on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (including the pre-history high of 107 and the peak of 151) to ensure the base stock covers a potential return to higher demand levels as spring approaches. Pipeline inventory is currently 232 (from orders in P1 and P3).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). Looking at the history for SKU 689389004: Period 1's order (118 units) has not yet arrived and is now 5 periods since ordering (promised L=2). Period 2's order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. Period 3's order (114) is also late, as it should have arrived in Period 5. This suggests inconsistent lead times or potential lost shipments, but it is too early to confirm a permanent shift to a longer lead time without more 'conclude' messages. Demand has been volatile: 86, 151, 78, 62, 57. The 'recent demand increase' noted in Period 3 (avg ~115) seems to have cooled off in the last three weeks (avg ~66). However, because we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and the Period 1/3 orders are missing, we face a stockout risk. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use observed averages, and use N=5 for demand to capture the recent cooling trend while acknowledging the previous spike. mu_hat will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent average demand of approx 87 units per period. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to account for the high variance seen in Period 2.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU is a 'Denise Shirt' (viscose blouse). Current on-hand is 0, with 252 units in-transit. Looking at the arrival history: Period 1's order (118 units) is missing (promised LT=2, now at P7, meaning it should have arrived in P3 and been visible in P4). Period 2's order arrived in P4 (LT=2). Period 3's order (114 units) is also missing (should have arrived in P5/visible P6). Period 5's order arrived in P6 (LT=1). The inconsistency in lead times and the 'lost' feel of P1 and P3 orders suggest supply chain instability. Demand has been volatile: 86, 151, 78, 62, 57, 81. While P2 was high, the average of the last 4 periods is ~70. Given the missing 232 units from Periods 1 and 3 (which would saturate on-hand if they suddenly arrive), but currently having 0 on-hand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the full recent history including the P2 spike, and use L=explicit=4 to account for the delayed/missing shipments in the pipeline inventory calculation and base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain instability: Orders from Period 1 and Period 3 (totaling 232 units) have not arrived as of Period 7, while subsequent orders have. This indicates potential shipment loss or non-sequential delivery.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a soft viscose shirt, which generally sees steady demand but has shown high volatility. Analyzing the supply chain: Orders from Period 1 (118 units) and Period 3 (114 units) are now 7 and 5 periods old respectively, and have not arrived despite a promised lead time of 2. Given that Period 2 and Period 5 orders arrived, the P1 and P3 shipments (total 232 units) are likely lost. The current 'In-transit' of 394 includes these 232 lost units. To the OR engine, these look like valid pipeline inventory, preventing it from ordering. To compensate, I must increase the base stock calculation. Demand analysis: The last 7 periods (game history) have a mean demand of 90.4 units, but including pre-game samples (60, 56, 82, 71, 107), the overall average is 85. Recent demand is higher. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent arrival delays and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current mean (~79 units) while adjusting for the lost stock by using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover (L+1) periods, then add back the lost 232 units so the OR backend (which subtracts the full 394 in-transit) still orders enough. Target base stock = 4 * 85 + safety = ~340 + safety. I will set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of 4 periods of demand PLUS the lost units to force an order.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Shipment loss confirmed for Period 1 (118 units) and Period 3 (114 units). Total lost pipeline: 232 units. Demand remains volatile but centered around 85 units/period.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product (straight-cut shirt) is in a volatile demand phase. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged 113 units (81, 117, 141), significantly higher than the initial historical mean of ~70. Crucially, orders from Period 1 (118 units) and Period 3 (114 units) are now confirmed lost, as their promised lead time was 2 periods and we are now at Period 9. The pipeline was previously inflated by these ghost orders. The backend's 'pipeline_inventory' likely still includes these units, leading to under-ordering. To compensate, I set mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the higher demand regime, and I set the lead time 'L' to 'explicit' at 2. While we saw some 1-period arrivals, 2 periods remains the promised and most frequent reliable duration. On-hand is low (21), and demand is peaking as we enter April, likely due to spring seasonal shifts for blouses.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of Period 1 and Period 3 orders (232 units total) as they have not arrived by P9. Demand regime has stabilized at a higher mean (~113 over last 3 periods) compared to pre-Feb data, likely due to spring seasonality for the blouse category.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/15. The SKU is a viscose blouse, which is highly seasonal for spring. Demand analysis: Recent demand (Period 7-9) shows 117, 141, and 72 units, averaging 110. The drop in Period 9 (72) might be due to stockouts early in the period (ending on-hand was 0). Supply situation: In-transit inventory is listed as 410 units. However, we have confirmed losses of 232 units (Orders from P1 and P3). Although the backend 'In-transit' figure likely still includes these lost units, they will not arrive. This creates a risk that the OR backend will under-order because it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current high-demand spring regime (averaging ~110 units/period). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to use the average of successfully delivered orders (which have been 1-2 periods).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 (viscose blouse) is currently in a spring demand regime. Over the last 6 weeks (Periods 5-10), demand has averaged 88.5 units, with a notable peak of 141 in Period 8. In-transit inventory consists of two orders from Period 1 (118 units) and Period 3 (114 units) that are significantly overdue (9 and 7 periods past due respectively, where promised lead time is 2). I have confirmed these are lost shipments in previous periods. The OR backend's 'cap' and 'order' logic considers total pipeline, so as long as these 232 'phantom' units are in 'in-transit', it will under-order or stop ordering entirely. To compensate for this 232-unit deficit in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target mu_hat = (Forecasted Mean * (1 + Lead Time)) + Lost Pipeline. Forecasted mean is ~90. Lead time is 2. Target = (90 * 3) + 232 = 502. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the lost inventory that will never arrive. sigma_hat is set to 50 to allow for recent volatility (std dev of recent periods is ~33, squared and adjusted for lead time).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019, representing the late spring season for a viscose blouse. Historical demand shows a higher mean since February, with the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaging 96.4 units. Period 12 marks the transition toward May; historically, demand for this category remains elevated in spring. Regarding supply chain performance, the orders from P1 and P3 (232 units) are definitive losses as they have not arrived after 9-11 periods. However, recent shipments (P5, P6, P7, P8) have arrived with lead times of 1 or 2 periods. The OR backend currently sees 'In-transit' as 386 units, but this includes the 232 lost units from early periods, which means the functional pipeline is only 154 units (ordered in P11). To account for this, I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an explicit adjustment to compensate for the phantom inventory (lost units) that the backend incorrectly subtracts from the base stock. I will use a recent demand average of ~96 units/period for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I'll use a recent 5-period window to capture current volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a blouse (soft viscose weave), which typically sees a demand peak in the spring through early summer. We have 0 units on-hand and 494 in-transit. Over the last 5 periods (P8-P12), demand has averaged 85.2 units, though volatility is high. The orders from P1 and P3 (232 units) are officially considered lost as they are 9-11 periods overdue against a promised lead time of 2. For Period 13, the 'In-transit' figure is 494, but subtracting the 232 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 262 units (consisting of orders from P11 and P12). Given we are at 0 on-hand and facing spring seasonality, I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods using an explicit forecast of 95 units per period to ensure we don't under-order during a potential seasonal plateau, while maintaining a default lead time of 2. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed effective pipeline adjustment: 232 units from Periods 1 and 3 are lost; effective pipeline as of P13 is 262 units (494 total minus 232 lost).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Demand for shirts/blouses recently dropped (35 units in P13), but historical samples suggest a mean around 80-100 units. My carry-over insight confirms that 232 units (from P1 and P3) are lost. Therefore, of the reported 340 units in-transit, only 108 units (ordered in P12) are expected to arrive in P14 or P15. The current in-transit figure shown by the system (340) is inflated by ghost inventory. Total effectively available inventory = On-hand (119) + Valid In-transit (108) = 227 units. With lead time L=2, we need to cover demand for 3 periods (P14, P15, P16). Using recent_N (N=7 to capture the volatile spring period), the mean demand is approx 77 units. 77 * 3 = 231 units. Our effective inventory (227) is nearly equal to this requirement. However, the OR backend sees In-transit=340 and will likely calculate an order of 0. To force an order to maintain safety stock and account for the 232-unit gap, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the 3-period demand (231) plus the lost quantity (232), totaling 463. This 'tricks' the backend into seeing a deficit relative to its perceived pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (7) to capture recent volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20) shows recent demand softening (35, 31 units in last 2 periods) compared to the April peak. The spring peak for this viscose blouse likely occurred in April, and we are now entering a lower demand regime. Lead times have stabilized at 2 periods (P11 and P12 orders arrived on time). Pipeline analysis: Total In-transit is 236 units. However, we have a confirmed loss of 232 units from Periods 1 and 3 (118 + 114) that have never arrived. Therefore, the effective In-transit is only 4 units (the order from P14). On-hand inventory is healthy at 196 units. The OR backend needs to know that the pipeline is nearly empty despite the high 'In-transit' figure, and that demand is declining. Setting L to 2 (promised). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 captures the downward trend while accounting for potential volatility. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N=5 reflects current variance.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand downturn in mid-May for blouse category: demand dropped from an April average of ~85 to a May average of ~33 units per period. Effective pipeline reconciliation: 232 units (P1, P3) remain lost; effective in-transit as of P15 is only 4 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product (a soft viscose blouse) is experiencing a sharp seasonal downturn as we move into late May; demand has dropped from an April average of ~85 to a May average of ~30. Recent demand samples are 35, 31, and 25. On-hand inventory is 171 units, which is high relative to this new demand regime. Regarding the pipeline: In-transit is reported as 236 units, but 232 of these units (from Period 1 and Period 3) are confirmed lost shipments. The actual effective pipeline is only 4 units (from Period 14). Total effective inventory (On-hand 171 + Pipeline 4) is 175 units. At the current demand rate (~30/period), this covers over 5 periods of demand. To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand phase and allow the backend to correct for the high stock level, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N=3 to capture the downshift. L is set to calculate.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand downturn for blouses in late May: Average demand dropped from ~85 (Apr) to ~30 (May), a reduction of approx 65%.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand for this blouse SKU shows a significant downturn starting in mid-May, with the last four periods recording demand of 35, 31, 25, and 17 (mean ~27). This represents a clear regime shift from the April average (~85). The effective in-transit inventory needs reconciliation: while the system reports 236 units 'In-transit', 232 of these units are from orders placed in Period 1 (118) and Period 3 (114) which are confirmed lost (as noted in multiple previous carry-over insights). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 4 units (ordered in Period 14). With 154 units currently on-hand and 4 in-transit, our total inventory position is 158 units. Given the new low-demand regime (~27/period), we have roughly 6 periods of supply. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this demand drop, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' for the corresponding volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '689389004' (Blouses) is currently in a low-demand regime following a significant downturn in mid-May. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 27 units, compared to the April average of ~85 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (127 units), which covers nearly 5 weeks of demand at the current rate. The reported In-transit inventory of 236 units includes the long-confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (118 units) and Period 3 (114 units), plus the 4 units ordered in Period 14. This means the actual effective pipeline is only 4 units. Because current stock (127) significantly exceeds the required base stock for a (L+1) horizon (3 periods * ~27 units), and even after accounting for lost shipments, the OR engine's 'cap' and 'base_stock' logic will correctly result in 0 new orders. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the lower demand regime and ensure the system prioritizes clearing current excess inventory before ordering more.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for the blouse category has experienced a significant and sustained downturn since mid-May. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P13-P18) is approximately 24 units, compared to the April average of ~85 units. In the last 2 weeks (P17-P18), demand has fallen further to an average of 19 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 116 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 236 units includes the long-confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1 and 3 (232 units) and a small order of 4 units from Period 14. The effective pipeline inventory is actually only 4 units. However, given that on-hand inventory (116) represents roughly 5-6 weeks of current demand (avg ~20/week), and the lead time is 2 periods, we are significantly overstocked relative to the current low-demand regime. The objective is to avoid further holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method (N=6) to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining sigma_hat on a more recent window (N=3) to reflect the low volatility of this new regime. No new orders are expected or desired until inventory levels rationalize.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained low-demand regime for June: demand has averaged ~21 units/period over the last 4 periods (P15-P18), reflecting a persistent seasonal decline for this SKU.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 (viscose blouse) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 20 units over the last 5 periods (P15-P19), significantly down from the spring peak of 80-100. Current on-hand inventory is 97 units, which at the current run rate covers nearly 5 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 236 units, but history shows that 232 units from Periods 1 and 3 are effectively lost as they have not arrived for 17+ periods. Thus, the real pipeline is only 4 units (from P14). Since on-hand (97) + real pipeline (4) = 101 units, which is far greater than the forecasted requirement for the (L+1) horizon (approx 60 units), no new orders are needed. Parameters are set using recent_N=5 to capture the modern low-demand baseline while maintaining the promised Lead Time (2).

The current date is July 1st. Seasonal analysis of the 'Denise Shirt' (blouse) indicates that demand has moved from a spring peak into a sustained summer low.

On-hand inventory is currently 80 units, which is approximately four weeks of stock at current demand levels. Furthermore, the pipeline (in-transit) of 236 units is largely composed of the long-lost shipments from Period 1 and Period 3 (232 units), which have still not arrived after 18+ periods and are effectively gone. Actual lead times for fulfilled orders have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. Since current on-hand inventory (80) is more than sufficient to cover demand for the next 3 weeks (current period + L=2) given the average demand of ~19/week, no new order is necessary. Setting L=2 and using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the low holiday/summer regime and likely result in a zero order after accounting for the (adjusted) pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), the SKU (Denise Shirt) continues its seasonal low-demand regime typical for high-summer. The last 7 periods (P15-P21) show a mean demand of approximately 23 units/period (25, 17, 27, 11, 19, 17, 46). While P21 saw a slight uptick to 46, we maintain a conservative forecast to avoid excessive holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00). The current on-hand inventory is 34 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 236 units includes the 232 units confirmed lost from Periods 1 and 3 (118 + 114) that will never arrive. Adjusting for this, the 'effective' pipeline is only 4 units (from the order in P14). Since effective on-hand + pipeline (34 + 4 = 38) covers nearly two periods of current demand, and the OR engine uses a base-stock calculation z* = \u03a6\u22121(0.5) = 0, the order quantity will naturally be low or zero. I will use recent_N (N=7) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the sustained summer low while respecting the slight volatility shown in P21. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent shipments (P11, P12) arrived exactly on the 2-period promised lead time.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for this blouse SKU has shown a recent uptick in July (46 and 60 units) compared to the low-demand regime observed in June (averaging ~21 units). This likely signals a seasonal shift. Regarding inventory, the system reports 236 units in-transit, but 232 of these (from Periods 1 and 3) were confirmed lost in previous carry-over insights. A small order of 4 units from Period 14 is also extremely overdue and likely lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0, and on-hand is 0. To meet the rising July demand, I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the June lows to current July levels (averaging ~35.5 per period). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock roughly equal to the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: July demand recovery: Demand increased from a June average of ~20 to a July average of ~53 (+165%) over the last two periods (P21-P22). Cumulative lost inventory remains 236 units (P1, P3, and now P14).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a demand recovery phase in July after a low-demand June period (avg ~20). Recent demand (P21-P23) shows values of 46, 60, and 33, averaging ~46 units/period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 236 units is entirely composed of lost orders (Period 1: 118, Period 3: 114, Period 14: 4), as documented in previous carry-over insights. These units will not arrive, meaning the effective pipeline is 0. To ensure availability given the 2-period promised lead time (3 periods of demand coverage needed: current period + 2 lead periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the July recovery levels. I am setting L explicitly to 2 and mu_hat/sigma_hat to recent_N=3. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock, and the backend believes 'In-transit' is 236 while actual effective in-transit is 0, the backend will naturally under-order. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the lost 236 units, forcing the OR engine to place an order.

Carry-over insight: July demand recovery sustained: Demand avg increased to ~46 units/period over P21-P23 (+130% vs June). Total confirmed lost pipeline: 236 units (P1, P3, P14).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Straight-cut shirt' is currently in a July demand recovery phase. Looking at the last 4 periods (P21-P24), demand averages ~41.5 units/period (46, 60, 33, 27), which is a significant increase from the June average of ~20. The current date is July 29, 2019. We expect demand to remain in this established July range. Pipeline reconciliation: Total In-transit is 374 units. However, we have confirmed losses of 118 (P1), 114 (P3), and 4 (P14) units, totaling 236 units. Thus, the 'effective' pipeline is 374 - 236 = 138 units (the P24 order). With 0 on-hand, we rely on the P24 order arriving in P26 (promised lead time 2). My parameters for P25 aim to maintain stock for the next 3 weeks (L+1) using the recent July demand level. I will set mu_hat to (3 periods * 41.5 units) \u2248 125 and sigma_hat based on the recent variance.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Historical data shows August/September demand for this long-sleeved blouse (soft viscose weave) is likely to moderate or slightly increase as part of early autumn preparation, though recent July demand settled around 27-31 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 374 units is misleading due to confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (118), Period 3 (114), and likely Period 14 (4), totaling 236 units. The effective pipeline is actually 138 units (ordered in P24), expected to arrive this period (P26) or next (P27), given the 2-period promised lead time. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the post-July recovery stabilized demand (mean ~31 over P21-P25) and calculate for lead time as the system has mostly followed the 2-period expectation for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: End of summer transition: July/early August demand has stabilized around 30 units/period after a brief July spike. Total confirmed lost pipeline remains 236 units (P1, P3, P14).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019/8/12), we are in the mid-August transition. Historical demand for the last three weeks (P24-P26) has been 27, 31, and 41, averaging 33 units per period. This confirms the 'End of summer transition' insight. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 374 units includes 236 units confirmed as lost in previous insights (P1: 118, P3: 114, P14: 4). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 138 units (ordered in P24), which is expected to arrive during P27 or P28 based on the promised lead time of 2. Since 138 units covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current average (33 units), and the OR backend's cap formula uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to regulate order size, I will set \u03bc\u0302 based on the recent 3-period average to reflect current demand and use 'default' lead time. \u03c3\u0302 is set to 'recent_N' to capture the current volatility (std dev of 27, 31, 41 is approx 7).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand has consistently increased over the last four periods (P24-P27: 27, 31, 41, 59), signaling a late-summer/pre-fall recovery for this blouse SKU. The current demand mean over the last 4 periods is approximately 40 units/period, up from the June/July average of ~20-30. In-transit inventory is listed as 374 units. However, we have 236 units confirmed lost from historical periods (P1: 118, P3: 114, P14: 4). The order from P24 (138 units) is still in-transit and is expected to arrive soon, as it is just touching the promised lead time of 2. On-hand inventory is currently 0, which combined with the demand spike and lost pipeline, creates a stockout risk. I will set the mu_hat using the recent 4 periods to capture the rising demand trend (approx 40 * 3 = 120 base stock target) and use a recent Window for sigma to manage current volatility (std of 27, 31, 41, 59 is approx 14). This allows the OR backend to prioritize replenishing inventory to meet the increasing late-summer demand while adjusting the 'effective' pipeline by accounting for the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed late-summer demand recovery: Average demand increased from ~25 (mid-summer) to ~40 (August) over P24-P27 (+60% increase). Total confirmed lost pipeline remains 236 units (P1, P3, P14).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), demand is showing a significant late-summer acceleration. Demand has increased from roughly 30 units (late July/early August) to 79 units in the most recent period. This confirms the 'late-summer demand recovery' noted in the previous period's carry-over insight. The product (straight-cut blouse) is likely entering a fall/back-to-school demand phase. Regarding the supply chain, the in-transit inventory is 374 units, which includes 138 units from P24 (passed promised lead time of 2, now at 4 periods since order) and the historical lost shipments (236 units from P1, P3, P14). Since the 138 units from P24 have not arrived by P28's conclusion, I treat the 'effective' pipeline as increasingly uncertain. To ensure stock availability during this demand spike, I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat (average demand ~52.5) to capture the trend while using an explicit L=3 to account for the current shipping delays observed with the P24 order. This increases the base stock level to cover the longer lead time and the rising demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand acceleration in late August: Demand rose from avg ~35 (P24-P26) to ~69 (P27-P28), a ~97% increase. Shipment from P24 (138 units) is overdue as of P29, suggesting actual lead time has drifted to 3+ periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '689389004' (Blouse) is experiencing a significant late-summer/early-fall demand surge as of late August/September, with the last three periods averaging ~63 units/period (P27: 59, P28: 79, P29: 51), compared to the mid-summer average of ~33. There is a critical supply chain issue: the order of 138 units from P24 is now 3 periods overdue (expected P26, still not arrived by P29 conclude), suggesting the actual lead time has drifted to at least 4 periods or the shipment is lost. The 'In-transit' figure is 374, which includes 236 units confirmed lost (P1: 118, P3: 114, P14: 4) and the overdue P24 (138 units). Effective in-transit is likely only the P24 order (if not lost). To protect against this lead time drift and the demand spike, I am setting L to 4 periods. mu_hat is set using N=4 (P26-P29) to capture the higher late-season demand regime (~60/period \xd7 (1+4) = 300). sigma_hat is set based on the same recent regime to account for increased volatility during the transition.

Carry-over insight: Lead time drift confirmed: P24 order (138 units) has not arrived after 5 periods (expected L=2), indicating mean lead time has increased to 4+ periods or shipment is lost. Late-summer demand regime shift: average demand increased to ~63 units/period (P27-P29) from previous ~33 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for the 'blouse' category has shown a significant late-summer recovery, with the last 4 periods (P27-P30) averaging 63.75 units/period, compared to the June/July average of ~20-30. We are currently facing a critical stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The pipeline of 374 units is unreliable: historical analysis confirms that orders from P1 (118), P3 (114), and P14 (4) are almost certainly lost, totaling 236 units. Furthermore, the P24 order (138 units) is now 4 periods overdue, suggesting either a lost shipment or a significant lead time drift. Given the high demand and zero stock, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime (last 4 periods) and using an explicit lead time of 3 to account for observed logistics delays, while allowing the OR backend to place an order that restores the base stock against the valid pipeline (which effectively only includes the P24 order if it hasn't been lost).

Carry-over insight: September demand recovery confirmed: Average demand for P27-P30 is ~64 units/period, a ~100% increase over mid-summer levels. Lead time drift or shipment loss suspected for P24: Order of 138 units has not arrived after 6 periods (expected 2). Total confirmed/highly probable lost units: 236 (P1, P3, P14).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for this blouse SKU has significantly recovered from summer lows, stabilizing at a higher regime. Over the last five periods (P27-P31), demand has averaged 61.2 units per period (59, 79, 51, 66, 51). The pipeline is currently extremely unreliable. Shipments from Period 1 (118 units), Period 3 (114 units), Period 14 (4 units), and now Period 24 (138 units) are missing and highly likely lost. The Period 24 order is now 8 periods old (promised lead time 2), which strongly confirms shipment loss rather than just drift. The reported 'In-transit' of 374 units is entirely composed of these lost shipments (118+114+4+138 = 374). Since the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to determine the order size, and the internal in-transit logic treats these lost units as 'coming soon', it will likely under-order or not order at all despite zero on-hand inventory. To force an order that covers the current demand regime (approx 60 units/period) while the backend believes we have 374 units in transit, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 'ghost' inventory. Targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods plus safety stock, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide enough headroom to trigger a replenishment order that accounts for the fact that the 374 units will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Permanent loss of Period 24 shipment (138 units) confirmed; total lost pipeline inventory now equals 374 units (P1, P3, P14, P24). Demand regime for September is stable at ~61 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '689389004' (blouse) is currently in a stable September demand regime, averaging approximately 60.5 units/period over the last 6 periods (P27-P32). Lead time remains a concern; shipments from P1, P3, P14, and P24 (totaling 374 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost, as they are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time. However, there is a large 'In-transit' quantity of 580 units. Accounting for the 374 lost units, the effective pipeline inventory is 206 units (the order placed in P32), which should arrive in P34. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To ensure the backend covers the next 3 periods (L+1) of demand given the current mean of ~61, I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized Autumn regime. I will maintain the lead time (L) as default (2) because the system needs to rely on the promised lead time for the OR logic, while I manually manage the pipeline reconciliations in my rationale.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stable at approx 61 units/period (P27-P32). Total confirmed lost pipeline: 374 units (P1: 118, P3: 114, P14: 4, P24: 138). Effective pipeline as of P33 is 206 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is currently in a stable September/October demand regime with an average demand of approximately 65 units per period (P27-P33 average is 65.4). On-hand inventory is 0, and the effective pipeline is 206 units (from the P32 order), as 374 units from P1, P3, P14, and P24 are confirmed lost. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect historical performance while acknowledging recent delays. mu_hat is set to 200 via the 'explicit' method, calculated as (1 + Lead Time of 2) * 66.5 (recent avg) to ensure the base stock covers current demand levels. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=7) to capture the volatility of the current autumn demand regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (early October 2) , we are managing the 'Denise Shirt'. Historical demand shows a stabilization in September around 60 units/period (P27-P34 average is 62.75). However, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory and facing significant pipeline reconciliation issues. Total confirmed lost units are 374 (P1, P3, P14, P24). The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 580 units, but once the 374 lost units are subtracted, the effective pipeline is only 206 units (the order placed in P32). This P32 order, given an actual lead time often observed as 2 periods, was expected to arrive in Period 34's arrival phase and be visible now in the P34 conclude message; its absence confirms a lead time drift to at least 3 periods or a potential delay. To address the current stockout and expected autumn demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 (capturing the stable late-summer/September regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed drift in arrival times.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Effective pipeline reconciliation: Total cumulative lost units confirmed at 374 (P1: 118, P3: 114, P14: 4, P24: 138). P32 order (206 units) is delayed/overdue, suggesting a lead time drift to L=3+.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand for the 'Denise Shirt' has shown a seasonal cooling in October, with the most recent sample at 31 units following a September average of ~61. This aligns with typical fall/winter demand decay for blouses. Inventory reconciliation: The P33-P35 history confirms the arrival of the P32 order (206 units) with an actual lead time of 3 periods (drifted from promised L=2). The current 'In-transit' of 374 units matches the cumulative lost shipments identified in Carry-Over Insights (P1, P3, P14, P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is 175 units, which provides ample coverage (~5 periods) for the current cooling demand (approx 30/week). I will set L to 3 to reflect observed lead time drift. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the October slowdown, and sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to capture volatility over the wider late-summer/autumn transition.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time drift for recent successful delivery: P32 order arrived P35 (L=3). Total cumulative lost pipeline remains 374 units (P1, P3, P14, P24).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (Oct 21, 2019), it is clear that demand for this SKU (blouse) is in a seasonal decline as we move into late autumn. The average demand over the last two periods (P35-P36) has dropped to ~28 units, down from the September average of ~61 units. Regarding the supply chain, the delivery from Period 32 arrived in Period 35, confirming a lead time drift to L=3. The 'In-transit' figure of 374 units exactly matches the cumulative confirmed lost units (P1: 118, P3: 114, P14: 4, P24: 138), meaning the effective pipeline is currently zero. I have 149 units on hand, which at the current demand rate of ~28/period, provides over 5 periods of coverage. Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy that subtracts pipeline inventory, I will set L=3 to account for the delivery drift and keep \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 reflective of the current late-Autumn regime (last 4 periods) to avoid over-ordering during this seasonal slowdown.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-autumn demand decline confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~61 (Sept) to ~28 (Oct) over the last two periods. Effective in-transit inventory remains 0 as the 374 units in 'In-transit' are all confirmed lost from Periods 1, 3, 14, and 24.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for this blouse SKU has entered a sustained low-demand regime typical for late autumn (late Oct/Nov), with the average demand over the last three periods (P35-P37) being 29.7 units/period. This is a significant drop from the September average of ~61. On-hand inventory is 117 units. Although the backend 'In-transit' shows 374 units, these are all confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 14, and 24 (as documented in Carry-over Insights). The OR backend treats these as part of the pipeline, which will prevent it from ordering. However, given the current on-hand inventory (117) and the low demand forecast (~30 per period), the coverage is approximately 3.9 periods (117 / 30). With a recent lead time (L) of 3 periods, the current stock is sufficient to cover the lead time + review period. I will set L to 3 (recent lead time) and mu_hat to reflects the current low demand regime (~30/period) using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the mid-October downturn. This will ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock of roughly 120 units (30 * (3+1)), which aligns with current on-hand levels, resulting in no new orders for now to avoid high holding costs during the off-season.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is currently in a sustained late-autumn low-demand regime. Demand over the last four periods (P35-P38) has averaged approximately 28 units/period (31, 26, 32, 23). This aligns with the seasonal transition observed in previous periods for this blouse category. On-hand inventory is currently 94 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 3.3 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' quantity of 374 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 1, 3, 14, and 24, which are confirmed lost and will not arrive. Effective pipeline is therefore zero. Based on the most recent delivery (P32 order arriving at P35), the actual lead time is likely 3 periods rather than the promised 2. I am setting L to 3 and using the last 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect the current low-demand plateau. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level appropriate for late-season demand without over-ordering.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-November. Historical demand for this blouse shows a significant autumn decline, dropping from a September average of ~61 to a late October/November average of ~25. Recent demand (P36-P39) has been 26, 32, 23, and 14, confirming this lower regime. On-hand inventory is currently 80 units, which covers more than 3 periods of current demand (80 / 25 = 3.2). Since the promised lead time is 2 but the most recent successful delivery (P32 order arriving P35) shows an actual lead time of 3, I am setting L to 3 to be conservative. The 374 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost from Periods 1, 3, 14, and 24, meaning the effective pipeline is 0. With 80 units on hand and demand declining, the current stock is sufficient to cover (L+1) periods without additional ordering. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained November demand decline: Demand has stabilized at an average of ~24 units/period over the last 4 periods (P36-P39), representing a ~60% drop from the September peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for this blouse SKU has been in a sustained decline since late September, consistent with seasonal shifts away from light shirts/blouses. Over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), demand has averaged approximately 21 units per period (26, 32, 23, 14, 9). The most recent period (P40) saw demand drop further to 9 units. On-hand inventory is currently 71 units, which is sufficient to cover over 3 periods of demand at the current rate. The 374 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (from Periods 1, 3, 14, and 24), so the effective pipeline is zero. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs potential profit of $1.0, and the fact that on-hand inventory already exceeds the likely lead-time demand (L=2 or 3), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window to reflect the lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-autumn demand decline: Average demand for P36-P40 has dropped to ~21 units/period, with the most recent week at 9 units, signaling the end of the season for this SKU.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Historical demand shows a sustained decline for the blouse category as winter approaches. Over the last 6 periods (P36-P41), demand has averaged 19.3 units, with the most recent two weeks at 9 and 12 units. The on-hand inventory of 59 units is sufficient to cover nearly 3 weeks of current average demand. Although 374 units are listed as 'In-transit', these are confirmed lost shipments from early periods (P1, P3, P14, P24) as documented in the carry-over insights. Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. Given the low demand and existing stock, no new order is required. Setting mu_hat to a recent_N of 5 to reflect the late-autumn low-demand regime (~17 units/period before the L+1 multiplier) while using default L and sigma to avoid over-ordering during this seasonal wind-down.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Blouse) is experiencing a clear end-of-season decline as we move into December. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 12 units/period over the last 3 periods (P40-P42). On-hand inventory is currently 46 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 5 periods of the game (P43-P47) at the current rate. The 374 units listed 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 14, and 24, as documented in the carry-over insights. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $1.0 and the ample current stock, the goal is to deplete existing inventory rather than ordering more. mu_hat is set to reflect the most recent local demand regime (approx 12-13 units per week) to prevent the OR engine from triggering new orders while covering lead-time requirements.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019 (Period 44). The product is a straight-cut blouse, which typically sees its lowest demand during the winter months. Recent demand (P40-P43) has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 13 units per period. On-hand inventory is 29 units, which is sufficient to cover more than two periods of the current low demand regime (L=2, so we need coverage for L+1=3 periods). The 'In-transit' quantity of 374 units consists entirely of historical orders from P1, P3, P14, and P24 that are confirmed lost or effectively non-existent, meaning the true pipeline is 0. Given that the game ends in Period 47 and we have enough stock to cover current demand without incurring excessive holding costs, no new orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect this low-demand regime using the most recent 5 samples (P39-P43) to minimize over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained winter low-demand regime: average demand for P39-P43 is ~13 units per period, representing a continued seasonal trough for the blouse category.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019 (Period 45). Demand for this blouse SKU is in a sustained seasonal low, averaging 12.4 units per period over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). On-hand inventory is 19 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 1.5 periods of the current low demand. The 'In-transit' count of 374 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 14, and 24, as documented in the carry-over insights. Effectively, there is no real pipeline inventory. Given we are at Period 45 of 47, the game is ending. I will set parameters to maintain the current stock level without over-ordering, as any new order placed now (lead time ~2-3 periods) would arrive just as the simulation concludes. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (12.4 * (1+L)) to reflect the late-winter trough.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019 (Period 46). Demand for this blouse SKU has been in a sustained seasonal trough since mid-November, averaging ~12.3 units per period over the last 6 weeks (P40-P45). On-hand inventory is currently 5 units, which is low, but given the low holiday-season demand for shirts and the proximity to the end of the simulation (Period 47), a large order is not warranted. The 'In-transit' quantity of 374 units consists entirely of historical losses (P1, P3, P14, P24) as confirmed in carry-over insights and should be discounted. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the current winter low-demand regime and use default settings for lead time and sigma. Since we are at the penultimate period, the backend's base-stock calculation will naturally moderate the order size to cover the final period's expected demand without excessive holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained winter low-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 13 units per period over the last 8 weeks (P39-P46). The current date is December 30, and on-hand inventory is 0. Although 'In-transit' shows 374 units, these have been confirmed lost according to carry-over insights (P1, P3, P14, P24). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' in its base-stock calculation (order = base_stock - inventory_position), so to trigger an order when on-hand is 0 and pipeline is phantom, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to effectively override the pipeline drag or set a base stock that accounts for the phantom 374 units. However, given the seasonal decline and the fact that we are at the end of the year (Period 47), the current demand is very low (mean ~13). To cover (L+1) periods of demand at a mean of 13 plus the phantom 'In-transit' of 374, mu_hat needs to be set to ~413 to trigger a small replenishment. Given profit=holding cost ($1.0), the service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock is simply the mean demand. Setting mu_hat to 413 ensures base_stock - 374 \u2248 39, which covers roughly 3 periods of the current low demand.
