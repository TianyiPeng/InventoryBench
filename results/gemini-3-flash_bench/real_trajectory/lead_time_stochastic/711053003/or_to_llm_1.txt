Historical demand shows an average of 31.8 units/week (13, 21, 55, 47, 23). The spike in late January (55, 47) suggests some volatility or early spring interest. The OR baseline recommends 62 units based on a base-stock policy (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302) with a 2-period lead time. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, and the lead time is 2 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3. The OR recommendation of 62 units effectively targets a service level to prevent stockouts during this lead-time window.

Historical demand shows a significant spike in late January (55, 47) before settling to 23 in early February. However, Period 1 actual demand was 79, suggesting a much higher demand regime than historical samples (average 31.8) or a sudden seasonal surge. \n2. Lead-Time & Inventory: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 (62 units) is in-transit and expected to arrive in P3 (visible in P4 start). We currently have 0 on-hand and 62 in-transit. \n3. OR Analysis: The OR agent recommends 82 units based on historical demand and promised lead time. However, OR's estimation likely underestimates the current demand regime (79 units in P1 vs historical avg ~32).\n4. Decision: I will follow the OR recommendation of 82. While P1 demand was high (79), there is high uncertainty if this persists. An order of 82 ensures that our pipeline (62 + 82 = 144) covers approximately two periods of high demand (79 * 2 = 158) just in case, while protecting against high holding costs ($1/unit) if demand reverts back to historical levels (~30).

Demand Analysis: Historical demand was low (avg ~31). However, Period 1 demand was 79 and Period 2 was 115. This SKU (Long T-shirt) is showing a massive upward trend as we move into late February/early March, likely due to spring seasonality. The OR baseline (61 units) is underestimating this trend because it uses all historical samples equally. \n3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 144 (62 from P1 + 82 from P2). \n4. Strategy: Total demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) is likely to exceed the OR's expectation. If demand stays at ~115, I need 345 units in the pipeline. Current pipeline is 144. OR suggests 61, bringing total to 205. This is insufficient if demand persists at >100.

Historical demand (Jan/Feb) averaged ~32 units but has surged significantly in the last three concluded periods (79, 115, 96), averaging ~97 units. This indicates a strong regime shift as we move into spring (March). Inventory analysis: On-hand is currently 0. Pipeline inventory is 254 units (orders from P1: 62, P2: 82, P3: 110). Lead-time analysis: Promised lead time is 2. The P1 order (placed at start of P1) should arrive during P3 and be visible at the start of P4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This means the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed. Since we have 0 on-hand and missed the expected arrival, we are in a stockout. OR recommendation is 0 because the pipeline (254) exceeds the OR's base-stock level (calculated on older, lower demand data). However, with demand now ~100/week and a lead time of 3+ weeks, we need to cover at least 400 units (L+1 demand) in the pipeline. Current pipeline is only 254.

Subtracting the lost P1 leaves a reliable pipeline of 230 units. 2. Inventory & Demand: On-hand is 0. Recent demand (Feb/Mar) has stabilized at a significantly higher regime (~102 units/period) compared to Jan history. The product is a basic T-shirt entering the spring season, so demand will likely remain elevated. 3. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it includes the lost P1 units in its pipeline. By removing the lost 62 units from the pipeline and accounting for (L+1)=3 periods of demand at the new ~102 unit average (Total needed: 306), the current reliable pipeline (230) is insufficient.

This is a clean +200% shift from the Jan baseline (~32). \n4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it sees a massive pipeline (372) against a historical mean that still includes the low Jan values.

Spring demand is typically stable for basic jersey t-shirts. Demand Analysis: Historical data shows a clear regime shift from ~31 in January to an average of ~96 units per week from February through March. This suggests a sustained baseline of approximately 100 units/week. Inventory Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 402 units, consisting of orders from P3 (110 units, very likely lost/overdue), P4 (120 units, overdue), P6 (60 units), and P7 (50 units). Lead Time Inference: Promised LT is 2. We've seen LT=2 (P2) and LT=1 (P5). However, P1, P3, and P4 orders are suspiciously missing. OR Recommendation: The OR baseline suggests 0 units because the pipeline (402) far exceeds the calculated base stock level for a 2-period lead time. Strategy: While the pipeline is technically full, the reliability of that pipeline is extremely low. P3 (110 units) and P4 (120 units) are significantly overdue and likely lost given the erratic delivery history. If we treat P3 and P4 as lost, our effective pipeline is only 110 units (P6 + P7), which covers about one week.

Effectively, only the P8 order (60 units) is in the reliable pipeline. 2. Demand Analysis: Demand has stayed high in the Feb-March regime (~100 units/period). In Period 8 (April 1), demand surged to 190 units, likely reflecting a spring/seasonal spike for t-shirts. On-hand is currently 0. 3. Inventory Reconciliation: Reported In-transit is 352, but after subtracting the 292 lost units, effective pipeline is only 60 units. 4. Strategic Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the inflated 352 in-transit figure. I need to cover demand for Period 9, 10, and 11 (L+1). Expected demand is ~150 units/period (averaging the ~100 baseline with the recent 190 spike). Total target pipeline = 450 units. Adjusted Pipeline (60) - Target (450) = 390 units.

To maintain a safety stock and bridge the gap for the next three periods (P25, P26, P27) while ignoring the 'phantom' pipeline, I need to ensure total reliable supply (On-hand + Reliable In-Transit + New Order) covers approximately 600 units (3 periods * 200 demand).

Adjusting 'In-transit' for these losses leaves a real-world pipeline of 225 units consisting of orders from P40 (50), P41 (200), and P42 (100). The current demand regime for late November/early December is holding steady at approximately 130-140 units per period. With only 15 units currently on-hand and a variable lead time (1-3 periods), the current reliable pipeline (350 units) plus on-hand (15 units) equals 365 units. Covering demand for the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 3 periods) requires approximately 400-420 units to maintain a healthy safety stock. To bridge the gap between reliable inventory (365) and desired stock level (420), I will order 100 units.
