  "rationale": "We are at Period 1. Historical demand for 'Tilly (1)' T-shirt over the last 5 weeks averages 157.4 units (145, 144, 105, 181, 212). There is a slight upward trend in the last two weeks. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt. As it is mid-February, we are approaching the spring season in many markets, which typically sees an increase in basic T-shirt demand. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The OR recommendation is 225 units, based on a base-stock policy. Given that we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, and the lead time is 2 periods (meaning this order will arrive at the start of Period 4), we need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Average demand for 3 periods is approximately 472 units. However, the OR recommendation of 225 seems to be a capped single-period-oriented replenishment. I will increase the order quantity to 240 units to slightly lean into the rising demand trend (212 last week) and prepare for spring seasonality, while acknowledging high holding costs ($1.0 vs $1.0 profit) which discourages over-stocking.",

The order placed in Period 1 (240 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, we have 480 units in transit (Period 1 and Period 2 orders).\n2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand in P1 was 206 and P2 was 239, significantly higher than the initial historical samples (which averaged ~157). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', and the dates (late February) suggest a transition into Spring/Summer demand in the Northern Hemisphere.\n3. OR Recommendation: The OR algorithm suggests 48 units based on historical mean (~157) and L=2. However, the recent demand (206, 239) shows a clear upward trend. Also, since on-hand is 0-sold due to stockouts (we couldn't satisfy P1/P2 demand), we are currently in a backlog of lost sales.\n4. Strategy: I will significantly increase the order relative to the OR recommendation to account for the rising demand regime and the fact that we have zero current stock. While 480 units are in transit, the expected arrival of 240 units in Period 3 (for P4 use) might just barely cover one week of demand at the current rate (~239).

However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. This suggests either a lead time longer than 2 periods or a lost shipment. \n2. Inventory & Pipeline: Currently on-hand is 0. In-transit is 600 units (240 from P1, 240 from P2, 120 from P3). We have missed demand for 3 consecutive weeks (total 795 units lost). \n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand was ~150-200. Recent demand (P1: 206, P2: 239, P3: 350) shows a significant upward trend, possibly due to seasonal transition into Spring for a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey'. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it sees 600 units in the pipeline against a base stock calculation that likely doesn't account for the recent demand surge or the delivery delay. Since we have 0 on-hand and the P1 shipment is late, we are in a critical stockout. Even if the P1 order (240) arrives this period, it won't cover the recent demand of 350. However, with 600 units already in flight, ordering more now risks high holding costs if they all arrive at once.

However, the Period 1 order (240 units) is still missing. Since P2 arrived exactly on time, and P1 (ordered earlier) is not in the 'conclude' message for P4, the P1 order is likely lost. 2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand was ~158, but recent demand (P1-P4) is significantly higher: 206, 239, 350, 260 (Avg = 264). This is a T-shirt ('Tilly'), and we are entering mid-March, likely seeing a seasonal ramp-up for spring/summer basics. 3. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline is 510 units (P1: 240, P3: 120, P4: 150). If P1 is lost, effective pipeline is only 270 units. 4. OR Recommendation: OR suggests 104 units based on L=2 and historical samples. However, OR does not account for the lost P1 shipment or the sustained demand jump to ~260+. With L=2, I need to cover demand for Periods 5, 6, and 7. Expected demand is ~780 units total.

Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order (240 units) is confirmed lost. The P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2).

However, given the P1 loss and P3's failure to arrive at the promised time, pipeline reliability is questionable. Demand Forecast: We are entering late March. The product 'Tilly (1) T-shirt' is a lightweight jersey basic, which sees increasing demand as spring progresses. OR recommends 0 units because its pipeline calculation (860 units, including the lost P1 order) exceeds its base-stock level.

The Period 4 order (150) is still pending at L=3. This indicates extreme lead-time volatility. 2. Demand Analysis: The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt.

Expected demand for lead time L+1 (3 weeks) is ~780 units. With 108 on hand and assuming only P6 (280) is reliable, we are under-stocked.

However, supply chain reliability is extremely poor: P1 (240 units) was lost, and P3 and P4 orders (combined 270 units) are now 3-4 periods overdue. Demand Analysis: The product is a jersey T-shirt (Women's Everyday Basics). The SKU is experiencing a significant demand spike (P7 demand was 448), likely correlated with the onset of Spring/April. Over the last 4 periods, average demand is ~298 units, well above the historical average of 160. Lead Time: Promised L=2, but observed L=1 (P5) and L=2 (P2), alongside multiple delays/losses. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically driven by the 940 units 'in-transit', but it fails to account for the high probability that P3 and P4 orders are lost or indefinitely delayed.

  "rationale": "In Period 9, the SKU '610776001' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a high-demand regime, likely due to spring seasonality (April). Historical demand for the last five periods (P4-P8) has averaged approximately 315 units, with the most recent two periods (P7-P8) spiking to an average of 415 units. The current on-hand inventory is thin at 48 units. The in-transit pipeline totals 760 units, consisting of orders from P1 (240 - confirmed lost), P3 (120 - severely overdue, likely lost), P4 (150 - severely overdue, likely lost), and P8 (250). Since P1, P3, and P4 totals 510 units that have not arrived despite the promised L=2, they must be discounted for planning. The only reliable incoming order is P8 (250 units), expected in P10 or P11. Using a required inventory level for L+1 (3 periods) at a forecasted demand of 350 units/period (reflecting the sustained April surge), I need ~1050 units in the reliable pipeline. Current reliable inventory (On-hand 48 + P8 250) is only 298 units. The OR recommendation of 0 is rejected because it treats all 760 units in-transit as valid, failing to recognize the 510 lost units. To cover the deficit and ensure availability for the late April peak, an order of 400 units is necessary.",

Based on historical data, P3 and P4 are confirmed lost. The 250 units from P8 should arrive during this period (P10), and 400 from P9 in P11. 2. **Demand Analysis**: SKU 610776001 (Jersey T-shirt) is in a high-demand spring regime. Recent demands were 448, 382, and 284. While P9 demand dropped to 284, we were stocked out for most of that period (sold only 48 units), so the actual demand was likely higher, consistent with the ~350-400 average seen in the weeks prior. 3. **OR Recommendation Critique**: The OR recommends 0 units because it strictly subtracts the gross 'In-transit' (1160) from its base stock, not realizing that ~270 units (P3/P4) are lost and the on-hand is currently zero. 4. **Strategy**: I need to ensure coverage for P10 (expected demand ~350), P11 (~350), and P12 (~350). Total needed = 1050. Visible/Reliable pipeline = 250 (P8) + 400 (P9) = 650. Gap = 400 units.

The 'In-transit' figure of 930 includes the 510 units from the lost P1, P3, and P4 orders, which will never arrive.

Effective Pipeline is 420. Total effective inventory = 797 units. With lead time (L) observed between 1-2, we need to cover (L+1) periods, i.e., 3 periods of demand (approx 1,050 units).\n4. **OR Baseline**: The OR recommends 0 because it sees the 'In-transit' as 930 and the 'On-hand' as 377, concluding we have an excess (1,307 units). However, adjusting for lost shipments (510 units), our true position is 797 units.\n5. **Adjustment**: To reach a target stock level of 1,050, I need an additional 253 units. Given the high risk of shipment loss, ordering slightly above this (300 units) provides a buffer against another lost order while maintaining a manageable holding cost risk ($1.0).",

Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt is stable in the high regime (~300-400 units/period) during the current late-May season. Pipeline Analysis: System 'In-transit' shows 1910 units. However, consistent history shows that orders from P1 (240), P3 (120), P4 (150), and now P10 (420) are lost or permanently stalled, totaling 930 lost units. The effective 'live' pipeline consists of orders from P13 (360), P14 (400), and P15 (220), totaling 980 units. Lead-Time Inference: Actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods. The P13 order (360 units), placed 3 periods ago, should have arrived by now if L=2; its absence suggests a delay or potential loss, but for planning, I expect it to arrive in Period 16. OR Recommendation: The OR baseline suggests 0 because it counts the 930 lost units as sitting in the pipeline (In-transit=1910). To cover demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) at an average of 400 units, I need 1200 units. Cumulative 'live' pipeline + on-hand is only 980 units.

The OR recommendation is 0 because it treats the 'In-transit' 2040 as valid, resulting in a perceived surplus.

Current on-hand inventory is 107 units. With an expected demand of ~70-75 units for Period 33, ending inventory would be approximately 32 units, which is slightly below a single period's worth of safety stock but manageable given the downward trend. However, the system reports 2,440 units 'In-transit', all of which are documented in carry-over insights as permanently lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). Therefore, the 'real' pipeline inventory is zero. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, we need enough stock to cover Periods 33, 34, and 35 (L+1). Total demand for this window is estimated at ~210 units (3 * 70). With 107 on-hand and 0 valid units in transit, we face a stockout in Period 34/35 if we do not order. The OR recommendation is 0 because its internal logic (likely using mean demand from the entire history including the summer peak) sees the massive 2440 'In-transit' figure as valid stock.

The system reports 2590 units 'In-transit', but historical Carry-over Insights confirm approximately 2400 of these are permanently lost or inactive (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). The only recently ordered and expected shipment is from P33 (150 units). Lead-time Inference: Arrivals typically occur within 1-2 periods. The P33 order is expected to arrive in P34 or P35. Demand Outlook: We are at the end of September. Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has dropped from summer peaks (350+) to a stable baseline of ~70-75. Protection Logic: If the P33 order arrives in P34, we will have 33 (current) + 150 (new) = 183 units, covering roughly 2.5 periods of demand. If it arrives in P35, we face a stockout in P34 (Demand 72 > On-hand 33). OR Recommendation: OR recommends 0 because it sees the massive (though mostly lost) in-transit volume and uses long-term historical averages which include high-demand periods.

  "rationale": "The SKU 610776001 (Women's Jersey T-shirt) is in a seasonal trough as we approach late November. Historical demand has declined significantly from its spring/summer peak (~400 units) to a current autumn/winter regime of ~25-45 units per period. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 2590 units. Based on long-term tracking of 'conclude' messages, 2550 units are definitively lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, and P34). This leaves only 40 units remaining in the 'In-transit' category that are not already written off (the P21 order was 450 units and arrived in P23, the P22 order was 250 units and arrived in P23, the P23 order was 400 and arrived in P26, the P33 order was 150 and arrived in P36). Checking the math: Total In-transit (2590) - Confirmed Lost (2550) = 40 units actually in the pipeline or unaccounted for. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P41: 25, P40: 30) suggests we need approximately 30-40 units per period. Since there are only 47 periods in the game, we are in the final stretch (6 periods remaining). The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees the massive (but phantom) in-transit total. However, with 0 on-hand and the 'real' active pipeline being negligible or non-existent (no orders placed since P34), we are stocking out.

This leaves a functional pipeline of 280 units (Period 42 order: 120, Period 43 order: 120, plus residual unaccounted units). \n\nLead-Time Inference: Promised lead time is 2. Recent successful arrivals (P33) took 3 periods. The orders from P42 (expected P44) and P43 (expected P45/P46) have not arrived as of P45 start.\n\nDemand Analysis: We are currently in mid-December (2019/12/16). Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) has fallen significantly from its summer peak (~350-450) and autumn levels (~70), now averaging ~20-30 units over the last three periods (P42-P44). \n\nStrategy: While functional in-transit inventory (240 units) is technically sufficient to cover current low demand (30/period) for several weeks, the pipeline reliability is extremely poor. However, the OR recommendation is 0 because the system sees a massive (though mostly lost) pipeline and low demand.
