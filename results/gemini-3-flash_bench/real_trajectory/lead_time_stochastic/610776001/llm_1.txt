Historically, demand from Jan 7th to Feb 4th has averaged 157.4 units (samples: 145, 144, 105, 181, 212), showing a slight upward trend as we move towards spring. The current date is Feb 11th. In many global retail calendars, February marks the beginning of the spring/summer transition, where demand for basic layering pieces like t-shirts typically stabilizes or increases. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover demand from Period 1 (current), Period 2, and Period 3 (when this order arrives), I need enough stock for 3 periods (~158 * 3 = 474 units). Since I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will place a foundational order of 500 units to establish inventory and provide a small buffer for the observed upward trend.",

Therefore, I expect the 500 units to arrive after my Period 3 decision, being available for demand starting in Period 3 resolution. Demand for P2 and P3 must be covered by current and future arrivals. Total demand to cover for (L+1) = 3 periods (P2, P3, P4) is approximately 180 * 3 = 540 units. Since 500 is already in transit and will cover Period 3 and 4, and I currently have 0 on-hand to meet P2 demand (resulting in lost sales this period), I need to ensure subsequent periods are well-stocked.

This indicates a strong upward trend or a higher demand regime than the pre-game samples suggested. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, 0 units are on hand, and we have experienced 3 periods of stockouts due to the lead time gap. The first order (500 units) placed in Period 1 should arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4 (now). However, checking the history: Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. Per the rules, an order placed in P1 with lead_time=2 should arrive in P3 resolution and be seen in 'Period 3 conclude'. Since 'Period 3 conclude' says arrived=0, the order is either delayed or the lead time is longer than 2. Pipeline: P1 (500), P2 (200), P3 (200) = 900 units in transit. Expected Demand: The mean of recent periods is ~265, but the latest (350) suggests a peak. I'll estimate 300-350 per week for the next 3 weeks (L+1). Required inventory for 3 periods = 1050.

I will use ~260 as the base forecast. c) Lead time analysis: P1 (500) is lost. P2 (200) arrived in 2 periods. P3 (200) was ordered P3, expected P5, now P7 start (2 periods overdue), likely lost. P4 (250) was ordered P4, expected P6, now P7 start (1 period overdue), potentially arriving this period or lost. P5 (550) arrived in 1 period (actual lead time = 1).

On-hand inventory is 306. Required inventory to cover P13, P14, and P15 (L+1 coverage, where L=2) at a 350-unit/period rate is 1,050 units. Total pipeline + on-hand is 306 + 750 = 1056.

Even with the historically high shipment loss rate (estimated at ~40%), any single shipment of the remaining pipeline (which includes orders ranging from 150 to 500 units) arriving would more than cover the remaining game demand. Ordering more would only increase the risk of massive holding costs if multiple shipments from the pipeline suddenly arrive. Given the objective to maximize total reward (Profit - Holding Costs), and the fact that holding costs are $1/unit, holding a surplus of 500 units for just one period would wipe out the profit of selling 500 units ($1/unit profit). Therefore, the optimal strategy remains to wait for the existing pipeline to arrive and avoid additional inventory risk.",

There are currently 3,500 units in-transit. Even with the historically high shipment loss rate (approx. 40%), the arrival of even a single one of the large pending shipments (mostly from P19-P24) would result in a massive overstock. Given that the holding cost ($1.00) equals the profit ($1.00), carrying ANY ending inventory at Period 47 is a direct penalty to total reward. Therefore, it is mathematically optimal to place no further orders and hope for a small portion of the 3,500 units in-transit to arrive and cover the final weeks.",

Recent demand (P43-P45) is very low, averaging ~25 units per period. The current game time is Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), meaning we are approaching the final period (47). The SKU has 0 on-hand inventory but a massive in-transit pipeline of 3,500 units. Even with a historical shipment loss rate of ~40%, any arrival from this pipeline (e.g., the 250 units from P24 or 150 units from P26) would vastly exceed the remaining demand for the final two periods. Specifically, even if a small fraction of the 3,500 units arrives, the resulting holding costs ($1.00/unit) would outweigh the profit ($1.00/unit) given the low probability of selling more than ~50 units total across P46 and P47.
