Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans. Initial historical demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show a clear upward trend as the product starts its lifecycle: 0, 0, 14, 52, 121. The most recent sample (121) is significantly higher than the earlier mean, suggesting a growth phase. Given the promised lead time (L=2), we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 360 units if we assume demand stabilizes near the last observed value). Since current inventory is 0 and the product description suggests a fashionable, high-stretch denim item, we should anticipate continued demand momentum. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the most recent growth while filtering some noise, and 'default' for lead time and sigma initially.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' (Ladies Denim). Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 0, 0, 14, 52, 121, and most recently 131 in Period 1. The average of the last 3 samples (52, 121, 131) is 101.3. However, there is a clear growth trajectory. The promised lead time (L) is 2, meaning orders placed today (P2) arrive in P4 (visible in P5). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 152 in-transit (ordered in P1, expected P3). Since we missed all sales in P1 (demand 131, sold 0), we need to set a base stock that accounts for the current high demand regime and the 1+L=3 periods of coverage. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent surge while avoiding over-reliance on a single data point, but I'll lean towards 'explicit' for mu_hat because 'recent_N' might under-forecast given the steep trend. Calculated mu_hat for 3 periods = 3 * ~110 = 330.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Denim', a staple ladies' denim item. Looking at the historical demand samples (0, 0, 14, 52, 121) and the recent game history (P1: 131, P2: 157), there is a clearly established upward trend as the product stabilizes in the market or enters a spring fashion season. Mean demand over the last 3 samples (121, 131, 157) is 136.3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from P1 (152 units) and P2 (181 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3 (and be visible in P4's start). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in P1 and P2. To capture the current demand regime and account for the upward trend, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to project the 136.3 mean over the (L+1) horizon. Sigma is set to default as we need more data points for a stable recent variance, but the default will incorporate the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: starting from 2019-02-04, demand has transitioned from low-single digits to a consistent upward trend (121, 131, 157) averaging 136.3 per period.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a high-waist super skinny jean, which generally experiences stable to slightly increasing demand in early spring. Demand history shows a recent regime shift: starting 2019-02-04, demand units were 121, 131, 157, and 108. The average of these last 4 periods is 129.25. The stock level is currently critical: 0 units on-hand with 508 units in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 (152 units) should arrive during the coming Period 4 (to be visible in Period 5's report). There are no concluded lead times yet to suggest a drift, so I will stick with the promised L=2. To capture the current demand level while accounting for the recent slight dip in Period 3, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will set the base stock to cover demand for (L+1)=3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019-03-11). Analyzing the history: Period 1 (ordered 152) has not yet concluded, while Period 2 (ordered 181) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2). The absence of the P1 order (now in its 4th period of transit) suggests it might be lost or significantly delayed, though we'll monitor one more period before confirming loss. Demand history shows a spike (121, 131, 157) followed by a cooling at 108 and 73. Given we are in mid-March, this product (ladies super-skinny jeans) should maintain steady spring demand.mu_hat calculation: Using the last 5 samples (121, 131, 157, 108, 73), the average is 118. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*118 = 354. However, the OR backend's inventory check (On-hand: 108 + In-transit: 327 = 435) already exceeds this. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent demand levels while allowing the OR logic to naturally throttle orders due to high pipeline inventory. L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead time of 2 from Period 4's arrival.

Carry-over insight: Period 4: Order from Period 1 (152 units) is overdue (4 periods vs 2 promised), potential loss or delay observed.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). Examining the history: the order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2, as promised). However, the order from Period 1 (152 units) is now 5 periods overdue and hasn't appeared in the 'conclude' messages, suggesting it is a lost shipment. The order from Period 3 (175 units) was placed with a promised lead time of 2, so it should have arrived in Period 5; its absence in the Period 5 conclude message indicates it is at least 1 period delayed (actual lead time >= 3) or also lost. Current on-hand inventory is low (36 units) while demand has stabilized after the initial spike, averaging ~72.3 units over the last 3 periods (108, 73, 72). Given the missing/delayed pipeline, the OR engine needs to order to cover the (L+1) window. I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N=3 to capture the post-spike stability. Sigma will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Pipeline instability confirmed. Period 1 order (152 units) remains missing after 5 periods (lost shipment likely). Period 3 order (175 units) is overdue by at least 1 period (lead_time >= 3). Demand has stabilized at ~72 units/period after a Feb peak.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand spike of 93 units in Period 6. The shipment from Period 1 (152 units) is now 6 periods overdue and is officially deemed lost. The shipment from Period 3 (ordered Period 3, now Period 7) is also overdue, as it has not arrived within its promised 2-period lead time (now at lead_time >= 4). However, the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. Given the instability, I will set an explicit lead time of 3 to provide a buffer for the OR engine, reflecting the observed delays. Demand has transitioned from a high February peak (avg ~130) to a more moderate March level. Taking the last 4 samples (73, 72, 93, + the week before) shows a more stable average around 80. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this post-peak demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects current trends rather than the anomalous February surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 1 shipment (152 units) confirmed lost (6 periods late vs 2 promised). Period 3 shipment is overdue (at least 4 periods in transit). Lead time is volatile, averaging > 3 periods for recent successful/pending arrivals.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/01), the inventory situation for SKU 732842002 is critical. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand in Period 7 saw a massive spike to 317 units (previously averaging ~80-100 following the initial peak). This spike coincides with the start of April, potentially related to spring seasonal retail cycles or a promotion for this specific denim SKU. Pipeline reliability is extremely poor: the Period 1 order (152 units) is officially considered lost (7 periods since order); the Period 3 order (175 units) is now 5 periods in transit (3 over promise); the Period 6 (9 units) and Period 7 (40 units) orders are still within expected ranges. Forecast: Given the massive spike in Period 7 (317) and the high volatility, a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 captures the shift toward higher demand better than the full history, while L=3 (explicit) accounts for the observed transit delays. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=3) to prioritize the high recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Massive demand spike (317 units) detected on 2019-03-25. Significant pipeline failure: Order 3 (175 units) is now 5 periods late, confirming lead time instability. Current demand regime is highly volatile.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is an 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' denim product. Current date is 2019-04-08. Demand history shows a massive spike in late March (317 units) followed by a high sustain in early April (199 units), likely due to a seasonal spring fashion transition. The pipeline is severely compromised: Order 1 (152 units) from P1 is confirmed lost. Order 3 (175 units) from P3 is now 6 periods late and must also be considered lost to prevent the OR logic from under-ordering due to phantom 'in-transit' stock. However, orders from P6 and P7 arrived with lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively, suggesting the logistics channel for new orders has recovered even if older shipments are stuck. I will use 'explicit' L=2 to reflect the recent successful arrivals. For demand, the average of the last 4 periods (108, 73, 72, 93, 317, 199) is heavily skewed; focusing on the most recent 3 periods (93, 317, 199) gives a mean of ~203. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*200 = 600 to capture the high spring demand regime. sigma_hat is set explicitly high to account for the extreme volatility observed (317 vs 199).

Carry-over insight: P8/P9 confirmation: Order 1 (P1) and Order 3 (P3) are lost shipments. Lead time for new orders (P6, P7) is stable at 1-2 periods. Demand regime shift confirmed: Spring peak in late March/early April averaging ~200 units/period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the SKU 732842002 is facing significant stockouts due to high demand and historical pipeline losses. Historical demand analysis shows a significant regime shift starting in late March (Period 7-9: 317, 199, 118). While P7 was an outlier spike, the average demand over the last four periods (P6-P9) is approximately 182 units per period. The pipeline is currently recovering; orders from P1 and P3 are officially considered lost, but recent orders from P6 and P7 arrived with lead times of 1 and 2 periods respectively, suggesting the logistics channel has stabilized. There is a large order of 385 units from P8 in-transit, which is expected to arrive this period (P10) or next (P11) assuming L=2. However, with current on-hand inventory at 0 and a high demand environment, mu_hat is set to reflect the most recent demand regime of ~182 units per period (N=4) to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture the spring sales peak while managing the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to weight the recent successful deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for this product (Ladies Denim Trousers) shows a significant peak in late March (Period 7: 317 units, Period 8: 199 units) and is now normalizing (Period 9: 118, Period 10: 82). The average demand over the last 3 periods is approx 133 units. Lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods after earlier lost shipments (P1, P3). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 318 units, with 327 in transit (likely the P10 order if any). Since Profit ($4) is 4x the Holding Cost ($1), the desired service level is 80%. I'll set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual 1-2 period lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the normalization after the March spike while still respecting the higher baseline compared to early February. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to account for the high volatility seen during the peak transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-spring peak (late March) is stabilizing; the average across the last 3 periods (P8-P10) is 133 units, significantly higher than the pre-peak Feb average (~80). Lead time is now consistently 1-2 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for 'Ladies Denim' has shown volatility following a late-March spring peak (317, 199 units) and is now stabilizing. The last three periods (P9-P11) show demand of 118, 82, and 117 units, averaging approximately 106 units per period. This is higher than the early March baseline of ~73, but lower than the peak. Lead times have stabilized following initial pipeline losses (P1, P3); recent arrivals (P6, P7, P8, P9) show lead times of 1-2 periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual recent performance. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the post-peak stability (N=3 because the regime shifted after the 317 spike). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the current demand variance. Currently, on-hand (201) and in-transit (371, likely for orders from P11 and pending larger cycles) are being monitored. Setting mu_hat based on the 106 average ensures the base stock covers (L+1) periods of expected demand (approx 318 units).

Carry-over insight: Post-spring peak stabilization: Demand for mid-late April (P9-P11) has averaged 106 units/period, down from the late March peak of 258 avg but up from the pre-peak Feb/March baseline of ~73.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-06. The SKU is a pair of skinny jeans, which typically has steady demand but experienced a spring peak in late March/early April (P7-P9). Demand has since stabilized. In the last three periods (P10-P12), demand was 82, 117, and 107, averaging 102 units per period. This regime is lower than the peak (~200) but higher than the pre-peak Feb baseline (~73). Lead times for the most recent successful deliveries (P8, P9) were 2 and 1 periods respectively, suggesting the supplier has recovered from the initial pipeline failures (P1 and P3 orders are confirmed lost). Pipeline inventory is currently 371 units (including the large P8 arrival buffer), and on-hand is 94 units. Given the stabilization, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods to capture the current post-peak demand level (~102/period). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the recent return to the 1-2 period lead time range.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Over the last five periods (P9-P13), demand has stabilized significantly, showing values of 118, 82, 117, 107, and 71. This averages to 99 units per period, a clear decrease from the late March peak of 317/199, but higher than the February baseline. The lead time has stabilized at 1-2 periods for all non-lost orders placed since Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 67 and there is nothing in-transit that isn't already accounted for by the most recent arrival (P11 order arrived in P13). There is no pipeline except for the two lost orders from P1 and P3 which are ignored. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this post-peak stabilization at ~100 units/period (total 300 for L+1). Lead time remains at the promised 2 periods (L=2).

Carry-over insight: Post-spring peak demand (May 2019) has stabilized at ~100 units/period, down from the March peak (~250) but higher than February (~75). Lead time performance since P6 is consistent at 1-2 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W' jeans has stabilized in May, following the late-March spring peak. The last four periods (P11-P14) show demand of 117, 107, 71, and 96, averaging 97.75 units per period. This confirms the new steady-state regime of ~100 units noted in the Carry-over Insights. Lead times have remained stable at 1-2 periods since the early pipeline disruptions in March; specifically, recent arrivals from orders P8, P9, and P11 show lead times of 2, 1, and 2 periods respectively. I am setting L to 2 (promised) as it remains the most reliable upper bound for the current stable phase. Mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the May stabilization (~100/period) without being skewed by the March peak. I am currently out of stock (on-hand 0) with a significant pipeline (327 units in-transit), so the OR backend will correctly size future orders against the pipeline to meet the target base stock based on the ~100 units/period forecast.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized following the late March spring peak (~258 units/period in P7-P8). Over the last five periods (P11-P15), demand has averaged approximately 96.6 units (117, 107, 71, 96, 92), indicating a new stable regime. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) because no orders were placed in P12-P15. While there are 327 units in-transit from P1 and P3, these were flagged as lost shipments in previous carry-overs (overdue by 12+ periods), meaning actual pipeline inventory is effectively 0. To restart supply, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (approx 97 units/period) and use recent_N for volatility. Lead time (L) is returned to the promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P8-P13) aligned with a 1-2 period lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. The SKU 732842002 (Ladies Denim) has been out of stock for the last three periods (P14-P16) with 0 on-hand inventory, despite consistent demand averaging 101.6 units over the last 3 samples. The 'In-transit' quantity of 327 units represents an order placed in P16 (not visible in the order history yet but reflected in the pipeline). Recent lead times (P6-P11) have stabilized at 1-2 periods. I will set L to 'default' (2) to align with the promised and recent performance. Demand for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has averaged 96.6 units (107, 71, 96, 92, 117), which is a stable regime for this product post-spring peak. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this stabilization. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent moderate volatility. The current in-transit stock (327) should be sufficient to cover the next few periods once it arrives, but the OR engine will determine if additional units are needed based on the (L+1) horizon.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans has stabilized since mid-May (P14-P17) at a mean of approximately 95 units per period (96, 92, 117, 75). Historically, demand for this item peaked in late March but has since settled into a consistent summer rhythm. There are 327 units currently in-transit, which arrived from a large order placed in a previous period to restock after the spring peak; however, the player did not place orders in P14-P17, leading to a stockout (on-hand is 0). At the start of P18, we expect the pipeline to start arriving. Lead times have normalized to 2 periods for recent successful arrivals. I am setting L to the promised 2 periods. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand during this stable regime, mu_hat is set using the mean of the last 4 periods (95 * 3 = 285). Sigma_hat is calculated similarly from the recent 4 periods to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for June 2019 has stabilized at a lower level (~95 units/period) compared to the March peak (~250 units/period). Stockouts occurred in P15-P17 due to zero orders being placed in P12-P17.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The focus for Period 19 is recovery from a long period (P12-P18) where no orders were placed, resulting in stockouts since P14. The last recorded demand in P18 was 63 units, following a trend in June (P17-P18) of approximately 70 units/period. The Carry-over insight for P18 suggests a demand regime of ~95 units/period for June. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the need to resume supply, I am setting mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at the June average. Using N=5 for recent demand (P14-P18) captures the stabilization around 88 units/period. The lead time (L) is returned to the promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P8-P13) followed a 1-2 period pattern before the ordering hiatus. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=5 period to account for recent volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 732842002 is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and has been stocking out since Period 14 due to a lack of orders between Periods 12 and 19. There are 327 units in-transit, but these appear to be 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (specifically the Period 1 order of 152 units and Period 3 order of 175 units, totaling 327 units), as confirmed by carry-over insights from Period 9. These shipments are now over 15 periods overdue and will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' from the base stock calculation, so as long as these 327 'lost' units remain in the pipeline count, the system will not place new orders despite the stockout. To force an order, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that significantly exceeds the 327 units of 'ghost' inventory. Current demand has stabilized at ~65 units/period (avg of P17-P19 is 64.7). For a target base stock that covers the next (L+1)=3 periods and offsets the 327 'ghost' units, I need a value around 550 ((65 * 3) + 327 + buffer). I will set L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to 550, and sigma_hat to 50 to ensure a robust order is triggered this period to end the stockout.

The SKU '732842002' (Ladies Denim) is currently in a state of high stockout (on-hand: 0) following a prolonged period where no orders were placed (P12-P19). Lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods for recent successful shipments. A massive pipeline of 558 units is currently in-transit (partially due to a large order of 231 units placed in P20, and likely residual overdue orders from P18-19 if any were calculated, or more likely, large orders placed in P20/P21 simulation steps not fully detailed in the history but reflected in the 'In-transit' total). Demand has entered a summer cooling phase, dropping from over 100 units to significantly lower levels (24 units in P20). Given the high pipeline relative to current demand, I will focus on safety coverage without over-ordering. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 1-2 period lead time observed since P8. For mu_hat, I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent sharp decline in demand (96, 92, 117, 75, 63, 56, 24). Choosing N=4 captures the latest deceleration (P17-P20 avg: 54.5) to avoid over-ordering during this seasonal dip. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: July 2019 demand has dropped significantly to ~24 units/period, down from the June average of ~65 and the May average of ~100.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 732842002 is currently in a low-demand regime for July 2019, with recent demand dropping to an average of ~33 units per period (P20: 24, P21: 41), compared to the June average of ~65. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is a significant pipeline of 558 units (231 ordered in P20, others pending). Based on the 2-period promised lead time, the 231 units ordered in P20 are expected to arrive during the current Period 22 resolution phase and will be visible at the start of P23. Given the current demand (approx 33 units/period) and the massive pipeline already in transit (558 units), the pipeline inventory is more than sufficient to cover the next (L+1) periods. No additional order is required. Setting L=2 based on recent stability, mu_hat to 100 (approximately 3 * 33) to reflect the recent demand drop, and sigma_hat to 15 to account for slight volatility in this low-demand state.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' jeans has significantly dropped in July, averaging 36.7 units/period (P20-P22) compared to the June average of ~65 and the May average of ~100. This downward trend suggests a post-seasonality decline for this specific denim SKU. On-hand inventory is 186 units with 327 units in-transit (placed between P1 and P19 but likely includes the replenishment order from P20 which arrived). Looking at the inventory, 186 units on-hand already covers over 5 periods of current demand (186 / 36.7 \u2248 5.07). The pipeline (In-transit: 327) is likely inflated by the P1 and P3 lost shipments which were never resolved in the conclude logs. My goal is to prevent overstocking during this low-demand phase to minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current July low-demand regime (~37/period), and lead time L to 'default' as recent successful deliveries (P20) arrived in the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: July 2019 demand has stabilized at a low level, averaging 36.7 units/period (P20-P22), down ~44% from the June average (~65).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842002' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a significant demand decline in July 2019. Demand for the last four periods (P20-P23) has been 24, 41, 45, and 40, averaging 37.5 units per period. This is a substantial drop from the June average of ~65 units and the May average of ~100 units, indicating a seasonal transition or cooling of the spring/summer peak. With 146 units on hand and 327 in transit (likely P23 order if placed, though game history ends with P23 conclude showing no P23 order), the inventory position is high relative to this new demand level. Promised lead time is 2, and recent actual lead times have stabilized at 2 periods (P20 order arrived in P22). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand regime, mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 4 to capture the July average (~38), which balances against the high pipeline inventory. No order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend given the current surplus.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash' denim has significantly declined from its peak earlier in the year. The most recent three periods (P22-P24) show demand of 45, 40, and 17, averaging 34 units/period. This confirms the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (July demand significantly lower than June). On-hand inventory is 129 units and in-transit is 327 units (which includes previously ordered safety stock or pipeline fill that is now excessive for current demand levels). Total inventory (456 units) covers over 13 periods of the current average demand (34 units/period), far exceeding the (L+1) requirement. Lead times have stabilized at 2 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00) and the current overstock position, the OR parameters must reflect the current low-demand regime to prevent further unnecessary ordering. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current downward trend while smoothing out the very low P24 value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: late July 2019 demand has dropped further, with P24 showing only 17 units, bringing the P22-P24 average down to 34 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash) has shown a significant downward trend during the summer months. Recent demand samples are: P21=41, P22=45, P23=40, P24=17, P25=65. The average of the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is 41.6 units. The inventory position is currently 64 units on-hand with 327 in-transit (reflecting the ordered pipeline). Lead times have stabilized at 2 periods (as seen in the Period 22 arrival of the Period 20 order). Given the lower demand profile in late July/early August, the focus is on preventing overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the recent volatility seen in P25. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (avg ~42) which is significantly lower than the June baseline (~65). L is set to 'default' as recent arrivals confirm the promised 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: August 2019 demand has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 41.6 units/period (P21-P25), representing a significant decrease from June (~65) and May (~100) levels.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 732842002 is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 72 units in Period 26. Since Period 20, a new inventory cycle began after a long period of zero ordering. Historical demand analysis shows a significant recent shift: July and August (Periods 19-26) have seen much lower demand compared to the spring peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 47.8 units/period. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 327) consists of units from the lost Period 1 and Period 3 orders (totaling 327 units). These orders (P1: 152, P3: 175) are more than 23 periods overdue and are confirmed lost in previous insights. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline from the base stock calculation, these 'ghost' units prevent the system from placing new orders while on-hand inventory is empty. To rectify this, I will set 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current lower demand regime (~48 units), and use 'explicit' for L with a high value to force the base stock calculation ( (1+L) * mu ) to exceed the 327 units in the dead pipeline. Setting L=7 with mu_hat around 48 gives a base stock of ~384, which overcomes the 327 units and allows for a fresh order of approximately 50-60 units to replenish the now empty stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842002' (Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash jeans) is currently entering mid-August. Historical demand shows a significant decline in July (averaging ~40 units/period) following a spring peak in March (~250 units) and a moderate June (~65 units). However, the last two periods (P26-P27) have shown a demand increase to 72 and 101 units respectively, suggesting a potential late-summer or back-to-school uptick for denim. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 411 units in-transit (reflecting the lost orders from P1/P3 and more recent placement from P27). Lead times have stabilized at 2 periods since the early disruptions. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5: P23-P27, averaging ~59 units) to capture the recent moderate lift while acknowledging the July slump. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to account for the current demand variability. L is set to default (2 periods) as performance has been reliable recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected: late-August (P26-P27) demand has increased to an average of 86.5 units/period, up from the July average of ~38, likely due to back-to-school seasonality for denim.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842002' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a back-to-school demand surge. Current date is late August (2019-08-26). Demand in Period 27/28 averaged 89 units/period, a significant increase from the July average of ~38. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 411 units in-transit (orders from P27 and likely unrecorded OR-triggered orders during recent stockout periods). Since lead time has stabilized at 2 periods (as seen in Period 22), and we are in a clear upward regime due to seasonality, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P26-P28) to capture this 'back-to-school' level (~83 avg). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased volatility seen during regime shifts. L is set to default (promised 2) as recent arrivals have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed for late August: demand increased from ~38 units (July) to ~89 units (P27-P28).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the midst of a back-to-school demand surge (late August/early September) for denim. Demand in the last three weeks (P27-P29) has averaged 81.3 units, significantly higher than the July average of ~38. The current date (2019/09/02) suggests peak seasonal demand. On-hand inventory is 0. An order of 84 units from P27 is currently overdue (3 periods in transit vs. promised 2), creating a potential stockout. Recent lead times for successful deliveries (P20, P11, P8) have been 1-2 periods, but P27 being overdue suggests a possible shift back to a longer lead time or a slight delay. To cover the current surge and accommodate the 1-period delay in visibility, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the higher back-to-school baseline, and leave the lead time at the default (promised 2) while monitoring the P27 order. The OR engine will use the high sigma from recent volatility to buffer against further demand spikes.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September, following a back-to-school demand surge in August. Historical demand has shifted: Period 26-30 (last 5 periods) shows an average demand of 78.8 units (72, 101, 77, 66, 88), which is a significant increase from the July/early-August lows. The lead time for the most recent order (P27) was 3 periods, slightly longer than the promised 2 periods, suggesting we should maintain a buffer. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 327 units in-transit (part of which is historically 'lost' or very late stock from earlier periods, but the backend OR engine needs our parameters to manage the active pipeline). I will use 'recent_5' for mu_hat to capture the current post-surge stabilization and 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for the recent drift to 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand stabilization: Following the back-to-school surge, demand for P26-P30 has averaged 78.8 units/period. Lead time for recent order (P27) confirmed at 3 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical data shows a back-to-school demand surge in late August (P27-P28), followed by a slight stabilization in September. The last 5 periods (P27-P31) show demand levels of 101, 77, 66, 88, and 65, averaging 79.4 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and there is a massive in-transit volume of 327 units; however, historical records indicate that orders from P1 and P3 were lost, and recently an order from P27 took 3 periods to arrive. Despite the large in-transit figure, the SKU is currently stocking out (sold 0 in P31). We need to maintain a baseline lead time of 2-3 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the post-surge levels and stick with the calculated lead time to account for the recent 3-period arrival.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September (2019/9/23). Historical demand analysis shows a significant back-to-school surge in late August (avg ~89 units), followed by a slight stabilization in early September (P26-P30 avg ~79 units). Most recent demand (P31: 65, P32: 47) suggests a cooling trend as the peak season passes. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but there is a large in-transit volume of 327 units from previous periods (though no orders were recorded in the immediate past history provided, this in-transit likely reflects system-level replenishment or unlisted historical orders). The lead time has been semi-stable but recently showed 3 periods (P27 order arrived P30). I will set L to 3 to be conservative. For demand mu_hat, I will use a 5-period average (P28-P32) which captures the post-peak deceleration (average ~68.6 units/period), resulting in mu_hat = (1+3) * 68.6 = 274.4. sigma_hat will be calculated over the same period to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand deceleration: following the late-August back-to-school peak, demand has trended downward from ~80 units to 47 units by mid-September (P28-P32).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October 2019. Historically, late August saw a 'back-to-school' surge (avg ~89), which then decelerated through September. The last four samples (P30-P33) are 88, 65, 47, and 96, averaging 74 units. While P33 showed a spike to 96, the overall trend is a stabilization lower than the August peak. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 327 units from an unlisted order (likely placed in P33 judging by the 'In-transit' jump from 0 to 327). Promised lead time is 2, but recent actual lead time (P30) was 3. I will set L to 3 to be safe. For demand, I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture the post-surge stabilization (avg ~74). This helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers the 3-period lead time plus the current period, while identifying that the massive P33 order (in-transit) likely already covers immediate needs.

Carry-over insight: September demand (P30-P33) has stabilized at an average of 74 units/period, following the late-August back-to-school peak of ~89.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a post-back-to-school demand phase. Analysis of recent demand (P30-P34: 88, 65, 47, 96, 62) shows a mean of 71.6 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 334 units in the pipeline (including a small order of 7 from P34 and a larger order of 327 from P33/P34 which seems to have been placed in previous steps not explicitly shown as 'ordered' in the history but reflected in 'In-transit'). Lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods but largely stabilized around 2. I will use N=5 for demand parameters to capture the recent stabilization following the September volatility. mu_hat is set to cover the upcoming 3 periods (L+1) based on this recent average (~215 units). The high in-transit balance (334) against this requirement (mu_hat) will likely lead the OR engine to place a zero or minimal order to avoid overstocking while on-hand is zero, awaiting arrivals.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Ladies Denim) has stabilized post the back-to-school peak (late August/early September). In the last 5 periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged 62 units (65, 47, 96, 62, 40), reflecting a downward trend from the late August peak of ~89 units. I am currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. There is a large in-transit volume of 334 units (comprised of 7 units from P34 and presumably significant orders placed in P35 or earlier that haven't concluded yet). Lead times have been mostly 2 periods, with an occasional 3-period outlier (P30). Given the profit/holding ratio (4:1), the target service level is 80%. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stabilization around 62 units per period and use the 'calculate' method for lead time to allow the backend to use the historical average including the recent 3-period observation.

Carry-over insight: October stabilization: Demand for October (P34-P35) has averaged 51 units, continuing the downward normalization from the late-August back-to-school peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand for October (P34-P36) has averaged 50.3 units/period, showing stabilization after the late-August back-to-school peak. Recent demand is consistent: 62 (P34), 40 (P35), 49 (P36). Lead time has been volatile; while promised at 2, the most recent successful arrival in Period 30 took 3 periods. Currently, 334 units are in-transit (orders from P34 and previous periods), and on-hand inventory is 0. Given the high stockout frequency recently, I need to ensure the pipeline covers future demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P32-P36) to capture the current post-peak stabilization level (~58 units/period), and keep L at the promised 2 periods for the OR backend, as recent history shows most orders eventually arrive within 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime (P34-P36) established at ~50 units/period, continuing the downward normalization from the ~89 back-to-school peak.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for October (P34-P37) has settled into a stable regime averaging 53.75 units per period, representing a post-back-to-school normalization. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is a significant pipeline of 334 units in-transit (reflecting orders that have not yet arrived). Lead times have recently shown variance between 1 and 3 periods. Given the target service level (high profit compared to holding cost), I will set the lead time parameter to 3 periods to account for observed instability and use the recent 4-period demand average to define mu_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation covers the lead time plus review period at the current consumption rate.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 732842002 (Ladies Denim) is currently in a stable demand regime following the August back-to-school peak. Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 52.6 units (62, 40, 49, 64, 48), establishing a clear October/early November baseline. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 334 units in-transit (reflecting historical pipeline cleanup, though effectively the recent order P34 was only 7 units). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand regime. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P27, P20) have varied between 2 and 3 periods, and the backend is best positioned to average these observed results.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime: established baseline of ~53 units/period (P34-P38 average: 52.6) following the dissipation of the August back-to-school surge.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with 334 units in-transit (orders from P34 and potentially earlier pending ones, though P34 was small). Demand in November (P39) dropped to 18 units, reinforcing the downward stabilization trend from the October baseline (~53). The current demand regime (P34-P39) averages ~47 units per period. Lead times have been volatile but generally settle at 2-3 periods for successful arrivals. Given the significant 'In-transit' quantity (334 units) relative to the current low demand regime (~47/period), further ordering is not required as the pipeline covers over 7 periods of demand. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to reflect this established November stabilization and downward shift. sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to account for the reduction in volatility compared to the back-to-school surge.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime shift: Mid-November (P39) shows a further drop to 18 units, bringing the P34-P39 average to 46.8 units/period, confirming the post-school peak cooling trend continues.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842002' (Ladies Denim) is currently in a downward demand trend following the August back-to-school peak. Recent demand (P39-P40) has dropped to an average of 22.5 units, which is significantly lower than the P34-P40 average of 44 units. The inventory position is critical: on-hand is 0, but there is a large in-transit pipeline of 334 units (ordered in recent periods but not yet arrived). Although the promised lead time is 2, historical data shows arrivals often take 1-3 periods. Since the current in-transit (334) already covers over 7 periods of recent average demand (~44 units), the OR engine should not place additional orders at this time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the post-September cooling trend (~44 units/period), and L='calculate' to account for historical lead time variability. This will result in a base stock level that the current pipeline already significantly exceeds, effectively pausing new procurement while we wait for arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Post-back-to-school demand normalization: November demand (P39-P40) has dropped to an average of 22.5 units, continuing the cooling trend from the October average of ~51 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '732842002' (Ladies Denim) is in a late November cooling phase, with demand significantly dropping from the October average of ~50 to a recent 3-period average of 26 units (P39-P41). This matches the 'Post-back-to-school normalization' observed in the carry-over insights. Currently, there is an 'In-transit' balance of 334 units. While the game history shows orders from P34 and older, the 'In-transit' total reported in the status (334) likely accounts for recent bulk replenishment orders not explicitly listed in the 'ordered' snippets of the history, or backlog clearing. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is low (~26 units), this 334-unit pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods of the simulation (ending Period 47). Increasing mu_hat or sigma_hat would trigger unnecessary orders given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the already excessive pipeline. I am setting L to 2 (promised) and using recent_N for mu_hat (N=3) to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend sees no gap to fill.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-12-02. We are entering the holiday season for ladies' denim. Historical demand shows a downward trend post-August back-to-school peak, with November (P39-P42) averaging ~35 units/period. However, December usually brings a seasonal uptick in retail. The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have a massive in-transit pipeline of 334 units (likely including several overdue or lost orders from earlier periods, though recent actual lead times have stabilized around 2-3 periods). Given the game ends in Period 47, we have 5 periods remaining. To avoid stockouts during any potential December surge while accounting for the high holding cost ($1 vs $4 profit), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current baseline of ~35, while allowing for a slightly higher service level implicitly through sigma. Setting L to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (since P20) have aligned closer to the promised 2 periods (avg ~2.3).

Carry-over insight: December seasonality check: Entering final 5 periods of the year. November demand stabilized at a lower baseline of ~35 units/period (P39-P42) after a long cooling trend from the August peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the final 4 periods of the year. Demand has cooled significantly since the August back-to-school peak, with the last 5 periods (P39-P43) averaging 32.6 units/period. The current 'In-transit' quantity is 334 units, but a critical audit of the history shows this is composed entirely of lost shipments from early in the year: Period 1 (152), Period 3 (175), and Period 34 (7). These orders are 43, 41, and 10 periods old respectively, and will never arrive. On-hand inventory is 0. Since the game ends in Period 47, we need to cover demand for Periods 44, 45, 46, and 47. Based on the established low-demand regime for late Q4, I will set mu_hat using the recent 5-period average (approx 32.6) to prevent excessive ordering, as there are only 4 periods of demand left. I use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture this end-of-year baseline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Audit P44: In-transit balance (334 units) is invalid; consists of lost shipments from P1 (152), P3 (175), and P34 (7). Net pipeline is 0.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 47, specifically December 16, 2019. The game is nearing its end (3 periods remaining). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the net pipeline is also 0 (the 'In-transit' balance of 334 units consists entirely of known lost shipments from P1, P3, and P34). Current demand has stabilized at a lower baseline following a significant cooling trend since the August back-to-school peak. Recent demand (P41-P44) has averaged 37.25 units per period. Given the game ends in Period 47, an order placed now in P45 with a promised lead time of 2 will arrive in Period 47 resolution phase, meaning it can only satisfy P47 demand. However, inventory held at the end of P47 incurs a final holding cost. To maximize profit, I will aim for a base stock that covers the remaining demand (P45, P46, P47) while accounting for the fact that the arrival only occurs at the very end. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current stable November/December baseline (~32.3 units/period).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), approaching the end of the simulation (total 47 periods). The current demand regime for late November and December (P40-P45) has stabilized at an average of 35.3 units/period (27, 33, 62, 23, 31, 36). As the game ends at Period 47, any order placed now (L=2) would arrive in Period 48, which is beyond the game horizon. Thus, the optimal move is to place no new orders to avoid ending inventory holding costs and wasted capital, especially since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the internal 'in-transit' count (334) consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, and P34 (as noted in Carry-Over Insights). I will set L to 2 and mu_hat to a minimal value to ensure the OR engine does not trigger an order for a period that won't be resolved.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The game ends at Period 47 (2019/12/30). Since this is the final period, the system will resolve the arriving inventory and demand for Period 47 after this decision. However, any order placed now (Period 47) would not arrive until at least Period 48 or 49, which are beyond the simulation's scope. Therefore, no new orders should be placed to avoid unnecessary holding costs for inventory that can never be sold. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is effectively 0 (confirmed lost shipments). I will set the lead time to its promised value and use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat with a value of 0 to ensure the OR backend does not generate a purchase order for the terminal period.
