The product is a women's basic V-neck T-shirt, which is a stable 'Everyday Basic' item. The current date is Feb 11th. There is no immediate major holiday surge expected for this specific basic item in mid-February, though spring transition might see a slight uptick.\n3. OR Recommendation Evaluation: The OR agent recommends 53 units based on a base-stock policy. Since on-hand and in-transit are zero, this recommendation aims to establish the initial pipeline. The formula accounts for demand over (L+1) periods (3 periods). 3 * 34 = 102 units, but the OR cap is applying here to smooth the initial order.\n4.

Since they haven't arrived yet (visible in Period 1 conclude as arrived=0), and the lead time is 2, I expect them to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. 2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are {51, 30, 35, 39, 25}, with a mean of 36. Period 1 saw a demand of 53, which is significantly higher than the average. This SKU is a 'V-neck T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics), which typically sees increased demand as spring approaches (February). 3. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Units in-transit are 53 (from P1). Per the (L+1) rule, I need to cover demand for Periods 2, 3, and 4 before the next order (placed now in P2) arrives in Period 4. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 58 units based on historical data. However, the OR does not account for the Period 1 stockout (sold=0 due to 0 inventory). 5. Strategy: I will follow the OR recommendation of 58. Total pipeline will be 53 (P1) + 58 (P2) = 111.

Observed demand in P1 (53) and P2 (93) shows a significant upward trend, likely due to seasonal transition into spring for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. The OR recommendation of 29 units seems too conservative as it likely relies heavily on the older, lower demand samples and hasn't fully weighted the recent surge (93 units in P2). 4.

Product is a basic T-shirt, which typically has stable or increasing demand as spring approaches in March. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is likely due to the high pipeline (176) relative to its lower historical demand estimate. However, since no stock has arrived yet and demand has doubled, I need to ensure future coverage. I will place a moderate order to account for the new demand mean (~76) while waiting for the pipeline to clear.

Historical mean was ~36, but the last four periods show: 53, 93, 83, 121 (avg: 87.5). Demand is trending sharply upward as we move into March (spring/summer seasonality).\n3.

Strategy: OR recommends 0 because it doesn't account for the lost P1 order and underestimates demand by looking at older historical data (2019-01). To cover a lead time of 2 + 1 decision period (3 periods total) at an estimated demand of 110/period, we need ~330 units in the system.

The original samples averaged 35 units. Current history shows demand of 53, 93, 83, 121, and 270. This reflects a massive regime shift far exceeding the initial data. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt', and the date is mid-March, suggesting a spring/summer seasonal ramp-up.

P3 (65 units) and P4 (60 units) should arrive in Period 7 (now) or 8. P6 (150 units) should arrive in Period 8 or 9.

If the 300 units from P8 arrive as expected within 1-2 periods, the total available supply will be 594-772 units. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR baseline suggests 0 units because the current pipeline + on-hand (772 total) is interpreted as exceeding the base-stock level derived from historical averages. Given the recent demand drop to 136 and the high pipeline, ordering more now risks high holding costs if the P8 order (300) arrives on schedule.

Recalculating pipeline: P1(53), P3(65), and P4(60) are definitely lost (total 178). Subtracting these from 'In-transit' 478 leaves a real pipeline of 300 (the P8 order). 5.

This is a decrease from the March peak (~260) but significantly higher than the initial base (~40).

Subtracting the 178 lost units, the functional pipeline is 75 units (comprising P10: 50 units and P13: 25 units). Both P10 and P13 are significantly overdue (P10 was placed 7 periods ago), suggesting these may also be lost or severely delayed. \n2. Demand Analysis: Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt' peaked in March (P5: 270) and has since cooled and stabilized. Recent demand (P13-P16) is 42, 50, 60, 56, averaging ~52 units/period. \n3. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 98 units, which covers nearly 2 periods of current average demand. \n4. Decision: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees high on-hand and a large (though mostly lost) pipeline. Given that the entire functional pipeline (75 units) is overdue and likely lost, the current 98 units on hand is the only reliable stock. However, since the current inventory covers 2 periods and demand is low, a large order is not yet necessary.

Demand analysis shows a massive spike in March (peaking at 270) followed by a stabilization/cooldown in May (averaging ~52 over P13-P16). However, Period 17 saw a sharp increase to 116 units, depleting all on-hand inventory. This indicates a potential secondary summer peak or 'summer basics' surge. Inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 283 units, but a deep audit reveals high risk: P1(53), P3(65), P4(60), P10(50), and P13(25) are all significantly past their promised 2-period lead time and are likely lost (Total lost: 253). The only reliable 'live' pipeline is from Period 17 (30 units). The OR Recommendation of 38 units is based on historical averages (including the March spike), but since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the OR's target stock level is relatively conservative. Given the recent stockout and the jump to 116 units in Period 17, I need to order enough to satisfy demand for the next 3 periods (L+1). Assuming demand remains elevated at ~100-110 units/period, I need ~330 units in the system.

The 'In-transit' of 583 units contains a significant amount of contaminated data. Based on Carry-Over insights, historical losses (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) total 253 units.

The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the unadjusted pipeline of 583 units. However, given demand is ~125/period and the promised lead time L=2, a safe base stock level is approx. 375 units (3 periods of demand). With a functional pipeline of 330 and 42 on hand (Total 372), the stock level is nearly perfect.

The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically flawed for this context because it's based on an inflated 'In-transit' figure of 863 units.

However, the P29 order (50 units) is now 5 periods overdue, confirming it as lost. We must rely on the more recent orders from P32 onwards.\n\n2. **Pipeline Reconciliation**: Reported In-transit is 1363 units. Based on historical tracking and carry-over insights, the following are confirmed/highly likely lost: P1(53), P3(65), P4(60), P10(50), P13(25), P17(30), P19(150), P24(280), P26(150), P27(150-partial?), P29(50). Calculating total lost: 53+65+60+50+25+30+150+280+150+150+50 = 1063 units. Functional pipeline = Total (1363) - Lost (1063) = 300 units (Orders from P32, P33, P34). \n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Late September (P31-P33) saw demand around 140-166. P34 saw a dip to 46. As an 'Everyday Basic' T-shirt, demand is relatively stable but may see volatility. Average recent demand is approximately 130 per period.\n\n4. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 4. Functional pipeline is 300 (P32, P33, P34). We need to cover demand for the lead time (2) + review period (1) = 3 periods. Estimated demand for 3 periods = 130 * 3 = 390 units. Current functional position = 4 (on-hand) + 300 (pipeline) = 304. Gap = 390 - 304 = 86 units.\n\n5. **Adjustment**: The OR agent recommends 0 because it likely counts the entire 1363 in-transit as valid. Since 1063 units are lost, I must override.

Additionally, the P34 order (150 units) is now 7 periods overdue and almost certainly lost. This leaves a functional pipeline of 150 units from P39 and 100 units from P40. Total functional stock (on-hand + functional pipeline) is 351 units. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has stabilized between 50-100 units (averaging ~75 over the last 5 periods). 351 units covers approximately 4.5 periods of demand at current levels. Lead-time Inference: Actual lead times remain volatile but generally range 1-3 periods. Since current functional inventory covers the lead-time window and the OR recommendation is 0 (due to high on-hand relative to recent low demand), staying close to the baseline is prudent. However, to hedge against the frequent shipment losses observed in this SKU, a small maintenance order is justified to keep the functional pipeline active.",

Demand over the last five periods (P37-P41) has been 83, 101, 51, 79, and 64, averaging approximately 76 units per period.

The current functional pipeline consists of orders from P40 (100 units) and P41 (50 units), totaling 150 units. Therefore, the total current and expected availability is 187 (on-hand) + 150 (functional pipeline) = 337 units. This covers roughly 4.4 periods of demand at the current average rate. Given the game ends in Period 47 (6 periods remaining), and the lead time is often 2-3 periods, we have sufficient stock for the next few weeks.

History shows that Period 40's order (lead time 2-3) should arrive in either Period 42 (didn't happen) or Period 43. Recent demand (P42: 134) suggests a seasonal uptick potentially linked to early December shopping/winter basics, even though this is a V-neck T-shirt. Using a 3-period lead time assumption for safety (L=2 promised), I need enough stock to cover Periods 43, 44, and 45. Average demand over the last 4 periods is ~82, but the most recent spike to 134 requires a buffer. Total required stock for 3 periods at ~100 units/period = 300 units.

However, even ignoring the in-transit units, the current on-hand inventory of 164 units is more than sufficient to cover the remaining two periods (P45, P46) given the current demand trend of <30 units per period.
