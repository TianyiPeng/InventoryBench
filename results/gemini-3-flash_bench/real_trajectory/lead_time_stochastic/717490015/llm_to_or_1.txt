Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). This is a 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks ranges from 32 to 55, with an average of 44 and a standard deviation of 9.77. Since this is the first period of our decision-making, we have no observed arrivals to verify lead time drift, so we will use the promised lead time of 2. For demand, the available 5 samples represent the most recent relevant regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent behavior for both mean and volatility, ensuring we cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 62 units (promised lead time L=2). As expected for L=2, the order has not arrived yet (it should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 62 units in-transit. The demand in Period 1 was 41, which is within the range of the provided historical samples (32-55). Given the item is a basic jersey T-shirt, we expect stable demand. Since we missed 41 units of sales due to zero starting inventory, we must ensure we cover the lead time (L) plus the review period (1). Based on the 5 historical samples provided [54, 36, 43, 32, 55] and the Period 1 demand of 41, the mean demand is approx 43.5. With L=2, mu_hat should target (1+2)*43.5 = 130.5. I will use 'default' or 'recent_N' to allow the backend to calculate from the sample pool.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt). Looking at historical demand (samples + P1 & P2), the sequence is 54, 36, 43, 32, 55 (pre-game) followed by 41 and 73 (game periods). This suggests a mean demand around 48 units. However, we have experienced 100% lost sales in P1 and P2 because on-hand inventory was 0. Promised lead time is 2, so the P1 order (62 units) is expected to arrive during P3 resolution (visible at the start of P4). The pipeline inventory is currently 121 (62 from P1 + 59 from P2). Given the recent spike to 73 in P2, I will use a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 based on the last 5 samples (approx 48.8 per week) to ensure the base stock calculation covers future demand while we wait for arrivals to materialize. L is kept at default (promised 2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The SKU is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), which typically sees rising demand as spring approaches. Historical demand samples (late Jan/early Feb) averaged ~44 units, but current game history (Feb 11 - Feb 25) shows a significant upward trend: 41, 73, and 82 units. The mean demand over the last 3 periods is 65.3, compared to the initial samples mean of 44. This suggests a seasonal regime shift or growth. Regarding supply, the promised lead time is 2 periods. Order 1 (placed P1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 resolution and be visible now (P4 start). However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests either a lead time delay (L=3+) or a lost shipment. Given that no arrivals have been recorded yet, I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to account for the delay and use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent demand surge. Sigma_hat remains 'default' to capture the overall volatility including the recent spike.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). Item 717490015 is a basic jersey t-shirt. Historical data (Jan-Feb) showed demand avg ~44. However, Period 1-4 demand values are 41, 73, 82, and 50 (avg 61.5). There is a clear upward shift in demand likely transitioning into spring. Looking at the history, the order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2). The order from Period 1 (62 units) has not concluded yet but should have arrived in Period 3 (if L=2). Since it hasn't appeared in a 'conclude' message after 4 periods, it might be lost or delayed. We have 9 units on hand and 228 in-transit (Orders from P1, P3, P4). To be safe, I will estimate mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the higher recent demand (avg 61.5 * (1+L)), and set L to calculate based on the observed arrival in P4. Sigma will reflect this recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 11 (Period 1): demand increased from Jan average of 44 to Feb/March average of 61.5 (+40%).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt). Demand history shows a shift from a mean of ~44 (Jan) to ~61 (since Feb 11). Period 5 saw a demand of 50, but we were stock-out limited (sold 9 of 50). We currently have 0 on-hand and 231 in-transit. Lead time reconciliation: The P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2). The P1 order (62 units) has NOT arrived as of P5 conclude; it is now 3 periods overdue (expected in P3), suggesting it is lost. The P3 order (71 units) was expected in P5 but hasn't arrived; we will monitor if it arrives in P6. Because the P1 order is likely lost and we are at zero stock, the OR backend needs to maintain a target that accounts for this gap. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~59) and sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. L is set to 'default' (2) as the P2 shipment confirmed the promised lead time, even if other shipments are delayed/lost.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment likely: Period 1 order (62 units) failed to arrive by Period 5 (L=2 promised).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 analysis: The product is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), which typically enters peak demand periods as spring approaches. Historical data shows a mean demand increase from Jan (avg ~41) to the Feb-March period (avg ~62). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The Period 1 order (62 units) is confirmed lost, as it is 4 periods overdue. However, Period 5 arrived early (L=1 instead of L=2) and Period 2 arrived on time (L=2). This indicates lead time is volatile but generally around the promised L=2. To compensate for the lost Period 1 shipment and the recent demand spike (76 in Period 6), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the higher spring demand regime. 'L' is set to default (2) as recent arrivals (P2 and P5) suggest the system still functions close to L=2, despite the one lost shipment. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to account for the increased volatility observed in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility: Period 1 order (62 units) lost; Period 5 order arrived early (L=1). Default L=2 remains the best anchor but requires safety stock buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: April 1. Demand analysis: Demand has surged significantly in March, with the last period (P7) reaching 91 units. The average demand since Period 1 (the start of the new regime) is approx 66.2 units, but the last 4 periods average 66.75 with a peak of 91, suggesting an upward trend for this 'H&M Divided' basic tee as spring begins. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand is 0. In-transit consists of orders from P3 (71), P4 (95), P6 (0), and P7 (7). The P1 order is confirmed lost. P2 arrived in P4 (L=2). P5 arrived in P6 (L=1). The P3 order (ordered P3, L=2 promised) should have arrived in P5 or P6 but is now 2 periods overdue, suggesting another lost shipment or severe delay. Given the 'out of stock' status and rising seasonal demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the recent high demand (avg ~67), scaled by (1+L=3). Sigma_hat is set explicitly higher to provide a safety buffer against lead time volatility and stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand regime: March demand averaged 66.75 (+50% vs Jan baseline), peaking at 91 in late March. Significant lead time instability: P1 order lost, P3 order currently 2 periods overdue.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this Jersey Basic T-shirt (717490015) has shifted to a higher regime since February, with the last 8 periods averaging 66.3 units, significantly higher than the initial January average of 44. Recent periods show high volatility (std ~14 during this period). Lead time is extremely unstable: P1 (62 units) and P3 (71 units) orders appear lost as they are many weeks past the promised L=2. Conversely, P5 and P7 orders arrived in just 1 period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 268, but 133 of those are the likely lost P1 and P3 orders, leaving a 'real' pipeline of ~135 units (from P4, P8). Setting mu_hat to explicitly cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at the new average of ~67 (Total 201) to ensure the backend orders enough to bridge the current stockout and account for the high demand. Choosing recent_N for sigma to capture the high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of orders from Period 1 and Period 3 (Total 133 units). Actual lead time for successful arrivals oscillates between 1 and 2 periods, but pipeline reliability is low.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), the SKU 717490015 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is facing a critical stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand has shifted from a January baseline of ~44 to a sustained February/March average of ~63, with a peak of 91. The current date is mid-April, which typically begins the spring/summer T-shirt season. We have confirmed the loss of orders from P1 (62 units) and P3 (71 units), totaling 133 units that will never arrive. Although the promised lead time is 2, actual successful arrivals (P2, P5, P7) have shown lead times of 2, 1, and 1 respectively. This suggests the supply chain is erratic but generally around 1-2 periods for successful shipments. I am setting L to the prometed 2 periods to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation covers the necessary window. For demand, I'm using recent_N (N=9, covering the February surge onwards) to capture the higher mean of ~65. This should trigger an order to refill the depleted pipeline and account for the lost stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490015 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime in April, with demand averaging approximately 64 units over the last 5 periods (P6-P10). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and shipments from Period 1 (62 units) and Period 3 (71 units) are now confirmed lost as they are significantly beyond the promised lead time of 2. Recent successful arrivals show lead times of 1 and 2 periods (P7 arrived in 1, P8 arrived in 2). Given the 0 on-hand inventory and the pattern of lost orders, I must set the OR parameters to ensure the replenishment covers the expected demand for the review and lead time periods (L+1 = 3 periods). Using recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation captures the current spring seasonality/high-demand regime better than the long-term history. I will maintain L at the default (promised 2) but the OR engine's high service level (based on 19:1 Profit-to-Holding ratio) will provide the necessary safety stock buffer to handle the lead time volatility and stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Continued high-demand regime throughout April (P6-P10 avg: 71.8 units). Lead time remains volatile (1-2 periods) and reliability of the pipeline is challenged by the permanent loss of P1 and P3 orders (total 133 units).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we continue to experience a high-demand regime for the 'Cat Tee' T-shirt, which is typical for the spring-to-summer transition. Demand since Period 1 has averaged approximately 67 units per period, significantly higher than the January baseline (44). Lead time remains volatile between 1 and 2 periods, but the primary constraint has been the permanent loss of orders from P1 (62 units) and P3 (71 units), totaling 133 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 252 units includes the 133 lost units plus 119 active units (P4: 95, P11: 24). The P4 order is extremely overdue and likely lost as well, meaning our effective pipeline is much lower than 252. To restore inventory and maintain service levels during this high-demand spring period, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 210 (3 periods * 70 units/period) and use an explicit sigma_hat of 26 to account for demand volatility and lead time instability, essentially forcing the OR backend to place larger replenishments to compensate for the unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Pipeline reliability remains critical; P4 order (95 units) is now 8 periods past its order date and 6 periods past promised lead time, making it highly likely to be lost. Effective pipeline is likely only the P11 order (24 units).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490015' (Cat Tee) is in a high-demand regime, with demand consistently averaging ~72 units over the last 7 periods (P6-P12). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and a stated in-transit pipeline of 253 units. However, history strongly suggests significant pipeline losses: orders from Period 1 (62), Period 3 (71), and Period 4 (95) are 12, 10, and 9 periods old respectively, and since the promised lead time is 2, these 228 units are effectively lost. The only reliable units in transit are from Period 11 (24) and Period 12 (1). This leaves us nearly stockless against a high-demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current 71.8 unit demand average, and set L to 'default' (2) as arrivals continue to oscillate between 1 and 2 periods when they do arrive. Setting a high sigma_hat via 'recent_N' is necessary to build a safety buffer against the high risk of further shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Pipeline loss confirmed for P4 order (95 units); combined with P1 and P3, total lost units are 228. Effective in-transit pipeline is only 25 units (P11 & P12). demand remains steady at ~72 units/period.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490015 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a high-demand regime, with May 6th (Period 13) showing a demand dip to 26, likely due to a localized stockout or reporting artifact, as April averaged over 70 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline of 232 units is heavily skewed by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from Period 1 (62), Period 3 (71), and Period 4 (95) are confirmed lost (total 228 units). The 'effective' pipeline is only 4 units (P12 order of 1 and P13 order of 3). To recover from the massive stockout and compensate for the OR backend's inability to recognize that 228 units of the pipeline will never arrive, I must significantly inflate the mu_hat parameter using the 'explicit' method. I estimate the target base stock needs to cover 3 periods (L+1) at a mean demand of ~72, which is 216 units. However, because the backend subtracts the (mostly dead) pipeline of 232 units, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the cap and force an order that replenishes the shelf, effectively 'writing off' the phantom inventory in the pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed phantom inventory in pipeline totals 228 units (P1, P3, P4). Real-world on-hand remains 0. Demand regime remains stabilized around 72 units/period despite the Period 13 outlier.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are managing a T-shirt SKU with significant pipeline reliability issues. History confirms that orders from Periods 1 (62), 3 (71), and 4 (95) are lost, totaling 228 units of 'phantom inventory' in the reported In-transit figure (413). After subtracting these losses, the actual effective in-transit quantity is 185 units (from orders at Periods 13 and 14). Demand has stabilized after an April peak, with the last two periods averaging 33 units (Period 13: 26, Period 14: 40). However, the broader regime since March still suggests a mean closer to 60-70 units for safety. Lead times for successful arrivals are consistently 1-2 periods. To clear the phantom inventory and force the backend to place necessary orders, I am using an 'explicit' L to calculate the correct base stock while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable period before the recent May dip to ensure we don't under-order if the dip was temporary.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed phantom inventory remains at 228 units (P1, P3, P4). May demand (P13, P14) shows a sharp decline to avg 33 compared to the March/April average of 72. Evaluating if this is a seasonal shift or temporary volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 context: Demand has shown significant volatility in May. After a drop to 26 and 40 (Periods 13-14), Period 15 spiked back to 72. This confirms that the high-demand regime (~70/period) discovered in Period 11 is likely persistent despite short-term fluctuations. The pipeline currently shows 413 units 'In-transit', but history confirms 228 units are phantom inventory (Lost Period 1, 3, 4 orders). Excluding these, the real pipeline contains 185 units (P13 order of 3, P14 order of 182). P13 is now overdue or arriving this period. The product is a jersey t-shirt, which should remain in demand through the summer months. Given the persistent stockouts and high phantom inventory, I will maintain lead time L at 2 (promised) to avoid order capping and set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the stabilized average of approx 60 units/period (adjusted for transition from spring to summer), while increasing sigma_hat to account for recent high demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed demand rebound to 72 units; high-demand regime (avg ~60-70) persists despite low May outliers. Total phantom inventory remains 228 units (P1, P3, P4).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand analysis shows that after a brief dip in early May, demand has stabilized back to a high regime averaging 66.5 over the last two periods (72, 61), following the broader March/April average of ~71. Leads times for successful orders (P11, P12) were consistent at 2 periods. However, the system is fundamentally plagued by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that will never arrive but remain in the Backend's 'in-transit' calculation. Specifically: P1 (62), P3 (71), and P4 (95) are lost, totaling 228 units. The 'In-transit' count of 413 units includes these 228 phantom units plus the P14 order of 182 units (which is now 1 period past its promised delivery and should arrive in the next conclude message). Subtracting the 228 phantom units, the 'real' pipeline is roughly 185 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 413 units from its base_stock calculation, it will likely order 0. To force the backend to place an order and replenish the actual on-hand inventory (which is 0), I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that offsets the phantom 228 units. Calculation: (1+L)*E[Demand] + Phantom = (1+2)*65 + 228 = 195 + 228 = 423. This ensures the backend sees a required stock level higher than the 413 units in transit, triggering a necessary replenishment order for the high-demand summer season.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18 (June 10), we are managing a T-shirt SKU. On-hand inventory is 0. History reveals significant pipeline reliability issues: orders from P1 (62), P3 (71), and P4 (95) are lost, totaling 228 units of 'phantom inventory'. The current total In-Transit is 488; after subtracting the 228 lost units, the active pipeline is 260 units (P13: 3, P14: 182, P17: 75). Demand recently shifted from an April average of ~75 to a lower May/June average of ~54 (P13-P17: 26, 40, 72, 61, 42). To compensate for the 228 units that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive, I must increase the base stock (via mu_hat) to force an order. Demand over (L+1) periods (3 periods) at the recent average of 54 is ~162. Adding back the 228 lost units to the base stock calculation targets a base stock of ~390. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set this target (390) and L=2 to reflect the promised lead time, which remains the best baseline despite individual losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Seasonal demand softening confirmed: June demand average dropped to 54 units compared to the March/April average of 75 units. Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains confirmed at 228 units (P1, P3, P4).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). June demand has softened significantly (periods 17-18 avg: 39.5) compared to the March/April peak of ~75. Total 'In-transit' is reported as 488; however, carry-over insights confirm that orders from P1 (62), P3 (71), and P4 (95) are lost, totaling 228 units of 'phantom inventory'. Subtracting these, the real pipeline is 260 units (comprising P13 (3), P14 (182), and P17 (75)). With a promised lead time of 2, P13 and P14 are already overdue. To account for this supply chain instability and the current demand softening, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to acknowledge the average arrival delay. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current 40-50 units/period demand regime while ignoring the higher April peaks. sigma_hat is also calculated via recent_N (N=4) to reflect current volatility levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand softening continued into mid-June; avg demand for P17-P18 is 39.5, confirming a clear drop from the Spring high-demand regime of 70+. Phantom inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P4) remains at 228 units; actual effective pipeline is 260 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Historical data and recent observations show a seasonal softening in demand for this item (Jersey T-shirt) entering the summer months. Demand for the last 3 periods (P17-P19) averaged 47.3 units, compared to the spring average of ~70. Crucially, the system reports an In-transit pipeline of 488 units. However, based on the historical pattern of lost orders (P1, P3, and P4 totaling 228 units) as documented in carry-over insights, this pipeline is inflated. The true 'live' pipeline consists of orders from P13 (3 units), P14 (182 units), and P17 (75 units), totaling 260 units. Since 260 units is significantly higher than the base stock required for the current demand regime (Forecast ~47 units/period, L=2 means base stock should be around 160-180 units), no new orders should be placed. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the lower summer demand level and 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for the volatility between 1 and 2 periods. The OR engine's cap and the existing pipeline will naturally result in a zero order until the excess is cleared.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 21 (2019/07/01). Demand remains in a stabilized summer regime, averaging 56.6 units over the last 5 periods (P16-P20). The inventory situation is critical because of massive pipeline distortion: the 'In-transit' figure of 488 units includes 228 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 62, P3: 71, P4: 95) that will never arrive. The remaining 260 units represent real orders (P13: 3, P14: 182, P17: 75) that are now significantly overdue (P14, 182 units, is 7 periods old). History suggests that when orders exceed 6 periods past their lead time, they are lost. If P14 is also lost, the true pipeline is only 75 units (from P17). To force the OR engine to order despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting L to 1 to reduce the lookback window of the pipeline calculation and utilizing recent demand (N=5) to reflect the slight softening from the Spring peak while still maintaining a high enough stock target to capture sales once shipments arrive. The z-score (~1.65 for q=0.95) will provide necessary safety buffer against lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: High probability that P14 (182 units) is also lost, which would bring total lost 'phantom' inventory to 410 units. Real pipeline is likely only P17 (75 units). Demand remains steady at ~57 units per week.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490015' (Cat Tee) is currently in a period of significant supply chain failure. Promised lead time is 2 periods, but multiple orders have been lost. Specifically: P1 (62), P3 (71), P4 (95), and now P14 (182) are highly likely lost as they are many periods past their delivery dates. The total 'phantom' inventory in the recorded in-transit (488 units) is approximately 410 units (P1+P3+P4+P14). The only 'live' order is P17 (75 units), ordered 5 periods ago (now 3 periods overdue). Demand has been volatile: after a seasonal dip in June, Period 21 saw a massive spike to 151 units (possibly due to 4th of July sales or local promotion). Given the massive stockout and the unreliability of the pipeline, I will set L=4 to force the OR backend into accounting for the higher lead time and set \u03bc_hat to account for the current demand regime of ~65 units/period (average of P15-P21). By using an explicit override for mu_hat based on recent trends and adjusting L to reflect actual delays, I aim to trigger a significant re-order since on-hand is 0 and effective pipeline is only 75.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: High probability that P14 (182 units) and P17 (75 units) are lost or severely delayed. Effective pipeline is likely near 0 despite 'In-transit' reflecting 488 units. Recent demand (last 7 periods) averages ~69 units, with a major spike of 151 in P21.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490015 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand summer period, with demand reaching 151 and 187 in the last two weeks (Period 21/22). The pipeline inventory of 488 units is almost certainly comprised of lost shipments: P1 (62), P3 (71), P4 (95), P14 (182), and P17 (75) are all far beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods without arriving. Specifically, P14 is now 9 periods old and P17 is 6 periods old. Because the OR backend's order calculation subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, the presence of these 488 phantom units prevents the system from placing new orders, resulting in persistent stockouts. To force an order despite the phantom pipeline, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that is high enough to exceed the phantom inventory plus expected demand. I estimate current demand mean at ~100 units/period (reflecting the July spike). To cover 3 periods (L+1) and offset the 488 units of noise, I need a target base stock of approximately 800 units. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 800 and sigma_hat at 150 to ensure a robust order is generated to resume supply.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Lost shipments now total 485 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17 are all significantly overdue). These phantom units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are preventing the automated logic from ordering, requiring explicit parameter inflation to bypass. Demand has spiked significantly in July (avg 169 over last 2 weeks), likely reflecting peak summer seasonality.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation for SKU 717490015 is critical due to massive pipeline inventory inflation caused by lost shipments. As of Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0 despite 'In-transit' showing 898 units. Historical evidence confirms that orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, and 17 (totaling 485 units) are significantly beyond the promised 2-period lead time and are likely lost. The OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from its base stock calculation; if we leave the parameters at default, the engine will see 898 'in-transit' units and refuse to order, despite those units never arriving. To force the engine to place an order, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than the 'phantom' pipeline. Current demand has also spiked significantly in July (last 3 weeks average: 162.7), which aligns with summer seasonality for a cotton jersey T-shirt. I am setting L to 2 (promised). I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1400 (representing (1+L) * ~466 units) which is designed to overcome the 898 'In-transit' units and account for the current 150-180 demand regime. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to 200 to ensure a high service level amidst high volatility and unreliable logistics.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Confirmed loss of P1, P3, P4, P14, and P17 (total 485 units). Seasonal demand peak in July confirmed: demand avg increased from ~60 in June to ~163 in July (+170%). Total 'phantom' pipeline inventory is approximately 485-500 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490015' (Cat Tee) is currently in a high-demand seasonal peak (July average demand ~154 units per period vs. June average ~50). Period 24 demand was 129 units. There is a critical supply chain failure: orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, and P17 (totaling 485 units) are lost, creating 'phantom inventory' in the in-transit view (1555 units). Because the backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock to calculate new orders, this phantom inventory prevents normal logic from replenishing stock while' on-hand' remains 0. To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to a value higher than the current in-transit level (1555) plus the required safety stock to force a replenishment order. I estimate the required base stock at approximately 2100 (which covers 3 periods of peak demand ~150 * 3 = 450, plus a buffer to overcome the 1555 phantom units). mu_hat is set to 2100 to achieve this. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to account for the ongoing instability and ensure the coverage window is wide enough.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Seasonal July peak demand confirmed (avg ~154). Massive shipment loss (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) totaling 485 units creates persistent phantom inventory. To maintain stock-on-hand, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to exceed the total phantom inventory in the backend calculation.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490015' (Cat Tee) is currently in a severe stock-out situation despite high seasonal demand in July/August. There is a massive mismatch between 'In-transit' inventory (2347 units) and actual stock arrival, as many orders (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P23, P24) are significantly overdue or likely lost. The backend OR logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will not place orders if it believes these 2347 units are coming. To force an order, I must explicitly set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline. Demand in July averaged ~135 units/period. The current In-transit is ~2347. To trigger an order for roughly 200-300 units (enough for current demand plus safety), mu_hat must be set to approximately 2700. Lead time remains anchored at the promised 2 periods, but volatility is extreme.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed extreme pipeline divergence; official 'In-transit' (2347 units) consists almost entirely of lost or severely delayed shipments (P1 through P24). Actual on-hand is consistently 0. July/August demand regime stabilized at ~135 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1230.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, we finally observed a significant arrival: 410 units from Period 23 arrived with a lead time of 3 periods. This confirms that the pipeline is not entirely 'phantom', but it is experiencing significant delays (3 periods instead of 2). The current on-hand inventory is 328 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 2537 units remains extremely high because it still includes the likely lost shipments from early periods (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, etc.) plus the massive orders placed in P24-P26. For Period 27 (mid-August), demand has dropped from the July peaks (~150+) to ~80-82. I will set the lead time to 3 based on the most recent successful arrival. To ensure the backend places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' pipeline units (which the backend subtracts), I will continue using 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~85 units/week. To cover 4 periods (L+1=4) and clear the ~2000 units of likely phantom inventory, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly high. mu_hat of 2500 is intended to force an order that accounts for both real demand and the subtraction of non-existent units from the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Lead time confirmed at 3 periods (P23 order arrived P26). July peak demand (~150) has subsided to an August baseline of ~82 units. Total phantom inventory remains ~2000 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: Major inventory inflow has finally occurred, with 792 units arriving this period (Period 27 conclude) from the Period 25 order. This, combined with the Period 26 arrival, has brought On-hand inventory to 1,048 units. The 'In-transit' of 1,874 units still contains roughly 485 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) plus the large orders from Periods 24 and 26. Demand has clearly transitioned from the July seasonal peak (~150/week) back to an August baseline, with the last two periods showing 82 and 72 units. With massive on-hand stock and decreasing demand, the immediate goal is to stop ordering to avoid excessive holding costs. For the OR backend, mu_hat is set to a level that ensures (base_stock - pipeline) is <= 0. Given On-Hand (1048) + In-Transit (1874) = 2922 Total Pipeline, and even excluding ~500 phantom units, we have plenty of coverage. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current softening demand (~75/week) vs the July peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Seasonal peak has subsided; August demand baseline confirmed at ~75 units/week. Significant on-hand inventory (1000+) now exists, mitigating previous stockout risks. Lead time reliability remains inconsistent but recent arrivals suggest L=2 to 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' has stabilized after a significant seasonal peak in July. August demand (Periods 25-28) has settled at a baseline average of approximately 75 units/week (80, 82, 72, 67). After a period of severe stockouts and lost shipments, the inventory position is now extremely healthy with 981 units on-hand. This is sufficient to cover approximately 13 weeks of current demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 1874 units remains heavily inflated by older shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P24) that are likely lost or permanently delayed, although recent arrivals from P23 and P25 suggest that the supply chain has partially recovered with a lead time of 2-3 periods. Given the high on-hand balance and the subsiding seasonal demand (moving from Summer peak to late August), the primary objective is to avoid incurring excessive holding costs. No new orders are needed. Setting L=2 and using a recent demand window of N=4 reflects the current lower baseline (~75 units/week) compared to the July peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-July seasonal peak: Demand has stabilized at a late-August baseline of ~75 units/week (12% decrease from March/April highs). On-hand inventory is now oversupplied (981 units) relative to current demand, mitigating previous stockout risks.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The peak summer demand (July) has subsided, and demand has stabilized at a late-August baseline averaging approximately 69 units/period over the last 4 weeks (P26-P29). There is currently a significant oversupply with 924 units on-hand, which covers over 13 weeks of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure remains heavily inflated (1874 units) by historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) and likely overdue shipments from early August. However, with the current on-hand inventory, there is no immediate risk of stockout. Parameters are set to 'default' for L and mu_hat to allow the OR backend to process the stable demand samples, while sigma_hat is set to a recent window to capture the reduced volatility after the July peak. No further ordering is required given the current inventory level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Post-July seasonal peak, demand has settled into a late-August baseline of ~69 units/period. On-hand inventory (924 units) is now highly sufficient, transitioning the strategy from growth/recovery to inventory depletion.

=== Period 30 Summary ===
717490015: ordered=0, arrived=129 units (ordered on Period 27, lead_time was 3 periods), starting on-hand inventory=1053, demand=38, sold=38, ending on-hand inventory=1015

Daily Reward (R_t): $-293.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of significant oversupply with 1,015 units on-hand, while current demand has stabilized following the July seasonal peak to a late-August/September baseline of approximately 50-60 units per week (Period 30 demand was 38). The 'In-transit' figure of 1,745 units continues to be heavily inflated by historical lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) and orders placed during the July peak stockout (P24, P25, P26). At a current burn rate of ~50 units/week, the existing on-hand inventory alone provides over 20 weeks of cover. The objective now is to allow this excess inventory to deplete. To ensure the OR backend does not trigger any new orders despite the 'phantom' pipeline, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent demand drop and use the default lead time. The high on-hand balance relative to the base stock calculation will naturally result in zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand has fully transitioned from the July seasonal peak (~150) to a September baseline of ~40-60 units. Inventory is currently in an oversupplied state (1015 units), sufficient for ~20 weeks of demand. Pipeline remains inflated with ~500 units of confirmed lost legacy orders and ~1200 units of peak-period orders yet to arrive or be confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-115.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the t-shirt SKU has significantly softened as we move into September, following the July seasonal peak. The last four periods (P28-P31) show demand levels of 67, 57, 38, and 45 units, establishing a new baseline average of approximately 52 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 970 units, which, even at a higher demand estimate, provides over 15 weeks of cover. The system still reports 1745 units in-transit, which includes both the historical 'phantom' lost orders and delayed bulk orders from the peak period. Given the massive overstock relative to the current demand regime, the objective is to prioritize inventory depletion and minimize holding costs. No new orders are needed. Parameters are set to reflect this lower demand regime using 4 samples to capture the post-peak stabilization, while the backend naturally suppresses orders due to the high on-hand and pipeline figures.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime confirmed at approx 52 units/period, down from peak July levels of ~150. Oversupply of ~970 units on-hand provides sufficient cover for the remainder of the game; strategy is now pure inventory depletion.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The strategy continues to be one of inventory depletion. On-hand inventory is currently 936 units, while the demand regime for September has stabilized at a lower level, averaging approximately 43 units over the last three periods (P30-P32). At this consumption rate, the existing stock covers over 20 weeks of demand, which extends well beyond the remaining 15 periods of the game. Despite the large 'In-transit' figure of 1745 units (which likely contains significant 'phantom' inventory from lost historical orders P1, P3, P4, P14, and P17, plus laggard peak-period orders), the on-hand stock alone is sufficient to satisfy all future demand without incurring further ordering costs or risk of stockout. To ensure no new orders are placed by the OR backend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand environment using recent_N=3, allowing the high on-hand balance to naturally prevent new procurement.

Daily Reward (R_t): $404.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a significant oversupply phase following a series of late arrivals and high-volume orders placed during the July seasonal peak. On-hand inventory is 869 units, while recent demand (P30-P33) has averaged approximately 46 units per period. At this consumption rate, the existing stock covers roughly 18-19 periods, which exceeds the remaining 13 periods of the game. The 'In-transit' figure of 1745 units continues to reflect a mix of significantly delayed legacy orders (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) and later arrivals from the July ordering surge. Given that the objective is to maximize profit minus holding costs, the priority is to deplete the current on-hand inventory to minimize holding costs. No new orders are needed. L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat are set to allow the backend logic to recognize this surplus and refrain from ordering.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime consistent at ~45-50 units/period. Inventory surplus (869 units) is sufficient to satisfy all remaining demand for the game duration; strategy remains pure inventory depletion with no further ordering required.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a state of extreme oversupply following the arrival of large orders placed during the July peak. Current on-hand inventory is 847 units, while the most recent demand (Period 34) was only 22 units. The average demand for the September/October regime (Periods 30-34) has stabilized at approximately 41 units per period. With only 12 periods remaining in the game (ending at Period 47), the total projected demand is roughly 500 units (12 * 41.2), which is significantly less than the 847 units currently on hand. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. The objective is to minimize holding costs while liquidating existing stock. I will set parameters to ensure a base stock level well below the current on-hand and pipeline levels to prevent the OR backend from triggering any replenishment orders.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The strategy remains in a pure inventory depletion phase. As of Period 36, on-hand inventory is 818 units, while the demand for the most recent period was 29 units. Average demand over the last 5 periods (Sept/Oct) is approximately 39 units. With 11 periods remaining in the game (ending Period 47), total projected demand is roughly 430\u2013500 units. The current on-hand stock is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand without any additional ordering. Pipeline inventory remains heavily inflated due to legacy lost orders and high-volume arrivals from the July peak, but this is irrelevant to the depletion strategy. Parameters are set to 'default' or low 'recent_N' to ensure the OR backend keeps base stock levels significantly below current on-hand/in-transit totals, preventing any new orders from being placed.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490015 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a state of high oversupply. On-hand inventory is 788 units, while the most recent demand (Periods 34-36) has averaged only 27 units per period. Historically, demand peaked in July (~150/period) but has since stabilized in a lower Autumn regime of approximately 30-50 units per period. With 11 periods remaining in the game (ending at Period 47), the total expected demand is roughly 330-550 units, which is significantly less than the 788 units already on-hand. Additionally, there is a large 'In-transit' quantity of 1,745 units, much of which consists of older lost/delayed shipments and redundant peak-season orders. Given the high on-hand stock and the objective to minimize holding costs while maximizing profit, the strategy remains pure inventory depletion. No further orders are required to meet demand for the remainder of the session. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the lower Autumn demand levels, which will result in a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand + pipeline, effectively suppressing new orders.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The strategy remains in an inventory depletion phase. Current date is October 28, and demand for September/October has stabilized in a low-demand regime (averaging 36 units over the last 5 periods: P33-P37). With 754 units on-hand and only 9 periods remaining in the game (P38-P47), total expected remaining demand is roughly 324-400 units. The current on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover all demand until the end of the game with a service level near 100%. Therefore, no further orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from placing any new orders, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 3 samples (capturing the low October demand) and L is kept at the default to minimize the base stock target relative to the existing high on-hand and pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed at approx 31 units/period (P34-P37), indicating a deeper seasonal softening from the September average of ~50. Inventory remains in extreme surplus (754 units on-hand) relative to the ~280-300 units of total expected remaining demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The strategy remains in a pure inventory depletion phase. Current on-hand inventory is 738 units. Demand has significantly softened as we enter November, with the last period recording only 16 units, and the October average sitting around 25-30 units per period. With only 8 periods remaining in the game (P39 to P47), total expected demand is approximately 200-250 units, which is easily covered by the current on-hand stock. No further orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from generating an order, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with a small window (N=3) to reflect the current low-demand regime. Since the backend 'base_stock' calculation will be significantly lower than the current on-hand + in-transit (which includes phantom inventory), the resulting order will be zero.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Late autumn demand regime confirmed at ~20-30 units/period (P35-P38 average: 27). On-hand inventory (738 units) is extremely sufficient for the remaining 8 periods of the game.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a state of extreme oversupply as the game approaches its conclusion. Current on-hand inventory is 721 units, while the recorded demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) has averaged only 25.2 units per period. With only 8 periods remaining in the game (P40-P47), total expected remaining demand is roughly 200 units (8 * 25). The current inventory is more than 3.5 times the total expected demand for the rest of the game. Additionally, there are 1,745 units 'In-transit', though a large portion of these are likely the missing/lost legacy shipments or late arrivals from the July peak. Since the objective is to maximize profit minus holding costs, and we have enough stock to satisfy all future demand without many additional holding costs for unnecessary units, we must continue to suppress any new orders. Setting mu_hat to a very low level (using recent_N with N=1 on the lowest recent demand) ensures the base-stock stays well below the combined on-hand and pipeline inventory, effectively halting all purchasing.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand (Nov) has hit a season low, averaging ~16.5 units over the last two weeks (P38-P39), confirming a continued decline from the October average of 27.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The strategy remains in a pure inventory depletion phase. As of Period 41, the on-hand inventory is 707 units, while the recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged only 15.6 units per week. With only 7 periods remaining in the simulation (ending at P47), the total expected demand is approximately 110-140 units. The current inventory is more than 5 times the total remaining requirement. Therefore, no additional orders are necessary. The 'In-transit' figure of 1745 is composed entirely of either lost legacy shipments or unneeded peak-period orders that will only serve to increase holding costs if they arrive. To prevent the OR backend from triggering any NEW orders, L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat are set to minimum or default values, relying on the massive on-hand surplus to satisfy all future demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-467.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 42 out of 47. On-hand inventory is 695 units, and demand has significantly declined in November, averaging 14.3 units over the last three periods (P39-P41). With only 5 periods remaining in the game, the total expected remaining demand is roughly 75-100 units. The current inventory covers this demand more than 7 times over. Profit is $19 and holding cost is $1. Given the massive oversupply, no further orders should be placed to minimize additional holding costs. The OR backend will naturally order zero units if the base stock (calculated from mu_hat) is significantly lower than the current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the low late-autumn demand regime, which will result in a target stock level far below current holdings, thus preventing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Late autumn demand (November) has stabilized at a low baseline of ~14 units/period, down from the October average of 27. Inventory of 695 units is sufficient for the remainder of the game.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490015 is in a state of extreme oversupply as the game moves into December (Period 43, 47 total periods). Current on-hand inventory is 674 units, while demand has dropped significantly to a late-autumn baseline of approximately 16 units per period (average of last 5 periods: 16). With only 5 periods remaining in the game (P43-P47), total expected demand is roughly 80 units. The inventory currently on hand is sufficient to cover this remaining demand nearly 8 times over. The strategy remains focused on inventory depletion to minimize holding costs, although meaningful depletion is unlikely given the slow demand versus high stock levels. No further orders are required. To prevent any automated replenishment, L is set to calculated and mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the currently low, stable demand levels.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 of 47, approaching the end of the simulation. The current context is established as a late autumn/winter demand regime with very low activity. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is approximately 16.4 units per period. With 656 units on-hand and only 4 periods remaining in the game (including the current period), the total expected demand until the end is roughly 65-70 units. Therefore, the current inventory is extremely excessive, covering nearly 10 times the remaining possible demand. The objective now is to purely deplete existing inventory to minimize holding costs, as any further ordering would result in unnecessary expenses without additional sales benefit. I will use 'explicit' methods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to 0 to ensure the backend logic does not place any new orders, effectively bypassing the 'phantom' in-transit inventory which is largely composed of lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, and likely P24).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in the final stages of the game (Period 45 of 47). The primary objective is inventory depletion to minimize holding costs while ensuring remaining demand is met. Current on-hand inventory is 644 units, which is extremely high relative to the recent late-autumn demand average of approximately 16 units per period (P40-P44 average: 15.4). Even at the highest recent demand of 21 units (P42), the total demand for the remaining 3 periods is estimated to be less than 70 units. There is no risk of stockout. To prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders, I am maintaining a strategy of zero replenishment by keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat low relative to the massive on-hand and in-transit surplus. The 'In-transit' figure of 1745 remains heavily composed of legacy 'phantom' lost orders, but this is irrelevant given the sufficient on-hand stock.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), nearing the end of the game (Period 47). The demand has stabilized at a very low winter regime, averaging approximately 18 units per period over the last five weeks (P41-P45), which is a significant drop from the summer peak. The current on-hand inventory is 615 units. Given that there are only two periods left (P46 and P47), the total remaining demand is expected to be under 50 units. Therefore, the existing on-hand inventory is more than ten times the required amount. Any further ordering would only increase holding costs without providing any additional sales benefit. The strategy remains focused on pure inventory depletion. Parameters are set to 'default' to allow the OR backend to process the high on-hand and pipeline inventory without generating new orders, which is consistent with the goal of maximizing total reward by minimizing ending inventory and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $185.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the final period of the game. The current demand regime for late December shows a slight increase (demand was 40 last period), but the on-hand inventory of 575 units remains extremely high relative to any plausible single-period demand. The strategy throughout the latter half of the game has been inventory depletion following a massive oversupply in August. Since No further orders can arrive before the game ends and existing stock is more than sufficient to meet the final period's demand, I will continue to set parameters that prevent new orders. By using the 'default' method for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat with such a large on-hand inventory (575) and pipeline (1745), the OR backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will result in a negative number, ensuring no new order is placed and minimizing further holding costs.
