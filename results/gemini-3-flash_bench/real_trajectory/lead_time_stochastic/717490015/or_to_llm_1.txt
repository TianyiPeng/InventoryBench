Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed today (P1) will arrive in P3 and be available for P4. The OR algorithm recommends 62 units, calculated using historical mean (~44) and standard deviation (~10.6), with a 95% service level cap. Given that we start with 0 inventory and there is a lead time delay, we need to ensure enough stock is in the pipeline to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 until the first shipment arrives. Total demand over those 3 periods (L+1) is approximately 132 units (44 * 3). However, OR's cap is meant to prevent over-ordering.

Historical demand samples show a mean of approximately 44 units. However, recent demand in P1 (41) and P2 (73) suggests a slight upward trend or variance. 3.

Strategy: Total units needed for 3 periods at an average demand of ~54 (recent mean) is ~162. Current in-transit is 121. 162 - 121 = 41.

Demand records show a steady increase: P1=41, P2=73, P3=82, compared to the initial historical mean of ~44. This suggests a seasonal uptick as weather warms.\n\n2. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. In-transit is 184 units (P1: 62, P2: 59, P3: 63). Despite the promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order (placed at the start of Period 1) should have arrived during Period 3's arrival phase and been visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. It was not. This indicates the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost.\n\n3. Demand Analysis: The last two periods (73, 82) are significantly higher than the 5-week history used by OR (avg 44). Using a more recent 3-period average (~65) for a lead time of 3 periods (L+1 = 4) suggests a target stock level of ~260 units.\n\n4. Decision: Current pipeline is 184. To reach target stock, I need ~76 units. The OR recommendation of 23 is based on a shorter lead time (2) and lower historical demand mean.

No strong seasonal indicators are present for mid-March for this 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt. 5. OR Recommendation: OR recommends 0 units because the pipeline (200) is large relative to current demand and lead time. 6. Strategy: I will place an order of 65 units. Although the pipeline is large, the Period 1 order of 62 units is highly likely lost (it is now 2 periods overdue). If we subtract that lost order, effective pipeline is 138 units + 9 on-hand = 147.

The product is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt', which has stable year-round demand but may see a slight uptick as spring (mid-March) begins. Current On-hand is 0.\n\n3.

According to historical evidence and the carry-over insights, P1 (62), P3 (63), and P4 (75) orders are confirmed lost, totaling 200 lost units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 325 - 200 = 125 units (specifically the order from Period 8, which is expected to arrive in Period 10 based on the 2-period lead time). Demand Analysis: This is a jersey t-shirt in April, entering spring/summer peak. Recent demand (P2-P8) averages ~70 units, significantly higher than the initial history of 44. The OR recommendation of 0 is flawed because it likely overestimates the pipeline (seeing 325 units) and ignores the lost shipments. To manage Period 9 (decision phase) through Period 11 (target arrival for new order): Period 9 demand (~70) will likely stock out (17 on-hand). Period 10 will be satisfied by the 125 units from P8. To cover Period 11, we need to place an order now. Using a 3-period coverage (L+1 = 3), total stock required is ~210 units. Current effective stock (Inventory + Effective Pipeline) = 17 + 125 = 142.

However, P1 (62 units), P3 (63 units), and P4 (75 units) are confirmed lost (total 200 units). In-transit inventory is listed as 405. After accounting for confirmed losses, the active pipeline is: P8 (125 units), P9 (80 units), and the unknown remnants, leaving approximately 205 units actually expected to arrive. 2. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand is 0. Demand has consistently outstripped supply, resulting in frequent stockouts. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Item 717490015 is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), and we are entering mid-April. Demand has surged from an initial average of ~44 to a recent average of ~70 (+59%), peaking as high as 91. This aligns with spring/summer seasonality for basic jersey apparel. 4. **OR Recommendation Critique**: The OR recommends 0 units because it views the 'In-transit' of 405 as sufficient. However, at least 200 of those units are lost. Based on a 2-period lead time, we need to cover demand for Period 10, 11, and 12 (approx. 210-240 units). 5. **Strategy**: With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 205 (P8 and P9), we are barely covered for the lead time window. Given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the risk of another stockout or lost shipment outweighs the risk of overstocking.

Wait, Period 13 order (85 units) and Period 15 order (30 units) equals 115 units. Let's re-examine the history. In-transit is reported as 400. History shows: P1(62-lost), P2(59-arrived), P3(63-lost), P4(75-lost), P5(65-arrived), P6(55-arrived), P7(30-arrived), P8(125-arrived), P9(80-arrived), P10(85-not arrived), P11(30-arrived), P12(80-arrived), P13(85-in-transit), P14(0), P15(30-in-transit).

These 210 units consist of orders from P13 (85), P15 (30), and P16 (95). \n3. **Arrival Projections**: Since we are at the start of Period 17, we expect the P13 order (85 units) to have arrived during Period 15/16 or to be arriving now (visible next period).

Critical issue: The Carry-over insights confirm that P1, P3, P4, and P10 shipments (totaling 285 units) are lost. These are still counted in the 'In-transit' figure of 440. Therefore, the 'True Pipeline' is 440 - 285 = 155 units. These 155 units correspond to orders placed in P13 (85) and P17 (70).\n2. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has fluctuated but averages around 60-70 units per period. The current date is June 10th (late spring/early summer). As this is a Cat Tee (Jersey Basic), demand is expected to remain steady or slightly increase due to summer seasonality. \n3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 83. True Pipeline is 155. Total available = 238 units. \n4. OR Recommendation Analysis: The OR agent recommends 0 units. This is likely because it sees 440 units in transit and thinks the system is overstocked. However, because 285 of those units are lost, the OR's base-stock calculation is severely skewed by 'ghost inventory'.\n5. Strategy: I need to cover demand for the lead time + review period (approx 3 periods). 3 periods * 75 units (conservative estimate) = 225 units. With 238 available, I am currently safe for the immediate future. However, given the extreme unreliability of the supplier (4 shipments lost already), maintaining a slightly higher safety stock is prudent. I will place a small order of 30 units to hedge against potential future losses and maintain the pipeline flow.",

In-transit inventory is reported as 980 units, but after accounting for these confirmed losses, the 'effective' pipeline is 500 units. The OR recommendation of 0 is significantly influenced by the inflated total 'In-transit' figure and the fact that it does not adequately weight the recent summer demand surge. Analyzing the effective pipeline: Orders from P23 (120), P24 (200), and P25 (180) total 500 units. Given 'lead_time was 2 periods' is the usual maximum, the P23 order (120 units) should arrive during Period 26. Starting on-hand is 0. If P23 arrives as expected, we will have 120 units against a demand expected to be between 80-150 units.

The current 'In-transit' of 830 units is highly misleading because it includes these lost shipments. After subtracting the confirmed 680 lost units, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 150 units (specifically, 150 units ordered in Period 26 which have not yet arrived). The current on-hand inventory is 86 units. Post-summer demand has cooled significantly, averaging approximately 43 units over the last 4 periods (P29-P32). The OR recommendation for Period 33 is 0 units, which is mathematically sound based on a 2-period lead time and on-hand inventory being sufficient for the immediate two weeks. However, given the extreme historical loss rate (nearly 50% of orders), I will monitor the Period 26 shipment arrival (expected soon). Ordering more now while having 86 units on hand and 150 (potentially) on the way would lead to excessive holding costs if the shipment arrives, or exacerbate risk if the supplier is entirely blocked.

The remaining 'valid' in-transit inventory consists of shipments from P16 (95 units, though highly suspect given P17/P19/P24 are lost) and P26 (150 units). However, P26 is now 8 periods old; given our typical 1-3 period lead time, P26 is also likely lost. Lead-time Inference: Recent successful deliveries (P31 arriving in P32) show a lead time of 1 period, but the supplier remains highly unreliable. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has stabilized significantly after the summer peak, with the last 4 periods averaging 46 units (45, 34, 67, and the current P33 result of 67). World Knowledge: As of 2019/9/30, we are entering the fall season. T-shirt demand typically declines as weather cools.

Total available inventory (on-hand 52 + reliable in-transit 40 = 92) covers approximately 6 periods of current demand.
