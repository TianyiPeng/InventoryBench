Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 719957006 (Women's Hipster Briefs). The initial on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. Historical demand shows five samples: 140, 45, 30, 95, 99. The average of these samples is approx 81.8. While there is variability, the most recent two weeks (95, 99) suggest a stabilization near 100 as we move through February. Given the promised lead time (L) is 2, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the initial historical distribution while accounting for recent levels. The lead time method is set to 'default' as we have no historical arrival data yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 2 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 155 units which are in-transit; they haven't arrived yet (expected lead time is 2, meaning they should arrive in Period 3 and be visible in Period 4). Historical demand for this women's cotton hipster bikini 3-pack shows values: 140, 45, 30, 95, 99 and the most recent demand in Period 1 was 21. The demand seems somewhat volatile but generally averages around 70-80 units per week. Given the on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we lost 21 sales in Period 1, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the (L+1) period demand. I will use the recent 6 samples (including Period 1) to forecast demand while keeping the default lead time of 2. N=6 captures the pre-game history plus the first game period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is 'Womens Lingerie' (hipsters). On-hand inventory is 0, with 284 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2, so the P1 order (155 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 3) and be visible in the next period's start (Period 4). Historical demand samples are 140, 45, 30, 95, 99. The most recent 'live' demands in P1 and P2 were 21 and 29. Combining the provided historical samples (mean ~81.8) with recent observations (mean ~25) suggests a recent downward shift or that historical samples included a seasonal peak not present in February. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to weigh the recent lower demand more heavily while still acknowledging some historical volume, setting L to default (2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's cotton hipster briefs. We are currently in Period 4 (Early March). Historical demand samples from Jan-Feb show an average of approx 82 units/week (140, 45, 30, 95, 99). Recent demand in the game history (P1: 21, P2: 29, P3: 53) is lower than the initial samples but showing an upward trend. On-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales of all demand so far. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from P1 (155 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 (L=2) and become visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. Checking the lead time definition: An order placed in Period 1 with L=2 arrives in Period 3 and is visible at the start of Period 4. Since the P3 conclude (received at P4 start) shows 0 arrived, the P1 order is delayed or the arrival window hasn't closed yet. However, the OR backend needs parameters to cover demand for (L+1) periods. I will use recent demand history to set mu_hat. Given the low initial game demand (avg 34 over 3 weeks) vs historical (avg 82), I will use a conservative recent_N approach for mu_hat based on the 5 samples provided plus the 3 game periods (total N=8). L remains at default 2 until a delay is confirmed by another period of zero arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a pack of cotton hipster briefs. Comparing the historical demand samples (range: 30-140) with the game history (P1: 21, P2: 29, P3: 53, P4: 121), we observe a significant upward trend in demand over the last four periods. Specifically, the jump from 53 in P3 to 121 in P4 suggests a demand regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. Regarding lead time, the order from P2 arrived in P4 (lead_time = 2), confirming the promised lead time of 2 periods. However, the order from P1 (155 units) is now overdue (it should have arrived in P3 if L=2), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. Despite having 155 units 'in-transit', if they are lost, our pipeline inventory is effectively zero. To protect against stockouts given the rising demand (121 units last week) and the uncertainty of the P1 shipment, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the recent surge (using the last 4 game history points and recent samples) and maintaining a conservative lead time. I will use N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from an average of ~38 in P1-P2 to 121 in P4. Observed lead time for P2 order was 2; however, P1 order (155 units) is overdue as of P4 conclude, suggesting a potential lost shipment.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/3/18), the SKU 719957006 (Womens Lingerie) is experiencing a sharp demand spike. Historical samples (Jan) were ~82/week, but recent demand (P4 and P5) reached 121 and 145 respectively. The mean of the last 3 periods is 106, while the last 2 periods average 133. Given the seasonality of lingerie and the sustained increase, I am moving to an EWMA approach for demand to weigh recent observations more heavily. Regarding supply: The P1 order (155 units) is now 3 periods overdue (P1 order should have arrived in P3 or P4 based on L=2). Since 'arrived=0' was reported in P3, P4, and P5 conclude messages for the P1 order, it is highly likely lost. The P2 order arrived on time (L=2). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 302 units in-transit (the 155 likely lost P1 units + 147 units from P5). Because the OR backend counts the likely lost 155 units as 'In-transit', it will under-order. To compensate, I am setting L=2 (promised) but using an explicit mu_hat of 441 (equivalent to an average demand of 147 over L+1=3 periods) to force a higher base stock, ensuring the OR engine places an order despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: P1 order (155 units) confirmed lost (overdue by 3 periods). Demand growth confirmed: average demand increased from ~38 (P1-P2) to ~133 (P4-P5), a 250% increase.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2018/3/25 (Period 7). The product is 'Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p' (Womens Lingerie). We have established a significant demand regime shift: early demand (P1-P2) averaged ~38, while recent demand (P4-P6) has surged to an average of 119.7. The P1 order of 155 units is officially lost (ordered P1, yet P4 order arrived first). The P5 order arrived in only 1 period, but we should stick to the promised lead time of 2 for safety given the previous lost shipment. For Period 7, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~120). mu_hat value will be set using recent_N=3 (P4-P6 demand: 121, 145, 93), which yields an average per period of 119.7. The OR backend will scale this by (1+L). This helps prevent stockouts in the face of the higher sustained demand seen since early March.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late March with an average of ~120 units per period, compared to the initial ~38; Lead time variability noted: P1 order lost, P5 order arrived in 1 period, P2 order arrived in 2 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (women's hipster briefs) has exited its high-demand phase observed in March. Demand in Period 7 dropped significantly to 34 units, contrasting with the P4-P6 average of ~120 units. This suggests the March peak was temporary (possibly seasonal or promotional). Lead times continue to be volatile: P5 arrived in 1 period, P2 in 2 periods, and P1 was lost. Currently, inventory is 20 units on-hand with 364 units in-transit (from orders in P6). Given the sharp demand drop in P7, I am adjusting the forecast to reflect a more moderate pace while accounting for the high volatility shown in the historical samples (140, 45, 30, 95, 99). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the recent stabilization/drop, and 'default' for sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock given the lead-time uncertainty and past lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Demand dropped from an average of ~120 (P4-P6) to 34 (-71%), indicating the end of the March seasonal peak.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The SKU 719957006 (Womens Lingerie) experienced a significant demand surge in March (averaging ~130 units), which has now sharply plummeted in April (Period 7: 34, Period 8: 8). This confirms the end of a seasonal peak, likely related to a spring promotion or event that concluded. We currently have 221 units on-hand and 155 units in-transit (from Period 1, though carry-over insights previously flagged this as likely lost, the 'In-transit' figure suggests the system still tracks it). Given the current demand level (mean of ~20 over the last two weeks), our existing 221 units are sufficient to cover over 10 periods of demand. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the low post-peak demand (avg ~25) and setting L to default (2), as the recent lead times have been 1 and 2 periods. The OR backend should naturally zero out orders because on-hand inventory significantly exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' (Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p) experienced a significant demand spike in March (P4-P6), likely due to seasonal lingerie demand or promotions, which has now clearly subsided. Since P7 (late March), demand has plummeted from an average of ~120 units to ~24 units (P7-P9: 34, 8, 31). The current on-hand inventory is 190 units, which at the current run rate, covers roughly 8 periods of demand. Lead times have been variable (1 or 2 periods, with one lost shipment from P1), but the current pipeline is empty (the 'In-transit' 155 is the lost P1 order). Given the excess inventory (190 units on-hand vs. a demand forecast of ~24 units/period), the OR backend will naturally suppress ordering. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this lower, post-peak demand regime (averaging 24.3 units/period) to avoid over-ordering as we enter April.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed (P7-P9): Demand has stabilized at a lower average of ~24 units per period following the March spike.

We are now in Period 11 (2019/04/22). History shows a major seasonal demand peak in March (Periods 4-6) which has since subsided. Recent demand samples starting from Period 7 are: 34, 8, 31, and 66. This suggests a post-peak regime with a significantly lower average (~35 units) compared to the March peak (~120 units). The product 'Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p' is a basic women's lingerie item, which typically sees spikes around Valentine's Day/early spring but stabilizes thereafter. On-hand inventory is currently high (124 units) following the arrival of a large shipment in Period 8. The 'lost' Period 1 shipment (155 units) is still technically 'in-transit' in the pipeline, but we have already concluded it is lost. Given the high current inventory and low recent demand, we must lower the base stock to avoid excessive holding costs. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this new, lower demand regime (Periods 7-10). Lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I'll use the promised lead time of 2 (default) as it remains the best proxy for upcoming orders.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting around Period 7 (March 25), where demand dropped from an average of ~120 to a post-peak average of ~38 (averaging the last 5 periods: 34, 8, 31, 66, 19). The product is 'Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p', which likely experienced a pre-Spring/March seasonal peak that has now subsided. Current on-hand inventory is 105 units, with 155 units in-transit (this is the P1 order previously flagged as lost but still technically showing as in-transit in the system summary; however, we treat it as unreliable based on past carry-over insights). Given the recent low demand, the existing 105 units on-hand already cover approximately 2.7 periods of demand at the current average rate (~38 units/period). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (avg ~1.5). I will use N=5 for demand and lead time calculations to capture the post-peak stabilized state.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant peak in March (Periods 4-6, avg ~120), which has since subsided. For the last 6 periods (P7-P12), demand has averaged 29.6 units, reflecting a post-peak stabilization. The most recent demand (P11-P12) is even lower (avg 14.5), but using N=6 captures the broader post-peak regime and provides a more stable forecast. On-hand inventory is 95 units, which is approximately 3.2 times the recent average demand (29.6), and with an additional 155 units in-transit (P1 order confirmed lost, but these 155 are likely from a later order or the backend's persistent tracking), we are well-stocked. Lead times have been 1-2 periods (excluding the lost P1 order). I will use recent_N=6 for demand parameters to reflect the current low-demand environment and prevent excessive holding costs, as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a cotton hipster brief, which typically sees steady demand with peaks around seasonal transitions. History shows a major spike in March (averaging ~120 units) followed by a significant decline. Current demand from Period 10 to 13 averages only 24.5 units per period (66, 19, 10, 3), showing a downward trend as we enter May. On-hand inventory is 92 units, and there are 155 units in-transit (ordered in recent periods), which is more than sufficient for the current low-demand regime. The target service level (q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8) suggests a conservative inventory approach given the relative holding cost. Expected lead time has stabilized at 2 periods (ignoring the lost Period 1 shipment). I will use the last 5 periods (P9-P13) to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining enough stock for potential stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed (P10-P13): Demand has decreased significantly since the March peak, averaging 24.5 units per period over the last 4 weeks.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 719957006 (Womens Lingerie) has significantly declined following the March peak and is currently in a very low-demand regime. Over the last three periods (P12-P14), demand has been 10, 3, and 2 units respectively, averaging only 5 units per week. The overall average since the post-peak stability (P10-P14) is roughly 20 units, but the most recent trend is even lower. We have 90 units on-hand and 155 units in-transit (from the lost P1 order and potential OR backend adjustments), which is more than enough to cover several weeks of current demand. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (N=5 covers P10-P14) to prevent unnecessary ordering while the inventory is being worked through. I will use the default lead time (2) as recent arrivals (P5, P6) have been 1-2 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical data and Carry-over Insights confirm a significant demand regime shift: after a high-demand period in March (peaking at 145 units), demand has plummeted and stabilized at a much lower level. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has been 19, 10, 3, 2, and 3 respectively, averaging 7.4 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 87 units, which is significantly more than sufficient to cover the current demand rate, especially considering the 2-period promised lead time. The 155 units 'In-transit' from Period 1 are confirmed lost as they are now 15 periods overdue. To avoid excessive holding costs on a low-demand SKU, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this 'post-peak' low-demand floor accurately. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to use historically observed lead times (averaging ~1.67 periods for successful deliveries).

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime confirmed (P11-P15): Demand has further stabilized to an average of ~7 units per period following the initial post-peak drop, significantly lower than the P7-P10 average of ~24.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/03. Historically, this product (Womens Lingerie) saw a significant demand surge in March (averaging ~120 units) which has since subsided. Recent demand history (P11-P16) shows a much lower regime, averaging 17.5 units per period, although P16 saw a spike to 68 units. Excluding the P16 spike, the weekly average is ~7 units. On-hand inventory is 19 units, and 155 units remain 'In-transit' from Period 1; however, as noted in previous insights, this P1 shipment is confirmed lost. Since the 'In-transit' figure 155 is still present in the system, the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will likely prevent any new orders because it perceives a large incoming supply. To counteract this and the recent volatility (P16 spike), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the post-April trend while smoothing the P16 outlier. I will use L=default (2) as recent arrivals (P5, P6) have confirmed a lead time of 1-2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 (Womens Lingerie) is currently experiencing a stockout, as on-hand inventory reached 0 after Period 17 sales. While a 155-unit shipment is 'In-transit', this is the original Period 1 order that was previously flagged as lost. Per game mechanics, lost units remain in pipeline inventory indefinitely. Because the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock targets, this 'phantom' inventory is preventing new orders from being placed. I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to force a base stock level that exceeds 155, allowing the OR backend to place a corrective order. Demand has been volatile: after a long period of single-digit lows, Period 16 and 17 saw a sudden spike (avg 45 units/period). With L=2, the total capture window is 3 periods. I will set mu_hat to 135 (representing 3 periods of 45-unit demand) plus a buffer for volatility via sigma_hat. Using L=default reflects the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand recovery detected: After a sustained low-demand period (avg <10), demand surged in P16-P17 to an average of 45 units/period. The 155 units 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory (lost Period 1 order), necessitating explicit mu_hat adjustments to bypass policy caps.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 (Womens Lingerie) is currently experiencing highly volatile demand as it transitions from a late May surge (P16: 68 units) back to low levels (P18: 2 units). The current period (June 17) precedes the summer season. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 309 units, but 155 of these are confirmed 'phantom' units from a lost Period 1 order. This leaves a real pipeline of 154 units (ordered in P18), which are expected around P20/P21. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 309 'In-transit' units from the base stock, it will effectively prevent any replenishment if mu_hat is set too low. To ensure we can cover potential demand spikes or high summer demand, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock that accounts for the phantom units plus a safety buffer. Based on recent volatility (avg of P16-P18 = ~30), and accounting for the phantom 155, I set mu_hat to 220 to 'trick' the backend into placing an order if it sees the real pipeline as insufficient, though with 154 units already coming, we are likely covered for the immediate 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Phanton inventory (155 units from P1) continues to suppress ordering; explicit mu_hat must be used to offset this 155-unit calculation error in the OR backend.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719957006' is currently in a post-spike state with very low recent demand (2 and 4 units in P18-P19 respectively). The 'In-transit' quantity of 155 units is confirmed phantom inventory from a lost order in Period 1. Because the OR backend subtracts all 'pipeline_inventory' (including phantom units) from its base stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the presence of these 155 phantom units effectively prevents the system from placing new orders unless the target base stock exceeds the on-hand + phantom total. Currently, on-hand is 150 and phantom in-transit is 155, totaling 305 units. Recent demand has dropped significantly after the mid-May/early June uptick (P16-P17). With current on-hand inventory at 150 and demand averaging ~3 units over the last two weeks, we are overstocked. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current volatile but generally low demand environment. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to account for recent variability (1-2 periods). No new order is needed right now.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a very low demand period (averaging ~3 units over the last 3 weeks: P18-P20). Although there was a brief spike in P16-P17 (~45 avg), it did not sustain. We current have 147 units on-hand, which is more than enough to cover projected demand for the next (L+1) periods (3 periods with L=2). However, as noted in carry-over insights, there is a 155-unit phantom inventory from a lost Period 1 shipment appearing in 'In-transit'. The OR policy calculates: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). With on_hand=147 and in_transit=155, the pipeline inventory is 302. To ensure no unnecessary orders are placed while also preventing the policy cap from interfering if we needed units, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method (N=7 to capture the post-spike stabilization). This will keep the base_stock low and align with the current 3-unit/period demand regime. No new orders will be triggered by the backend because on-hand inventory is significantly above any reasonable base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime re-established (P18-P20): Demand has returned to an average of ~3 units per period following the brief P16-P17 spike.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a low-demand regime following a brief demand spike in late May (P16-P17). In Period 21, demand was 28 units, but the average demand over the last 4 periods (P18-P21) is approximately 9.25 units. There is a confirmed phantom inventory of 155 units (the lost order from Period 1), which makes the 'In-transit' figure 155 and the 'On-hand' figure 119. Combined, the pipeline inventory is calculated by the OR backend as 274 units. This is far in excess of near-term demand expectations (approx 10 units/period). To prevent unnecessary holding costs, no new orders should be placed. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current lower demand trend (avg ~9) while acknowledging the recent P21 volatility. The high inventory levels are sufficient to cover forecasted demand for several periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15. Demand history shows a volatile pattern with a recent surge to 104 units in Period 22, likely a July seasonal spike in the 'Womens Lingerie' category (e.g., summer sales). The current on-hand inventory is 15. The 'In-transit' quantity of 155 units remains a confirmed phantom from the lost Period 1 order (overdue by 21 weeks), which continues to block the OR backend's automated ordering logic (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)). To ensure the system places an order to meet the current high-demand regime and avoid a stockout, mu_hat must be set explicitly high enough to offset this phantom inventory. Average demand during the current July surge is approximately 66 units (avg of P21-P22). With L=2, the required (L+1) exposure period is 3 periods. Base stock calculation: (3 * 66) + safety stock approx 250 units. To trigger an order despite the 155 phantom units + 15 on-hand (total 170 'visible' units), the base_stock must exceed 170. Setting an explicit mu_hat of 350 to provide buffer and force order replenishment.

Carry-over insight: July seasonal demand spike confirmed: Demand increased to an average of 66 units/period in P21-P22 (previously <5). Current inventory levels are insufficient to meet this local trend given the 155-unit phantom inventory blockage.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (July 22) analysis: We are in the middle of a significant July seasonal spike for this SKU (Womens Lingerie). Demand in P22 (104) and P23 (111) has surged, but we ended P23 with 0 on-hand inventory due to the surge exceeding supply. Current In-transit is 344 units, which includes 155 units from the confirmed lost Period 1 order (phantom inventory) and 189 units from the Period 23 order. The backend logic for base_stock (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat - pipeline) will subtract the full 344 units, believing we have plenty of stock, whereas we only actually expect 189 units. To correct for this 155-unit phantom blockage and meet the current high-demand regime (avg ~107 over the last two weeks), I must set mu_hat explicitly. Aiming to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) at ~107 units/period plus the 155-unit offset: (3 * 107) + 155 = 476. I will set mu_hat to 476 and sigma_hat to 70 (reflecting high recent volatility) to force an order that replenishes stock for the ongoing peak.

Carry-over insight: July seasonal demand spike confirmed: Demand P22-P23 averaged 107.5 units/period. Stockout occurred in P23 due to 155 units of phantom inventory (Period 1 lost shipment) preventing adequate ordering.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a July seasonal spike with demand averaging ~105 units over the last three periods (P22: 104, P23: 111, P24: 100). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 535 units in-transit. However, 155 of these in-transit units are from a confirmed lost shipment in Period 1 (phantom inventory), and another 189 units were ordered in Period 23 (expected to arrive in Period 25 or 26). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 155-unit phantom inventory blockage, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1) at the current high demand rate (105 * 3 = 315) and add the 155 phantom units to bypass the 'pipeline_inventory' subtraction in the backend formula (315 + 155 = 470). I will use explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen during these seasonal shifts.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained July/August seasonal demand spike (P22-P25 average ~101 units/period). On-hand inventory is 0, and the system is in stockout. In-transit inventory stands at 535 units, consisting of: P1 lost shipment (155), P23 order (189), and P24 order (191). The P23 order (placed July 15) is expected to arrive this period (P26) given the promised lead time of 2, but has not yet concluded. The presence of the 155 units of 'phantom' inventory from Period 1 continues to inflate the pipeline inventory, which causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order size. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the current high demand regime (~100 units/period) plus a buffer to absorb the 155-unit calculation error. Setting mu_hat to 600 (approx. (1+L)*150 + 150 offset) ensures the backend generates a replenishment order despite the phantom stock. Lead time is set to default as recent arrivals fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: August seasonal demand continuation: P22-P25 demand remains high, averaging 101.5 units/period. Stockout continues as orders from P23 and P24 are still in transit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 is in the middle of an August high-demand regime, with demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) averaging approximately 104 units. We have an on-hand inventory of 73 units and a significant in-transit pipeline of 461 units. However, 155 of these in-transit units are from an order placed in Period 1 that is confirmed lost (phantom inventory). This phantom inventory leads the OR backend to believe the pipeline is healthier than it is, potentially suppressing necessary orders. Current pipeline (excluding phantom) is 306 units (P24: 191; P26: 115). Period 23 order (189 units) arrived in Period 26 (L=3), suggesting actual lead times are currently longer than the promised 2 periods. To ensure we maintain stock during this high-demand summer phase while compensating for the 155-unit backend calculation error, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 468 (calculated as 4 periods of 117 units). This creates a base stock target that allows for the phantom inventory and the slightly extended lead time (L=3) to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent phantom inventory (155 units from P1) continues to necessitate explicit mu_hat adjustments to ensure sufficient base stock. Recent lead time observed as 3 periods (P23 order arrived P26).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: Currently in the mid-August seasonal demand peak for women's lingerie (hipster briefs). Average demand for P26-P27 is ~120 units/period. The inventory situation is critical: On-hand is 0, and In-transit is officially 461 units. However, 155 of these are 'phantom' units from a lost Period 1 shipment, leaving 306 units of genuine pipeline (191 from P24, 115 from P26). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 461 units of pipeline inventory from the base_stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this 155-unit calculation error and force an order. With an actual lead time (L) of 2-3 periods, I need to cover demand until Period 31. Expected demand (L+1) is approximately 360 units. To clear the 155-unit phantom inventory blockage and maintain a buffer given the recent stockouts, I set mu_hat explicitly to 515 (360 + 155), which forces the backend to recognize a higher target inventory level. I also set sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent high volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 (Womens Lingerie) is currently experiencing a sustained high-demand period in August, with demand averaging approximately 111 units per period since P26. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 553 units contains 155 units of phantom inventory from a lost Period 1 shipment. This necessitates using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the base stock target, effectively bypassing the OR engine's deduction of non-existent units from the pipeline. Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with P23 arriving in 3 periods; I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this variability. To maintain a strong service level during this peak, I'm setting mu_hat = (1+L) * 110 + 155 (phantom offset) \u2248 485, and using recent volatility for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed August demand plateau: Demand P26-P28 has stabilized at an average of 110.7 units/period. Phantom inventory of 155 units (P1) still persists in the system, requiring explicit base stock adjustments.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 continues to experience a high-demand regime throughout August, with an average demand of approximately 107.5 units per period over the last 8 weeks (P22-P29). Currently, the system shows 0 units on-hand and 553 units in-transit. However, the 553 units in-transit includes a 155-unit phantom shipment from Period 1 that was never delivered, meaning the true pipeline is 398 units. To account for this 155-unit calculation error in the OR backend (where base_stock = mu_hat - pipeline), I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. With a lead time of 2-3 periods, I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods. Using L=3 and a forecast of ~100 units/period, the required base stock is ~400 units. To offset the 155 phantom units and ensure the backend targets a real-world inventory of 400, I set mu_hat to 555 (400 + 155). This allows the OR engine to order sufficient stock despite the suppressed logic caused by the lost Period 1 shipment.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 is currently in a high-demand phase (August/September peak), with demand from P26-P30 averaging 102.8 units/period. The 155-unit phantom inventory from the lost Period 1 shipment continues to erroneously inflate pipeline inventory in the OR backend's logic, leading to systemic under-ordering. To ensure sufficient stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this phantom stock (base_stock = order + on-hand + (in-transit - phantom)). Current in-transit is 479, but actual physical in-transit (P24: 191, P26: 115, P30: 18) equals 324 units. Total pipeline (physical in-transit 324 + on-hand 18) = 342. Target base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~110 units/period is roughly 330, but given the service level requirements (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), a higher safety buffer is needed. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 550, which when balanced against the 479 reported in-transit and 18 on-hand by the OR engine, will trigger a sufficient replenishment order to maintain availability through the current peak.

Carry-over insight: Phanton inventory of 155 units from Period 1 remains in the 'In-transit' total, requiring persistent explicit mu_hat adjustments to prevent stockouts during demand peaks.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to suffer from the 155-unit phantom inventory (from the lost Period 1 shipment), which suppresses the OR backend's order logic. As of Period 32, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0). Recent demand has stabilized at a high level (P28-P31 avg: 86 units/period), although slightly down from the August peak (>100). The current 'In-transit' of 560 units includes the 155 phantom units, meaning the real pipeline is 405 units. These 405 units consist of orders from P24 (191 units), P26 (115), P30 (18), and P31 (81). The P24 order is now significantly overdue (7 periods since order), suggesting it might also be lost or severely delayed. To ensure we recover from the stockout and cover the (L+1) period demand window (approx 3 * 85 = 255 units), while accounting for the 155-unit phantom inventory subtraction, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I will use a high explicit mu_hat to force a base stock that exceeds the 'In-transit' calculation error. With L=2 and expected demand around 85, a healthy base stock is ~300-350. To achieve this when the backend sees 560 in transit, I will set mu_hat to 650 to trigger a meaningful order and maintain availability.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Potential second lost shipment identified (Period 24, 191 units) as it has not arrived by P31 conclude (7 periods elapsed). Total phantom inventory may now be 346 units (155 + 191).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has two confirmed or highly probable lost shipments in 'In-transit': Period 1 (155 units) and Period 24 (191 units), totaling 346 units of phantom inventory. This phantom inventory causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order size because it believes the pipeline is fuller than it is. To compensate, I use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Recent demand (P30-P32) has slowed from the August peak (~110) to an average of ~65 units. For a lead time of 2, the required base stock (covering L+1 periods) at a target service level of 80% (Profit 4 / (4+1)) is approximately 3 * 65 + safety stock. Given the 584 units 'In-transit', I must set an explicit mu_hat that, when combined with this inflated pipeline, still triggers a sufficient order. Current arriving units (P30/P31 orders) have bridged the gap, but to maintain stock against a forecast of ~60 units/period, I set mu_hat to 600, which forces the backend to maintain a base stock higher than the phantom inventory level.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory likely 346 units (P1: 155, P24: 191). Post-August peak demand (P30-P32) has stabilized at ~65 units/period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 is currently experiencing a demand surge (138 units in P33), likely representing a final peak or high volatility following the August plateau. Historical analysis confirms a multi-period 'phantom inventory' issue: Period 1 (155 units) and Period 24 (191 units) are both lost, totaling 346 units that the OR backend wrongly counts as in-transit. This 'In-transit' figure of 585 units is actually composed of 346 lost units and 239 true units (123 from P32, 1 from P33, and 115 from P26 which hasn't concluded arrival yet though P30/P31 did). To force the engine to order despite this 346-unit discrepancy, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock for L=2 is roughly 3 periods of demand (P, P+1, P+2). Given the recent demand of ~138 and a 3-period average of ~86, I will set a safe mu_hat estimate that accounts for the phantom inventory blockage. I set mu_hat explicitly to 500 to ensure the base stock (approx 500-600) exceeds the total recorded pipeline (585) enough to trigger an order to cover the current 0 on-hand status.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand surge to 138 units in P33, deviating from the ~65 average. Total phantom inventory confirmed at 346 units (P1: 155, P24: 191), causing continuous order suppression by the backend.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to be plagued by 'phantom inventory'. There are 585 units 'In-transit', but history shows two confirmed lost shipments: Period 1 (155 units) and Period 24 (191 units), totaling 346 units of phantom inventory. Period 24 is now 11 periods overdue (promised L=2). Accounting for this, true pipeline inventory is 585 - 346 = 239 units (specifically the orders from P26, P32, and P33). Demand has stabilized at roughly 75-80 units/period after the August peak but spiked in P33 (138). To calculate the order, the backend uses: base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). With on-hand=0 and in-transit=585, the backend thinks we have 585 units arriving. To force the OR engine to order enough to cover 3 periods of demand (~240 units total) while it subtracts 585, I must set \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) to (240 + 585) = 825. This ensures the base_stock is high enough to generate an order despite the 346-unit phantom inventory blockage.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 346 units (P1: 155, P24: 191). Post-peak demand has settled around 75-80 units/period, requiring explicit mu_hat of ~825 to overcome the 585-unit in-transit inflation and maintain stock levels.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (October 14, 2019), the system has an on-hand inventory of 103 and a reported in-transit of 750 units. My check of the history confirms a total of 346 units of phantom inventory: 155 units from Period 1 and 191 units from Period 24. These orders are significantly past any reasonable lead time and are effectively lost, yet they inflate the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, suppressing orders. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat to a value that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the 346 phantom units. Current demand has subsided from the August peak but remains around 75-80 units/period (P34-P35). Estimating a base stock requirement of ~240 (3 periods * 80) plus the 346 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 586 (representing approximately 80 units/period * 3 periods + 346 offset). This ensures the backend (base_stock - pipeline) calculation results in a target inventory level that matches real demand despite the system errors. Lead time L is set to 2 as the recent average remains between 2 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Confirmed total phantom inventory of 346 units (P1: 155, P24: 191) continues to inflate pipeline inventory. Post-August demand has settled into a 75-80 units/period range.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track significant phantom inventory totaling 346 units (155 units from Period 1 and 191 units from Period 24), which remains in the 'In-transit' bucket despite being lost. Current on-hand inventory is 385 units. In Period 36, demand dropped significantly to 7 units, following a trend of lower post-August/September demand. The average demand over the last four periods (P33-P36) is approximately 60 units, but the most recent two periods (P35-P36) averaged only 13.5 units, suggesting a transition into a low-demand late-autumn regime. With 385 units on hand and 115 units of real 'In-transit' stock (from P26) which should arrive soon (ordered P26, currently P37, observed lead times 1-3 periods), the current stock levels are more than sufficient to cover demand for several periods. Because the OR backend subtracts the 346 phantom units from the target base stock, I must use an explicit mu_hat to prevent the system from being blocked entirely, even if no ordering is required this period. I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~50 units per period for (L+1) periods, but since on-hand (385) + real in-transit (115) = 500, which is > (~50 * 3), no new orders will be triggered.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 currently has 382 units on-hand, which is significantly high given the recent demand drop. Demand in P36-P37 averaged only 5 units/period, indicating the end of the August-September peak. Furthermore, the 'In-transit' figure of 461 units contains 346 units of confirmed phantom inventory (P1: 155, P24: 191), meaning the actual pipeline is 115 units. Combined with the 382 units on-hand, the total effective inventory is approximately 497 units. With average demand now well below 10 units/period, no further ordering is required. To prevent the OR backend from attempting to 'top up' based on the phantom-inflated pipeline calculation, I am setting mu_hat to a low explicit value. This will result in a base stock lower than the calculated inventory, suppressing new orders and allowing the existing surplus to be consumed while minimizing additional holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed (P36-P37): Demand has dropped to an average of <10 units/period. Total phantom inventory remains confirmed at 346 units (P1: 155, P24: 191).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a post-peak low-demand regime, with demand over the last three periods (P36-P38) averaging only 4.33 units. On-hand inventory is high at 379 units, which is more than sufficient to cover multiple periods of current demand. However, the OR engine's 'In-transit' figure of 461 units is heavily inflated by confirmed phantom inventory: 155 units from Period 1 and 191 units from Period 24 (totaling 346 units). The remaining 115 units represent the Period 26 order which is also likely lost or severely delayed (12 periods elapsed). Combined, these 461 units of phantom/lost inventory would normally prevent the backend from ordering if demand were to spike. Given the current on-hand surplus and extremely low demand, no new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3-period regime to reflect current demand (~4.3 units/period), resulting in a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand, thus preventing unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: The Period 26 order (115 units) is now 12 periods overdue, bringing the total estimated phantom/lost inventory to 576 units (P1: 155, P24: 191, P26: 115). High on-hand inventory (379 units) currently mitigates the risk of this 'In-transit' inflation causing a stockout during the current low-demand phase.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a very low-demand regime (P37-P39 demand: 3, 3, 3), following an August-September peak. Current on-hand inventory is 376 units, which is extremely high relative to current demand (~125 periods of coverage). The 'In-transit' total of 461 units is heavily inflated by phantom/lost inventory from Period 1 (155), Period 24 (191), and Period 26 (115), totaling 461 units. Since the total in-transit quantity exactly matches the sum of these missing orders, it is certain that no actual stock is on the way. Given the massive inventory surplus and low demand, no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the current low-demand stability while allowing the high on-hand stock to naturally deplete.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 461 units is confirmed as 100% phantom/lost (P1: 155, P24: 191, P26: 115). High on-hand inventory (376 units) provides excessive cover for the current low-demand regime (<5 units/period).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained low-demand regime (November). Since Period 36, demand has been very low, averaging ~6 units per period. We have significant on-hand inventory (356 units), which provides massive coverage (approx 59 weeks) even if demand increases slightly. The 'In-transit' figure of 461 units is confirmed as phantom inventory from lost shipments in Periods 1 (155), 24 (191), and 26 (115). This phantom inventory would normally suppress ordering, but because we are so overstocked, it is currently irrelevant for ordering decisions. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand environment. Default lead time is used as lead time variability remains present but doesn't impact current strategy due to high inventory.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total remains 461 units (P1: 155, P24: 191, P26: 115). The November demand regime is confirmed low, averaging ~6 units over the last 5 periods (P36-P40).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 719957006 is currently in Period 42. Demand in Period 41 spiked to 135 units, which is a significant departure from the previous 5-period average of ~7 units. This volatility likely represents a pre-holiday or Black Friday effect given the date (Nov 25). However, on-hand inventory remains at 221 units, providing sufficient safety stock even with this spike. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' quantity of 461 units is confirmed as phantom inventory from lost shipments (Period 1: 155, Period 24: 191, Period 26: 115). This phantom stock inflates the pipeline total and suppresses the OR backend's ordering logic. Since we have 221 units on hand and a lead time of ~2 periods, we are well-covered for the current demand surge. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent demand increase (averaging ~53 units/period) while allowing the on-hand stock to naturally deplete without over-ordering against the phantom 461 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand surge in P41 (135 units) suggests a seasonal or promotional peak. Phantom inventory remains at 461 units, suppressing pipeline replenishment.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand December/Holiday peak, with demand increasing from 135 in P41 to 308 in P42. The system has run out of on-hand inventory (0 units). A critical issue remains: 461 units are 'In-transit' but are confirmed phantom inventory from lost shipments (P1: 155, P24: 191, P26: 115). Because the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory (461) from the base stock to calculate orders, and given that 461 units likely exceeds any standard base stock calculation for 3 periods, the system will naturally order 0 units unless mu_hat is set explicitly high to overcome this 461-unit offset. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered for the holiday season, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1100 units. This targets a base stock that covers the 461 phantom units plus approximately 640 units of real inventory (sufficient for roughly 2 periods of 300+ demand). sigma_hat is set explicitly to 150 to account for high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: December peak confirmed: Demand surged to 308 in P42. Total phantom inventory remains 461 units (P1, P24, P26), necessitating explicit mu_hat overrides to bypass order suppression.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak December holiday season for the product 'Ginger Ch hipster ctn 3p'. Demand in P42 (308) and P41 (135) confirms this seasonal surge. After a stockout in P42/P43, we placed a large order of 510 units in P43, which is currently in transit. The 'In-transit' figure is 971, but this is heavily distorted by 461 units of confirmed phantom/lost inventory (P1: 155, P24: 191, P26: 115). Therefore, the 'real' pipeline is 510 units. Since current on-hand is 0, we must ensure the base stock is high enough to generate replenishment despite the 461-unit phantom inflation. Based on P42/P43 demand, a forecast of ~300 units per period for the immediate next 2-3 weeks is necessary. To achieve a base stock (L+1 periods) that produces an order on top of the 971 quoted in-transit, we need mu_hat to be roughly (3 periods * 300) + 461 phantom offset = ~1361. Setting mu_hat to 1350 to maintain pressure for a secondary holiday shipment as we approach the end of the year (47 periods total).

Carry-over insight: December seasonal peak confirmed: P42 demand reached 308 units. Total phantom inventory remains confirmed at 461 units (P1, P24, P26), which continues to suppress automated ordering by inflating the pipeline inventory calculations.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak. Demand in Period 42 surged to 308, and subsequent periods (P43-P44) show sustained high demand of 87 and 83 despite stockouts. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 1529 units; however, historical analysis confirms a massive accumulation of phantom inventory from lost shipments: Period 1 (155), Period 24 (191), and Period 26 (115), totaling at least 461 units. Recent orders (P43: 510, P44: 558) represent legitimate replenishment attempt. To ensure the backend places an order for Period 45 to cover the upcoming late-December/January demand, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1200. This value accounts for the ~461 phantom units plus a lead-time demand forecast for 'L+1' (3 periods) based on the holiday surge (~250 units/period). This override is necessary because the OR backend's automated logic will subtract the 1529 'In-transit' units from the base stock calculation, effectively blocking any new orders unless the mu_hat is set high enough to compensate for this phantom inflation and required stock level.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed phantom inventory remains at least 461 units (P1, P24, P26). Current 'In-transit' of 1529 includes these lost units plus high-volume orders from P43-P44 intended for the December peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the December seasonal peak for lingerie. Period 42 saw a massive spike to 308 units, and P43-P45 demand remains elevated (average ~95). Looking at history, late December/early January 2019 saw demand of 140 units, suggesting the peak is not yet over. | Inventory Situation: On-hand is 395. 'In-transit' is reported as 1019. However, 461 units of this are confirmed lost/phantom (P1: 155, P24: 191, P26: 115) and will never arrive. The actual pipeline is 1019 - 461 = 558 units (the order from P44). | Strategy: Total actual inventory (on-hand + true in-transit) = 395 + 558 = 953 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order if needed and doesn't stop due to the phantom 461 units, I must use an explicit mu_hat set high enough to cover (L+1) periods of peak demand plus the phantom inventory offset. Assuming a peak demand of ~150-200 units/period and L=2, base stock needs to be ~600 + 461 = 1061. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1100 to maintain stock for the remainder of the holiday surge and offset the calculation error caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed that 'In-transit' contains 461 units of phantom inventory from lost orders (P1, P24, P26). Actual pipeline as of P46 is 558 units (ordered P44).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are coming off the December peak. Demand in Period 46 dropped to 32 units, following the 83-115 range in Periods 44-45. We have 363 units on hand. The 'In-transit' total of 1019 units is highly distorted: it contains 461 units of confirmed phantom inventory (from lost orders in P1, P24, and P26) and 558 units from the Period 44 order. Actual pipeline inventory is just the 558 units from P44, which are expected to arrive in Period 47 or 48. Total real inventory (On-hand + Real In-transit) is 363 + 558 = 921 units. With the seasonal peak subsiding, demand is expected to return to a lower baseline (potentially similar to the post-August regime of ~60-80 or the October-November low of <10). Since 921 units cover many weeks of even moderate demand, no new order is needed. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 461 phantom units as valid pipeline and potentially under-ordering in future periods, and to account for the current 'In-transit' reflecting 1019, I will set mu_hat conservatively using a recent 5-period average (approx 144 units per period including the peak) to ensure the base stock calculation remains robust, though the high existing stock will likely result in a zero order anyway.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: December peak has peaked (P42: 308) and is now subsiding (P46: 32). Total phantom inventory confirmed at 461 units (P1, P24, P26), which continues to occupy 'In-transit' space.
