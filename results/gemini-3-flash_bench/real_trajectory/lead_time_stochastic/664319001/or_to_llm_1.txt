Given the holding cost is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit, a slightly higher service level is warranted to ensure no lost sales during the initial lead time.

The product is a 'Tiblisi paperwaist tapered' trouser for women. As we move into late February/early March, demand for spring fashion usually increases or remains steady. \n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. Pipeline is 56 units.

OR's base stock calculation (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302) for 3 periods (L+1) likely targets around 60-65 units. Since 56 are in transit, it recommends a small top-up. \n5. **Adjustment**: I will slightly increase the OR recommendation to 12 units.

This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed/lost. \n2. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (14, 26, 16) is slightly higher than the pre-game historical average (~17). The product is 'Womens Everyday Collection' trousers, which likely has stable demand, but we are currently losing all sales due to zero stock.\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. Pipeline (In-transit) is 68 units (30 from P1, 26 from P2, 12 from P3). \n4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR agent recommends 0 units because the pipeline (68) already exceeds its calculated base stock for a 2-period lead time. However, the OR agent is oblivious to the fact that the Period 1 order (30 units) is already late. \n5. **Strategy**: Since we have 68 units in the pipeline and zero on-hand, we are waiting for arrivals. Ordering more now would likely lead to an overstock once the late shipments arrive, especially with a $1/unit holding cost vs $4 profit.

However, P16 conclude showed 0 arrivals. This indicates that shipments are currently delayed or P13/P14 are lost. 2. **Demand Analysis**: Significant seasonality for these trousers is evident. Demand has peaked and stabilized between 110-170 units over the last 5 periods (mean ~140). 3. **Inventory Position**: Current On-hand is 0. In-transit is 466 (composed of P13: 120, P14: 120, P15: 160, plus residuals from likely lost early orders). 4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR agent recommends 0 because the pipeline (466) exceeds its calculated base-stock. However, the pipeline is highly unreliable right now with zero arrivals in the last two concluded periods despite orders exceeding promised lead times. 5. **Strategy**: Since demand is high (140+/week) and the pipeline is failing to deliver, I must continue ordering to regain stock even if it risks overcompensating if old orders suddenly arrive. I will ignore the 0 recommendation and place an order to cover one more week of peak demand (147 units).",

Recent demand (P39-P42) has averaged 15.25 units/week, down from the peak summer levels. Currently, there are 49 units on-hand. While the system reports an In-transit total of 786 units, my carry-over history indicates that approximately 762 of these units (from P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19, P26, and P34) are confirmed lost due to persistent supplier reliability failures. The adjusted viable pipeline is effectively zero or negligible. However, even with only 49 units on-hand, the inventory covers more than 3 weeks of current demand (49 / 15.25 \u2248 3.2). Given the promised lead time of 2 periods and the current downward-trending seasonal regime, 49 units provide a sufficient buffer to avoid stockouts without incurring unnecessary holding costs.

The OR recommendation of 0 units is based on the unadjusted pipeline and historical averages that don't reflect the recent demand spike or the massive shipment losses.

The only potentially viable order is the 80 units placed in Period 44, which has a promised lead time of 2 periods and should arrive during Period 46. Given the recent demand spike to 125 units, 80 units arriving today will not be enough to satisfy current demand, and I am already out of stock.

Recent demand in P45 and P46 was 125 and 92 units respectively, confirming a shift far above the low-season average. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1116 units is misleading due to severe historical reliability issues: 762 units (from P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19, P26, and P34) are considered lost. Subtracting these leaves 354 units potentially in the pipeline. Of these, 80 units were ordered in P44 and 250 in P46. Based on a 2-3 period lead time, the P44 order (80 units) should arrive during P47, and the P46 order (250 units) should arrive around P48-P49. While the OR recommends 0 (likely overestimating the viability of the 1116 units in transit), I will place a conservative order of 100 units. This serves as a buffer against further pipeline losses and ensures stock for the sustained demand regime observed in December, balancing the high holding cost ($1.0) against the stockout risk in the final periods.",
