Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 568597006 (Hayes slim trouser). The current date is mid-February, following the provided historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4). The historical demand mean is 88.4 (79, 80, 88, 115, 80). There is a slight peak on 2019-01-28 (115), but it returned to 80 in the last sample. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, an immediate order is required to cover the lead time (2 periods) and the current period's demand (L+1 = 3 periods). Using 'default' methods for the first period will utilize all 5 historical samples to calculate the baseline. No lead-time history is available yet, so 'default' (promised L=2) is appropriate.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Hayes slim trouser' (Womens Tailoring). Historical demand samples show values of 79, 80, 88, 115, 80, and Period 1 demand was 71. The mean demand across these 6 points is approximately 85.5. In Period 1, we ordered 114 units (the system's initial estimate). Those 114 units are currently in-transit. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, we expect the order placed in P1 to arrive during P3 and be visible in P4's decision phase. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is occurring (71 last period), we are currently experiencing lost sales. The OR backend uses (1+L) * mean for mu_hat. With L=2, (1+2)*85.5 = 256.5. I will use the recent_N method (N=6) to capture the most recent demand baseline to ensure the base stock calculation includes the latest sample (71). Standard deviation over these 6 points is approx 15.3, so sigma_hat (sqrt(3)*15.3) will be calculated by the backend.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history (provided samples) shows a range of 79-115 per week, with recently concluded periods showing demand of 71 and 123. The product is a 'Womens Tailoring' trouser, which often sees stable or slightly increasing demand during the transition from winter to spring. Inventory is currently 0 with 225 units in-transit (114 from P1, 111 from P2). Given a promised lead time of 2, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible at the start of P4. I will set L to 'default' (2). For mu_hat, the recent demand of 123 in P2 suggests a possible uptick from the 70s-80s range; using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P1, P2, and the 3 latest provided samples) captures this recent volatility while maintaining a stable average. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the high variance observed between P1 (71) and P2 (123).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. We are looking at a women's professional garment (suit trousers). Historical demand samples show a baseline around 80-90, but recent game environment demand (Periods 1-3) has been 71, 123, and 90, averaging 94.6. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (ordered=114) should have arrived during P3 and been visible in the P3 conclude message read at the start of P4. However, the P3 conclude message shows arrived=0 for SKU 568597006. This suggests either a lead time longer than 2 or a lost shipment. Since the 'In-transit' total is 320 (114+111+95), the P1 order is still in the pipeline. I will set L to 3 explicitly to account for this delay and use the recent 3 periods of game demand to forecast mu_hat. This higher L increases the base stock level to cover the longer replenishment cycle while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time exceeds promised 2 periods; P1 order (placed 2019-02-11) not arrived by P3 conclude (2019-02-25).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a women's slim trouser. Demand history shows relative stability with a slight upward trend in late January (Period -3 to -1) followed by an average of around 87 units per week over the last four weeks (71, 123, 90, 63). The 'Period 4 conclude' message confirms that the Period 2 order arrived with a lead time of 2 periods (arriving in Period 4 resolution). However, the Period 1 order (ordered 2019-02-11) is still missing. Since the Period 2 order arrived but the Period 1 order did *not*, we must assume the Period 1 order (114 units) is lost. I am setting L to the promised lead time of 2, as the Period 2 arrival timing was consistent. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the mean of the available period samples (approx 87) multiplied by (1+L) = 3, totaling 261. Given the recent variability (63 to 123), I'll use a recent_N of 4 to capture this current regime's volatility for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (114 units) confirmed lost: Period 2 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=2) while Period 1 order remains outstanding.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18. Historical demand samples (79, 80, 88, 115, 80) and game history demand (71, 123, 90, 63, 105) show an average of approximately 89 units per period. Product is 'Women's Tailoring Hayes slim trouser', which typically sees steady demand transitioning into spring. Inventory situation is critical: On-hand is 0 due to the confirmed lost Period 1 shipment (114 units). The Period 2 shipment arrived on time (L=2) in Period 4. Period 3 (95 units) and Period 4 (103 units) orders are in-transit; P3 should arrive this period (P6) if L=2 and P4 next period (P7). Given the lost shipment and recent stockout (Ending Inventory=0 in P5), I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods. L=2 is the observed reliable lead time for the P2 order. For mu_hat, N=8 (5 historical + 3 game samples with demand visibility) provides a stable mean of ~90. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the volatility seen in the game history (range 63-123).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), we are managing 'Hayes slim trouser'. The Period 1 order (114 units) is confirmed lost, as the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (actual lead time = 2) while Period 1 remained missing. This has led to a stockout since Period 5. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 312 units in transit (likely from orders in P3, P4, and potentially P5/P6 if the OR engine placed them). The promised lead time is 2, and the actual lead time for the only successful delivery (P2 order) was 2. Historical demand from the prompt and game history (samples: 79, 80, 88, 115, 80, 71, 123, 90, 63, 105, 95) shows a mean around 90. To recover from the stockout and account for the lost shipment, I will use a recent_N window (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility. L will remain at the promised 'default' of 2, as the actual observed lead time matched the promised duration.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Looking at history, the Period 1 order (114 units) is confirmed lost, while the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. There is a significant pipeline of 312 units (from orders in P3, P4, and potentially subsequent logic). Demand shows a slight upward trend from the pre-game samples (avg ~88) to the in-game samples (avg ~89 over 7 periods), but the last 4 periods have been consistently higher (63, 105, 95, 78; avg 85.25) than the very first game week (71). Given the loss of the first shipment and current zero inventory, we need to ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the recent mean of ~88 units/period, and default lead time (L=2) as the Period 2 order confirmed the promised lead time remains the target. Note: The OR backend will subtract the 312 units in-transit from the calculated base stock, which may result in a zero order this period if the pipeline already exceeds the target service level.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/08. On-hand inventory is 0, and 312 units are in transit. Historical analysis shows a lost order (Period 1) and a confirmed lead time of 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Recent demand (Periods 4-8) has fluctuated, with an average around 90 units (63, 105, 95, 78, 108). Total demand across the (L+1)=3 period window (current + lead time) is estimated at 270 units. Since 312 units are already in transit from recent orders (likely from Periods 3 and 4), the pipeline inventory covers the expected demand for the lead time duration. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect current demand levels and keep L at the promised 2 periods as the only successful delivery matched this.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019-04-15). The product is a women's suit trouser, a fairly steady staple. Historical demand samples (P1-P9 and pre-game data) show a mean around 87 units/week with a standard deviation around 17. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and 312 units are in-transit (orders from P3 and P4). The P1 order (114 units) is confirmed lost as P2 arrived in P4. The P3 order (95 units) was placed on 2019-02-25; with a promised lead time of 2, it was expected in P5 conclude, but has not arrived by P9 conclude (4 periods late). The P4 order (103 units) is also potentially delayed or lost. Given the significant stockouts and the unreliable arrival history, the OR backend's default base-stock calculation (using promised lead time L=2) will be insufficient because it doesn't account for the 'pipeline' being occupied by likely-lost units. I will set L to 4 to reflect the persistent delays/losses and use the full history for demand forecasting (mu and sigma) to stabilize the order quantity against recent volatility, ensuring we signal the OR backend to replenish the stock for a 5-period window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: P3 order (95 units) and P4 order (103 units) are now critically delayed or lost as of P9; pipeline inventory is unreliable.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/22. Historically, demand for this SKU (Womens Suit Trousers) has averaged around 85 units/period (Historical mean: 88, Game history mean: 85.8). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. The supply chain is highly unreliable: P1, P3, and P4 orders are likely lost (missing for 7-10 periods). Only the P2 and P10 orders show normal patterns, though P10 hasn't arrived yet. Consequently, the OR backend's pipeline inventory count of 432 is overstated because it includes P1 (114), P3 (95), and P4 (103), totaling 312 likely lost units. Only 120 units (P10) are legitimately in transit. To force the OR engine to order despite the 'ghost' pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat (target stock) to a value that exceeds the phantom 432 units. Since the backend calculates 'order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)', I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat at 550 (approx 6.5 periods of demand) to trigger an order to replenish stock, while keeping L at default (2) for the lead time component and sigma_hat at default to account for high demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: P1, P3, and P4 orders (total 312 units) are confirmed lost as of P11; pipeline inventory is unreliable.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand is relatively stable, but the supply chain is highly unreliable. As identified in previous periods, orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 312 units) are confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 579 is misleading because it includes these lost units. The actual active pipeline consists only of orders from P10 (120 units) and P11 (147 units). Since ON-HAND is 0 and promised lead time is 2, the order from P10 should arrive during P12 and be visible at the start of P13. Demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) has averaged 73.4 units/week. To account for the lost stock and the 'In-transit' inflation, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the pipeline includes 312 ghost units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to ensure a real order is placed to meet upcoming demand until P10/P11 arrivals stabilize. However, the backend also has a cap. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the most recent regime) and set L to default (2), but I will monitor the loss of units closely. No new sustained pattern is detected beyond the previously reported stock losses.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 13 (2019-05-06). The SKU (568597006 - Women's suit trousers) is experiencing severe stockouts due to a string of lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, and 4) which were officially confirmed in Period 11. Pipeline inventory currently shows 579 units, but 312 of these are attributed to those lost orders (P1: 114, P3: 95, P4: 103). The OR backend's inventory tracking includes these 'ghost' units, leading it to under-order or not order at all when subtraction occurs (base_stock - pipeline). To compensate, I am setting L=3 to account for potential shipment delays observed earlier, even though P2 arrived in 2. Demand is relatively stable with no clear seasonal trend for this SKU in the provided window (avg ~84 units/period), so I will use a recent N approach (N=7 to capture the post-initial-volatility phase) to estimate demand. Most importantly, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat to 'pad' the base stock calculation, effectively forcing an order to overcome the 312-unit deficit in the pipeline inventory caused by lost shipments. This allows the system to target a higher inventory level that accounts for the fact that ~312 units in 'in-transit' will never arrive.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019-05-13), we have confirmation that the supply chain is partially restored: the Period 11 order (147 units) arrived after 2 periods, while the Period 10 order (120 units) and earlier orders (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost. Total in-transit is currently reported as 542, but 312 units (P1, P3, P4) and likely 120 units (P10) are lost. This leaves approximately 110 units (from P13) as valid pipeline inventory. Demand remains relatively stable between 50-110 units. I am setting L=2 (confirmed by P11 arrival) and using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers periods 9-13: 62, 63, 56, 110, 77; Mean=73.6) to capture the current demand level. mu_hat reflects 3 periods (L+1) of demand. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to match the current volatility context.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Period 10 order (120 units) confirmed lost; only P13 order (110 units) is considered valid in-transit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568597006 (women's suit trousers) shows consistent historical demand with a mean of ~86 units. However, supply chain reliability is very poor. Historically, orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 have been lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 542 units in-transit, but based on the Carry-Over Insights, we must discount lost shipments (P1: 114, P3: 95, P4: 103, P10: 120 = 432 units). The only actionable pipelines are P13 (ordered 110, due P15) and any subsequent orders. Since P13 should arrive this period, we need to ensure replenishment covers the next lead time window (L+1=3). Demand is stable (recent mean ~83 over the last 5 periods), so I use N=10 to smooth the forecast. I set L=2 (promised) as recent successful deliveries (P11) adhered to it.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568597006' (Hayes slim trouser) shows a volatile supply chain with frequent lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10). The current 'In-transit' of 542 units is highly inflated by these losses. Based on history, only the order from Period 13 (110 units) had a chance of arriving, but it hasn't appeared by P15 conclude (expected lead time is 2). If P13 is still coming, it should arrive in P16 or P17. However, the 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard (542) likely includes P1, P3, P4, P10, P11, and P13. We only trust the orders from P13 (110 units) as potentially valid. Since inventory is currently 0, we need to order to cover demand. The average demand across all historical samples (including the initial ones) is approximately 84.7 units per week. With L=2, we need to cover (2+1=3) weeks of demand, roughly 254 units. Given the extreme unreliability of the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a robust base stock target while using the default lead time (2) to allow the OR backend's capping mechanism to function without being overly restricted by the inflated 'In-transit' count. I use mu_hat based on the mean of the last 15 periods (approx 85) * (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Reliability of pipeline continues to be low; P13 order (110 units) is now overdue by one period beyond promised lead time but not yet confirmed lost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is Women's Trousers. Looking at history, demand is relatively stable, averaging around 82 units per week. However, supply reliability is extremely poor. Carry-over insights and history show significant lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10). Specifically, the P13 order of 110 units (placed May 6) is now 4 periods old; since the promised lead time is 2, it is highly likely lost or severely delayed. The 'In-transit' figure of 542 units is likely inflated by these ghost orders. I will treat the pipeline as effectively zero to force the OR engine to place a fresh order to cover the next cycles, as on-hand is currently 0. Demand method 'recent_N' with N=5 (P12-P16) reflects the most recent sales environment, averaging 76.8 units/period. Over L+1 (3 periods), the required mu_hat is 230.4. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this target is met despite the unreliable 'In-transit' data being used by the backend.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Period 13 order (110 units) is confirmed lost/severely delayed (4 periods since order, promised 2); total confirmed lost units now include P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/06/10), the 'Hayes slim trouser' (Womens Tailoring) shows a significant supply chain reliability issue. Out of 1050 total units historically 'In-transit', several shipments are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13), totaling 542 units. These 542 units represent the current 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard, meaning effectively zero units are expected to arrive. On-hand inventory is also 0. Demand has trended downwards from an average of ~85 units to ~54 units over the last 3 periods (P15-P17). To recover from the stockout caused by lost shipments, I am setting an explicit L=2 (promised) to trigger an order immediately. I will use the last 5 samples for mu_hat (mean=59.8) to account for the recent demand decrease, while maintaining a higher sigma_hat (using all 17 samples) to provide a safety buffer against the high volatility and recent lost-order disruptions.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Dashboard 'In-transit' of 542 units consists entirely of confirmed lost/severely delayed orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13); actual expected pipeline is zero.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/6/17), the SKU 568597006 (Hayes slim trouser) has 0 units on-hand and 542 units listed as 'In-transit'. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, all 542 units in-transit (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13) are confirmed lost or severely delayed (e.g., P13 was ordered 6 weeks ago with a promised lead time of 2 weeks). Consequently, the actual expected pipeline is zero. The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see the 'In-transit' 542 and produce a net zero order if I do not intervene. To force an order that covers local demand despite the 'phantom' inventory, I must set mu_hat (the target level) high enough to exceed 542 plus the desired stock level. Current demand (last 5 periods: 60, 57, 45, 39) shows a downward trend, averaging ~50 units/period. For a lead time of 2, the window is 3 periods. Expected demand is roughly 150 units. To secure an order while bypassing the 542 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 750 (approx 542 ghost + 200 buffer) and sigma_hat to 100 to handle volatility. This will result in an order of approximately 200 units (750 - 542), which is consistent with the backend cap formula.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Demand for this item (women's suit trousers) has shown a steady decline over the last 6 periods, dropping from ~100 units/week in early May to under 40 units/week recently. Average demand of the last 6 periods (P14-P19) is 55.6 units. The product is in a low-demand regime. Regarding inventory: On-hand is 0. The 'In-transit' of 835 units is highly unreliable. It includes confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13 (total 542 units). Subtracting these from the current 835 leaves 293 units, which matches exactly the order placed in Period 19. According to the promised lead time of 2, the P19 order is expected to arrive in Period 21. Since the OR backend uses a capped policy (base_stock - pipeline), and it incorrectly sees 835 units in the pipeline, it will likely order 0. To force an order despite the phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate base_stock for (L+1) periods. Expected demand is ~50/week. Mean = 3 periods * 50 = 150. z-score for 80% service level (~4:1 profit-to-holding ratio) is ~0.84. However, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 542 units of dead inventory the OR engine thinks are coming. Target Base Stock = (3 * 50) + 542 = 692. I will set mu_hat to 680 and sigma_hat higher to ensure the backend generates a sufficient order to cover the current stockout and future demand, accounting for the unreliability of the 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified 'In-transit' contains 542 units of confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13); Only the P19 order (293 units) is live. Recent demand (P14-P19) averaged 55.6 units, reflecting a significant seasonal decrease from the 80-100/week seen previously.

The current 'In-transit' of 835 units includes these 542 lost units plus the P19 order (293 units). We are now in a new demand regime; since P14, demand has significantly dropped, averaging 42.1 units over the last 7 periods (P14-P20), compared to the earlier historical average near 80-100. This decline likely reflects seasonality for 'Hayes slim trouser' during the height of summer. The OR backend's 'cap' logic uses pipeline inventory, which is currently inflated by lost orders. To force an order and maintain stock despite the ghost pipeline, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock = (Mean Demand * (L+1)) + Safety Stock. With mean demand ~42, and L=2, base stock needs to be ~170. However, because the backend sees 835 units in transit, it will place 0 orders unless mu_hat + z*sigma_hat > 835. I will set mu_hat to 950 to ensure the policy triggers an order to cover upcoming demand, while setting sigma_hat to represent the recent volatility (std dev ~22).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 14-20 average demand dropped to 42.1 units (-50% vs early periods). Cumulative lost orders confirmed: 542 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/8. Demand analysis shows a significant regime shift: demand averaged ~85/week in early periods but dropped to ~42/week (P14-P20). However, Period 21 showed a sudden spike to 72, which might be a volatility outlier or a new trend. I will use recent_N=8 to capture this lower/volatile regime (P14-P21 average: 45.8). Lead time reliability is extremely poor; 'In-transit' shows 982 units, but history confirms 542 units are lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). Subtracting these, the active pipeline consists of P19 (293 units) and P21 (147 units). Since only P19 is currently due based on promised lead time (L=2) and on-hand is 0, the OR engine needs to compensate for the lost units incorrectly counted in the pipeline. I will set L to 'default' (2) but use 'explicit' for mu_hat at (1+L)*150 = 450 to effectively force an order that accounts for the fact that 55% of the reported pipeline inventory is non-existent, ensuring we have stock despite the low nominal demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Pipeline integrity remains compromised; 542 units currently in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). Active pipeline consists only of orders from P19 and P21.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), the system shows 982 units in-transit. Based on 'Carry-over Insights', 542 units are confirmed lost from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 13. The remaining active pipeline consists of P19 (293 units) and P21 (147 units). The P19 order, placed on June 17 with a 2-period promised lead time, is now significantly overdue (it should have arrived in Period 21), and there is still zero on-hand inventory. This confirms a pattern of severe supply chain instability or loss. Demand has shifted: after a slump (P14-P20 average of ~52), the last two periods (P21-P22) have seen a bounce back to 72 and 89 units respectively, possibly indicating a mid-summer sales period. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the shift from the slump to the current recovery while maintaining a cautious forecast. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 982 'in-transit' units from its calculated base stock, and 542 are phantom/lost, the OR engine will stop ordering. I must use an 'explicit' L value to reflect that shipments are taking longer or not arriving, but since the OR engine uses L to calculate both the base stock and the cap, increasing L alone won't force an order if the pipeline is inflated. However, my primary goal is to ensure the backend uses realistic demand figures. I'll set N=9 for demand to weight the recent recovery.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand spike observed in P21-P22 (avg 80.5) following the P14-P20 slump, suggesting a mid-summer recovery. P19 order (293 units) is now 2 periods overdue beyond promised lead time, increasing the probability of it being lost or severely delayed.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (2019-07-22), we observe the following: 1) The 'arrived=147' in Period 23 confirms the P21 order arrived with the promised lead time of 2. 2) The P19 order (293 units) placed on 2019-06-17 is now 4 periods old; since P21 (placed later) has arrived, the P19 order is confirmed lost. This brings the total confirmed lost units in 'In-transit' to 835 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and now P19). 3) Effectively, 'In-transit' is zero for the OR backend's calculation. 4) Demand has shifted: From P15-P20, demand averaged 45 units/week. In P21-P23, it spiked to an average of 77.6 units/week, likely due to a mid-summer seasonal change for women's tailoring/trousers. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this recent recovery, and use an explicit lead time L=5 to force the OR backend to ignore the lost 'In-transit' inventory. Since pipeline_inventory is 835 and L=2 would result in a base stock much lower than the phantom pipeline, setting L to 5 or higher increases the base stock target enough to trigger a new order, effectively bypassing the 835 units of 'noise'.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Period 19 order (293 units) confirmed lost as P21 order arrived while P19 did not. Total confirmed lost units in dashboard 'In-transit' is 835. Recent demand (P21-P23) has recovered to an average of 77.6 units/week.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/29. We are in Period 25. The product is Women's suit trousers. Historical demand shows a drop in June (avg ~35) across periods 18-20, followed by a recovery in July (avg ~70) across periods 21-23. The most recent demand (P24) was 52. I will use a 4-period window (P21-P24) to capture this post-slump recovery, which averages 71.25 units/week. Supply chain reliability remains very poor. Total 'In-transit' is 929 units, but 835 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). The only active pipeline is the order from P24 (94 units). Because the OR engine uses the full 'In-transit' value (929) to calculate the order, and the base stock for a 2-period lead time and ~71 mean demand will be significantly lower than 929, the engine will likely order 0 units repeatedly unless I use 'explicit' to bypass this. Since on-hand is low (23) and only 94 units are actually coming, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or use explicit L to adjust the inventory position logic. However, since I cannot control the engine's perception of 'pipeline_inventory', I must set mu_hat to an explicit value that considers the 835 ghost units as 'not there', or simply use the backend's logic while acknowledging we are currently overprotected if those units were real, but underprotected since they are not. I'll set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (71.25 * 3 = 213.75) but since the OR engine will subtract 929, I must provide an explicit value that forces the order. To maintain a safety stock for ~70 units/week with a 2-period lead time, the target base stock is roughly 300. To get the engine to order ~70 units when it thinks it has 929+23, I would need a mu_hat near 1300. Instead, I will use lead time 'explicit' to 2 and mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_N' to stay grounded in demand, accepting that the ghost inventory prevents ordering through the OR backend until it is cleared. Note: Since I cannot clear the 'In-transit' dashboard, I must use 'explicit' to force the order by setting a high mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Dashboard 'In-transit' (929) is 90% comprised of lost shipments (835 units from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). Demand has stabilized post-summer-slump at approximately 70 units/week (P21-P24 avg: 71.25).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/8/5), the stock is at 0 units following a demand of 92 in Period 25. The dashboard shows an in-transit quantity of 1250 units, but historical data and carry-over insights confirm that 835 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P19) are effectively lost or permanently delayed. The reliable pipeline consists only of orders from Period 24 (94 units) and Period 25 (321 units). Demand has transitioned from a mid-summer slump (P14-P20 avg ~42) to a more stabilized level. The last 5 samples (P21-P25) average 75.4 units, which aligns with the pre-slump mean (80) and recent evidence. Given the unreliable pipeline and stock-out, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the current post-slump stabilization. For lead time, while 'calculate' is valid, the promised lead time of 2 periods remains the most frequent observation for successful deliveries (P2, P11, P21), so I will use 'default' for L.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity remains low: 835 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). Current reliable pipeline consists only of P24 (94 units) and P25 (321 units) orders. Demand is stabilized at a post-slump mean of ~75 units (P21-P25 avg: 75.4).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568597006 is currently experiencing a total stockout (on-hand: 0) as of Period 27. The 'In-transit' balance of 1250 units is highly misleading: 835 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) are confirmed lost based on historical arrival patterns. The active pipeline consists only of P24 (94 units), P25 (321 units), and any order placed in P26 (0 units). Specifically, the P24 order (lead time 2) was expected to arrive in Period 26 but did not appear in the Period 26 conclude message; it should arrive during Period 27 (observed in P28). Demand has recovered from the early summer slump (P14-P20 avg ~42) to a higher stability (P21-P26 avg ~78.5). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this recovery and using explicit L=3 to account for the frequent delays and the fact that the P24 order is currently 'at least' lead time 2 and likely arriving at 3. This high mu_hat/sigma_hat combination will force a significant order to bypass the OR engine's conservative 'pipeline' logic which incorrectly counts lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: P24 order (94 units) is delayed (not in P26 conclude); actual lead time for recent shipments is trending toward 3 periods. Total lost units in dashboard 'In-transit' remains at 835.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. In Period 27 conclude, the P25 order (321 units) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, while the P24 order (94 units) is still missing and now 1 period overdue (placed Period 24, expected Period 26 finish). Given the persistent history of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19), P24 is highly likely lost or severely delayed. The dashboard In-transit shows 929 units, but 835 units are confirmed lost, and P24 (94 units) is now suspicious; thus, the functional pipeline is effectively zero. Demand in P27 spiked to 179 units, significantly higher than the previous 4-week average (~75). This may be a back-to-school or seasonal peak for women's tailoring (suit trousers). I will set L to 'calculate' (the backend average) as the most recent arrival was on time, but I must provide a mu_hat that accounts for both the recent spike and the unreliable pipeline. I'll use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the shift from the summer slump to the current high-demand regime (Avg P21-P27 \u2248 92 units), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: P24 order (94 units) remains missing after P27 conclude, adding to the list of likely lost shipments (Total likely lost: 929 units). Demand spike in P27 (179 units) suggests a new high-demand regime, likely seasonal (back-to-school/autumn transition).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/26. We are observing a significant demand surge likely tied to the 'Back-to-School' and 'Autumn transition' period for tailored trousers. Demand in the last two periods was 179 and 140 (average 159.5), compared to the prior post-slump average of ~75. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (2 units). The 'In-transit' dashboard shows 929 units, but historical tracking (Carry-over insights) confirms that 929 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, and now P24) are lost or indefinitely delayed. The P24 order (94 units) should have arrived by P27 conclude but is missing as of P29 start, thus it is marked lost. There are currently ZERO reliable units in-transit. To address this, mu_hat is set using an 'explicit' value based on the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) at the current high-demand rate (160 * 3 = 480). Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to handle the shift in volatility. L is set to calculated as recent valid arrivals have adhered to the 2-period promised lead time, but we must ignore the lost shipments in determining the stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 27: Average jumped to ~160 units (+110% vs P21-P26 average). P24 order (94 units) confirmed lost as of Period 29 (missing 3 periods past promised delivery). Total confirmed lost dashboard units: 929.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019-09-02), the product is in a clear high-demand regime, likely associated with the autumn/back-to-school season. Demand for periods 27-29 averaged 152.3 units/period, compared to the ~75 units seen in the mid-summer recovery. Pipeline inventory is currently 929 units, but following the Carry-Over Insights, all 929 units are confirmed lost or severely delayed (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, and P24). Consequently, effective pipeline inventory is zero and on-hand inventory is zero. To satisfy the new demand regime and replenish stock, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly account for the new average (~153 units) across the (L+1) period risk window. With L=2, mu_hat = (2+1) * 153 = 459. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to 50 (approximately sqrt(3) * 29) to handle the volatility of this new peak. Because the OR backend subtracts 'Pipeline Inventory' from 'Base Stock', and our pipeline is reported as 929 but is actually 0, I must use an 'explicit' L value to ignore the promised lead time logic and use 'explicit' mu_hat to force a large order that overrides the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed Periodic 27-29: Mean demand increased to 152.3 (+100% vs previous period). Total confirmed lost/phantom 'In-transit' units is 929; effective pipeline is zero.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/09. Demand has shifted into a higher regime starting Period 27, coinciding with the transition to autumn/back-to-school season for trousers. The average demand for the last four periods (P27-P30) is 151 units per week. Inventory is currently 0, and the dashboard 'In-transit' of 1524 units is heavily compromised: 929 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24) are confirmed lost or severely delayed based on historical sequences. Only the P25 order (which arrived in P27) and the P30 order (595 units) are reliable. Because the P30 order was just placed, the effective pipeline is 595. I will set mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (N=4) to ensure the OR engine targets ~151 units/week. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent successful deliveries (P21, P25) have adhered to the promised 2-period window, but the 'cap' logic in the backend will help moderate over-ordering given the high 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: September demand spike confirmed: P27-P30 average demand is 151 units, a 110% increase over the summer average. Total confirmed lost units in dashboard 'In-transit' remains 929 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/16. We are in a high-demand regime for 'Hayes slim trouser' (Womens Tailoring), consistent with late summer/early autumn office wear demand. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 163 units, a significant increase from previous levels. The dashboard shows an 'In-transit' of 1524 units. Analysis of lost orders confirms that 929 units are phantom inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline is only 595 units (ordered in P30), which is expected to arrive in P32 or P33. Since current on-hand is 0 and demand is spiking, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the ~163 units/week average (3 periods = ~489 units). The 595 units in the real pipeline cover this comfortably, so the OR backend should order minimally to maintain safety stock for the subsequent periods without overstocking if the spike is transient.

Carry-over insight: September demand spike sustained: Period 27-31 mean demand is 163.0 units (+130% vs summer average). Total confirmed lost/phantom 'In-transit' units: 929 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23 (Period 33). We are in a high-demand regime that began in Period 27, coinciding with the autumn transition for 'Womens Tailoring Trousers'. The average demand from Period 27 to 32 is 177.3 units per week, significantly higher than previous periods (P27: 179, P28: 140, P29: 138, P30: 147, P31: 211, P32: 249). The latest observation of 249 units shows the peak may still be climbing. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this regime shift specifically. Lead time is currently stable at 2 periods for successful deliveries (P30 order arrived in P32), but the 'In-transit' figure of 929 units is entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24). Consequently, the OR backend sees 929 units in the pipeline that do not exist, which would normally suppress ordering. By setting L to 'explicit' at 2 and using a high mu_hat via explicit value or recent_N, I aim to trigger a restock that accounts for the fact that the 929 units are phantom inventory. Since on-hand is 346 and expected demand over the next 3 periods (L+1) is approximately 531 (177*3), a significant order is needed to prevent stockouts during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: September/Autumn demand peak intensified: P27-P32 average demand is 177.3 units (+140% vs summer). Last reported demand (P32) reached 249 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its peak autumn demand phase. Recently, demand has surged from a summer average of ~70 units to 479 units in Period 33, with the Period 27-33 average now at 220.6 units. The product (Hayes slim trouser) is seasonally relevant for the autumn 'back-to-office/school' period. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The dashboard's 'In-transit' figure (929 units) is strictly comprised of confirmed lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 19, 24). Consequently, the actual effective pipeline is zero. Since the last order (Period 30) arrived on time (L=2) and demand is accelerating, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the most recent spike (479 units) plus a buffer for the upward trend, targeting a forecast of ~500 units per week across the L+1 period. sigma_hat is set explicitly to manage the high volatility observed in the recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Period 33 demand reached 479 units, bringing the P27-P33 mean to 220.6 (+200% vs summer). All 929 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost history.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a high-demand autumn peak for 'Hayes slim trousers'. The demand in Period 33 reached 479, though it cooled to 188 in Period 34. The average demand from P27 to P34 is 216.5 units per week. The dashboard 'In-transit' figure of 1714 is highly misleading due to historical losses; specifically, 929 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory consists only of the P34 order (785 units). With zero on-hand inventory and a lead time of 2 periods, we must set parameters that cover the expected demand for the next 3 weeks (current period + 2 weeks lead time). Given the volatility and the recent triple-digit demand spikes, I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 (the start of the autumn regime in Period 27) to capture this new mean (~217 units/week). To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to cover the gap between our current effective pipeline (785) and the 3-period demand requirement (approx 3 * 217 = 650+), I maintain recent statistics reflecting this surge.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand peak sustains high volatility: P27-P34 mean is 216.5 units, with a peak of 479 in P33. Effective pipeline significantly lower than dashboard: 929 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost history.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is a 'Hayes slim trouser' (Womens Tailoring). Current period is mid-October (P36), which is the height of the autumn/winter demand peak for tailoring items. Demand remains highly volatile but at a significantly higher mean (P27-P35 mean is ~212 units) compared to summer. The total 'In-transit' on the dashboard is 1714 units, but carry-over insights confirm that 929 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, and P24) are lost. This leaves 785 units (ordered in P34) as the only reliable pipeline, which should arrive in P36 (current period). Given the lead time is 2, the order being placed now will land in P38. I will set mu_hat using the last 9 periods (P27-P35) to capture the autumn regime shift (mean ~212, so (1+L)*mu is ~636), and increase sigma_hat using an explicit value to account for the extreme P33 outlier (479 units) ensuring the OR logic holds enough safety stock for the winter peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed (Sept-Oct): P27-P35 mean demand is 212.1 units vs summer mean of 75. Cumulative lost units in dashboard 'In-transit' identified as 929 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24). Only the P34 order (785 units) is currently reliable in-transit.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in the middle of a high-demand autumn regime for women's tailoring (Hayes slim trousers). Demand over the last 10 periods (P27-P36) has averaged 198.6 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) show high volatility with an average of 253.8 units and a peak of 479. The dashboard 'In-transit' figure of 1714 is misleading: 929 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24). The only reliable active order is P34 (785 units), which was expected in P36 (L=2) but has not arrived yet. Given the shipment history, recent lead times have frequently hit 3 periods or orders have been lost entirely. We must assume some delay. With 0 on-hand and 0 reliable inventory arrived, the OR backend needs to secure stock for the high-demand period (approx 200-250/week). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime (mu_hat approx 200 * (1+L)), while maintaining a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility (e.g., the 479 unit spike).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: P34 order (785 units) is now 1 period overdue (ordered P34, expected P36, not arrived in P36 conclude). Reliability of the 1714 'In-transit' remains low; 929 units are definitely lost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28 (Period 38). On-hand inventory is 0. The dashboard shows an in-transit of 1714 units, but 929 of these (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24) are confirmed lost through historical analysis. The remaining 785 units are from the Period 34 order, which is now 1 period past its promised delivery (L=2). Given that the P19 and P24 orders were previously lost, the delivery of the P34 order is uncertain; however, it has not yet reached the 3nd overdue period threshold where I confirm a loss. Demand has shifted into a high-volatility autumn regime starting Period 27. The average demand from P27 to P37 is approximately 209 units per week. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=11 to capture this high-demand regime (P27-P37) and lead time to 3 to account for the frequent delays observed in the supply chain. This approach aims to restore inventory levels to meet the high autumn demand once shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Lead time for the only active shipment (P34, 785 units) is now at least 4 periods, confirming a pattern of severe logistical delays or high risk of loss for large autumn orders. Demand regime (P27-P37) remains stable at a mean of ~210 units/period despite high variance.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-04. Demand analysis: Since Period 27 (mid-August), the SKU has entered a high-demand autumn/winter regime. Excluding the extreme spike in P33 (479 units), the mean demand from P27-P38 is approximately 190 units/period with high volatility. Supply Chain Analysis: The dashboard shows 1714 units 'In-transit'. However, history confirms 929 of these are lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24). The only 'live' order is 785 units from P34. This P34 order is now 4 periods old (ordered P34, should have arrived P36). Given that lead times in this system are either 2 periods or lost/severely delayed, there is a high probability the P34 order is also lost or stuck. With 0 on-hand inventory and a likely empty pipeline despite the 'In-transit' display, we must place a significant order. I will set mu_hat based on the high-demand regime (recent 12 periods, P27-P38) to ensure the base stock is high enough to handle current demand and recover from stockouts. I will use 'explicit' for L to acknowledge the high risk of delay/loss, setting it to 2 to trigger a fresh order while the OR engine calculates the gap between base stock and the (unreliable) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Period 34 order (785 units) is now 2 periods overdue beyond promised lead time and 4 periods since order; high risk of loss. Effective pipeline is likely zero despite 1714 units shown in dashboard. Demand regime P27-P38 stabilized at mean ~190 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 40 (2019/11/11). The dashboard shows an in-transit inventory of 1714 units, but based on historical analysis, 929 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24). The remaining 785 units (ordered in P34) are now 4 periods overdue (6 periods since the order was placed), which strongly indicates they are also lost, especially since recent successful arrivals (P25 and P30) adhered to a 2-period lead time. With zero on-hand and an effectively zero pipeline, we must place a significant order. The demand regime from P27-P39 indicates a seasonal high for this product ('Hayes slim trouser'), with an average demand of 190.2 units and significant volatility (peak of 479). I will set mu_hat to 600 explicitly to cover (L+1) periods of this high-demand regime (3 periods * ~200 units/period) and use an explicit sigma_hat of 250 to account for high variance and potential stockouts during this autumn/winter peak. Lead time is set to default (2) to signal expectations to the OR engine, though we must manually account for the lost pipeline in our targeting.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: P34 order (785 units) is now 4 periods overdue and considered lost. Total confirmed lost units in dashboard 'In-transit' is 1714 (sum of all orders from P1 through P34 except P11, P21, P25, P30). Effective pipeline inventory is zero. Demand regime (P27-P39) remains at a high-level mean of ~190 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (2019-11-18), the system reports an 'In-transit' of 1714 units, but based on historical analysis, all these units are confirmed lost or severely delayed beyond recovery. Specifically, the P34 order (785 units) is now 4 periods overdue (expected P36, now P40 conclude has passed without arrival). Consequently, effective pipeline inventory is zero and on-hand inventory is zero. Demand for 'Hayes slim trouser' spiked in September (reaching 479 in P33) and has since stabilized into a high-demand autumn/winter regime. Over the last 10 periods (P31-P40), demand has averaged 196.5 units. Given the high stockout risk and the total failure of previous large orders to arrive, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average to capture the current regime and use explicit L to reflect the observed unreliability, though I will keep L at 2 for the backend while setting mu_hat high enough to trigger a significant reorder. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility (std dev ~95 in the recent period).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Effective pipeline inventory is confirmed zero; all 1714 units in dashboard 'In-transit' (including the P34 order of 785 units) are considered lost. Demand regime for late autumn (P31-P40) is stable at a mean of 196.5 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (late November), the SKU 568597006 (Hayes slim trouser) is in a high-demand regime that began in late August (Period 27). Recent demand from Period 31 to 41 reflects a stable but high mean of 196.5 units per week, although the very last observation (P41) was lower at 119. Inventory management is severely compromised by a persistent history of lost shipments; all 1714 units currently listed as 'In-transit' in the dashboard (including the P34 order of 785 units) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue (P34 is now 6 periods overdue). Consequently, effective pipeline inventory is zero. Since on-hand inventory is also zero, a substantial order is required to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 weeks). I will set L to 2 (promised) as the backend uses this for base stock calculation, but I will uses 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the high-demand autumn regime (P31-P41), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock reflecting the ~196 units/week average. Sigma is set to 'recent_N' (N=11) to account for the high volatility observed during this peak season.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Hayes slim trouser spiked dramatically in Period 42 (408 units), likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (Nov 25th date context). This follows a high-demand autumn regime (P31-P41 avg ~189 units). The current 'In-transit' of 1714 units is entirely comprised of lost or severely delayed orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24, P34), as no arrivals have occurred since Period 32 despite the promised 2-period lead time. With zero effective on-hand and zero effective pipeline, and the game ending in Period 47, I must use explicit parameters to trigger the OR backend to place a significant recovery order. I set L=2 (promised) to avoid inventory being delayed further in the backend logic, but I use a very high explicit mu_hat to account for the recent demand spike and the need to fulfill safety stock immediately. Mu_hat is set to cover the next 3 weeks (L+1) at a projected rate of ~220 units/week (blending the autumn mean with the recent massive spike).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed Black Friday demand spike of 408 units in P42. Average demand for the late autumn/holiday transition (P31-P42) is 207 units. Entire dashboard 'In-transit' of 1714 units remains confirmed lost/phantom.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), following the Black Friday spike (P42 demand: 408) and a subsequent drop (P43 demand: 91). History shows a clear seasonal demand uplift starting in September (P27), with an average demand of 200.2 units from P27 through P43. During the most recent period (P31-P43), the mean demand is 196.4 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The dashboard shows 1714 units 'In-transit', but carry-over insights and arrival history confirm these are lost/phantom shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24, and notably the large P34 order of 785 units which is now 7 periods overdue). The effective pipeline is zero. Since we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47), and the promised lead time is 2, an order placed now in P44 would arrive in P46, leaving only P46 and P47 to sell. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the high-demand regime from P31 onwards) to reflect the current autumn/winter mean of ~196 units. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture recent high volatility. L is set to 'default' as recent successful deliveries (P21->P23, P25->P27, P30->P32) adhered to the promised 2-period lead time, despite the specific losses of other orders.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45, following the Black Friday spike (P42: 408 units) and entering the mid-December holiday shopping period. Recent demand (P41-P44) has averaged 193.5 units. The dashboard 'In-transit' of 1714 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24, and now P34 which is 8 periods overdue). Effective pipeline is currently zero, and on-hand is zero, resulting in a 100% lost sales situation. I will use 'explicit' parameters to force an order that accounts for the fact that the OR backend incorrectly believes there are 1714 units coming. I am setting mu_hat based on the late autumn/winter average (approx 190-200 units per week) across the review+lead time of 3 periods (L=2, so L+1=3). mu_hat = 3 * 200 = 600. sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility seen in P42. Because the backend subtracts 'In-transit' (1714) from the base stock, I must set the mu_hat to a value that exceeds 1714 + desired order to trigger a replenishment, but given the 'cap' mechanism (which uses mu_hat for calculation), I will use 'explicit' to provide the highest reasonable forecast to maximize the possible order size.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Effective pipeline remains zero; the dashboard 'In-transit' of 1714 units consists entirely of lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24, P34). Demand remains in a high-volume winter regime (P41-P44 avg 193.5).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Dec 23rd, just before Christmas. We are in Period 46. Historically, demand for these trousers shifted from a summer average of ~75 to an autumn/winter average (P31-P45) of 191 units. The most recent demand (P45) was 158 units. The dashboard 'In-transit' of 2695 units contains 1714 units confirmed lost from early periods and the P34 order. The only 'live' order is from P45 (981 units), which is expected to arrive in P47 conclude. I will set mu_hat based on the recent higher demand regime (last 15 periods, P31-P45, mean ~191) to ensure the target base stock covers the current season. Reliability remains a major concern; however, since an order was just placed in P45, I will keep the base stock logic consistent with a lead time of 2, while being mindful that the backend OR capped policy will limit the order size based on the (likely phantom) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Dashboard 'In-transit' (2695) is heavily inflated by 1714 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P24, P34). The only active pipeline is the P45 order of 981 units. Autumn/Winter demand regime (P31-P45) maintains a mean of 191.1 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are looking at a post-holiday demand environment (late December). Historically, the dashboard 'In-transit' figure is heavily inflated (1714 units confirmed lost across periods 1-34). The current 'In-transit' of 2695 includes those 1714 units plus the order from Period 45 (981 units). The P45 order is expected to arrive during Period 47 (based on the promised lead time of 2 periods), though it won't be visible until the P48 start. Demand has cooled significantly from the autumn/Black Friday peaks, with P46 demand at 80 units. The average demand for the most recent regime (P41-P46) is 168.6 units. I will set mu_hat based on this recent average (N=6) to reflect the post-holiday dip while maintaining enough safety stock given the history of lost shipments. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: P45 order (981 units) is the only active shipment expected in the pipeline; 1714 units in the dashboard 'In-transit' remain confirmed as lost shipments from earlier periods.
