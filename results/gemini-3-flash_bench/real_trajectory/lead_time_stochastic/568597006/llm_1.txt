The average is approximately 88.4 units per week. The spike to 115 on Jan 28 may be an outlier or a specific promotion. Excluding the spike, the mean is ~82. d) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 arrive for demand in P3. Pipeline is currently 0. e) Order Logic: To avoid stockouts for the next three periods (P1, P2, P3), considering an average demand of ~88 and keeping a small safety buffer for the variability seen in January, I need to cover roughly 264-280 units.

My goal is to cover demand for Period 3 (when the first order arrives) and Period 4 (to bridge the gap for the next order). Assuming a baseline demand of ~85 units, I need coverage for 2 periods (~170 units). Since 270 are already in-transit and will arrive in Period 3, I have enough to cover Period 3 and likely Period 4.

As we move further into October and November, historical data and seasonal knowledge of 'Womens Tailoring' suggest demand will remain steady or slightly decrease before any winter holiday shifts. The lead time is highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a high order loss rate. Analysis of 'In-transit' (2195 units): Presumed lost are orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, and P29 (total 1465 units). Additionally, the P34 order (570 units) is now 3 periods old; based on recent successes of P33 (3-period lead) and P32 (3-period lead), I expect P34 to arrive in Period 37 or 38. Current on-hand is 397. Period 36 order (150 units) is also viable. Our viable pipeline (On-hand 397 + P34 570 + P36 150) equals 1117 units. Considering demand ~180/period, this covers roughly 6 periods. However, given the extreme unreliability of arrivals and the risk of the 570-unit order being lost (which would leave us with only 397 on hand), I will place a moderate safety order of 100 units to maintain a flow of arrivals without incurring excessive holding costs if the large shipment arrives.",
