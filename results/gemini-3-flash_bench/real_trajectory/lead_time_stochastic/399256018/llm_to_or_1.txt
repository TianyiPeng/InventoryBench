Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 399256018, which is Women's Ankle-length jeans. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend leading into February: 72, 81, 87, 104, 149. This suggests a seasonal ramp-up or a regime shift toward higher demand. The mean of the last 5 samples is 98.6, but the most recent sample is significantly higher (149). Given the trend and the product category (Womens Everyday Collection/Jeans) moving towards spring, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this acceleration while maintaining some stability. The promised lead time is 2, so the system needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I'll use default lead time and standard deviation calculation based on the recent window to manage the increased volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The SKU is 'Ankle-length jeans', a staples item for women. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 72, 81, 87, 104, 149 (pre-game) and a sharp spike to 195 in Period 1. This suggests a seasonal 'Spring' ramp-up or a promotion. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 167 units in-transit (ordered P1, promised lead time 2). Per the timing rules, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 4 start message. For Period 2's decision, we need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the last 3 samples (104, 149, 195) to capture the trend, the mean is ~149.33. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 3 * 149.33 \u2248 448. For sigma_hat, the volatility is increasing, so I will use an explicit higher value to ensure service levels during this stockout phase. L is set to default (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is 'Ankle-length jeans' (Womens Everyday Collection). Historical demand from Jan-Feb (72, 81, 87, 104, 149) plus game history (195, 179) shows a significant upward trend. The mean of the last 3 samples is approximately 174. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (167 units) and Period 2 (226 units) are in transit. Following the 2-period lead time rule, the order from Period 1 (placed at start of P1) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Currently, on-hand is 0, leading to lost sales in P1 and P2. To capture the increasing demand trend and mitigate stockouts, I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=4 to weigh the recent spikes heavily, and use the default promised lead time of 2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' is currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. Historical demand samples (recent 5 weeks) are: 72, 81, 87, 104, 149. Observed demand in the game history for Periods 1-3 (end of Feb/early March) has jumped significantly to 195, 179, and 119, indicating a shift from the initial baseline (avg ~98) to a higher regime (avg ~164). This aligns with the 'Spring' seasonal transition for women's denim. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (167 units) should have arrived during Period 3's resolution phase and become visible in Period 4's start (Period 3 conclude), but the 'arrived=0' message for Period 3 conclude indicates a delay or that the '2-period' lead time actually means it arrives in the 3rd period (visible at the start of the 4th). Given no arrivals have been confirmed yet, I will maintain L at default but use an explicit mu_hat to capture the elevated demand regime (avg 164) across the (L+1)=3 period window. I set mu_hat = 3 * 165 = 495. I will use a larger sigma_hat via recent_N (N=3) to account for the high volatility seen in the game history (195 vs 119).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in Feb/March: average weekly demand increased from ~98 to ~164 (+67%) compared to initial Jan/Feb samples.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). In Period 4, we received the order from Period 2 (226 units), confirming the promised lead time (L=2). However, the order from Period 1 (167 units) is still missing after 4 periods (expected arrival was Period 3). Since shipments can be lost, and we have a confirmed successful delivery from a later order, I will treat the Period 1 order as potentially lost. Demand history (samples + game history) shows: 72, 81, 87, 104, 149, 195, 179, 119, 96. While there was a spike to 195/179 in Feb, the last two weeks (119, 96) suggest demand is stabilizing back towards a moderate level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the shift post-spike while acknowledging the higher levels seen in late Feb. L is set to 'calculate' as the system has observed a lead time of 2. Sigma remains 'default' to handle the recent high volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees stable to increasing demand in spring. Historically, demand has been volatile: initial samples (Jan/Feb) averaged ~98, while recent periods show a fluctuation (P1: 195, P2: 179, P3: 119, P4: 96, P5: 85). Despite the recent downward trend in the last two weeks, the earlier high demand in mid-February suggests a potential for spikes or seasonality that isn't fully captured by the short-term average. Lead time (L) is confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4). On-hand is 45, while in-transit is high (377), including the P1 order (167) which is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P1, expected P3, currently P6 start). Since the P1 order is likely lost or significantly delayed, the OR backend needs to account for this gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the full range of the recent regime including the February spikes (Avg P1-P5 \u2248 135/week). For L, I use 'calculate' to rely on observed history (L=2). For sigma, I use 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the recent high volatility (Std \u2248 50).

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Order from Period 1 (167 units) is 3 periods overdue relative to promised lead time (2) and is likely lost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), the SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). Looking at history: the Period 1 order (167 units) is now 6 periods old and has not arrived, confirming it is lost. The Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (LT=2). The Period 5 order arrived in Period 6 (LT=1). The Period 3 (136 units) and Period 4 (25 units) orders are still in transit (both >2 periods old), suggesting either high lead time variability or further loss. Given the product is 'Ankle-length jeans' and we are moving into late March/April, demand is expected to remain steady or rise. Current demand average over the last 3 periods is ~94. To address the stockout and the unreliability of the pipeline, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability and use 'recent_N' (N=3) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current trend without being skewed by the very high initial demand spikes in Feb. This conservative mu_hat aims to stabilize stock levels without over-ordering if the 'lost' orders suddenly arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 (136 units) and Period 4 (25 units) orders are now overdue (4 and 3 periods respectively), indicating significant supply chain instability or additional lost shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU is currently out of stock. A major demand spike occurred in Period 7 (211 units), significantly higher than the previous average. Analysis of supply history shows critical instability: while the Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2) and Period 5 arrived early (L=1), Period 1, 3, and 4 orders (totaling 328 units) are now significantly overdue (by 3-5 periods) and are likely lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 383 includes these likely lost units and the Period 6 order (55 units). To recover from the stockout, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I will set L=3 to account for observed supply delays. I forecast demand based on the recent jump, using a conservative mean of 150 units per period. With L=3, mu_hat = (1+3)*150 = 600. To protect against the high variance and stockouts, I am setting a high sigma_hat of 120 (approx sqrt(4)*60). Because the OR backend subtracts the unreliable pipeline inventory from its calculated base stock, I must use 'explicit' values high enough to trigger a substantial recovery order despite the inflated 'In-transit' count.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability confirmed: multiple orders (P1, P3, P4) are now 3-5 periods overdue and presumed lost. Demand spiked to 211 in late March, suggesting a shift to a higher-velocity regime (approx 150/week).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) and entering April. Historical demand has shifted upward significantly since February, with a recent spike of 211 and a current mean around 150 units/week. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: orders from Period 1, 3, and 4 are now significantly overdue (7, 5, and 4 periods respectively) and are presumed lost. However, the order from Period 5 arrived in 1 period and Period 6 arrived in 2 periods, suggesting that while some shipments fail entirely, others follow the promised lead time. I will maintain L=2 for the OR engine but use an explicit mu_hat to account for the current demand regime (~150/week) and the high stockout risk. Since base stock = (1+L) * mu, and L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 150 = 450. I will increase sigma_hat explicitly to provide a higher safety buffer given the recent volatility and 0 on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation confirmed: orders either arrive on time (L=1-2) or are lost entirely (P1, P3, P4). Demand regime stabilized at ~150 units/week since late March.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The SKU is 'Skinny Ankle Jeans', a women's everyday collection item. Demand analysis shows a significant shift starting in Period 7 (late March), with recent demands being 211, 144, and 113. While the early April figures (144, 113) are lower than the late March spike, they confirm a higher baseline compared to January. I'll use recent_N (N=3) to focus on this new regime (avg ~156). Supply chain instability is major: orders from P1, P3, and P4 are long overdue and assumed lost. Only P2, P5, and P6 arrived with lead times of 2, 1, and 2 respectively. Because 3 out of 6 recent orders were lost, the 'In-transit' figure of 577 is misleading; roughly 328 units (P1: 167, P3: 136, P4: 25) should be discounted as lost. To compensate for this risk and the current zero on-hand inventory, I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised lead time) to ensure the OR engine targets enough stock for the next 3 weeks (L+1), and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent high-velocity, high-volatility demand environment.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for these skinny ankle trousers has stabilized around a mean of ~132 units/week over the last 6 periods (including historical context and recent fluctuations). The supply chain remains unreliable: orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are officially lost as they are far beyond the 2-period lead time. However, the last order from Period 8 arrived exactly on time (L=2). To account for the 'lost' units inflating the pipeline, I must ensure mu_hat is high enough to trigger new orders, as the OR backend's 'capped policy' subtracts the undelivered (but lost) units from the target stock. I am setting L=2 (promised and recently observed), mu_hat using the last 6 samples to capture the stabilized demand regime of ~132/wk, and a moderate sigma_hat to buffer against volatility and potential stockouts caused by shipment losses.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). We have 72 units on-hand and 328 in-transit. The 328 units represent the sum of older 'lost' shipments (P1, P3, P4 total 328 units). Because these shipments are now 8-11 periods overdue against a promised lead time of 2, they must be considered lost. The OR backend includes these lost units in 'pipeline_inventory', which suppresses new orders. I must use a very high mu_hat via the 'explicit' method to force an order that bypasses this ghost inventory. Demand has softened in the last three weeks (88, 89, 113) compared to the March peak (211, 144), averaging approximately 97 units/week. To cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods), I need a base stock of roughly 300 units. However, to trigger an order from the backend while pipeline_inventory is 328, mu_hat must be set significantly higher than the pipeline. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 600 to ensure the backend places a replenishment order to cover actual future demand, and use 'calculate' for L as the arrived shipments (P2, P5, P6, P8) have shown L=1 or L=2.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Pipeline inventory (328 units) consists entirely of lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4. Demand regime has moderated from the March peak to approximately 95-100 units/week in April.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the 'Skinny Ankle Jeans' are out of stock (On-hand: 0). Looking at history, the in-transit inventory of 603 includes three long-lost shipments: Period 1 (167), Period 3 (136), and Period 4 (25), totaling 328 units that will likely never arrive. Recent arrivals (Period 8 order arriving in Period 10) show that successful shipments follow its promised lead time of 2 periods. Demand has stabilized from the late-March peak (~211) to a more moderate April-May level. The last four demand observations are 113, 88, 89, and 132 (average ~105/week). To ensure the OR engine ignores the 328 'ghost' units in transition and corrects for the current stockout, I use the 'explicit' method. I set L=2 (promised). For mu_hat, I project demand for (L+1)=3 periods using the recent average (105 * 3 = 315). For sigma_hat, I provide a volatility estimate based on the standard deviation of recent samples (~20) scaled by sqrt(L+1) (approx 35). This will force an order that accounts for the fact that half the pipeline consists of lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (328 units total) remain in-transit indefinitely; the backend 'In-transit' figure is inflated by these units, requiring explicit parameter adjustment to maintain service levels.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's ankle-length jeans, currently in mid-May. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 603 units is misleadingly high because it includes 328 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are significantly overdue and presumed lost. The actual viable pipeline consists only of the 275 units ordered in Period 12 (expected to arrive in Period 14 or 15). Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~110-120 units/week over the last 5 periods (samples: 113, 88, 89, 132, 130). To compensate for the 328 phantom units in the OR backend's pipeline calculation, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. Following the logic: base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock; order = base_stock - (actual_pipeline + lost_units). To force the backend to ignore lost_units, I set mu_hat = (Forecast * (L+1)) + Lost_units. Forecast for (2+1) periods = 115 * 3 = 345. Inflated mu_hat = 345 + 328 = 673. This ensures the order logic (673 + safety_stock) - (275 + 328) results in a target covering the next 3 weeks of demand plus safety stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), demand for this skinny ankle jeans SKU has settled into a stable late-spring regime. Recent weekly demand samples (P10-P14: 88, 89, 132, 130, 106) average 109 units. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this current level. Regarding supply chain, the promised lead time of 2 periods is generally holding for successful deliveries (P12 arrived P14), but there is a major issue with phantom pipeline inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 430 units includes 328 units from old orders (P1, P3, P4) that are now 11-14 weeks overdue and effectively lost. The OR backend subtracts total pipeline from its target base stock; to prevent these lost units from blocking new orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand: 109 * 3 = 327. I then add the 328 'lost' units to this target to neutralize the backend's subtraction, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 655. This ensures the engine places an order to cover real upcoming demand despite the inflated pipeline count.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late May (2019/5/27). Demand for this SKU has stabilized in a regime of approximately 95-130 units per week since mid-April. In-transit inventory (518 units) contains 328 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) that are definitively lost, meaning the 'useful' pipeline is only 190 units (P14 and P15 orders). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 518 units from its base stock calculation, it will fail to place necessary orders unless I use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target inventory level to compensate for the phantom stock. I set L=2 (promised). For mu_hat, I calculate the target base stock covering 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~110/week) PLUS the 328 lost units, totaling approx 658 units. This prevents the system from under-ordering due to the inflated pipeline. For sigma, I use recent_N=6 to reflect the current stability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256018' (Women's Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a stable demand regime of approximately 100-110 units per week. Recent demand history shows Period 14: 106, Period 15: 110, and Period 16: 100. The average demand of the last 3 samples is 105.3. On-hand inventory is 0 at the start of Period 17, and the current 'In-transit' of 627 units is severely inflated by historical lost orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 328 units). Subtracting these lost units, the effective pipeline inventory is 299 units (comprising Period 14: 102, Period 15: 88, and Period 16: 109). With a lead time of L=2, the total pipeline requirement (L+1 periods) at a 105 units/week rate is roughly 315 units. Because the backend uses 'In-transit' in its base-stock calculation (Order = BaseStock - InTransit), the 328 phantom units will prevent the backend from ordering anything unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset them. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered while accounting for the ~105 demand rate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat = (Ideal Base Stock) + (Lost Units) = (105 * 3) + 328 = 643. This forces the backend to recognize the need for new stock despite the ghost inventory. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand has stabilized at approximately 100 units per week throughout April, May, and early June. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P14-P17) show demand values of 106, 110, 100, and 79 (avg: 98.75). The pipeline inventory (468 units) is heavily distorted by lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (total 328 units), which the OR backend still believes are in transit. To compensate for these phantom units, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. My target safety stock level should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, I need to cover 3 periods (~300 units). To trigger an order that accounts for the 118 on-hand units while ignoring the 328 'lost' units, I set mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory Position (Base Stock) = 300 (actual needed) + 328 (to offset lost units) = 628. I set mu_hat to 628 to force the OR backend to maintain sufficient stock despite the pipeline noise.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), the current demand for womens stretch denim ankle jeans is moderating from spring levels (~100-110) to a more stable summer level (~50-80). The 'In-transit' figure (537) remains heavily inflated by lost shipments from Period 1 (167), Period 3 (136), and Period 4 (25), totaling 328 ghost units. Furthermore, the order from Period 14 (102 units) is now 5 periods old and significantly past the observed lead time of 1-2 periods; it is also likely lost. Total confirmed/likely lost units are approximately 430. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (537) from the base stock target, it is under-ordering. To compensate, I am applying an 'explicit' L=2.0 to stabilize expectations and an 'explicit' mu_hat of 650. This mu_hat represents approximately 3 weeks of demand (1 + L=2) at ~100 units per week ($300), plus an offset of ~350 units to neutralize the 'ghost' pipeline units that the backend will otherwise subtract from the order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Pipeline inventory remains inflated by ~430 units due to lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, and now Period 14. Demand has stabilized at ~75 units/week for June.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny Ankle Jeans' has seen a seasonal decline since the March/April peak, stabilizing around 70-80 units per week throughout June (P17: 79, P18: 52, P19: 56; Avg ~62). The primary challenge is the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 551 units. Inventory analysis reveals that 430 units are likely lost shipments (P1: 167, P3: 136, P4: 25, P14: 102), as they are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods. The backend OR engine uses the logic 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. If pipeline_inventory is artificially high due to these 'ghost' units, the system will stop ordering, leading to stockouts. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock sufficient for L+1 periods (estimated 2+1=3). With a forecasted demand of ~70 units, the target base stock is approximately 210 units plus a safety buffer. However, to bypass the 551-unit pipeline deduction, mu_hat must be set higher than the pipeline. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 750 (representing the 551 units of 'ghost' inventory + 199 units for actual requirements) to force the OR engine to place an order of approximately 120 units, ensuring on-hand availability for July.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of July 1st (Period 21), demand has stabilized at a lower summer level (~57 units/week over the last 4 weeks). However, the critical issue is 'Ghost Pipeline' inventory. The OR backend sees 709 units in transit; however, history shows that orders from Periods 1 (167), 3 (136), 4 (25), and 14 (102) are significantly overdue (7-20 periods) and likely lost. This totals 430 lost units. The true pipeline consists only of orders from P17 (38), P19 (83), and P20 (158), totaling 279 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these ghost units, mu_hat must be inflated. Base stock targeting 3 periods of coverage (L=2 + 1 review period) with demand at ~60/week would be 180 units. I use 'explicit' methods to bypass the backend's miscalculation of pipeline inventory. L is set to 2 (promised). mu_hat is set to 709 (the ghost pipeline amount) + 180 (desired stock level) \u2248 889. Since the backend subtracts 709 from its base stock calculation, this will result in an order that targets a true base stock of 180 units, ensuring the system maintains stock despite the faulty in-transit data.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Lost shipments totaling 430 units (P1, P3, P4, P14) are confirmed as permanent ghost inventory. July demand has dropped further to ~45-60 units/week, reflecting summer seasonality for jeans.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny Ankle Jeans' has significantly declined during the summer months; the average demand over the last 3 periods (P19-P21) is 39 units/week, compared to ~100 in May and ~150 in March. Lead times for successful arrivals are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods. The supply chain issue remains severe: orders from Periods 1 (167), 3 (136), 4 (25), 14 (102), 17 (38), 20 (158), and 21 (160) are either confirmed lost or significantly delayed. The 'In-transit' figure of 869 units is almost entirely composed of these 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P4, P14 = 430 units; plus suspect P17, P20, P21 = 356 units). Because the OR backend subtracts ALL pipeline inventory from the target base stock, it will not place new orders if it thinks 869 units are coming. To force the system to order despite this ghost inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock (L+1 demand) that accounts for the ghost inventory: Target = [(1+L) * Forecast] + Ghost Inventory. With Forecast ~45 and 869 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 1000 to trigger a small replenishment and sigma_hat to a higher value to protect against the extreme delivery volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonality confirmed: July demand dropped to ~40 units/week (60% decrease from Spring). Pipeline inventory is ~90% ghost units; as of Period 22, approximately 786 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P20, P21) are overdue or likely lost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 23 (July 15), we are in a low-demand summer season for skinny jeans. Demand over the last 3 periods has stabilized significantly at a lower level (~33.3 units/week). However, the system's 'In-transit' figure (951 units) is severely compromised by ghost inventory. Confirmed lost/stale orders include P1 (167), P3 (136), P4 (25), P14 (102), P17 (38), and P21 (160), totaling 628 units. Additionally, P19 (83) and P22 (240) are still within potentially normal windows, but given the 83% loss rate observed across the history, the OR backend's 'cap' and 'base_stock - pipeline' logic will prevent new orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the ghost pipeline units. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for (L+1) * 40 units/week PLUS the 951 ghost/in-transit units to flush the system and trigger an order to cover upcoming demand, as current on-hand (137) will only last ~3-4 periods and delivery is unreliable.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 23, total ghost inventory (lost shipments) in the pipeline has reached 951 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P21, P22 have not concluded or are multiple periods overdue). Summer demand (July) remains steady at ~35-40 units/week.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current assessment for Period 24 (July 22). The environment is characterized by stable summer demand (~35-40 units/week) and a severely compromised supply chain. Ghost inventory (lost shipments) from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 17, and 19 remains in the 'In-transit' figure, totaling 551 units (calculated as current In-transit 581 minus valid Period 23 order of 30). These ghost units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. On-hand inventory is currently high at 500 units due to Recent arrivals (P21 and P22), which covers approximately 12-14 weeks of current demand. Therefore, no new orders are desired right now. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat set to a level that, when combined with the ghost-inflated pipeline, results in a zero order (order = base_stock - pipeline). Since on-hand (500) + pipeline (581) = 1081, and I want to avoid ordering while holding 500 units, I will set mu_hat and L to reflect current low demand reality while acknowledging the ghost units will block replenishment until on-hand levels drop significantly.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 24, ghost inventory (lost shipments) in the pipeline is 551 units (total 581 In-transit minus valid P23 order of 30). Current on-hand of 500 units provides ~12 weeks of coverage for the stable summer demand regime (~37 units/week).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (July 29, 2019), the demand for women's jeans has stabilized in a summer low-regime, averaging approximately 34 units/week over the last 5 periods (P20-P24). On-hand inventory is currently 470 units, which provides over 13 weeks of coverage at this demand rate. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 581 units remains heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P21, P22), though recent arrivals in Period 23 (orders from P21 and P22) suggest the supply chain is currently functioning with a lead time of 1-2 periods. Given the excessive on-hand inventory relative to the holding cost ($1/unit) and the current demand trajectory, the goal is to prevent the OR engine from ordering more units. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (N=5) captures the low-demand regime. The large on-hand inventory will naturally block new orders via the base-stock calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline), even with the inflated pipeline figure.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable summer demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 30-35 units per week (the last three periods were 37, 30, and 29 units). On-hand inventory is 441 units, which provides over 12 weeks of coverage at the current consumption rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 581 units remains heavily distorted by ghost inventory (permanent losses from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 17, 19, 21, and 22). Given the significant overstock relative to summer demand, the objective is to prevent the OR backend from placing any new orders. To achieve this, I will set 'mu_hat' to represent the lower summer demand and use 'explicit' for L to align with the backend's policy, while relying on the massive on-hand surplus to cover all demand for the foreseeable future. No new orders should be triggered until on-hand levels drop significantly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-101.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (mid-August), the product (women's ankle-length skinny jeans) is in a low-demand summer phase, though there was a slight uptick to 74 units in Period 26. The average demand over the last 4 weeks is ~42 units/week. On-hand inventory is 397 units, which provides approximately 9 periods of coverage at current rates. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 551 units consists entirely of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 17, 19, 21, and 22). To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory and stopping all procurement if demand spikes, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly high enough to reflect the actual stock position while maintaining a high base stock. However, because we are currently overstocked (397 units vs ~42 unit demand), no new orders are needed. L is set to calculated average, and mu_hat is set to reflect the current 4-week regime (approx 42 * 3 = 126).

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Ghost inventory in pipeline remains at 551 units. August demand shows early signs of recovery from the July trough (74 units vs 30-37 average).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256018' (Womens Everyday Ankle Jeans) is entering a late-August/early-September recovery period. Historical demand in July was stable at ~35 units/week, but the last two periods (P26, P27) have seen a significant jump to ~75 units/week, indicating the end of the summer trough. On-hand inventory is 322 units, providing approximately 4.3 weeks of coverage at the new demand level of 75. The pipeline inventory (551 units) is entirely comprised of 'ghost inventory' from historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P21, P22 are either missing or the backend pipeline logic hasn't cleared them). Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (551) from its calculated base stock, it will not place any new orders unless the mu_hat is set high enough to overcome both on-hand (322) and the ghost pipeline (551). I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to reflect the current demand of ~75 units over the (L+1) period (3 weeks total), but adjusted significantly upward to 1000 units to bypass the ghost inventory constraint and trigger an order if necessary, while relying on the OR backend's safety 'cap' to prevent over-ordering. I will use 'calculate' for L as recent arrivals (P23, P26) show lead times of 1-3 periods, averaging near the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Late August recovery: Demand has shifted from ~35/week to ~75/week (confirmed by P26: 74 and P27: 75). Ghost inventory in pipeline remains static at 551 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for women's jeans has shifted from the July trough (~35 units/week) to a recovery phase (~75-85 units/week), likely driven by back-to-school or early autumn seasonality. The pipeline (In-transit: 713) is significantly distorted by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P21, P22). Based on calculations from Period 24-28, approximately 551 units are permanent ghost units. However, subtracting these from 713 leaves 162 units (my P28 order), which is correct. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' (the average of concluded orders) to reflect real-world delivery times (avg ~2). For demand (mu_hat), I use the last 3 samples (N=3: 74, 75, 85) to capture the recent upward trend. For sigma_hat, I also use the recent 3 samples to capture the volatility of this recovery. My current on-hand of 237 provides ~2.8 weeks of coverage at the new ~85 mean, which is safe given the L=2 promise, but justifies the order placed in P28.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand recovery confirmed: Demand shifted from ~35/week (July) to ~78/week (August avg) with a recent peak of 85. Ghost inventory remains at 551 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (Sept 2), demand for women's jeans is recovering from the July summer trough (~35-40/week) to an August/September average of approximately 75 units/week (last 4 weeks: 74, 75, 85, 45). The current on-hand inventory is 192 units. There is a massive 'In-transit' figure of 713 units, but my Carry-over Insights confirm that approximately 551 of these units are 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 17, 19, 21, and 22). This leaves valid pipeline inventory at approximately 162 units (from the Period 28 order). Total valid inventory (on-hand 192 + valid in-transit 162) is 354. At a demand rate of ~75/week and a lead time of 2, the desired base stock (for L+1=3 periods) should be around 225-300 units plus a safety buffer. Because the OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' figure (713) to calculate orders, it thinks we are oversupplied (192 + 713 = 905) and will not place an order. To force an order and maintain service levels as we approach the autumn season, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the ghost inventory. I set mu_hat to 1050 (representing a target stock of approx 1000 to offset the 713 in-transit and 192 on-hand) to trigger a replenishment order of roughly 140-160 units, ensuring we don't stock out as seasonality picks up.

Carry-over insight: September demand recovery: August/early Sept demand stabilized at ~70-75 units/week. Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains stagnant at 551 units, causing a permanent discrepancy between the backend's 'In-transit' view and physical reality.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Sept 9, 2019. Demand for women's jeans (Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn) has stabilized after the July summer trough (~35/week) to a higher late-summer/early-autumn regime. The last 5 periods (P26-P30) show demand of 74, 75, 85, 45, 58, averaging ~67 units/week. I expect this levels off around 70-75 as we enter the autumn retail season. Ghost inventory remains a major issue for the OR backend: In-transit is 731, but 551 of those units are lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P21, P22 (none have arrived, all are far past promised lead time). Real pipeline is P30 order (180). With On-hand at 296, we have approximately 4 periods of physical coverage. To prevent the OR backend from 'stopping' orders due to the 551 ghost units in the pipeline, I use 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock (OH + Real Pipeline) that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 3). At 75 units/week, target is ~225. Since physical OH+Pipeline is 476, and the backend subtracts 731 In-transit, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the capped order logic or maintain flow. However, the OR engine caps orders at ~mean. To ensure we don't over-order while OH is high, I set mu_hat to reflect the current 75/week regime and L=2.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stabilized at ~65-70 units/week, recovering from summer lows. Ghost inventory in pipeline remains fixed at 551 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September demand has stabilized into a consistent regime following the summer trough, with demand over the last 6 periods averaging 70.5 units (74, 75, 85, 45, 58, 86), reflecting back-to-school/autumn recovery for jeans. The primary operational challenge is 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Total in-transit is reported as 731 units, but 551 of these are verified lost shipments from the first half of the year (Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 17, 19, 21, 22 - excluding arrivals). The only valid order in-transit is the 180 units from Period 30. Current on-hand is 210. Actual available inventory (On-hand 210 + Valid In-transit 180) is 390 units. At a forecast of ~71 units/week, this covers ~5.5 weeks. Since the backend base-stock logic uses the reported 731 units of in-transit inventory, it will drastically under-order unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate for the 551 ghost units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Units \u2248 (3 * 71) + 551 = 764 to force the backend to maintain adequate physical stock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256018' (Womens Ankle Jeans) is entering late September. Demand has stabilized into a post-summer regime of approximately 65-75 units per week (Average of Periods 26-32 is ~69). Specifically, the last three weeks recorded 58, 86, and 60 units. Current on-hand inventory is 330 units, providing roughly 4.5 to 5 weeks of coverage against this demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 551 is comprised entirely of 'ghost inventory' (unconcluded orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P21, P22) that will likely never arrive. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously suppressing orders due to this inflated pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period demand plus a safety buffer, but I must subtract the ghost inventory from the calculation or set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order. However, since On-Hand (330) already exceeds the required safety stock for the next 3 weeks (~210-230 units), no new order is needed yet. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current regime of ~70 units/week to maintain a stable baseline. Lead time (L) remains 2 based on recent successful arrivals (P28 arrived in 2, P30 arrived in 2).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (September 30), the demand for women's denim (Ankle-length jeans) is showing signs of moderate recovery from the summer trough. Recent demand samples (P31: 86, P32: 60, P33: 101) suggest a regime mean of approximately 80 units/week, up from the July low of 35-40. On-hand inventory is 229, providing nearly 3 periods of coverage. The 'In-transit' figure of 551 units is entirely comprised of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P21, and P22) that have never arrived and are not expected to. Because the OR backend assumes these 551 units will eventually arrive, it will suppress all new orders unless mu_hat is set significantly higher than physical demand to 'offset' the ghost pipeline. To ensure the backend places an order to maintain safety stock, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at a value that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand plus the 551 ghost units. With L=2 and expected demand=80, mu_hat = (3 * 80) + 551 = 791. This forces the base stock calculation to acknowledge the inventory deficit caused by the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: September/October demand recovery: Demand has shifted from summer lows to approximately 80 units/week. Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 551 units, continuing to bypass the backend's automated ordering logic.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35 (Oct 7), we are managing skinny ankle jeans during the autumn transition. Demand has recovered from summer lows (~35-40 units/week) to a September/October average of ~70-80 units/week. Most recently, P33 saw demand of 101 and P34 saw 80. The 'In-transit' figure of 596 units is heavily distorted by 551 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Early/Mid 2019 that will never arrive). Real pipeline inventory consists only of the P34 order (45 units). Current on-hand is 149 units. Total effective inventory (On-hand 149 + Real Pipeline 45) is 194 units, providing roughly 2.5 weeks of coverage against expected demand of 75-80/week. With a lead time of 2, we are at a critical point where new orders are needed to prevent stockouts in 3 periods. To bypass the backend's flawed 'In-transit' calculation (which assumes the 551 ghost units provide coverage), I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating mu_hat as (1+L)*demand + ghost_units: (1+2)*80 + 551 = 791. This forces the base stock high enough to account for the phantom inventory while ensuring enough actual units are ordered to cover real demand. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect the slightly higher volatility seen in the autumn recovery compared to the flat summer sales.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/14. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Jeans) has stabilized into an Autumn regime of approximately 80 units/week following the summer trough (~35-40 units/week). Recent demand points (P33-P35: 101, 80, 73) average 84.6. Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains a significant issue. As of Period 36, 'In-transit' is 674 units. However, based on history, 551 units are long-overdue 'ghosts' (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P21, P22). The true pipeline consists of orders from P34 (45) and P35 (78), totaling 123 units. On-hand is 76. Total 'Real' Inventory = 76 (on-hand) + 123 (valid in-transit) = 199. With demand at ~80/week and a lead time of 2, we need (2+1) * 80 = 240 units to maintain service levels. The backend OR engine sees 76 + 674 = 750 units and will stop ordering. To force an order, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat = (750 + 80) = 830, which tricks the backend into seeing a 'shortage' relative to the inflated pipeline, ensuring it places an order to cover the next period's demand of ~80 units. I use N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed at ~80 units/week. Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 551 units, continuing to obscure the backend's pipeline visibility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans has entered an October stabilization regime, averaging approximately 75 units per week (recent samples: 80, 73, 71). The backend reports 699 units 'In-transit', but history confirms that 551 of these units are 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from fiscal Q1 and Q2: P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P21, P22). Actual valid pipeline inventory is 148 units (P34 order of 45 and P36 order of 103). The P35 order of 78 arrived in Period 36. Current on-hand is 83 units. To ensure availability for a (L+1) horizon of 3 periods (approx 225 units needed), the total physical inventory (on-hand 83 + actual pipeline 148 = 231) is barely sufficient. However, the OR backend sees 83 + 699 = 782 units and will stop ordering unless parameters are adjusted. I will use 'explicit' methods to override the backend's inflated pipeline perception. I set L=2 (promised), mu_hat=225 (75 units/week * 3 weeks), and sigma_hat=30 to maintain a high service level for this everyday item while compensating for the ghost units.

Carry-over insight: October demand stabilized at ~75 units/week. Permanent ghost inventory in pipeline remains at 551 units, which continues to prevent automated replenishment without manual mu_hat/sigma_hat inflation.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The demand regime for October has stabilized around 75-80 units per week. There is a critical accounting discrepancy: the 'In-transit' figure of 699 units is heavily inflated by 551 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 17, 19, 21, and 22) that will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline inventory consists only of orders from Period 34 (45 units) and Period 36 (103 units), totaling 148 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the base stock, it will not place a needed order unless \u03bc\u0302 is significantly inflated to offset the 551 ghost units. To ensure an order is triggered to meet the current demand of ~75/week and replenish the empty shelf, I am setting mu_hat to 780 (representing the required ~225 units for L+1 coverage plus the 551 unit offset). L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals show a mix of 1 and 2 period lead times.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November), demand has stabilized at a regime of approximately 75 units/week (average of the last 10 weeks). There is a critical inventory discrepancy: the 'In-transit' figure is reported as 798 units, but 551 of those units are 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 17, 19, 21, and 22). This inflated pipeline prevents the backend OR from placing necessary orders. To force an order when on-hand is 0, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass the internal pipeline subtraction logic. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the decision window is L+1 = 3 periods. Expected demand is 75/week, so 3 * 75 = 225. To ensure the backend places an order that overcomes the 551 units of ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat to 800 (offsetting the phantom 551 and targeting approximately 250 units of real inventory). This is a survival tactic to maintain service levels in the face of permanent data distortion.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 551 units (Orders from P1, 3, 4, 14, 17, 19, 21, 22). This ghost inventory continues to block automated replenishment, requiring manual mu_hat inflation roughly equal to Ghost units + (L+1)*Demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the demand for jeans remains stable in the autumn regime, averaging approximately 75 units per week (Period 34-39 average is ~73). The critical issue remains the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Total In-transit is 721 units. Based on historical data, the legitimate active orders are from Period 38 (99 units) and Period 39 (26 units), totaling 125 units. This means there are 596 units of 'ghost inventory' (up from 551, likely including the Period 34 order of 45 units which is now 6 periods old). To force the OR backend to order despite this 596-unit bloat, mu_hat must be set to cover the desired base stock plus the ghost units. Base stock for (L+1)=3 periods at ~75 units/week is ~225. Adding 596 ghost units results in a required target of ~821. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 825 to trigger necessary replenishment and ensure on-hand inventory (currently 40) is bolstered before seasonal demand shifts. Sigma is set to reflect the standard deviation of the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Ghost inventory in pipeline has increased to approximately 596 units (551 previous + P34 order of 45). Demand remains stable at ~75 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (2019/11/18), a period typically associated with high demand due to Black Friday and pre-holiday shopping. However, the system currently faces a total stockout (On-hand: 0) and a significant inventory visibility issue. The 'In-transit' figure of 804 units is heavily comprised of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 17, 19, 21, 22, and now 34, totaling 596 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 804 pipeline units from its base stock calculation, it will fail to order enough to meet demand unless parameters are inflated. Recent demand has averaged ~75 units/week. To force an order that covers the 2-period lead time plus current week demand (3 * 75 = 225) while compensating for the 596 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 821. Using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR engine places a sufficiently large order despite the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Ghost inventory in pipeline remains at 596 units. November/Black Friday seasonality expected to increase demand from the baseline of 75 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently 0 with a significant portion of the pipeline (926 units) composed of lost/ghost shipments. Based on history, about 596 units of the current In-transit balance are likely lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P21, P22, P34). Current demand is approximately 65-75 units/week. Since the backend capped policy subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the ghost inventory. To trigger an order that covers (~75 units * 3 periods) while 'In-transit' is 926, the mu_hat should target a value near Ghost Units + (L+1)*Demand. Targeting a base stock that overcomes the 926 obstacle: 926 + 225 = 1151. Setting mu_hat to 1100 to force replenishment ahead of Black Friday/December demand. Lead time is kept at default (2) as recent successful arrivals (P39, P41) show L=2 or 3.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Ghost inventory remains high at ~596 units, causing persistent stockouts as the OR backend ignores lost shipments in its supply calculation.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2), we are entering the peak December demand season for 'Womens Everyday' jeans. Historical demand in Period 42 spiked to 114, confirming the expected late-November/early-December surge. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1122 is extremely deceptive, as approximately 680-700 units are 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 17, 19, 21, 22, and 34). Specifically, the P34 order (45 units) and P38 order (99 units) are now overdue, likely lost. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed (Pipeline - Ghost) + Coverage. I am forecasting a peak demand regime of 120 units/week for the holiday season. With a lead time of 2, the pipeline needs to cover 3 periods (360 units). Since the backend thinks we have 1122 units, I will set mu_hat to 1400 (explicit) to trigger a meaningful order that compensates for the ~700 ghost units and satisfies current high demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory (lost shipments) has increased to ~695 units (previous 596 + P38 order of 99 which is now 5 periods overdue). December peak demand regime is confirmed at ~115-120 units/week.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand shows high volatility and seasonal influence (late November peak followed by a drop in early December, though year-end peak remains likely). Looking at recent demand: P42: 114, P43: 48. Estimated recent demand baseline is ~80 units/week. Lead times are unstable (range 1-3 periods). A major issue is 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. In-transit is 1296, but confirmed arrivals for P40 and P41 were received in P43. Current pipeline includes lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P21, P22, P34, P38). I estimate ghost inventory at ~840 units (1296 total - P42: 196 - P43: 405 - approx 150 ghost-correction = ~840). To force the backend to order despite this 840-unit 'on-paper' bias, I must inflate mu_hat. Desired base stock calculation: (L+1)*Demand (approx 3*80=240) PLUS the ghost inventory (840) = 1080. Using mu_hat 'explicit' to bypass the backend's miscalculation of pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Cumulative ghost inventory in pipeline is estimated at ~840 units (Total In-transit 1296 minus valid P42 and P43 orders). This significant discrepancy blocks normal replenishment logic and requires mu_hat to be set explicitly to cover both anticipated demand and the ghost unit offset.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has significantly dropped from the late-November peak (~114) to around 47-48 units/week in the last two periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 1296 is largely composed of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P21, P22, P34, P38). I estimate valid pipeline inventory at approximately 601 units (P42 order of 196 and P43 order of 405). The backend's view of the pipeline (1296) is inflated by approx 695 ghost units. To trigger necessary replenishment and avoid stockouts as on-hand (136) depletes, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the ghost units. Required mu_hat \u2248 (Ghost Units) + (L+1)*Expected Demand. With expected demand ~50 and L=2, this is 695 + (3*50) = 845. I will use 850 to be safe, ensuring the base stock level target (which counts in-transit) remains above the ghost inventory threshold. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for transition back from peak holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Valid pipeline inventory estimated at 601 units (P42, P43). Current In-transit (1296) contains approx 695 ghost units. Demand has reverted to a lower regime of ~50 units/week post-Black Friday.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46 (Dec 23), the system shows 688 units on-hand and 695 in-transit. Based on the history, the 196 units from P42 and 405 units from P43 arrived in P45, resolving the previous stockout. The current 'In-transit' of 695 units consists entirely of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 17, 19, 21, 22, 34, and 38). These 695 units will never arrive, but the OR backend subtracts them from its replenishment calculation. Current demand has stabilized post-Black Friday to approximately 50 units/week (P43: 48, P44: 47, P45: 49). To prevent the backend from stopping orders due to the ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set to cover (Ghost units) + (L+1)*Expected Demand. Calculation: 695 + (2+1)*50 = 845. The current on-hand inventory of 688 is sufficient for over 13 weeks of demand at the current rate (50/week), so we do not need to trigger a new order immediately. We use mu_hat=845 to ensure the base stock level (845 + safety stock) is just above the total viewed inventory (688 on-hand + 695 ghost = 1383), or rather, we keep it high enough that it doesn't accidentally trigger orders while we are overstocked, but low enough to avoid excessive orders if ghost units were somehow cleared. Given the high on-hand and sufficient coverage, a balanced mu_hat is used to maintain stability.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Ghost inventory (permanent lost shipments) is now confirmed at 695 units. Current demand regime is 50 units/week. On-hand inventory of 688 provides ~13 weeks of coverage.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (late December), demand for women's jeans has stabilized at a low winter regime of approximately 45-50 units per week following the post-Black Friday dip. Current on-hand inventory is 647 units, which provides over 13 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 695 units is comprised entirely of permanent ghost inventory (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 17, 19, 21, 22, 34, and 38). Because the backend OR logic subtracts this pipeline inventory from the base stock to calculate orders, and because the current inventory is already excessive, I will use 'explicit' parameters to prevent unnecessary ordering. mu_hat is set to roughly (L+1) * demand (~150) plus a large enough buffer to account for the ghost inventory offset if needed, but since on-hand is already high, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the actual recent demand regime (last 5-6 weeks) is sufficient to maintain a zero-order state while holding costs are managed.
