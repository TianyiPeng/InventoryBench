Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 636323003 (Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans). Historically, demand has shown a clear upward trend over the last five weeks: 19, 46, 48, 62, 85. This suggests a seasonal ramp-up as we head into spring. The promised lead time is 2, and we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, making this a critical ordering period. Given the strong trend, using all historical samples (default) would underestimate current demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent growth (mean of 48, 62, 85 \u2248 65), which results in a mu_hat of (1+2)*65 = 195. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. L is set to 'default' (promised 2) until actual lead times are observed.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which likely follows seasonal trends for early spring. Historical demand has shown a clear upward trend: 19, 46, 48, 62, 85, and most recently 67 (sold=0 because on-hand was 0). The last three samples (62, 85, 67) suggest a higher demand regime compared to the start of January. Average demand of the last 3 samples is approximately 71.3. Promised lead time (L) is 2. The pipeline inventory (96 ordered in P1) is in transit. To set base stock, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent growth trend and default for sigma_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock. L is set to default (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of high-waisted skinny ankle jeans. We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical demand data from Jan/Feb shows a clear upward trend: 19, 46, 48, 62, 85. In the game periods (P1 and P2), demand surged significantly to 67 and 173 respectively. This likely reflects the transition into the Spring apparel season where denim demand typically peaks. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales of 240 units total in P1 and P2. We have 205 units in transit (96 ordered P1 + 109 ordered P2). Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order (96 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the recent high-demand regime, while keeping L at 'default' (2) until arrivals confirm otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from a Jan/Feb average of ~52 to a Feb game average of 120 (+130%), signaling Spring seasonality.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Ankle-length jeans', a spring/summer staple. Demand has spiked significantly since mid-February (moving from an average of ~52 to ~132 in the last three periods), confirming a strong seasonal shift. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts. 387 units are in transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 (96 units) should arrive during Period 3 (visible in P4 start), and the order from Period 2 (109 units) should arrive during Period 4 (visible in P5 start). However, since Period 3 conclude still shows 0 arrived, the first shipment is effectively at the promised lead time window now. I will maintain L=2. For mu_hat, I'm using the last 3 samples (67, 173, 156) which average ~132. Demand is likely to stay high or grow as spring progresses. To ensure the backend places an order that accounts for the current backlog and high demand, I will set mu_hat based on the recent N=3 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2071.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a high-waist ankle denim jean, which typically sees rising demand in early spring (March). Looking at the history, demand spiked significantly starting in Period 2 (Feb 18), jumping from sub-100 levels to values like 173 and 156, before settling at 110 in Period 4. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 450 units in transit. Period 4 concluded with the arrival of the Period 2 order (109 units), confirming the actual lead time L=2 periods. Since arrivals in Period 3 and Period 1 are still not visible (Period 1 order of 96 units is potentially lost or significantly delayed as it should have arrived in Period 3), I need to ensure the pipeline covers demand. The current mean demand over the last 4 game periods is approx 127 units. With L=2, mu_hat should cover 3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new, higher demand regime while setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed lead time of 2. Sigma reflects high volatility due to the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time equals promised (L=2) based on Period 2 order arrival in Period 4 conclusion. Period 1 order (96 units) is likely lost as it is overdue by 1 period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees strong Spring demand. Looking at historical data, we saw a demand surge in Feb (averaging ~120), but the last two weeks (P4 and P5) showed lower demand (110 and 67). However, we have been stocked out (ending inventory=0) for every period except P4, which likely suppressed observed demand. The Period 1 order (96 units) is now 3 periods overdue and clearly lost. The Period 3 order (182 units) should arrive this period (P6) based on L=2. Total in-transit is 516 (P1: 96, P3: 182, P4: 172, P5: 66). Since we assume P1 is lost, effective pipeline is 420. Given the stockouts, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (P1-P5) to capture the higher Spring average (~114/week) and use L=2.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed Period 1 order of 96 units remains lost (3 periods past promised lead time).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), the product (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens) is experiencing high demand consistent with Spring seasonality. However, we are currently facing zero on-hand inventory and have lost significant sales due to stockouts. The Period 1 order (96 units) is officially considered lost (5 periods overdue). The Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2) and the Period 5 order arrived early (L=1). The Period 3 (182 units) and Period 4 (172 units) orders are both currently in-transit; Period 3 is now overdue (due Period 5, now Period 7), and Period 4 should have arrived in Period 6. This suggests severe supply chain instability or additional lost shipments. Since demand is stable but supply is unreliable, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but monitoring for losses.mu_hat is set using N=3 to capture the recent sustained demand regime of ~93 units/period (average of Periods 4-6). Over-ordering is currently mitigated by the OR backend's cap, but parameters must reflect the need to replenish safety stock once the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Supply chain instability detected; Period 3 and Period 4 orders (total 354 units) are overdue by 1-2 periods, following the confirmed loss of the Period 1 order.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees high demand during the Spring season. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P3-P7) is 112.2 units, confirming a sustained shift from the early Jan/Feb average (~52). Supply chain instability is the primary concern: Period 1 order (96 units) is 5 periods overdue and considered lost. Period 3 order (182 units) is 3 periods overdue (promised L=2). Period 4 order (172 units) is 2 periods overdue. Only the Period 5 order arrived early (L=1). With 0 on-hand inventory and the pipeline (450 units) currently unreliable, I must increase the lead time parameter 'L' to 'explicit' 4 to account for the current bottleneck/delays and ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (approx 112/week) to capture the current Spring demand regime while maintaining a high sigma_hat to account for both demand volatility and supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption intensified: Period 3 order (182 units) is now 3 periods overdue; total overdue pipeline inventory stands at 354 units (P3 & P4 orders).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the SKU (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens) is facing a severe supply chain crisis. On-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of concluded periods shows: Period 1 order (96 units) is lost (7 periods overdue); Period 3 order (182 units) is 4 periods overdue; Period 4 order (172 units) is 3 periods overdue. Only the Period 2 order (2 periods) and Period 5 order (1 period) arrived successfully. Weekly demand is currently averaging ~98 units over the last 6 weeks (Periods 3-8). The pipeline inventory of 615 units contains 450 units of potentially lost or significantly delayed stock (P1, P3, P4). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' pipeline inventory, I am setting L to 4 (reflecting the current delay) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 600. This 600 covers the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) at a rate of ~120 units/period, which accounts for the current mean plus a buffer for Spring seasonality. This forced high base stock will trigger replenishment despite the large (but unreliable) In-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Period 3 and Period 4 orders (total 354 units) are now 3-4 periods overdue and likely lost or severely delayed, joining the lost Period 1 order. Reliable lead time is currently non-existent, but estimated at 4+ for planning.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 636323003 (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens) is currently unreliable. Period 1, 3, and 4 orders (totaling 450 units) are all significantly overdue and presumably lost. Only the Period 2 and Period 5 orders arrived (leads times 2 and 1 respectively). As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has cooled significantly in the last sample (22 units) after a high of 210+ in earlier March phases, suggesting the 'Spring Seasonality' spike has passed or is volatile. Given the high risk of lost orders, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 4 to force the OR backend to calculate a larger buffer. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent average of (121+74+22) plus the current period forecast, which helps stabilize against the extreme volatility seen in March/April. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the high variance in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: late Feb/March saw demand spikes (110-173), but early April shows sharp decline (22). Lead time remains unstable with confirmed losses of P1, P3, and P4 shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent arrival in Period 10 confirms that the supply chain is no longer fully broken; shipments from Period 8 and 9 arrived (lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively), although shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost and must be ignored for pipeline inventory calculations. Current demand has dropped significantly from the February/March peak (~120) to an April average of ~26 over the last three periods (22, 31). This looks like a seasonal shift away from skinny jeans as the weather warms or a post-Easter lull. With 239 units on-hand and an average demand of ~26, we have approximately 9 periods of stock available. Given the high on-hand levels and the need to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while demand is low, no new order is needed. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the varied arrival times (1 and 2 periods), mu_hat to 'recent_N' (N=3) to capture the sharp April demand decline, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect the current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery: Shipments from Period 8 and 9 arrived successfully (Lead times 1-2 periods), resolving the previous complete stall. Demand regime shift at Period 9: Demand dropped from a late-Feb/Mar average of ~115 to an April average of ~26 (-77%), likely due to product seasonality.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/29. The product (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens Denim) has entered a low-demand regime since early April. Demand for the last three periods (P9-P11) has been 22, 31, and 18 respectively (average ~24), confirming the regime shift noted in Carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory is 450 units, but it includes Period 1, 3, and 4 orders (96 + 182 + 172 = 450 units) which are now heavily overdue and confirmed lost based on the arrival of much more recent Period 8 and 9 orders. Effectively, the usable pipeline is 0. On-hand inventory is 221 units, which at the current demand rate (~24/week) covers over 9 weeks of supply. As the lead time has stabilized back to 1-2 periods and we are heavily overstocked relative to current demand, I will set L to 1 to reflect recent actual performance and use the last 3 samples for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand plateau. Sigma_hat is set using recent data to account for the reduced volatility in this low-demand state.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are in a low-demand regime for this 'Ladies Denim' product, which saw a significant drop starting in early April (Period 9). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P9-P12) is 23.75 units, compared to the peak season average of ~115. Supply chain performance has stabilized with recent lead times of 1-2 periods, although orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 450 units) are confirmed lost and currently inflate the 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low-demand plateau. I will use the explicit method for lead time L=2 to reflect the promised and recently observed performance, ignoring the noise from the lost historical shipments. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect current volatility. With 197 units on hand and very low demand, the OR engine will likely place zero orders, which is appropriate given our high stock level relative to the current sales rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed low: April-May average demand is ~24 units, a 79% reduction from the March peak (~115). Pipeline inventory of 450 units is composed entirely of lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Demand is currently in a low regime, averaging approximately 24 units per period since early April (Period 9), which represents a significant 79% decline from the February/March peak of ~115 units. This shift is likely seasonal as 'Skinny Ankle Jeans' see higher demand in early Spring. The pipeline inventory (450 units) consists of lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (96 + 182 + 172 = 450), which were ordered over 10 periods ago and are non-recoverable. On-hand inventory is 180 units, which at the current demand rate of 24 units/period, provides approximately 7.5 periods of coverage. Since L=2, the total coverage required for the review+lead period (3 periods) is roughly 72 units. No new orders are needed as current stock significantly exceeds the required base stock levels. Parameters are set to match the recent low-demand regime (N=5) and the promised lead time (L=2) to allow the OR backend to correctly calculate that a zero-order is optimal while maintaining a buffer for the observed low volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' has significantly declined since April, stabilizing at a low regime (avg ~20 units/week) compared to the March peak (~115 units/week). The last five periods of demand (P10-P14) are 31, 18, 24, 17, and 11, averaging 20.2 units. Current on-hand inventory is 169 units, which covers approximately 8 weeks of demand at the current rate. The in-transit inventory of 450 units consists of lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4. Because the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline inventory' from the target base stock, these lost units effectively prevent the system from placing new orders. However, with 169 units on hand and very low demand, no additional orders are needed. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the low-demand regime and lead time to the promised 2 periods to maintain a target inventory that prevents unnecessary overstocking while demand is low.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is in a low-demand regime following a sharp decline in early April. The average demand since Period 9 is approximately 23 units (N=7). Period 15 demand was 18, and the current on-hand inventory is 151 units, which covers more than 6 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' quantity of 450 units consists entirely of lost orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (96+182+172=450). Because these shipments are several months overdue and previous arrivals in Period 10 confirmed lead times of 1-2 periods, these 450 units are considered unrecoverable ghost inventory. If treated as valid pipeline stock by the OR engine, it would prevent replenishment even if on-hand dropped to zero. However, since on-hand is currently high (151) and demand is low, no ordering is required yet. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current low-demand stability (avg ~23/week), and use default/promised lead time (L=2) as recent arrivals show recovery from the earlier logistics failure.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a pair of skinny denim jeans. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift around early April: March mean demand was ~115, while the April-May period (Periods 9-16) dropped significantly to a mean of ~19.4 units per period. This low-demand state is consistent and sustained over 8 periods. On-hand inventory is 137 units, which at the current burn rate of ~20 units/week, covers approximately 6.8 periods. The in-transit inventory of 450 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4, which are now months overdue and should be disregarded for planning purposes. Because current inventory (137) exceeds the base stock target for the next 3 weeks (L+1=3, 20*3=60), no new orders are needed. I will use 'recent_8' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current post-peak low-demand regime. L is set to 'default' as recent successful shipments (Periods 8 and 9) arrived within the promised window (1-2 periods).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a low-demand regime characteristic of post-Spring seasonality (May-June). Since Period 9 (early April), weekly demand has dropped significantly, averaging approximately 18.5 units over the last 9 periods, with the most recent sample at 9 units. On-hand inventory is currently 128 units, which covers approximately 7 weeks of current demand. The pipeline inventory (450 units) consists of shipments from Period 1 (96), Period 3 (182), and Period 4 (172) that are now 13-16 periods overdue and are confirmed lost. The OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock; since 450 units of bad data (lost shipments) exist in the pipeline, the backend will compute an order of 0 unless parameters are adjusted. However, with an on-hand balance of 128 units and a low demand rate, 0 is the correct physical order to avoid mounting holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=9) to reflect the low-demand plateau since early April, and L=2 (promised) to stabilize calculations.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans' has entered a stable low-demand summer phase. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 14-18), demand has averaged 12.2 units per period (11, 18, 14, 9, 9). The current on-hand inventory of 119 units is sufficient to cover approximately 9-10 periods of demand at this current rate. The in-transit inventory of 450 units consists entirely of historical orders from Period 1 (96), Period 3 (182), and Period 4 (172) which are long overdue (15+ periods) and established as lost; however, the OR backend logic considers 'in-transit' as viable pipeline inventory. To prevent the OR from under-ordering in the future or making erratic calculations based on these 'phantom' units, and because on-hand inventory is already high relative to demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the low-demand regime accurately. I will use 'calculate' for lead time as recent arrivals (P8, P9) showed the supply chain has stabilized near the promised 2 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The demand for skinny high-waisted denim has entered a sustained low-demand regime since mid-April. Over the last 10 periods (P10-P19), the mean demand has dropped significantly to approximately 15.6 units per period, down from over 100 in March. On-hand inventory is 114 units, which at the current consumption rate provides over 7 periods of coverage. The in-transit inventory of 450 units consists entirely of shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4, which are now 15+ periods past their promised lead time and are confirmed lost. I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current low-demand stability while ignoring the high-demand volatility of early Spring. Lead time has stabilized back to the promised 1-2 periods for successful deliveries, so I will use 'calculate' to reflect recent successful arrivals. No additional orders are needed at this stage due to the high stock-to-demand ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level (~16 units/period) throughout May and June, confirming a post-Spring seasonal decline for this SKU.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a low-demand regime following its Spring peak. Demand over the last 11 periods (since mid-April) has averaged approximately 18 units, with Period 20 showing a slight increase to 37. On-hand inventory is currently 77 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4 periods of demand based on the recent average, while the pipeline inventory of 450 units consists entirely of lost shipments from early periods (P1, P3, and P4) that have not arrived in over 15 periods. Given that the lead time has stabilized at 1-2 periods for recent successful arrivals, and the backend OR logic will account for the massive (lost) pipeline when calculating orders, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 samples (N=11) to reflect the low-demand stability. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR engine due to the high on-hand relative to demand and the phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for these skinny denim jeans has stabilized in a lower regime following the Spring peak, with a slight uptick in the last two periods (37 and 65 units). The average demand over the last 11 periods (P11-P21) is approximately 21 units. On-hand inventory is down to 12 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 450 units is composed of lost shipments from Period 1 (96), Period 3 (182), and Period 4 (172), which are now over 15 periods overdue and effectively nonexistent. To trigger a new order from the OR backend, I must use 'explicit' parameters for mu_hat and sigma_hat that ignore this phantom pipeline inventory. I will set mu_hat based on the recent average demand of ~25 units across the (L+1)=3 period horizon. I'll use a conservative lead time of 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P8, P9) showed the supply chain recovered to 1-2 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' has surged significantly over the last three weeks (P20: 37, P21: 65, P22: 144) compared to the stable May/June average of ~16. This suggests a mid-summer or back-to-school demand spike for denim. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 450 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (now >18 periods overdue). For ordering purposes, the OR backend must ignore these 'ghost' units in the pipeline and account for the new demand regime. I will use a recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend while incorporating the low May demand. Lead time is stabilized at the promised 2 periods (based on the last successful arrivals in P10).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: High-summer demand spike for denim detected. Weekly demand increased from a May/June average of ~16 to a recent 3-week average of 82 (+412%).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-summer demand regime for denim (Period 24). The demand over the last three weeks (P21-P23) has spiked to 65, 144, and 107 (average ~105), confirming the shift noted in Period 23 carry-over. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 450 units comprises shipments from P1, P3, and P4, which are now over 20 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory from the base stock, these 'ghost' units will prevent any new orders unless accounted for. I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (promised) to stabilize. For mu_hat, I will use 'explicit' with a value of 525 (calculated as (1+L) * mean of last 3 periods: 3 * 105) plus an additional buffer to offset the 450 units of lost inventory so the OR engine actually places an order. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the high volatility of this new peak season.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a high-summer demand spike that began at Period 21. Demand over the last 4 periods has been 65, 144, 107, and 46 (average ~90). This confirms the shift noted in the Carry-over Insights (+412% from the May/June low). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The Pipeline Inventory (In-transit) is 776 units, which is significantly inflated by historical lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, and 4 total 450 units). Only the 326 units ordered in Period 24 are viable current inventory. To ensure the OR engine places an order to cover the current demand peak (\u03bc ~ 90), L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (excluding losses), and mu_hat is set using N=4 (the current high-demand regime) to normalize the spikes. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high volatility seen in this summer window (std dev is significant).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). The SKU (Ladies Denim Jeans) has entered a high-demand summer regime since early July (Period 21). Historical demand in this regime has been 65, 144, 107, 46, and 80. The average demand over these 5 periods is 88.4 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts recently. While there is a large pipeline (776 units), 450 units of that are confirmed lost shipments from early in the game (P1, P3, P4). Excluding these lost units, the active pipeline is 326 units (ordered in P24). Under the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from P24 is expected to arrive during the current period (P26) and be available for P27. Given the high demand and the risk of further lost shipments, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime (N=5) and lead time to the promised default. I am choosing recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the 88.4 average, ensuring the base stock level targets the summer spike while the OR's cap logic prevents excessive over-ordering against the 326 active pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Summer denim demand regime confirmed (Periods 21-25): average demand increased to ~88 units/period from a previous low of ~16. Active pipeline inventory should exclude the 450 units lost in P1, P3, and P4.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand Summer regime (Periods 21-26), with an average demand of approximately 96 units over the last three weeks (107, 46, 80, 136). The on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout since Period 22. Pipeline inventory is nominally 776 units, but 450 of these (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are confirmed lost based on historical carry-over. The only viable in-transit order is the 326 units placed in Period 24. This order is expected to arrive in Period 26 or 27 (the current period) based on a 2-period lead time. Since it has not yet concluded, we must maintain a high base-stock target to recover from the stockout. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (late July-August) while smoothing the volatility. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the observed volatility (approx 35-40 units) in this high-demand segment.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Ankle-length jeans' is currently in a high-demand summer regime (Periods 21-27) with an average demand of approximately 98 units per period (65, 144, 107, 46, 80, 136, 109). We are currently experiencing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 776 includes 450 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) and a recent order of 326 from P24. Given the date (Aug 19), we should expect continued high demand before a seasonal shift. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to capture the current stable behavior (L=2) observed since P10, ignoring the earlier disruptions. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=7) to focus on the current high-demand regime since the Summer spike started in Period 21. For sigma_hat, N=7 is also used to reflect the significantly higher volatility (standard deviation) seen in this recent period compared to the low-demand May/June period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a high-demand summer regime. The average demand since Period 21 is approximately 105 units/period, compared to the spring average. The current inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0, and demand has consistently exceeded available stock. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 776) includes 450 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost. The only valid in-transit order is the 326 units placed in Period 24, which is now overdue (promised L=2, now at period N+4). This suggests either a recurring lead-time disruption or another lost shipment. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent delays and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated summer demand (~105/week) while ignoring the spring lows. The OR backend needs to place a significant recovery order because the current valid pipeline is insufficient to meet this high demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer denim demand regime (Periods 21-28) confirmed: average demand sustained at ~105 units/period (+550% vs May/June). Continued supply chain instability: Period 24 order (326 units) is now 2 periods overdue beyond promised lead time.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. The summer denim demand regime (Periods 21-29) is strongly sustained with an average demand of approximately 106 units per period. The supply chain remains highly unreliable: Period 24's order (326 units) is now 3 periods overdue beyond the promised lead time of 2, totaling 6 periods since it was placed. Including the 450 units previously lost in P1, P3, and P4, the total likely lost/stalled pipeline inventory is 776 units (which perfectly matches the current In-transit status). Since on-hand is 0 and no arrivals have occurred, I must treat the pipeline as effectively zero to trigger a new order. I will use a recent_N of 9 to capture the summer regime for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I will set L to 'explicit' at 4 periods to account for the observed delays and prevent premature stockouts if a shipment actually moves.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Supply chain failure confirmed for second major wave; Period 24 order (326 units) is 3 periods overdue (6 periods total transit), joining P1, P3, and P4 in the 'likely lost' category. Effective pipeline for OR calculations is 0 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The SKU (Ankle-length jeans) is currently in a sustained high-demand summer/autumn regime. Since Period 21 (July 1), the average demand has been approximately 107 units per period. The supply chain is severely disrupted: In-transit inventory of 776 units consists of likely lost shipments from P1 (96), P3 (182), P4 (172), and now P24 (326). With on-hand inventory at 0 and no arrivals since Period 10, there is a total stockout. To recover, I must ignore the 'phantom' pipeline inventory and set parameters based on the current high demand regime (Periods 21-30). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the mean of 106.2 and a standard deviation reflecting the summer volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure we order based on the promised timing while recognizing the system's stockout state, forcing the OR to place an order that covers at least (2+1)*106.2 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand Summer/Fall denim regime (average demand ~115 units/period over the last 5 periods). On-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory of 776 units is highly unreliable. Historical analysis confirms that 450 units (from P1, P3, P4) are definitively lost. Furthermore, the Period 24 order (326 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting it is also lost or indefinitely delayed. The OR backend's 'capped policy' subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock; to ensure the system places new orders to meet current high demand, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat high enough to offset the phantom pipeline (776 units) plus the required safety stock, I trigger the necessary procurement. \u03bc_hat is set to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at ~120 units/period (360) plus the 776 'lost' units to neutralize the pipeline subtraction by the backend, totaling 1136. Lead time L is set to explicit 2 to align with the promised time, asRecent successful arrivals (P10) showed L=1 or 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Pipeline failure confirmed for 776 units (P1, P3, P4, and P24 orders); these units are 5+ periods overdue and considered lost. High-demand denim regime continues with average demand ~115 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' is in a high-demand Summer/Fall denim regime, with demand averaging approximately 110 units per period over the last 12 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' total of 1212 units includes 776 units from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 24 which are 5+ periods overdue and confirmed lost based on historical patterns. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 436 units (the order placed last period). To ensure the OR backend recalculates the base stock correctly and attempts to fill the current stockout, I will set 'L' to 2 (promised). However, since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory (1212 units) from its calculated base stock, and 1212 is likely higher than the base stock, it will result in no order being placed. To bypass the 'lost' units inflating the pipeline, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*forecast + (lost units to replenish). Forecast mean is ~110. (1+2)*110 = 330. To counteract the 776 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I must provide a mu_hat that covers both the required base stock and the lost inventory. 330 + 776 = 1106.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The SKU is high-waisted denim, which has been in a high-demand regime since early July (Period 21). Average demand over the last 13 periods (P21-P33) is approximately 109 units/period. The supply chain has significant reliability issues: orders from P1, P3, P4, and P24 (totaling 776 units) are confirmed lost/stalled based on multiple periods of overdue status. The in-transit total of 1212 includes these 776 lost units, meaning the 'real' pipeline consists only of the P32 order (436 units). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 'ghost' units, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' to ignore lost inventory and target the current demand regime (~110 units/period). This results in a base stock targeting (L+1) * 110 = 330 units. Since on-hand is 0 and real pipeline is 436 (P32 order), the OR engine calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline) would naturally result in 0 additional units ordered this period, which is appropriate as we await the P32 shipment and avoid over-committing to a broken supply chain.

Carry-over insight: P32 order (436 units) is the only active pipeline; P1, P3, P4, and P24 (776 units) are confirmed lost. High-demand denim regime continues (P21-P33 avg: 109 units/period).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand Summer/Autumn denim regime (Periods 32-34 average demand ~112 units). On-hand inventory is 0, and the total in-transit quantity of 1212 units is heavily skewed by 776 units of confirmed 'lost' shipments (P1, P3, P4, and P24). The only theoretically active shipment is from Period 32 (436 units), which has reached its promised lead time (L=2) but hasn't arrived as of the Period 34 conclusion. Given the history of complete shipment failures, the pipeline inventory must be treated as near-zero or extremely unreliable to ensure the OR engine triggers a new order. I set L to 'explicit' at 2 to reflect the promised window, mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering the high-demand period since P21) to capture the current mean of ~109 units/period, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=14 to account for the volatility in this period. This will generate an order to cover the (L+1) period demand (~327 units) regardless of the phantom in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Pipeline failure verified at 776 units (P1, P3, P4, P24). P32 order (436 units) is now at its promised lead time window; if it fails to arrive by P36 conclusion, it will also be categorized as lost/severely delayed.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand denim regime (approx. 110 units/period since Period 21). The Period 32 order of 436 units arrived in Period 35 with an actual lead time of 3 periods (promised was 2). The 776 units currently in 'In-transit' are from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, 4, and 24, which are significantly overdue and confirmed lost in previous carry-over insights. These 776 units must be ignored in the OR engine's pipeline calculation to avoid under-ordering. Setting L=3 reflects the actual observed lead time of the most recent successful delivery. Demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 31-35) averaged 106 units. I am setting mu_hat to (1+L) * 110 = 440 to maintain the current high-demand base stock and setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Lead time for the most recent successful order (P32) was confirmed at 3 periods, suggesting a sustained increase from the promised 2. High-demand denim regime (P21-P35) remains steady at ~110 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime (Ladies Denim/Ankle Jeans) that began around Period 21. Demand from Period 21 to Period 36 has averaged approximately 101 units per period, despite a slight softening in the last two weeks (82 and 63). Supply chain performance remains the primary risk: 776 units in the 'In-transit' bucket (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P24) are confirmed as lost or indefinitely delayed and must be excluded from OR backend calculations to prevent under-ordering. The most recent successful arrival (Period 32 order arriving at the end of Period 35) confirmed an actual lead time of 3 periods, which is higher than the promised 2. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect this reality. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=16 (covering the entire high-demand regime since P21) to capture the current seasonal mean (approx 100 units/period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. With on-hand at 291 and effective pipeline at 0 (excluding the 776 lost units), the OR backend will calculate a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1) of demand, ensuring we don't stock out given the extended lead time.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The high-demand denim regime (summer/autumn) continues, with the most recent 5-period average demand being ~84 units/period, showing a slight softening from the mid-August peak of ~115 but remaining significantly higher than the spring floor. The 'In-transit' quantity of 776 units consists entirely of historical orders from P1 (96), P3 (182), P4 (172), and P24 (326) which are all 6+ periods overdue and confirmed lost; therefore, the effective pipeline inventory for the OR calculation is 0. The actual lead time for the only successful recent shipment (P32) was 3 periods. To ensure adequate coverage, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to align the backend's window with recent fulfillment reality. Given the current on-hand inventory of 210 and the need to cover a (L+1) window of 4 periods at ~84 units/period (totaling ~336 units), a new order is necessary. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current regime's mean while smoothing recent volatility, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the sustained higher variance in this demand bracket.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand denim regime (P21 onwards) average settled around 85-110 units/period. The 776 units in-transit are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P24). Lead time for P32 was 3 periods, suggesting a shift from promised 2.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a sustained high-demand denim regime that began around Period 21. Since Period 35, we have been selling from the inventory that arrived from the Period 32 order. Recent demand for the last 4 periods (P35-P38) has been 82, 63, 81, and 72, averaging approximately 74.5 units per period. The 776 units currently in-transit are confirmed lost (from P1, P3, P4, and P24), meaning the physical pipeline is empty and on-hand inventory is 138 units. With a lead time observed at 3 periods (P32 order), 138 units will only cover approximately 2 more periods of demand. To prevent a stockout, I am setting L to 3 to reflect the actual lead time and mu_hat to 300 (equivalent to approximately 75 units/period over L+1 = 4 periods) using the 'explicit' method to account for the clear regime change and ensure the OR engine recognizes the need for a replenishment order. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=18, covering the high-demand regime) to capture current volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The high-demand 'Summer Denim' regime (initiated around Period 21) has begun to cool down as we enter late autumn/winter. Demand in the last two periods has dropped to 72 and 46 units, respectively, compared to the summer average of ~110. I am using a recent_N approach (N=7, covering demand since Period 33) to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough buffer for potential late-year surges or lead time volatility. Regarding the supply chain, while the promised lead time is 2, the most recent successful delivery (Period 32 order arriving in Period 35) confirmed an actual lead time of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 776 units consists of orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 24, which are all significantly overdue (8+ periods) and have been confirmed as lost; therefore, they provide no inventory coverage. With 92 units on-hand and 0 functional units in-transit, an order is necessary to maintain service levels for the (L+1) period horizon. I set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the observed delay.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Nov starting to show decline from summer/autumn peaks (P39 demand 46 vs P21-38 avg ~105). Pipeline of 776 units remains confirmed lost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a late-autumn/winter period where demand is significantly softening from the summer/autumn peaks. Demand in Period 39 (46) and Period 40 (38) confirms a downward trend compared to the previous regime (average ~110). I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this rapid deceleration (reflecting the last three weeks: 72, 46, 38). Although the promised lead time (L) is 2, the most recent successful delivery (Period 35) exhibited an actual lead time of 3. Given the history of lost shipments (776 units from P1, P3, P4, and P24), I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 to reflect this increased risk and observed delay. The OR backend will treat the 776 units 'in-transit' as active pipeline; since these are confirmed lost, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime, but the high pipeline count relative to the low base stock will likely result in an order of 0, which is appropriate given current on-hand inventory (54) covers several weeks of the new lower demand level (~40 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: November demand (avg ~42) is significantly lower than the Summer/Autumn regime (avg ~110). Lead time remains unreliable with the last successful shipment taking 3 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (2019/11/25). Demand has shown a clear downward shift from the Summer/Autumn peak (~105/period) to a November average of approximately 40 units/period (P39-P41: 46, 38, 37). On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (17 units). The 'In-transit' quantity of 776 units consists entirely of historical orders from P1, P3, P4, and P24 which are months overdue and confirmed lost; therefore, pipeline inventory is effectively 0 for ordering logic. Lead time for the last successful shipment (P32) was 3 periods. I will set L to 3 to reflect this sustained delay. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order to cover the upcoming 4-period window (L+1) while avoiding the over-ordering risk associated with the earlier high-demand cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~40 units/period in November, confirmed by 3 consecutive weeks (P39-41). Observed lead time for the last successful arrival was 3 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 636323003 has transitioned from the high-summer/autumn denim peak (~110 units/period) into a stabilized late-autumn regime. Over the last four periods (P39-P42), demand has averaged 51.5 units, though P42 showed a spike to 85. Given the current date is Dec 2, we must account for potential pre-holiday demand while acknowledging that the Summer peak is over. Lead time remains erratic; while the promised L=2, the last successful shipment (P35 arrival) took 3 periods, and the current 776 units in-transit are long-confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. I will set L to 3 periods to reflect the actually observed lead time and use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current regime average since P39, adjusted for the recent spike. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N=4 will capture the increased volatility seen in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Demand stabilized at a lower winter level, averaging ~52 units (P39-P42) compared to the previous ~110. Effective pipeline remains 0 as 776 units (P1, P3, P4, P24) are confirmed lost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand has shifted from the summer/autumn high (~110 units) to a winter regime averaging ~51 units (P39-P43: 46, 38, 37, 85, 47). The high demand in P42 (85) likely reflects a Black Friday/Cyber Monday spike, but the trend is generally lower. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit inventory of 776 units consists of orders from P1, P3, P4, and P24, which are all significantly overdue and confirmed lost; therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. Recent successful lead time was 3 periods (P32 order), which is longer than the promised 2. I will set L to 3 to reflect this reality. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current winter demand regime while incorporating the recent holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P39-P43) confirmed at ~51 units/period, significantly lower than summer levels. Lead time for successful deliveries remains 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December. Since Period 39 (start of November), demand has shifted from the high summer/autumn denim peak (avg ~109) to a lower winter regime, averaging ~47 units over the last 6 periods (P39-P44: 46, 38, 37, 85, 47, 29). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit pipeline of 776 units is confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P24 orders), meaning effective pipeline inventory is 0. Recent successful logic suggests an actual lead time of 3 periods (observed in P35 from P32 order). Given the current zero stock and the winter demand level, I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods to capture the recent winter average (~47 units/period) and set L to 3 to account for the observed lead time delay. This will trigger an order to cover the (L+1) window, roughly 4 * 47 = 188 units, which is appropriate for the current demand regime. With only 3 periods left in the simulation, minimizing holding cost while meeting the remaining demand is priority.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P39 onwards) confirmed: average sustained at ~47 units/period, down from summer peak of ~110.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' is in a winter demand regime starting from Period 39 (early November). Demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the summer denim peak. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P39-P45) is approximately 44 units/period, significantly lower than the ~110 units/period seen in late summer. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the in-transit inventory of 776 units consists entirely of orders (P1, P3, P4, P24) that are many periods overdue and confirmed lost. The most recent successful delivery (Period 32 order arriving in Period 35) established an actual lead time of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. For Period 46, I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current winter regime (P39-P45). To account for the observed reliable lead time of 3 periods, I will explicitly set L=3. This ensures the base stock calculation properly covers the lead time plus the one-period review cycle (L+1=4 periods) at the current demand rate.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/30 (Period 47). The SKU '636323003' is in a low-demand winter regime. Reviewing recent data from Period 39 to 46, demand has averaged 40.25 units per period (46, 38, 37, 85, 47, 29, 26, 13). Specifically, the last four weeks (P43-P46) show an even lower average of 28.75 units. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture the full winter regime mean of ~40 units. Regarding inventory, the reported pipeline of 776 units is confirmed lost (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P24), meaning the effective pipeline is 0. On-hand inventory is also 0. Historical lead times for successful deliveries have shifted from the promised 2 periods to 3 periods (e.g., P32 order arrived P35). To ensure the OR engine covers the current empty stock position and the observed lead time delay, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3, mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=8, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=8. This will prompt an order to rebuild stock for the winter baseline while accounting for possible delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P39-P46) confirmed: average sustained at ~40 units/period, with a further softening trend in Dec (avg 28). Effective pipeline is 0 due to 776 units in confirmed lost shipments.
