Historical data from the last 5 weeks shows a clear upward trend in demand: 19, 46, 48, 62, and 85 units respectively. The most recent demand (Feb 4) was 85. Given the dates (transitioning from late winter into spring), denim sales often see a seasonal uptick as customers refresh wardrobes. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To calculate the order for Period 1, I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 = 3). Using the most recent demand of 85 as a baseline and accounting for the upward trend, I estimate demand at ~90-100 per week. To ensure high service levels while minimizing holding costs on a $19 profit item, I will target a stock position of approximately 280 units (95 average * 3 periods) to cover the pipeline until the first shipment arrives.",

The average demand over the last 6 weeks is approximately 55 units. Given the spring season (mid-February), demand for 'Ankle-length jeans' is likely to remain strong or increase as customers prepare for warmer weather. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, meaning we lost 67 sales in Period 1. We have 280 units in-transit from Period 1, which are expected to arrive in Period 3 (promised lead time is 2 periods). To maintain a safety stock and cover demand for the lead time window (Periods 2, 3, and 4), I need to calculate the target pipeline. Estimating demand at ~75 units/week (accounting for the upward trend), the 3-period requirement is ~225 units. We already have 280 in-transit. However, to compensate for the current stockout and potential growth, a small supplemental order is prudent to ensure we don't stock out again if demand continues to accelerate towards 100+ units/week, while balancing the $1 holding cost.",

Current on-hand inventory is 331 units, which at the current demand regime covers roughly 15 periods of sales. Despite a high 'In-transit' figure of 630 units, many of these are confirmed or potentially lost based on history (P1, P3, P4). However, even ignoring the in-transit units, the current on-hand inventory (331) is significantly excessive relative to the post-peak demand. One unit of holding cost ($1) is high relative to the profit ($19), and since we have over 15 periods of stock on hand, any further ordering would only increase cost without improving service level.

This confirms a sustained late-summer/pre-fall high-demand regime. Currently, on-hand inventory is 254 units. In-transit inventory stands at 930 units. However, previous carry-over insights and history show that orders from P1 (280), P3 (200), and P4 (100) are definitively lost (630 total). Subtracting these lost units from the tracked in-transit (930 - 630), the reliable pipeline is 300 units (from P24), which is already 5 periods old and likely lost or significantly delayed given that the P25 order (arrived P27) and P23 order (arrived P26) have already cleared. The 'In-transit' figure is misleading due to these ghost orders. I expect demand to remain at ~130 units/period. The current 254 units provide roughly 2 periods of coverage. Given the unreliability and potential loss of the P24 order, I must place a fresh order to cover the next 3-4 periods (lead time 2 + safety stock).

The demand regime has significantly decelerated for the late autumn/winter season, with recent demand averaging approximately 40 units per period (P39: 46, P40: 38, P41: 37). Even using a conservative estimate of 50 units per period for the remaining 6 periods (P42-P47), total expected demand is only ~300 units. Our current on-hand stock of 681 units is more than double the total remaining demand for the game. Placing further orders would only increase holding costs ($1.0/unit) without increasing sales. The 'In-transit' figure of 1380 is largely comprised of historical lost shipments and does not represent usable inventory, but even ignoring all in-transit units, the current on-hand balance is sufficient to achieve a 100% service level until the simulation concludes.",

Demand analysis: P42 showed a spike to 85, possibly due to a late November/Black Friday shopping event, but the overall November/early December regime has stabilized at approximately 45-50 units/period (average of P39-P42 is ~51). Even using a conservative high-end forecast of 80 units per period for the remaining 5 weeks, the total expected demand is 400 units (5 * 80). With 596 units on hand, there is a surplus of approximately 196 units relative to even an aggressive demand scenario. Ordering more would only increase holding costs ($1/unit/period) without increasing sales, as the current stock is more than sufficient to cover the rest of the game timeline.

The average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 52 units per week. With only 4 periods of demand remaining (P44, P45, P46, P47), the total expected demand is roughly 200-240 units. Since on-hand inventory (549) significantly exceeds this requirement, there is no need to place additional orders.

The product is 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' denim, which is currently in a seasonal winter lull. Recent demand (P43: 47, P44: 29) indicates a low-demand regime. Average demand over the last four periods is approximately 50 units. With an on-hand inventory of 520 units, we have coverage for more than 10 periods at the current consumption rate. Even with potential sales spikes during the final weeks of December, the current stock is more than sufficient. Given the high holding cost ($1.00/unit) relative to the remaining time and the unreliable supply chain (64% loss rate or 1380 units in-transit categorized as lost), placing any further orders would only increase holding costs and end-of-game inventory without contributing to additional sales.

Historical demand for the month of December (P43-P45) has been consistent with a post-peak holiday slowdown: 47, 29, and 26 units. Even with a potential minor spike for the final week of the year, demand is extremely unlikely to exceed 100 units for the final period. The current inventory of 494 units provides massive coverage (nearly 5x the maximum expected final period demand). Because any units left at the end of Period 47 will incur a holding cost and there is no benefit to ordering more as they would not arrive in time to be sold (lead time L=2), the optimal action is to order 0 units to minimize holding costs and maximize final profit.",
