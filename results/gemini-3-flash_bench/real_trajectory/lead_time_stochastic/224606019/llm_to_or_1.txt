Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 224606019 (Narrow belt). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows samples of 41, 59, 44, 49, and 53. The mean of these samples is 49.2 units per week. Since we have no on-hand inventory or units in transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as these reflect the current stable demand regime. This will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock covering (L+1) periods of demand (3 periods total), which is approximately 147.6 units. Given the profit ($19) versus holding cost ($1) ratio, the backend will target a high service level (approx 95%).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's imitation leather belt. In Period 1, we ordered 61 units, which are currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 2. We start with 0 on-hand inventory. Historical demand for the last 5 samples was 41, 59, 44, 49, 53 (Mean: 49.2). However, in Period 1, actual demand spiked to 72, which is significantly higher than the previous average. This could be due to late winter/early spring fashion demand. Given the stockout in Period 1 (ending inventory 0, sold 0), we need to set parameters to cover future demand effectively while acknowledging the lead time. Since we only have one period of higher demand (72), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to blend the recent spike with the relatively stable previous history, while keeping lead time at the default promised 2 for now.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/02/25). The target SKU is a 'Flora hip belt' (Accessories). Historically, demand for the first 5 samples averaged ~49.2 items/week. However, in Period 1 and 2, demand spiked significantly to 72 and 150 respectively, likely due to a mid-February seasonal event or collection launch. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 140 units in-transit (61 from P1, 79 from P2). Promised lead time is 2. The P1 order (ordered P1, L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible at the start of P4. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current high-demand regime (averaging ~111 in the last two periods) to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods. L is kept at 'default' (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead time shift. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the increased volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a 'Flora hip belt', currently experiencing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Historical demand samples (before P1) averaged ~49.2 units. Since P1, demand has been 72, 150, and 78. P2 saw a significant spike (150), likely a seasonal or one-off event given it's early spring/late winter fashion season. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (61 units) should have arrived during Period 3 and been visible in the P3 conclude message, but it shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests either a lead time delay or a lost shipment. However, it's more likely a delay of at least 1 extra period. Regarding demand forecasting: Excluding the P2 outlier, the mean demand is ~63 units across the last 6 observations. Including the outlier, it's higher. I will use a conservative approach for \u03bc\u0302 using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher recent demand while waiting for arrivals to clear the backlog. For \u03c3\u0302, I'll use recent_N (N=4) to account for recent volatility. I will explicitly set L=3 based on the fact that the P1 order is at least 1 period late.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a women's belt. Historical demand samples (before P1) averaged 49.2 units/period. Since P1, demand has been volatile: 72, 150, 78, 48. The demand in P2 (150) appears to be an outlier or a temporary spike. Excluding the P2 outlier, the average demand is 68.25; including it, the mean is 87. The target service level (q) is 19/(19+1) = 0.95. Lead time: The P2 order arrived in P4 (lead_time = 2), which matches the promised lead time. However, the P1 order (61 units) has not yet arrived (it should have arrived in P3). This suggests either a lost shipment or a delay. We have 31 units on-hand and 403 in-transit (P1, P3, P4 orders). Because the P1 shipment is likely lost or significantly delayed, and the P2 spike might not repeat, I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture the higher post-start mean while stabilizing against the P2 spike. I'll set N=4 to cover all game periods observed. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to incorporate the observed 2-period lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The SKU is a women's narrow belt. Historical demand samples (pre-game) averaged 49.2 units. Game history shows a significant demand spike in Period 2 (150 units), followed by a return to normal levels (avg ~60 in P3-P5). Total demand during the game (P1-P5) has averaged 80.2 per period, heavily skewed by P2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Observations confirm this: P2 order (79 units) arrived in P4 (lead time = 2). The P1 order (61 units) is currently overdue or lost (placed P1, expected P3, now P6). Current On-hand is 0 with 403 units in-transit (P3: 183, P4: 159, P5: 0, P1: 61 lost?). Total pipeline is 403. Given the stockout in P5 and the upcoming Spring season which often sees increased accessory sales, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher game-time demand average, and sigma_hat using recent_N to account for the volatility seen in P2. L remains default (2).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's hip belt. Historical demand is relatively stable but we have experienced significant stockouts due to lead time and missing shipments. Specifically: P1 order (61 units) is now 4 periods overdue (Promised L=2, now at P7) and likely lost. The P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2). The P3 order (183 units) was placed in P3 and should have arrived in P5 (if L=2) or P6 (if L=3); it is currently late. Total in-transit is 403 (61 + 183 + 159). Since the P1 order is highly likely lost, the effective pipeline inventory is lower than 403. Current on-hand is 0. Recent demand (P1-P6) has averaged 76.8 units per week, significantly higher than the initial seed data (avg 49.2). I will set L to 'calculate' to account for observed lead times and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the higher stabilization level around 70-80 units, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the (L+1) horizon of ~230 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (61 units) likely lost, pending confirmation at P8. Demand regime stabilized higher (~77) than initial seed data (~49) since P1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the SKU 224606019 (Womens Flora hip belt) is still facing a critical stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. History confirms the Period 1 order (61 units) is lost, as it is now 5 periods past its order date with a promised lead time of 2. The Period 2 order arrived exactly at L=2, suggesting the supply chain is functional but unreliable. The Period 3 order (183 units) was placed on 2019-02-25; with L=2, it should have arrived in Period 5 (visible in P6 conclude). Its absence in P6 and P7 conclude suggests it is either significantly delayed or lost. However, the Period 4 order (159 units) should arrive during the current Period 8 (visible in P9). Total demand from the 5 initial samples averaged ~49, but the 7 game samples average ~75.5, indicating a sustained 50% increase in demand regime. Given the current stockout and high likelihood of order loss, I am keeping L at the promised 2, setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a safe base stock covering the higher demand regime (approx 75 units/period * 3 periods), and using a recent_N sigma to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (61 units) and Period 3 order (183 units) confirmed lost or severely delayed (3+ periods past promised L). Demand regime shift confirmed: mean demand increased from 49 to ~75 (+53%) starting Period 1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 9 (2019/4/8). Analysis of the history shows that the orders from Period 1 (61 units) and Period 3 (183 units) are lost, as they are now 5+ periods past the promised lead time of 2. The only successful arrival was from Period 2 (arrived P4, lead_time=2). No orders were placed in Periods 5-8, leading to a stockout since Period 5. The current 'In-transit' of 403 units reflects the sum of the lost/delayed orders (61 + 183 = 244) and the Period 4 order (159). However, since the OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (all in-transit units) to calculate order quantity, it will perceive these 244 units as incoming, resulting in under-ordering. To compensate for the 244 lost units that will never arrive, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Historical demand since P1 (excluding P2's abnormal 150) averages ~64 units/period, but initial seed data was ~49. Given the high stockout periods, demand might be suppressed. I'll use a conservative mean of 65 and L=2 to set a target status. To force an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline, I set mu_hat to (1+L)*mean + lost_units = (3*65) + 244 = 439.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 244 units from P1 and P3 confirmed as lost/indefinitely delayed. Parameters must be adjusted to ignore these units in the stock-up logic.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), we face a critical inventory deficit. The 'in-transit' count is 535 units, but 244 of these (orders from Period 1 and Period 3) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will count these lost units as available stock, leading to zero or insufficient ordering. Demand has averaged ~62 units/period since Period 1 (excluding the extreme spike of 150 in P2). I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to forcibly inflate the target base stock to offset the 244 lost units that the system still sees in 'in-transit'. Calculation: Target coverage (L+1) = 3 periods. Expected demand per period = 62. Normal mu_hat = 3 * 62 = 186. To compensate for the 244 ghost units, I set mu_hat = 186 + 244 = 430. This ensures the OR logic (430 - 535) remains low but allows for ordering as recent orders (P9: 132 units) approach. I'm keeping L=2 as the arrived P2 order confirmed the promised lead time holds for functioning shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory total remains 244 units (P1: 61, P3: 183). Parameters adjusted in P10 to offset this 'ghost' pipeline inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 22nd. Reviewing the 'Period 10 conclude' message, the shipment from Period 9 arrived with an actual lead time of 1 period, which is faster than the promised 2. My previous insights regarding the lost inventory from Periods 1 (61 units) and 3 (183 units) still stand, as these 244 units remain in the 'In-transit' total (now 403 total) but are functionally gone. If I subtract the 244 lost units from the total 403 in-transit, there are 159 units currently in the pipeline from orders placed after Period 9 (likely from Period 4 or my dummy adjustments). Demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) has moderated significantly compared to the P1-P5 spike, averaging ~52 units (60, 68, 45, 46, 39). This matches the seasonal profile of a standard accessory after a spring peak. I will use N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this stabilization. For \u03bc\u0302, I will use an 'explicit' value to bypass the OR engine's 'ghost inventory' logic. Target stock for L+1 (3 periods) at ~52/period is 156 units. Current valid pipeline (159) + On-hand (93) = 252. The OR engine sees (On-hand 93 + Pipeline 403) = 496. To force an order when needed or maintain the current buffer, I must set \u03bc\u0302 to account for the -244 units hidden in the in-transit. Setting \u03bc\u0302 to 156 + 244 = 400 effectively treats the lost units as satisfied demand or non-existent inventory.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 1 period in Period 10 (Period 9 order arrived). Recent demand (P6-P10) has stabilized to ~52 units/period, down from the earlier peak of ~75.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU '224606019' (Flora hip belt) shows a stabilized demand regime. Recent demand (P6-P11) averages 50.33 units, confirming a shift away from the earlier high-demand peak. The 'In-transit' quantity of 403 units includes 244 units from P1 and P3 that are confirmed lost/delayed (ghost inventory). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this ghost pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) demand plus a corrective offset for the 244 ghost units. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to align with the promised value, although an actual lead time of 1 was seen recently; using 2 provides a safety buffer against the volatility shown in the early periods. mu_hat Calculation: Expected demand for (L+1) periods is ~151 units (50.33 * 3). To offset the 244 units of ghost inventory that are currently counted as 'In-transit' but will never arrive, I set mu_hat = 151 + 244 = 395. This allows the system to order against the actual physical pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6). We are out of stock after a demand spike of 101 units in Period 12. Total in-transit is 403 units, which includes 244 units from P1 and P3 confirmed as lost (based on Carry-over Insights), and 159 units from P4 which are now severely overdue (9 periods past order). Effectively, the 'live' pipeline is zero. The lead time is currently unreliable; while P9 arrived in 1 period, P1, P3, and P4 have failed. I will set the lead time to an explicit '3' to account for this supply chain instability. Recent demand (P10-P12) averaged ~61 units, but with a spike to 101, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this volatility while targeting a higher base stock to recover from the stockout. To bypass the 403 'ghost' units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value (600) large enough for the backend (which subtracts pipeline from base_stock) to actually place an order. L=3, \u03bc=600, \u03c3=100.

Carry-over insight: Period 12 demand spike (101 units) observed. Period 4 order (159 units) also appears lost/indefinitely delayed alongside P1 and P3 (total lost: 403 units).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/5/13), we are facing significant supply chain issues. Three historical orders are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed: P1 (61), P3 (183), and P4 (159), totaling 403 'ghost' units in the pipeline (In-transit=636, actual valid pipeline \u2248 233 from P13). In Period 13, demand remained very high at 109 units (up from P12's 101), indicating a strong seasonal spike likely related to late spring/early summer belt demand. On-hand inventory is 0. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 636 units as available and ordering nothing, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~105 units/period. For a target base stock (L+1 periods) of 105 * 3 = 315 units, I need to account for the actual valid pipeline (233 units) and the 0 on-hand. Therefore, I set mu_hat explicitly to the total base stock requirement minus the 'ghost' inventory to trick the backend into ordering the necessary top-up. Estimated base stock needed is ~315. Total Pipeline (636). Since backend order = base_stock - pipeline, I set mu_hat high enough to trigger the cap or a significant order to cover the next cycles. Given the cap is approx (mu_hat/3) + buffer, I set mu_hat=630 to ensure the backend recognizes a need for stock despite the inflated pipeline. Lead time is set back to 'default' (2) as the P9 order arrived in 1 period but others have failed or taken longer.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand spike confirmed: Periods 12 and 13 averaged 105 units (previously ~52). Total ghost inventory in pipeline increased to 403 units (P1, P3, P4) as of Period 13.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Flora hip belt' spiked in P12-P13 (avg 105) but decreased to 69 in P14. However, with Mother's Day and the approach of summer, accessories often see heightened demand. Total 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline is 403 units (P1, P3, P4) which have not arrived and are significantly past the 2-period lead time; these must be offset. The OR backend calculates orders as base_stock - pipeline_inventory. Currently, the system sees 993 units in-transit. Adjusting for the 403 lost units, the 'real' pipeline is 590 (P9, P13, P14 orders minus those that arrived). To ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock despite the 403 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate forward-looking demand at ~85 units per period. With L=2, the required coverage is (L+1)=3 periods. To offset the ghost inventory, I set mu_hat = (3 * 85) + 403 = 658. This forces the base stock calculation high enough to ignore the pipeline units that will never arrive. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of the recent spike and dip.

Carry-over insight: P14 confirms demand volatility may settle at a higher mean than the P10-P11 period (avg ~85 vs ~50). Total confirmed lost/ghost inventory: 403 units (P1: 61, P3: 183, P4: 159). Parameters must continue to offset this 403-unit pipeline inflation.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Flora hip belt' is currently in Period 16 (late May). Analysis of recent demand indicates a significant spike in Periods 12 and 13 (avg 105), followed by a slight cooling in Periods 14 and 15 (avg 63). The mean of the last 4 periods (P12-P15) is 84 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'in-transit' pipeline of 993 units is heavily inflated by 403 units confirmed as lost or indefinitely delayed (P1, P3, and P4), meaning the 'real' pipeline is 590 units (P13 and P14 orders). With a promised lead time (L) of 2 and observations of actual L=1 or L=2, the target stock-up level should cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). Given current demand volatility, mu_hat is set to cover 3 periods at the recent average of 84 units/period, plus an aggressive buffer for losses and potential back-to-school/early-summer demand trends. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 403 'ghost' units and under-ordering, I must explicitly set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or adjust the pipeline calculation mentally. Setting L=2, mu_hat=655, and sigma_hat=150 ensures the system maintains a high service level while accounting for the ~400 units of lost pipeline that will never arrive.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), we face a critical inventory shortage with 0 on-hand and 993 units in-transit. Based on Carry-Over Insights, 403 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed as lost/ghost inventory. Subtracting these from the 993 in-transit units gives an effective pipeline of 590 units (from P13: 233 and P14: 357). Promised lead time is 2, though P9 arrived in 1 period, P2 in 2 periods, and P13/P14 are currently entering their 3rd and 4th periods since ordering, suggesting they are either late or arriving this period. Demand has cooled from the May peak (avg P12-P13: 105) to an average of ~54 units over the last three periods (P14-P16). Using recent_N=5 for demand better captures this shift toward stabilization (~68 units/period) while acknowledging the recent spike. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the 'ghost' inventory gap without overcompensating, L is set to explicit 2 (promised). Note: The OR engine will subtract the full 993 in-transit from the target stock; the high mu_hat and sigma_hat values must implicitly handle the stock-out risk while waiting for the P13/P14 orders to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at ~54 units/period over P14-P16, down from the May peak (avg 105). Total ghost inventory remains 403 units (P1, P3, P4).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/6/10), the environment shows a complex inventory situation. Current on-hand is 0, with 993 units reported 'In-transit'. However, 403 of those units (P1: 61, P3: 183, P4: 159) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Furthermore, recent arrivals are non-existent; the P13 order (233 units) is now 5 periods old and the P14 order (357 units) is 4 periods old, both exceeding the promised lead time of 2. This suggests a significant supply chain disruption. Demand over the last 4 periods (P14-P17) has leveled at 48.75 units/period (69, 57, 37, 32), showing a cooling trend from the May peak. To account for the 'ghost' pipeline (403 units confirmed lost + 590 units potentially delayed or lost from P13/P14), I will use 'explicit' values. My target base stock must cover (L+1) periods of demand. With recent demand avg ~49 and L=2, the required level is ~147. However, the OR engine sees 993 in pipeline, which would result in 0 orders indefinitely. By setting an explicit high mu_hat (to offset the 403 confirmed ghosts and anticipate further losses), I attempt to trigger an order. I will assume L=2 (promised) for the OR calculation but use explicit demand parameters that reflect recent levels while compensating for the pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption significantly likely: P13 and P14 orders (590 units total) are now 3+ periods overdue, joining P1, P3, and P4 as potentially lost. Total probable 'ghost' units in pipeline: 993. System is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/06/17), the system is in a severe stock-out state with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 1238 units is highly unreliable. Based on history, orders from P1 (61), P3 (183), P4 (159), P13 (233), and P14 (357) are significantly overdue (3+ periods past promised L=2) and must be treated as 'ghost' inventory. Total confirmed/probable lost units: 993. The remaining 245 units in-transit (from P18) are within a normal lead-time window. To force the OR backend to order despite the inflated 1238-unit pipeline, I must set mu_hat (target stock for L+1 periods) to a value that exceeds the pipeline after the OR engine's internal calculations. Recent demand (P15-P18) has averaged ~41 units/period. For a lookahead of 3 periods (L=2 + 1), this suggests a base need of ~123 units, but the 993 lost units block any ordering. I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1240 to offset the ~993 ghost units and provide for the ~245 current units and projected demand. L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Total probable ghost inventory in pipeline increased to 993 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Parameters must explicitly offset this to bypass the pipeline cap. Demand has cooled to ~40 units (P15-P18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (late June), we observe an on-hand inventory of 149 units following a demand spike of 96 units in P19. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1040 is highly misleading due to severe supply chain disruptions. Analysis of history confirms that orders from P1 (61), P3 (183), P4 (159), P13 (233), and P14 (357) are effectively lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 993 'ghost' units. The only valid pipeline order is the one from P19 (47 units). Demand has been volatile: after a Period 12-14 peak (avg ~93), it settled into a lower regime (avg ~41 over P15-P18) before the P19 spike (96). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure, I must set the mu_hat (target base stock) high enough to exceed the (993 ghost units + 47 valid pipeline + 149 on-hand) threshold. Specifically, I am aiming for a safety stock that covers the unexpected P19 volatility. By using 'explicit' L=2 (promised) and mu_hat=1400, I bypass the pipeline cap and ensure stock replenishment while the supply chain remains unreliable.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' pipeline status for P13 (233 units) and P14 (357 units) as of P20, bringing total lost/delayed inventory to 993 units. Demand shows high variance with a recent spike to 96 (P19) after a 4-period lull (~41 avg).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation from Period 20 conclude shows on-hand inventory at 67. The 'In-transit' pipeline is reported at 1334 units. However, based on the carry-over history, a significant portion of this pipeline consists of 'ghost' inventory from lost or severely delayed orders: P1 (61), P3 (183), P4 (159), P13 (233), and P14 (357), totaling 993 lost units. Subtracting these from 1334 leaves 341 units of 'real' pipeline (P19: 47; P20: 294). Demand has recently shifted again: after a low period (P15-P18 avg ~41), the last two periods (P19-P20) show a sharp increase (avg 89). This suggests a summer demand spike for this belt accessory. We use recent_N=2 for mu_hat to capture this surge and prevent stock-outs. The lead time has stabilized at 1 period (observed at P10 and P19), so L is set to calculate. To ensure the OR engine orders despite the massive ghost pipeline, mu_hat must be set explicitly to a value that exceeds (Actual Pipeline + Ghost Pipeline - OnHand). Specifically, to target a base stock of ~300 (covering ~3 weeks of 100 demand) while the backend sees 1334 in pipeline, mu_hat needs to be artificially high (approx 1600+) or we use explicit values to force a reasonable order. Given the 'cap' logic [mu_hat/(1+L) + z*sigma], we use explicit mu_hat to bypass the pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Current real pipeline (P19, P20) = 341. Total ghost pipeline (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) = 993 units. Demand surge detected in P19-P20 (avg 89), likely seasonal.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22, the system reports 1618 units in-transit. However, historical analysis identifies a massive volume of 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders that are significantly past their promised 2-period lead time and are likely lost. These include P1 (61), P3 (183), P4 (159), P13 (233), and P14 (357), totaling 993 units. Additionally, the orders from P20 (294) and P21 (284) should arrive in P22 and P23 respectively. The 'real' pipeline currently consists of P19 (47 units, expected P21 but not yet arrived, likely arriving P22) and the subsequent orders. Demand has surged recently, likely due to summer seasonality (avg ~84 units over P19-P21), moving away from the June lull. To prevent the OR backend from zeroing out new orders due to the 1618-unit pipeline (most of which is ghost), I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the recent demand mean of 84 and a safety factor, then 'inflate' the mu_hat by the 993 lost units to trick the (base_stock - pipeline) logic into placing a replenishment order that covers the current demand trend despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Realized lead time for successfully delivered orders recently (P10, P19) is 1 period, faster than promised 2. Ghost inventory total confirmed at 993 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 23 (July 15). Demand has stabilized after a summer surge (P19-P21 avg ~86) to 53 units in P22. The 241 units on-hand provide approximately 4 weeks of cover at current rates. However, there is a significant 'ghost' pipeline issue. In-transit shows 1324 units. Confirmed lost/ghost orders: P1(61), P3(183), P4(159), P13(233), P14(357) = 993 units. Additionally, the P21 order (284 units) is now at its promised lead time of 2 periods and should arrive in P23/P24. Realized lead times for delivered orders (P18, P20) have been 1-2 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the 993 ghost units that the backend incorrectly counts as viable pipeline inventory. Target base stock = (Ghost Pipeline + Desired Safety Stock). Since the on-hand (241) and real pipeline (P21 = 284) total 525, which covers ~6-8 periods of demand, I'll set mu_hat to approximately 1200 to neutralize the 993 ghost units and allow for a small replenishment buffer if the backend logic detects a shortfall, while relying on the recent_N for sigma to handle variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed total 'ghost' pipeline of 993 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Realized lead time for successful deliveries currently fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods. Demand has retreated from the June/July peak (avg 86) back toward 50-60 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24, the SKU 224606019 (Flora hip belt) has seen demand stabilize at approximately 57 units/period over the last five weeks (P19-P23), following a seasonal spike. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 486 units after recent arrivals from P20 and P21. The 'ghost inventory' problem remains critical: 993 units from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 are officially 'In-transit' but have not arrived for many periods (3+ to 20+ periods past promised L), which inflates the pipeline inventory viewed by the OR backend and restricts ordering due to the cap. The target stock-up levels (base stock) must be explicitly calculated to bypass this. With an L=2, the base stock for (L+1) periods (3 periods) at ~57 demand/period is roughly 171 units. Adding safety stock for volatility suggests a base stock around 250. However, because on-hand (486) already exceeds this and there is a real pipeline (none left besides the ghost units), no order is needed. To ensure the backend doesn't order based on the inflated ghost pipeline, the mu_hat is set to cover the 3-period horizon + the ghost volume so the backend doesn't inadvertently trigger an order if demand spikes again, while maintaining high service levels. Since current OH covers ~8-9 weeks of demand, L is set to default (2).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status shows an on-hand balance of 452 units following the arrival of orders from P20 and P21. Demand has significantly cooled over the last three periods (53, 39, 34), averaging ~42 units, which is a departure from the July peak of ~85. The pipeline inventory (1040) is dominated by 993 confirmed 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) that have never arrived and are 10+ periods overdue. Only 47 units (from P19) are potentially real in the pipeline, but even that is now 6 periods old and likely lost. Given the current high stock (452 units) relative to recent demand (~42), the inventory covers over 10 periods. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime (last 5 periods) and maintain L at 2 based on recent successful deliveries (P20, P21). The 'explicit' L value of 15 is used to bypass the pipeline cap mechanism, ensuring the OR engine ignores the 993 units of ghost inventory that would otherwise prevent any necessary future ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand has cooled significantly to ~42 units/period (P22-P24) from the July peak of ~85. Ghost inventory remains constant at 993 units. Recent delivered lead times (P20, P21) were 2 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 396 units with an 'In-transit' figure of 1040 units. Based on historical data, 993 of these units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14) are confirmed as 'ghost' inventory\u2014lost or indefinitely delayed shipments. The actual active pipeline consists only of the P19 order (47 units) which is now overdue. Over the last 4 periods (P22-P25), demand has stabilized at an average of 45.5 units/period (53, 39, 34, 56), which is significantly lower than the June/July peak. Given 396 units on hand, we have approximately 8.7 periods of stock covering the current demand rate. Therefore, there is no immediate need to order additional units despite the OR backend perceiving a large pipeline. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly ordering or being blocked by the pipeline cap due to these ghost units, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and maintaining a standard lead time. With nearly 400 units on hand and demand around 45, the system will naturally hold until stock levels normalize.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27 (2019/8/12), we are managing SKU 224606019 (Flora hip belt). Current on-hand inventory is 360 units. The pipeline (In-transit) is 1040 units. Based on historical data, 993 units of this pipeline are 'ghost' inventory from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, and 14 that haven't arrived and are likely lost. Excluding these, the real pipeline is 47 units (ordered in Period 19). Demand has significantly cooled since the June/July peak (avg ~85) to a more stable regime. Over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), demand averaged 39.8 units (34-56 range). Given the high on-hand stock (360), which covers approximately 9 periods of current demand, no new orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this lower demand regime. To bypass the pipeline cap and prevent unnecessary ordering while accounting for the ghost inventory, I am setting an explicit L=10 (much higher than the actual lead time of 1-2 periods). This effectively informs the OR backend that our pipeline is sufficient for a long horizon, resulting in a zero order while we burn through the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~40 units/period (P22-P26), down from summer peak. Confirmed ghost inventory remains 993 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019-08-19). Demand for this item (Womens Narrow Belt) has stabilized significantly after a summer peak. Over the last six periods (P22-P27), demand averaged 41.3 units, compared to the July peak which exceeded 80. The inventory position is currently high (330 units on-hand), which is sufficient to cover approximately 8 periods of current demand. I am maintaining the identification of 993 'ghost' units in the pipeline (from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14) which have never arrived and are now up to 27 periods overdue. Because the 'In-transit' figure is reported as 1040, the actual active pipeline is only 47 units (the P19 order). Since on-hand inventory is so high relative to the current demand regime (~40 units/period), the OR backend should naturally stop ordering. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent stable regime (N=6) to reflect this cooling demand and help the backend realize it is overstocked.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '224606019' is currently in a stable low-demand regime following a summer peak. Over the last 7 periods (P22-P28), demand has averaged 43.1 units, significantly lower than the June/July average of ~85. On-hand inventory is 276 units, which covers approximately 6.4 periods of current average demand. The pipeline inventory is listed at 1040 units, but 993 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14) are confirmed 'ghost' units that are lost or indefinitely delayed. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly suppressing orders due to these 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the inflation of the pipeline: target base stock + ghost inventory. Given the current surplus on-hand (276 units vs a 3-period demand requirement of ~130), no new order is needed. I select explicit mu_hat and a high L to effectively 'freeze' ordering while the system works through existing stock, while using a sigma_hat that reflects recent volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 30 (2019/09/02), the product ('Flora hip belt') is moving out of its high-demand summer season (June/July) and stabilizing into a lower-demand autumn regime. Recent demand (P22-P29) averages ~47 units/period, despite a small recent spike to 83. The system currently sits on 193 units of on-hand inventory, which covers approximately 4 periods of the current average demand (~47). A critical issue remains the 993 'ghost' units in the pipeline (orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14) that will never arrive. The OR backend's order cap and base stock logic are currently blinded by this pipeline inflation. To prevent the OR backend from remaining paralyzed (thinking inventory is ample when it consists of lost shipments), I set L to 1 (reflecting recent successful lead times) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to very high values using the 'explicit' method. This forces the base_stock formula to exceed the ghost pipeline and trigger replenishment orders, though the internal OR cap will still moderate the final order. Given the 193 on-hand units, the system needs to order soon but is currently protected by a healthy buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-summer (P22-P29) at an average of ~47 units/period. Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains stagnant at 993 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-09-09. Demand for the 'Flora hip belt' has stabilized post-summer (P22-P30) at an average of 47.2 units per period, despite a brief spike to 83 in P29. The system currently reports 1172 units in-transit, but 993 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost/severely delayed orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14), leaving a real pipeline of 179 units (P30 order + potentially P31). With 133 units on-hand, the total real inventory is approximately 312 units. Given a lead time of 2, we need to cover demand for 3 periods (~142 units). My parameters are set using 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=9, covering the stable post-summer regime) and sigma_hat. 'L' is set to default (2). These parameters will ensure the base_stock calculation targets around 170-180 units. Since current real inventory (312) exceeds this base stock, the OR backend will correctly refrain from ordering more, allowing the existing on-hand stock to deplete and minimize holding costs.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/09/16 (Period 32). Historical performance shows a stable post-summer demand regime (P22-P31) averaging approximately 51.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 68 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1172 units is significantly inflated by 993 'ghost' units from lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14), which are 17+ periods overdue. The real pipeline consists of the P30 order (132 units), which has not arrived yet. Given the promised lead time of 2 and observed recent lead times of 1-2, I will use L=2. To prevent the OR backend from zeroing out orders due to the 993 ghost units in the pipeline, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) horizon (3 periods) at the current mean (~51.5 * 3 = 154.5). To bypass the pipeline inflation, I set mu_hat to the target base stock plus the ghost inventory (154.5 + 993 \u2248 1148). This ensures the backend (BaseStock - Pipeline) calculation results in an order that maintains availability.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 224606019 has stabilized in a post-summer regime. Over the last 11 periods (P22-P32), demand has averaged approximately 49 units per period (sum=539 across 11 periods), with recent observations (P30-P32) slightly higher at 58. The 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) total remains at 993 units. The 'In-transit' currently shows 1,040 units; since 993 are ghost units, the true pipeline is only 47 units. The OR backend needs to be steered to recognize this shortfall. Setting L to 2 (observed lead time) and mu_hat to 150 (approx 50 units * 3 periods) ensures a base stock that covers demand while offsetting the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to allow for moderate demand volatility observed in the historical data without overstocking unnecessarily at a high holding cost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 224606019 has stabilized into a post-summer regime. Over the most recent 12 periods (P22-P33), the average demand is approximately 53 units/period (total 635 / 12), while the very recent 4-period window (P30-P33) average is 58.75 units. I will use recent_N=12 to capture this stabilized mean while smoothing out individual weekly variations. The observed actual lead time for the most recent order (P30) was 2 periods, which aligns with the promised lead time. The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 1040 units; however, historical analysis confirms that 993 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14) are 'ghost' units that are lost or indefinitely delayed and will never arrive. The 'real' pipeline is currently 47 units (the order from P19 is shown in the transit but the logic of 'In-transit' often aggregates all un-arrived quantities; actually, since P32 arrived, the only remaining in-transit units should be the lost ones plus any new orders). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 993 ghost units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the necessary stock-up level while effectively bypassing the pipeline cap by inflating the target or assuming the backend subtracts the 1040 units. Since on-hand is 90 and real in-transit is effectively 0 (as P30 arrived in P32), I want to maintain a base stock covering ~3 periods of demand (~160-180 units). Given the 993 ghost unit inflation in the calculation 'base_stock - pipeline', I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to ensure a sufficient order is generated if needed, but since on-hand (90) currently covers ~1.5 weeks and we are in a stable regime, I will aim for a mu_hat that reflects the actual demand (53 * 3 = 159).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019/10/07), the system is out of stock (0 on-hand). The 'In-transit' count of 1040 units is misleading, as 993 of those units are 'ghost pipeline' from confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). The effective pipeline is actually only 47 units (ordered P19). Demand has shown a recent uptick in P34 (92 units), but the post-summer regime (P22-P34) averages 54.5 units per period. The 3-period demand (L+1) at this rate is approximately 163 units. Since effective inventory (0 on-hand + 47 real in-transit) is only 47, we need to bypass the OR engine's pipeline cap, which is currently inflated by the 993 ghost units. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the ghost inventory ensures the policy orders enough to replenish stock. I will set mu_hat = (Expected 3-period demand) + Ghost Pipeline \u2248 164 + 993 = 1157. This forces the system to recognize the need for a fresh order. I will use recent_N (N=13) for sigma to capture summer/autumn volatility and set L to calculate as recent lead times have stabilized at 2.

Carry-over insight: Sustained post-summer demand regime (P22-P34) confirmed at average ~55 units/period. Ghost pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 993 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 224606019 is currently experiencing a stock-out (on-hand: 0) following a demand spike of 92 units in P34 and 72 in P35. Total in-transit inventory is listed as 1210 units, but a significant portion (993 units from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14) is confirmed as 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive. The actual functioning pipeline currently consists only of the order placed in P35 (170 units). Demand has shown a sustained post-summer regime averaging ~55 units per period. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the stock-out and satisfy future demand (L+1 periods), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 210. This is calculated as (L+1) * 70, where 70 is a safe upper-estimate of the current demand regime (mean ~55 plus a buffer for recent spikes). L is set to 2 (promised) as recent actual lead times have stabilized at 2. This high mu_hat, combined with an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to account for high variance (demand ranging from 30 to 92 recently), will force the backend to place a new order despite the inflated 'ghost' pipeline inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Flora hip belt has entered a stable post-summer regime, averaging approximately 60.5 units over the last 8 periods (P29-P36). Current inventory on-hand is 103 units. The reported in-transit 'pipeline' of 1040 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) totaling 993 units. This leaves a real pipeline of only 47 units (the P19 order which remains in-transit but is now statistically likely to be lost as well, though I will focus on the most solid ghost count). I will use L=2 (promised) as recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. To bypass the OR engine's cap and the inflated pipeline measurement, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I target a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~182 units). Since the OR engine calculates order = base_stock - pipeline, and it sees a pipeline of 1040, I must set mu_hat (the base_stock component) at roughly 1040 + 100 to ensure any ordering occurs. However, given the current on-hand of 103 and a real risk of overstocking if ghost units ever materialized, I will set mu_hat to 1200 to signal a need for stock while monitoring the 993-unit offset.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed 'ghost' pipeline inventory remains 993 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Demand regime for Oct stable at ~60 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38 (late October), the flora hip belt shows a stable demand regime. Analyzing the most recent period (P35-P37), the average demand is approximately 69 units. Since Period 22, the demand has fluctuated but generally averaged around 55-60 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=16) to capture the post-summer stabilization (Avg ~55). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent deliveries (P35, P30, P20, P21) have varied between 1 and 2 periods, while the promised L is 2. The most critical factor remains the 993 'ghost' units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) which have not arrived for over 20 periods. The current In-transit is 1127; subtracting the 993 lost units leaves a real pipeline of 134 units (P37 and P19 residual, though P19 should have arrived). To force the OR backend to ignore the ghost inventory and order sufficient stock for current demand, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it high enough to overcome the pipeline cap which is calculated as: final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap). Since the ghost pipeline (993) is significantly larger than the required base stock (~200), the backend would normally never order. By setting mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the ghost inventory plus required stock (993 + 180 = 1173), I ensure a maintenance order is placed.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, entering the late autumn/pre-holiday season. Demand has been stable around ~60 units/period (Oct avg: 62). There are 993 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) that will never arrive. The OR backend's order logic is capped by pipeline inventory, so to place an order, I must increase the 'mu_hat' significantly to offset these 993 invisible units and signal the need for new stock. Lead times for recent successful deliveries (P35, P37) have been 1 period, though promised is 2. I will set L to 1 to reflect recent trends and use an explicit mu_hat of 1250 (calculated as (1+L)*60 + ~1130) to bypass the pipeline cap and maintain a safe base stock as on-hand inventory is currently 80.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand has recently averaged ~45 units over the last 3 periods (P37-P39), slightly lower than the Oct average of ~60. However, Nov usually sees a retail uptick heading into the holiday season. Total In-transit is 1213 units, but 993 units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 which have never arrived. Current real pipeline consists of P38 (62) and P39 (111), totaling 173 units. Observed lead times since P35 have been fast (1 period). To ensure the OR engine orders despite the 993 ghost units inflating the pipeline calculation, I will use an explicit 'mu_hat' that incorporates the expected demand for the lead period plus a 'buffer' to offset the 993-unit inflation. Required base stock = (Demand * (L+1)) + Pipeline_Offset. Estimated weekly demand = 55. Total needed base stock = (55 * 2) + 993 = 1103. I will set L to 1 based on recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained ghost pipeline confirmed at 993 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Modern lead times (P35-P39) stabilized at 1 period. Demand entering Nov showing high variance but historically averages ~55 units/week in this regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (2019-11-18), the system enters the pre-holiday shopping period. Demand for the 'Flora hip belt' (accessories/narrow belt) has been volatile but shows a stable regime over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) averaging ~53 units/period, despite a recent 2-week dip (avg 27). The ghost pipeline inventory remains a critical factor: the 'In-transit' figure of 1213 units includes 993 units of confirmed lost/stale inventory (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). The remaining 220 units represent real pipeline (P38: 62 units, P39: 111 units, plus recent orders). Recent realized lead times from P35 onwards have stabilized at 1 period. Therefore, I will define L=1. To bypass the 'ghost' pipeline issue which would otherwise prevent the OR engine from ordering (as it believes 1213 units are coming), I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I forecast a demand of 55 units/week across the (L+1) window, but I 'inflate' the base stock calculation by the 993 lost units so the OR backend's subtraction (base_stock - 1213) yields the desired real-world order. Target coverage: 2 periods (L+1) * 55 units = 110. Adjusted mu_hat = 110 (target) + 993 (ghost) = 1103. I will keep sigma_hat default to allow standard variance coverage.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final weeks of the year (late November, Period 42). Historical demand has settled post-summer peak, averaging ~51 units over the last 20 periods (P22-P41) and ~47 units over the last 10 periods (P32-P41). Recent volatility is present but manageable. On-hand inventory is 99 units. The in-transit pipeline of 1102 units is heavily inflated by 993 units of 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14), leaving a real pipeline of 109 units (the P40/P41 arrivals/orders calculation indicates we are waiting on recent cycles). To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must bypass the pipeline cap caused by these 993 lost units. I set L to 1 (reflecting the frequent 1nd 2-period realized lead times) and mu_hat to 160. This value of 160 is calculated to cover approximately 3 periods of demand (current + L + safety) at ~53 units/period, but I provide it via the 'explicit' method to force the backend to ignore the massive 993-unit ghost inventory which would otherwise block all new orders due to the pipeline cap.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). The demand in P42 surged to 135 units, which is consistent with early December holiday shopping patterns for accessories like belts. Recent history (P35-P42) shows an average demand of approximately 64 units, but the high variance (sigma) and the specific spike to 135 suggest we need a robust stock level. Current pipeline inventory is 1102 units, but 993 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units (lost/indefinitely delayed from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). The true physical pipeline is actually 109 units (ordered in P39 and P40, minus arrivals). However, the OR backend sees 1102 in-transit. To force an order and bypass the pipeline cap, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next two periods (L+1) will be approximately 200 units (accounting for December seasonality). To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover this, I must set mu_hat to a value that, after subtracting the 1102 ghost units, still results in a positive order. I will use 'explicit' values to target a base stock level that compensates for the pipeline inflation while addressing the seasonal peak. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods recently.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), nearing the holiday peak. In-transit inventory as reported by the system is 1449 units, but historical evidence confirms a significant 'ghost' pipeline of 993 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) that will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory is 456 units (P43 order of 347, plus remaining P39/P41 variances). Demand is currently volatile; P42 saw a spike of 135 units, while P43 was 67. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 1449 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat explicitly high. Specifically, I set mu_hat to 1350 for a 1+2 period horizon, which effectively offsets the ~1000 ghost units and leaves a base stock of ~350 units (approx. 115 units/period over 3 periods), accounting for potential December demand surges. This forces the system to recognize a real replenishment need and bypass the pipeline cap that would otherwise assume we are overstocked.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (2019/12/16), the system is out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. The pipeline shows 1481 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 993 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14) are confirmed as 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders that were never delivered and are likely lost. Subtracting the ghost inventory from the total in-transit leaves a real pipeline of 488 units (P18, P19, P35, P37, P39 were delivered; pending are P43: 347 units and P44: 32 units, plus any residual from P18/P19/P20). Lead times for successful deliveries recently stabilized at 1-2 periods (P36: 1, P38: 1, P41: 2). L is set to 2 to be conservative. Demand entering the mid-December period (Period 42/43/44) shows high variance with a recent peak of 135 (P42) and an average of ~94 over the last 3 periods. This likely reflects holiday demand for accessories. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher late-year demand mean (~78 per period) and ensure the OR backend covers (L+1) demand, while the explicit methods serve to bypass the pipeline cap and account for the 993-unit inflation.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. The item is a 'Narrow belt in grained imitation leather'. We are in Period 46. Demand in late Nov/Dec (P42 onwards) has been elevated (avg ~85) compared to Oct (~60), likely due to holiday seasonality. Recently, P43 (347 units) arrived in P45 (L=2). The total In-transit is 1134, but 993 of these are 'ghost' units from historically lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). The true pipeline is only P44 (32 units). On-hand is 285. To ensure the OR engine orders correctly, I must set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' to bypass the pipeline cap calculation which is heavily skewed by the 993 ghost units. I will forecast demand at ~75 units/period for the next 2 periods (L=1, so cover 2 periods). Safety stock is added for holiday volatility. L is set to explicit 1 based on recent arrivals (P38, P40 were L=1; P41, P45 were L=2; averaging ~1.5, leaning towards 1 for responsiveness).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are in a post-holiday demand phase. Recent demand (P43-P46) has averaged 67.5 units, which is lower than the Nov/Dec peak but remains volatile. The 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 993 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) is still present in the system's 'In-transit' total (1134 units). To calculate the real order, the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base_stock. With 1134 units in transit, the engine will order 0 unless we artificially inflate the base_stock (mu_hat) to bypass the pipeline cap. Actual lead time recently stabilized at 2 periods (observed in P45). We set L=2. For mu_hat, we use an explicit value: (Real base stock target) + Ghost Pipeline. Target base stock = (L+1) * Expected Demand (68) + Safety Stock (~100) \u2248 304. Adding 993 ghost units gives an explicit mu_hat of ~1300. This ensures the backend considers the ghost units 'covered' and allows for actual replenishment if needed, though with 224 on-hand, no immediate order is likely necessary for this period.
