Period 1 is 2019-02-11. World knowledge suggests steady demand for basic accessories, possibly a slight uptick around Valentine's Day (this week). Promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) arrives in P3 (L=2) and becomes visible in P4. I must cover demand for P1, P2, and P3 to ensure availability, as on-hand and in-transit are currently 0. Average weekly demand is ~50. Expected demand for P1-P3 is 150 units. I will order 200 units to establish initial stock and provide a safety buffer for the lead time period, as the current stock out results in lost profit of $19/unit compared to $1/unit holding cost.",

Promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, I placed an order of 200 units, which is currently in-transit. I expect this to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current inventory is 0, so I am missing potential sales. To cover demand for the lead time period (L+1 = 3 periods) plus a safety buffer, I target a pipeline of approximately 210-240 units (based on an average demand of ~60-70).

Currently, the SKU is in a major stock-out (0 on-hand) because no orders have arrived yet despite a promised lead time of 2 periods. Analyzing the sequence: Order 1 (200 units, placed Period 1) should have arrived in Period 3's resolution and been visible in the Period 4 start message ('Period 3 conclude arrived=X'). However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Total in-transit is 400 (P1: 200, P2: 80, P3: 120). Demand forecasts suggest needing ~100-120 units per period. I will refrain from a massive over-order to avoid a huge holding cost spike if all 400 units arrive at once, but I must maintain the pipeline to cover future demand assuming a longer lead time.

Historical demand (early Jan-early Feb) was stable (avg ~49). However, Period 1 & 2 showed sudden spikes (72 and 150), likely due to a promotion or seasonal shift, before settling back to lower levels (78 and 48) as seen in Periods 3 & 4. Expected demand is estimated at ~65 per period to account for potential spring shopping volatility. Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Current status: On-hand is 32. Pipeline (In-transit) consists of Period 1 (200 - potentially lost/overdue as it should have arrived in P3), Period 3 (120 - expected in P5), and Period 4 (120 - expected in P6). Calculation: We need to cover demand for P5, P6, and P7 (Lead time L=2 + 1 current period). Total requirement = 3 periods * 65 units/period = 195 units. On-hand (32) + expected pipeline (120 in P5 + 120 in P6) = 272 units.

(c) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2. Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (actual lead time = 2).

Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory. Two orders (240 units total) are significantly overdue (P3 and P4 orders). If these do not arrive, we face massive stockouts. However, placing yet more orders on top of a massive (but delayed) pipeline risks excessive holding costs if they all arrive at once. We need enough stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~180 units). Total Pipeline (490) far exceeds this, but reliability is low.

While P14 and P15 showed lower demand (69 and 57 respectively), stockouts likely suppressed the realized demand visibility, or we are in a high-variance spring regime.

Currently, 250 units from P14 are expected to arrive in P16 (this period) and 150 units from P15 are expected in P17. Legacy orders (P1, P3, P4, and likely P10) are confirmed or highly likely lost.

The only recent successful delivery was the P23 order which arrived in P26 (lead time = 3). Current on-hand inventory is 164 units. Given the cooling demand (~41 units/week), this inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 4 periods of demand (164 / 41 = 4.0).

Since the existing on-hand stock (134) is sufficient to cover the expected lead time (3 periods) plus the current period's demand (Total 4 periods * 40 units = 160 units required), and we have a high holding cost ($1) relative to the cooling demand, I will place a small order of 50 units.

  "rationale": "The product is a women's narrow belt (Flora hip belt), which typically shows stable demand but can be influenced by seasonal transitions. We are now in Period 40 (mid-November). Historical demand analysis: (a) Autumn demand (P29-P38) averaged ~65 units. (b) Period 39 saw a dip to 25 units, which might be a one-off or the start of a pre-holiday lull. (c) December historically brings increased retail activity, so a slight uptick should be anticipated. Pipeline analysis: The 'In-transit' of 1390 units is dominated by historical losses (1230 units: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). The reliable active pipeline consists of orders from P38 (80) and P39 (80). Current on-hand is 134. Average lead time is ~2 periods. To cover 3 periods (L+1) at an estimated demand of 65-70 units per period (~210 units total), the current on-hand (134) plus expecting the P38 order (80) brings us to 214 units. To maintain safety stock against potential losses and prepare for late November/December demand spikes, I will order a standard replacement batch to keep the pipeline moving.",

Pipeline: P38 order (80), P39 order (80), and P40 order (80) are in transit. P34 (70) is confirmed lost. With demand dropping to ~30 units/week, current on-hand (105) covers ~3.5 weeks.

Specifically, the P38 order (80 units) is now 4 periods old and potentially lost, while the P40 order (80 units) is due to arrive within the next 1-2 periods.

This breaks the previous 'off-peak' cooling trend of ~30-40 units observed in Nov. Given that the product is a women's imitation leather belt (a common gift/accessory item), higher demand is expected throughout December. Current on-hand inventory is very low (12 units). The pipeline is heavily inflated by 1230 units previously identified as 'likely lost' (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). The reliable active pipeline includes P38 (80 units, overdue at 5 periods old), P40 (80 units, 3 periods old), and P41 (recently arrived, but it was 0 order). Wait, checking P40: ordered 80 in P40. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods). I need to cover the (L+1) window (3 periods). With demand potentially averaging 100-120 units during the holiday peak, I need ~360 units available.

On-hand (25) + Effective In-transit (P43 order: 280) = 305 units. While the pipeline technically covers the expected needs, the risk of shipment loss is high.
