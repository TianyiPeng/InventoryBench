Valentine's Day (Feb 14) is approaching, which might provide a slight lift if these are perceived as giftable, but they are primarily a staple item. b) Demand Analysis: Historical data from Jan-Feb shows demand ranging from 190 to 294, with a mean of approximately 229 units/week. Recent trend shows a slight decline (294 -> 212 -> 190). c) Lead Time/Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 arrive for demand in P3. There is no current on-hand or in-transit inventory. d) Inventory Assessment: I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 until the first shipment arrives. e) Order Logic: Since on-hand is 0, demand in P1 and P2 will be lost. I must order to meet demand starting at the earliest arrival (P3) and maintain a buffer. Given the average of ~230 and a 2-period lead time, I need to cover at least Periods 1, 2, and 3 (Total ~690 units). I will order 700 units to establish a baseline inventory and account for the initial 2-week stockout period.",

I started Period 1 with 0 inventory, meaning 233 units of demand were lost. I have 700 units in transit from Period 1.

Total pipeline needed (L+1 = 3 periods of demand) is approximately 230 * 3 = 690 units. Since I already have 700 units in transit, I will place a maintenance order of 230 units to ensure continuity once the pipeline starts delivering.

{
  "rationale": "(a) World Knowledge & Description: The product is 'Fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge.' It is a basic everyday item with moderate seasonality.

In-game demand (Periods 1-5) has been 233, 271, 174, 145, 162 (avg ~197). There is a slight downward trend compared to January, settling around 150-170. I will forecast ~170/period. (c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Promised LT is 2. Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (LT=2).

True Pipeline (On-hand + True In-transit) = 0 + 730 = 730 units. To cover L+1 (3) periods of demand at ~170/period, I need ~510 units.

With 362 on hand and 1250 units in the active pipeline (assuming P38 arrives very soon), the position is relatively strong.

I expect demand for the next two periods (Christmas and post-Christmas sales) to remain high, averaging around 400-500 units.
