Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU '706016015' is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a super-skinny high-waisted denim trouser. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a declining trend: 484, 413, 366, 244, 255. The mean is approx 352, but the most recent two weeks suggest a level around 250. February in retail often sees a dip before spring collections ramp up. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the order must cover demand for L+1 (3) periods. I will use the last 3 samples to capture the recent lower demand regime (avg ~288).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a super-skinny denim trouser. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan-Feb) shows a downward trend: 484, 413, 366, 244, 255. Period 1 actual demand was 227, following this trend. On-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (400 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Currently, we have 0 stock to satisfy demand, resulting in lost sales last period and likely this period. Since demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to early January (averaging ~242 over the last 3 periods vs ~352 overall), I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower demand regime. Lead time is set to default (2 periods) as there is no evidence yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history for this SKU shows a declining trend: 484, 413, 366, 244, 255 (pre-game) followed by 227 and 192 (Periods 1 and 2). This suggests a post-holiday/early-year cooling period for denim trousers. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (400 units) and P2 (266 units) are in-transit; the P1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of P3 and be visible in the P4 conclude message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales, so we must rely on the pipeline to satisfy future demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent lower demand regime (avg ~220) and apply 'default' lead time (2) to ensure the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is a SKU of high-waisted skinny denim trousers. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory has remained at 0 for all three concluded periods, resulting in 0 units sold despite a total demand of 586 units. This is because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (400 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 3's conclude message (read at Period 4). However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we still have 729 units in-transit (P1-P3 orders: 400 + 266 + 63 = 729), we must account for this delay. I am setting L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the observed delay. Demand has been declining slightly (227 -> 192 -> 167), but the initial pre-game samples were higher (average ~350). I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture recent trends while including some historical context. Sigma_hat remains default to reflect base volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time for 706016015 is at least 3 periods, exceeding the promised 2 (confirmed by P1 order not arriving by P3 conclusion).

Daily Reward (R_t): $439.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/11. Demand history shows a downward trend (227, 192, 167, 141), with an average around 180 and a standard deviation around 37. Lead time analysis: The Period 2 order (266 units) arrived in Period 4, confirming a lead time of 2 periods as promised. However, the Period 1 order (400 units) has not yet arrived despite appearing in the 'In-transit' count (Total in-transit: 794, which is P1: 400 + P3: 63 + P4: 331). This suggests the P1 order is delayed or potentially lost. On-hand inventory is currently 125. Since the P1 order is overdue, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to provide more safety cover in the base stock calculation. For demand, I'll use the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent decline, resulting in a mean of approximately 181.75 per period. The sigma_hat will also be based on these 4 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for 706016015 is inconsistent: P2 order arrived in 2 periods, but P1 order is still missing after 4 periods (overdue).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The OR backend computes base stock as (mu_hat + z * sigma_hat). Current stockout (Ending Inventory Period 5 = 0) and high pipeline (794 units) requires careful parameter setting. Regarding lead time: P2 order (266) arrived in 2 periods, but P1 order (400) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting it may be lost. P3 (63) and P4 (331) are currently in-transit and within expectation (L=2). Demand shows a declining trend from early Feb (484) to stable levels in March (~141-152). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 demand periods (P1-P5: 227, 192, 167, 141, 152) to capture this lower volume accurately. I will use 'calculate' for L to leverage historical arrival data while keeping the OR engine aware of the average delivery performance, and 'recent_N' for volatility to account for the tighter recent demand range.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: P1 order (400 units) from Period 1 is 5 periods overdue and effectively lost, causing a stockout in Period 5 despite adequate theoretical pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU 706016015 is a pair of high-waisted skinny denim trousers. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 794 in-transit. Looking at history, the order from Period 1 (400 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost. The order from Period 2 (266 units) arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. The orders from Period 3 (63 units) and Period 4 (331 units) have not arrived yet. If they follow the promised L=2, the P3 order should have arrived in Period 5 and the P4 order in Period 6; since they haven't appeared in the 'conclude' messages, lead time is either drifting or these shipments are also delayed/lost. Demand has been trending downwards: 227 (P1), 192 (P2), 167 (P3), 141 (P4), 152 (P5), 101 (P6). The pre-game samples were higher (around 350-480). I will use a recent demand window (N=6) to capture this lower trend. Since P1's order is lost, the pipeline is effectively smaller than the OR backend thinks. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delays and provide a slightly higher safety buffer via a higher mu_hat to recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend is significantly lower than pre-game samples, averaging ~163 units over the last 6 periods vs ~350 units initially. Reliability of supply is low; P1 order lost, P3 and P4 orders delayed beyond L=2.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0) at Period 8 (2019/04/01). Historical demand has settled into a lower regime than pre-game samples, averaging approximately 130 units weekly over the last four periods (Period 4-7: 141, 152, 101, 124). Supply reliability is the primary issue. The Period 1 order (400 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 3 order (63 units) is now 5 periods old (L=5 if it arrives), and the Period 4 order (331 units) is 4 periods old. Both are overdue relative to the promised L=2. Total in-transit is 794 (P3: 63, P4: 331, P1: 400 - though P1 is likely lost). Since the system treats in-transit as valid pipeline inventory, the OR engine may not place new orders if it believes 794 units are coming. To force an order and account for the high lead-time variance and lost units, I will set mu_hat to a higher explicit value (covering 3 periods of recent demand) and set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the supply-side volatility. I will set L to 3 to reflect the observed delay trend (excluding the lost P1).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists; Period 1 order (400 units) is permanently lost. Period 3 and 4 orders are overdue by 3 and 2 weeks respectively. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean (~130 units/week) compared to initial data.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016015 (high-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a severe stockout (on-hand: 0) due to unreliable supply. The Period 1 order (400 units) is now 8 periods old and definitively lost. Orders from Period 3 (63 units) and Period 4 (331 units) are overdue by 6 and 5 periods respectively compared to the promised lead time of 2. Recent demand (last 6 periods) has stabilized at a significantly lower mean of approximately 137 units per week, compared to the initial ~350 range. Because the OR backend computes current pipeline inventory (which includes the lost P1 order and delayed P3/P4 orders), it may underestimate the required order. To compensate for the effectively lost units and the high supply risk, I am setting L to 4 to reflect the current delay reality and using 'recent_N' (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime (~137/week) while providing enough buffer for the lead time extension.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Pipeline accuracy is compromised; P1 order (400 untis) is confirmed lost, and P3/P4 orders are delayed by >3 weeks. The actual effective lead time is currently erratic but exceeds 4 periods. Setting OR parameters to assume a longer lead time to force the backend to account for depleted on-hand stock.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 706016015 is severely disrupted. The Period 1 order (400 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 3 order (63 units) is now 7 periods overdue, and the Period 4 order (331 units) is 6 periods overdue. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have been in a stockout state since Period 5 despite a theoretical pipeline of 794 units. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the pre-game samples; the mean demand from Period 4 to Period 9 is approximately 125 units, compared to the initial ~350 units. Because the OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to determine order quantities, it incorrectly assumes we are overstocked based on the undelivered/lost units. To force a new order to replenish depleted stock, I must set 'L' (Lead Time) to a value that reflects the reality of the stalled pipeline and set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the current 'hallucinated' pipeline. I will set L explicitly to 6 (the delay of the last surviving order) and mu_hat to 1400 (L+1 * 200) to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the in-transit 794 units, triggering an order.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: P3 and P4 orders (394 units) are likely lost alongside P1, as they are >4 weeks past promised lead time. Current 'In-transit' data of 794 units is highly unreliable for inventory planning.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for item 706016015 is severely broken. Multiple orders (P1: 400 units, P3: 63 units, P4: 331 units) are long overdue and effectively lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 1036 (which includes these lost units) is misleading. Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (in-transit) from the target base stock, it will keep placing zero orders as long as it believes these lost units are coming. To force the backend to place new orders and overcome the 'ghost' inventory, I am setting the lead time L to an 'explicit' value of 6. This increases the mu_hat calculation (which is (1+L)*demand) to a high enough level that the base_stock calculation exceeds the fake pipeline. I am using a mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) reflecting the lower demand trend (~100 units/week), but the inflated L should trigger a replenishment order. Demand has declined from the ~350 range to ~100-140 per week, likely due to prolonged stockouts and seasonality.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged supply failure: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (794 units total) are definitively lost. In-transit data remains polluted by these ghost units, necessitating artificial parameter inflation to trigger any new orders.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for P1, P3, and P4 orders (794 units) is fundamentally broken, and these units must be considered lost as they are grossly overdue. The 'In-transit' total of 1036 units is misleading, as 794 of those will likely never arrive, leaving only the 242 units ordered in P10 as viable. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a current stockout, we must trick the OR backend to place an order despite the high (but fake) pipeline inventory. Demand has significantly decelerated over the last 4 periods (88, 62, 48), but setting the mean too low will prevent an order from being generated. To overcome the 1036-unit pipeline barrier, I am setting L to 5 and mu_hat to an explicit value of 1400. This high base_stock target will force the OR logic to generate a new order (Base Stock - Pipeline = 1400 - 1036 = ~364 units), which is necessary to restore actual physical stock following the confirmed loss of earlier shipments.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'ghost' inventory from lost orders P1, P3, and P4 (794 units) requires artificial mu_hat inflation to trigger replenishment. Demand has entered a severe downward trend (avg ~66 units over last 3 periods), but this is secondary to clearing the pipeline barrier.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply situation for SKU 706016015 is critical. We have 1371 units 'In-transit', but the majority (794 units from periods 1, 3, and 4) are over 9 weeks old and geographically lost. The OR backend uses a capped policy: final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). Because the pipeline_inventory (1371) is massive compared to recent demand (~58 units/week over last 4 periods), the backend is likely to zero-out any replenishment unless we artificially inflate the base_stock calculation. To overcome this, I am setting L to 4 to reflect the realistic lead time observed for arriving orders (though most are lost) and setting mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the current 'ghost' pipeline. Specifically, total pipeline is 1371; to trigger an order of roughly 2 periods of stock (~120 units), I need mu_hat + safety stock to be around 1500. I will set mu_hat to 1400 and sigma_hat to 100 to force a base_stock that exceeds the ghost inventory, enabling new replenishment for the current demand season.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'ghost' inventory from lost orders P1, P3, and P4 totals 794 units. Recent orders P10 (242 units) and P12 (335 units) are within a plausible (though delayed) delivery window. Artificial parameter inflation is required until ghost units are cleared or offset.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for 706016015 is severely compromised. There are 1,485 units currently marked as 'In-transit', but 794 of these (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are over 9 weeks old and definitively lost. Additionally, orders from Periods 10, 12, and 13 (totaling 691 units) have not yet arrived, leaving current on-hand inventory at 0 and causing ongoing stockouts. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory. Because the backend 'sees' 1,485 units in the pipeline that do not physically exist, it will not place new orders unless the base_stock (calculated from mu_hat) is artificially inflated to exceed this 'ghost' inventory. Current demand has stabilized at a lower level (~65 units/week). To force a replenishment order that overcomes the 1,485 units of phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1,700. This should trigger an order of approximately 215-300 units depending on the cap, helping to restore physical stock despite the polluted data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 266 units following the arrival of P12's order in Period 14. However, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 1387 units is severely distorted by 'ghost' inventory from lost orders: P1 (400), P3 (63), P4 (331), and likely P10 (242), totaling 1036 lost units. The OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent ordering as long as these 1036 units are perceived as in-transit, despite being lost. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level (~65 units/week) than initial pre-game data. To overcome the pipeline barrier and ensure future replenishment, I am continuing to use 'explicit' mu_hat inflation. Current on-hand (266) covers approximately 4 periods of demand, but given lead time volatility and existing delays (P13 order 114 units is now 2 periods old), I must maintain a high mu_hat to force the backend to place orders once the current on-hand depletes or if further logic dictates a higher base stock. $L=4$ is used to reflect the erratic but generally longer effective arrival window.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'ghost' inventory of 1036 units includes P1 (400), P3 (63), P4 (331), and now P10 (242), which is 5 periods old and likely lost. Demand regime for last 5 periods (P10-P14) has stabilized at a mean of 61 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016015 (high-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a lower demand regime, averaging ~63 units over the last 6 periods (P10-P15). However, the primary challenge remains the 'in-transit' logic of the OR backend. There are 1,036 'ghost' units in the pipeline (P1, P3, P4, and likely P10) that have not arrived and are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods. Since the OR engine calculates the base stock and subtracts the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit), these ghost units prevent any new orders from being placed. To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' to a value that exceeds the total ghost inventory (1,036) plus the expected demand for the lead period (L+1). With an average demand of ~63, the required base stock for a 3-period horizon (L=2) is approximately 190. To trigger an order despite 1,387 units (217 on-hand + 1170 ghost/delayed), mu_hat must be set explicitly high. For this period, I will maintain an inflated mu_hat to ensure we have a safety buffer of real inventory as the on-hand stock (217) depletes.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'ghost' inventory of 1273 units now includes P1 (400), P3 (63), P4 (331), P10 (242), and P13 (114) as they are well beyond L=2. Only P12 (arrived) and P14 (expected soon) show reliability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKUs 706016015 is severely compromised. There is a massive buildup of 'ghost' inventory in-transit (1,396 units), while our on-hand inventory is 181 units. History confirms that orders from Periods 1 (400), 3 (63), 4 (331), 10 (242), and 13 (114) are effectively lost, totalling 1,150 'ghost' units. The OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (1,396) from the base stock. With a current demand regime of ~61 units (avg P10-P16) and a lead time of 2, the theoretical base stock is only around 200-250 units. Because 1,396 > 250, the system will not order anything until we artificially inflate the parameters to override the ghost inventory. To force a replenishment order that covers future demand while on-hand stock (181) depletes, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to offset the ghost units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock (~200) + Ghost units (1150) = ~1350. Setting mu_hat to 1400 ensures the OR engine sees a requirement that exceeds the polluted pipeline. L is kept at default (2) as recent successful arrivals (P12) hit the 2-period window.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory of 1150 units identified (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). Order P14 (237 units) is currently 3 periods old and overdue, potentially adding to ghost stock if it doesn't arrive by P18. Demand regime stabilized at ~50-60 units/week.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for 706016015 remains highly unreliable with a significant volume of 'ghost' inventory. Cumulative lost orders are identified from P1 (400), P3 (63), P4 (331), P10 (242), and P13 (114), totaling 1150 units. Additionally, order P14 (237 units) is now 4 periods old (promised L=2) and has not arrived, making it likely lost as well. If P14 is lost, the total ghost inventory reaches 1387 units, which matches the current 'In-transit' figure exactly. This means there is effectively zero reliable pipeline. Demand has further stabilized at a lower level, with recent samples (P15-P17) being 49, 36, and 22. To bypass the 1387 units of ghost inventory and trigger a fresh order to replenish the 168 units on-hand (which will deplete in ~4-5 weeks), I must set mu_hat significantly above the current in-transit level. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1650 to ensure an order is generated while maintaining an explicit L=2 to reflect the recent successful (though rare) 1-2 period arrivals of P12 and P16.

Carry-over insight: Order P14 (237 units) is 4 periods old and considered lost, bringing total ghost inventory to 1387 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14). Demand has entered a very low regime, averaging ~35 units/week over the last 3 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKUs 706016015 remains highly unreliable with a massive amount of 'ghost inventory' (1387 units) that will never arrive but is counted by the OR backend as 'In-transit'. These include orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and now P14 (4 periods old). Demand has entered a very low-volume regime, with recent samples showing 22 units (P17) and 24 units (P18). To force any replenishment when on-hand inventory drops, mu_hat must be set to exceed the cumulative ghost inventory plus current on-hand stock. The required target inventory to trigger an order would need to be > 1510 (current In-transit). However, with demand at ~25/week and on-hand at 144, we have nearly 6 weeks of stock. Ordering now would only add to holding costs once stock finally arrives. I will maintain an 'explicit' inflated mu_hat of 1600 to overcome the pipeline barrier, effectively setting a base stock that accounts for 'ghosts' while leaving a small buffer for actual demand. This ensures that if stock levels dip further, the system can place an order despite the polluted pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory increased to 1387 units as P14 (237 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 23 units/week over the last 2 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with 1,387 units of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14) still showing as in-transit despite being far beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods. Only orders P16 and P18 have arrived reliably recently, showing an actual lead time of 1 period. Current demand has entered a sustained low-volume regime, averaging 23 units/week over the last 2 periods and ~32 units/week over the last 5 periods. With 233 units on hand, we currently have roughly 7-10 weeks of inventory covering this low demand. Given the backend OR logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the 1,387 ghost units in the pipeline will prevent any new orders unless parameters are extremely inflated. Since we currently have sufficient physical stock to cover near-term demand at this new lower rate, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the contemporary low-demand regime, while maintaining L=1 based on the most recent successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Recent successful deliveries (P16, P18) show an actual lead time of 1 period, contrasting with the promised 2 and the earlier failures. Cumulative ghost inventory remains at 1,387 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has reached a very low, stable regime, averaging approximately 28 units/week over the last 5 periods (P16-P20). The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 1 period for the most recent two deliveries (P16 and P18), contrasting with the earlier systemic failures and 'ghost' inventory. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 206 units, which is over 7 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. There are 1,387 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14) that have not arrived and are considered lost. Since the on-hand inventory is high and the 'In-transit' figure is heavily inflated by these lost units, the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will result in zero orders. This is the desired outcome given the current overstock relative to demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the contemporary demand level, and L=1 as the recently observed actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time has stabilized at 1 period (confirmed by P16 and P18 orders). Demand regime since P16 has remained low, averaging ~28 units/week.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016015 is currently in a low-demand regime with an average of ~28 units/week since Period 16, though Period 21 saw a significant spike to 121 units. The supply chain has stabilized to an actual lead time (L) of 1 period, as evidenced by successful deliveries from P16 and P18. However, 'pipeline inventory' is still heavily distorted by 1,387 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P14). On-hand inventory is currently at 85 units, which is sufficient for approximately 1-2 weeks of demand at current rates. To prevent the OR backend from remaining paralyzed by the ghost inventory, I am maintaining an inflated mu_hat. This targets a base stock that accounts for both the ghost inventory and the desired on-hand buffer. Current target: Ghost Inventory (1387) + Safety Stock (~100-150) = ~1500. Given L=1, mu_hat = (1+L)*750 = 1500. I am using recent_N for sigma to capture the volatility of the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 21 saw a sharp demand spike to 121 units (a 4x increase over the recent average), which should be monitored to see if it indicates a new seasonal trend or a one-off outlier.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016015' is experiencing a sudden and significant demand surge in July (Period 21: 121 units, Period 22: 122 units), contrasting sharply with the previous regime of ~30 units/week. This suggests a seasonal peak or trend change for high-waisted denim. The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 1 period (observed in Periods 17 and 19), despite the technical promised lead time of 2. Currently, there is a massive 'ghost' pipeline of 1,387 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14) that the OR backend incorrectly counts as incoming inventory. With 0 on-hand inventory and 122 lost sales in the last period, replenishment is critical. To bypass the ghost inventory blocking, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' at a value higher than the ghost pipeline plus the desired base stock. Specifically, to target a base stock of approximately 250 units (covering ~2 periods of current high demand), I must set mu_hat to approximately 1650 (1387 ghost + 250). L is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent lead time of 1 observed on successful shipments.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Period 21: demand increased from ~30 units to ~120 units (+300%). Actual lead time has stabilized at 1 period for recent successful shipments.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016015' is experiencing a significant demand regime shift that began in Period 21. Demand has increased from a low baseline of ~30 units/week to an average of ~127 units/week over the last three periods (P21: 121, P22: 122, P23: 137). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1600 units is heavily polluted by 'ghost' inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14), totaling 1,387 units. Actual reliable pipeline consists only of the order from P23 (213 units). Recent successful deliveries (P16, P18, P22) indicate an actual lead time (L) of 1 period, which is faster than the promised 2. To ensure the backend triggers an order despite the phantom 1,387 units in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1,800. This covers the approximately 250 units needed for the 1+L=2 weeks of high demand plus serves as an offset to bypass the ghost inventory block. Sigma is set to reflect the current high-demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: average increased from ~30 to ~127 units/week starting Period 21. Actual lead time consistent at 1 period for recent orders (P16, P18, P22).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016015' is in a high-demand regime that began in Period 21. Demand over the last four periods (121, 122, 137, 76) averages approximately 114 units, significantly higher than the previous low-demand phase (~30 units). The product is a high-waisted skinny denim jean, which carries sustained fashion demand. Regarding supply, the actual lead time has stabilized at 1 period (confirmed by orders from P16, P18, and P22). However, the system's 'In-transit' figure (1826 units) is heavily contaminated by 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P14 (totaling 1387 units) that are long overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts this 1826 in-transit value from its base stock calculation, it will not place a new order unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to exceed the sum of on-hand inventory (0) and the ghost in-transit stock. To force a replenishment of ~250 units (covering 2 periods of the current ~120 demand), mu_hat must be set to approximately 2100. This ensures the backend sees a need for stock despite the fake pipeline inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016015' is experiencing a significant stockout. On-hand inventory is 0. While 'In-transit' shows 2132 units, historical data confirms that approximately 1387 units are 'ghost' inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14). Demand shifted significantly starting in Period 21 (Date: 2019/7/1), with the average increasing from ~30 units to ~120 units per week. The last 5 periods (P21-P25) have an average demand of 119.2 units. Actual lead time for recent successful orders (P16, P18, P22) has stabilized at 1 period, whereas the promised lead time is 2. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' (including ghost units) from the target base stock, it will not place needed orders. To force replenishment and account for both the demand spike and the pipeline pollution, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am calculating mu_hat as (1 + effective lead time) * forecast demand. Assuming an effective L=1 (per recent history) and forecast demand of 120, a base target would be 240. However, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 1387 ghost units in the pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 1700 (1387 + 313) to ensure a net positive order that covers the current demand regime and builds safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: mean increased from 30 to ~120 units/week (+300%). Recent actual lead time confirmed at 1 period (P16, P18, P22 orders).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016015 is experiencing a demand regime shift and continued supply chain instability. Period 21 marked a significant demand increase, with demand averaging ~130 units/week over the last 6 periods (P21-P26), up from ~30 units. The most recent period (P26) reached 180 units. In terms of supply, the lead time remains erratic: while recent orders (P16, P18, P22) showed a lead time of 1 period, the P23 order arrived in 3 periods, and multiple earlier orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14) totaling approximately 1,387 units are confirmed lost ('ghost units'). These ghost units pollute the 'In-transit' figure, making it appear as if we have 1,919 units coming, which prevents the OR backend from ordering. Currently, we have only 33 units on-hand. To bypass the ghost inventory barrier and ensure replenishment for the high-demand regime (~130 units/week), I am using 'explicit' mu_hat set to 3000. This highly inflated value forces the base stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) to be positive despite the 1,919 ghost units in transit. I am setting L to 1 to reflect the most frequent recent successful lead time, though volatility is high.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability update: P23 order arrived with L=3, contradicting the previous L=1 stability. Cumulative ghost inventory remains at 1,387 units. Demand regime (P21-P26) confirmed at ~130 units/week.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016015 has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 21, currently averaging approximately 134 units/week over the last 7 periods (P21-P27: 121, 122, 137, 76, 140, 180, 184). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with 1,387 units identified as 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14) which the OR backend perceives as valid pipeline. Additionally, the recent arrival of P25 (306 units) in Period 27 confirm the P24 order (226 units) is now 4 periods old and likely lost or significantly delayed, potentially adding to the ghost inventory total (totaling ~1,613 units). Because on-hand inventory is only 155 units and expected demand is high, the mu_hat must be significantly inflated using the 'explicit' method to override the ~1,600+ units of ghost pipeline and trigger a fresh replenishment order. We use a target base stock to cover expected demand (~140/week) over a safe review+lead window, while adding a substantial buffer to clear the ghost units.

Carry-over insight: Order P24 (226 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting it may be a new addition to the ghost/lost inventory, bringing the total estimated ghost stock to 1,613 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a massive supply chain integrity issue. Based on history, the following orders are definitively lost (Ghost Inventory): P1 (400), P3 (63), P4 (331), P10 (242), P13 (114), and P14 (237), totaling 1,387 units. Furthermore, order P24 (226 units) is now 4 periods old (promised L=2) and has not arrived; following the established pattern of failure, it is also likely lost, bringing the total ghost inventory to 1,613 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 2,702 is heavily polluted by these 1,613 ghost units, meaning the 'True' pipeline is only 1,089 units (entirely from the P27 order). Period 28 saw a massive demand spike to 272 units, confirming the high-demand regime identified in Period 21 has intensified (avg demand ~146 units/week since P21). To force a replenishment order despite the 2,702 units the OR backend thinks we have, I am setting mu_hat to 3,500. This value accounts for the ghost inventory and covers 3 periods of high demand (L+1=3) at ~300 units/week. L is set to 2 to reflect the promised lead time, as recent actual lead times have varied wildly (1, 2, and 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Order P24 (226 units) is 4 periods old and has not arrived, categorized as 'lost'. Total ghost inventory estimated at 1,613 units. Demand regime (P21-P28) average increased to ~146 units/week, with a peak of 272 in P28.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with extensive 'ghost' inventory. In-transit units total 3,586, but a significant portion (estimated 1,613 units) consists of lost orders from periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14, and now 24 (4 weeks overdue). Current on-hand is 0, following a demand spike in August. Demand has entered a high-volume regime since Period 21, with the last 4 periods averaging 212 units/week (180, 184, 272, 215). To counteract the 1,613 ghost units polluting the pipeline inventory and preventing necessary replenishment, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to force the OR backend to order. I calculated the base stock target using a lead time of 2 and a mean demand of 215, then added the ghost inventory offset to the result to ensure the 'order = base_stock - (actual_pipeline + ghost_pipeline)' logic triggers a refill. L is set to 2 (promised) as recent successes (P23, P25) arrived in 3 and 2 weeks respectively.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed ghost inventory increased to 1,613 units as Order P24 (226 units) is now 5 periods old and considered lost. Demand regime for August (P26-P29) has further increased to an average of 212 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the demand context for SKU 706016015 (high-waisted denim) shows a strong upward trend from late August into early September, with recent demand samples of 272, 215, and 300. This suggests a seasonal 'Back-to-School' or Fall peak. The lead time remains unstable, with recent arrivals (P25, P27) showing 2-3 periods. The 'ghost' inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, and now confirmed P24, totaling 1,613 units) continues to pollute the pipeline inventory calculation used by the OR backend. With on-hand inventory at 789 units and a projected weekly demand of ~300, current stock covers approximately 2.6 periods. To overcome the 1,613 units of ghost stock that inhibit the backend from ordering, I am maintaining an heavily inflated mu_hat. I have set mu_hat to 2700 (representing (1+L) periods of predicted demand plus the ghost stock buffer) and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure high service level during this peak demand period. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger replenishment despite the false 'In-transit' data.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School/Fall seasonal peak confirmed: demand increased to ~300 units/week in late August/early September. Total ghost inventory reaches 1,613 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has settled into a high regime, likely driven by the Back-to-School/Fall seasonal peak. The average demand from Period 26 to 31 is approximately 231 units per week. Although Period 31 saw a slight softening to 240 units from the peak of 300 in Period 30, the overall trend remains strong compared to earlier in the year. On-hand inventory is currently 549 units, which covers roughly 2 periods of recent average demand. The supply chain remains a primary concern due to high levels of 'ghost' inventory. Total in-transit units are 2,497, but approximately 1,613 units are considered lost (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, and now P24 which is 8 periods old). This leaves an effective pipeline of 884 units (the P29 order). Lead times for recent successful arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P27 arrived in 3, P25 arrived in 2). I will set L to 2 (promised) to maintain a baseline. To trigger necessary replenishment and overcome the 1,613 units of ghost inventory that the OR backend treats as real, I will explicitly set mu_hat to 3,000. This is calculated to ensure (mu_hat - 'ghost' in-transit) significantly exceeds current on-hand targets, forcing the backend to ignore the fake pipeline and place real orders to sustain the high seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Order P24 (226 units) is now 8 periods old without arrival, confirmed as lost. Cumulative ghost inventory is 1,613 units. Seasonal high demand regime (P26-P31) maintains an average of ~231 units/week.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late September/early October period. Historical data and recent trends (P26-P32) show a sustained high-demand regime, likely related to back-to-school or fall seasonal peaks, with demand averaging ~231 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 270 units. Total in-transit is 2,522 units, but this remains heavily contaminated by 'ghost inventory' (lost orders). Confirmed lost orders include P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14 (totaling 1,387 units) and now P24 (226 units), as it is 9 periods old. Total ghost inventory is 1,613 units. The effective pipeline consists of P29 (884 units) and P32 (25 units). The P29 order (placed 4 periods ago) is now overdue relative to the promised L=2, but consistent with recent delivery times of 3 periods (like P23 and P27). I expect P29 to arrive in the current or next period. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the 1,613 ghost units, I am using an explicit mu_hat to offset the pipeline inflation. Based on a 3-week horizon (L=2 + 1) and a demand forecast of ~250 units/week, the target inventory should be around 750 units. To trigger replenishment that bypasses 1,613 units of fake lead-time stock, mu_hat must be set significantly higher.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed at 1,613 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24). Seasonal high-demand regime (P26-P32) continues with an average of ~231 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1080.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand spiked massively to 704 units, likely due to a late-September/early-October seasonal event or promotion, depleting all on-hand inventory. The available 'In-transit' of 2522 units is heavily polluted by 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost orders totaling 1,613 units: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24). Subtracting these ghost units leaves a real pipeline of 909 units (P27, P29, P32). However, P27 (1089 units) already arrived in P30, so the remaining 'real' pipeline consists of P29 (884 units) and P32 (25 units), totaling 909 units. Order P29 is now 5 periods old and overdue (arriving at L=3 or 4 usually), making its status precarious. Because on-hand is 0 and recent demand (P33) was extremely high, mu_hat must be inflated to force the OR backend to overcome the 'In-transit' barrier of 2522 units. I will use an explicit mu_hat calculated as (Actual Demand Mean * (1+L)) + Ghost Inventory to trigger a replenishment order. Demand mean for the high-season (P26-P33) is ~290. With an estimated L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 290) + 1613 = 2483. I will set L to 2 (promised) to keep the cap reasonable but use explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike in Period 33 (704 units), nearly 3x the previous high-season average. Total ghost inventory remains 1,613 units, causing permanent artificial inflation of the pipeline inventory.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016015' is experiencing a significant seasonal demand surge (Fall/Back-to-School), with a massive peak of 704 units in Period 33 and 397 in Period 34. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 384 units/week. Supply chain reliability remains a major issue: cumulative 'ghost' inventory from clearly lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24) totals 1,613 units. This inflated 'In-transit' figure prevents the OR backend from ordering enough stock. To circumvent this, I am using the 'explicit' method to set mu_hat. Following the logic (1+L) * forecast, and using L=2 (promised) and a forecast of 400 units/week to sustain the current peak, mu_hat is set to 1200. This value must be large enough to exceed the ghost inventory (1,613) + minimal on-hand (0) to trigger necessary replenishment orders. sigma_hat is also set explicitly high to handle the extreme volatility seen in Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility in late September (P33: 704 units). Current seasonal average (~400/week) significantly exceeds previous high-season estimates (~230/week). Total ghost inventory remains stagnant at 1,613 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand seasonal regime (averaging ~350 units/week over the last 6 periods). Recent actual lead times have been 2-3 periods, contrasting with the promised 2. A major replenishment order from Period 29 (884 units) has reached its 6th period in-transit without arrival and is now categorized as 'lost', joining the existing 'ghost' inventory. Total confirmed ghost inventory is now 2,497 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). With 0 on-hand and the OR backend seeing a massive (but fake) pipeline of 2,753 units, it will not place new orders despite the 350-unit weekly demand. To force replenishment, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to set a target that exceeds the ghost inventory plus 3 weeks of seasonal demand. This ensures the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation results in a positive order value to cover the current 350-unit demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Order P29 (884 units) is now 6 periods old without arrival and is considered 'lost'. Total ghost inventory estimated at 2,497 units. Demand regime (P30-P35) remains high, averaging ~360 units/week.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. As of Period 37, order P29 (884 units, placed P29) is 8 periods old and confirmed lost, increasing 'ghost inventory' to 2,497 units. The current 'In-transit' of 4,094 units is heavily dominated by these lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). Demand has transitioned from a sharp peak (P33: 704 units) to a high-but-declining post-peak regime (P34-P36 avg: 281 units). With 0 on-hand inventory and the backend's replenishment logic blocked by 4,094 units of (mostly non-existent) pipeline stock, I must use 'explicit' inflation for mu_hat. I target a base stock level that covers 3 periods (L+1) of demand at ~300 units/period (900 units), plus enough to offset the 2,497 ghost units. Total target pipeline: ~3,400 units. Since 'In-transit' is 4,094, the backend will not order unless mu_hat + z*sigma_hat exceeds that value. Given the critical stockout, I set mu_hat explicitly high (4,500) to force a replenishment order that accounts for both actual demand and the pipeline deficit created by missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Order P29 (884 units) confirmed lost (8 periods since order). Total ghost inventory now 2,497 units. Post-peak demand regime (P34-P36) averaging ~281 units/week.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a high-demand post-peak regime. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is approximately 371 units, though it shows high volatility. The supply chain remains severely compromised. We have a confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 3,381 units: P1(400), P3(63), P4(331), P10(242), P13(114), P14(237), P24(226), and P29(884) are all significantly beyond the promised lead time of 2 and the maximum observed lead time of 3. These 3,381 units will never arrive but are counted in the OR backend's pipeline, preventing new orders. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for a 3-period lead time (L=2 promised + 1 review period) using the recent mean of 371: Base Stock = (3+1) * 371 = 1484. To force an order despite the 3,381 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 1484 + 3381 = 4865. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation results in a positive order value to replenish our zero on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Order P29 (884 units) confirmed lost after 8 periods of non-arrival. Total cumulative ghost inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29) is now 3,381 units. Current demand regime (P33-P37) fluctuates around a mean of 371 units/week.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (early November), the supply chain remains highly unreliable. Order P37 arrived in just 1 period, while orders P34 and P36 remain in-transit beyond their promised L=2. Total in-transit inventory is 4,455 units, but 3,381 units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). These lost units artificially block the OR backend from placing new orders because it perceives a massive pipeline. Demand has settled into a high-season regime, averaging ~324 units over the last 6 periods (P33-P38). To bypass the pipeline barrier and trigger necessary replenishment, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it high enough to offset the 3,381 ghost units plus cover projected demand for the review and lead period (L+1=3). Specifically, target base stock = (3 periods * 324 mean) + 3,381 ghost units + safety stock (~1.5 * sigma), totaling approximately 4,600. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the erratic actual lead times (ranging from 1 to 3+).

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed at 3,381 units as of P38. High-season demand regime (P33-P38) sustains an average of 324 units/week despite significant volatility (peaks over 700).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), we are in a high-demand regime driven by the fall/winter season for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' SKU. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 293 units. Recent successful deliveries (P36 and P37 orders) show lead times of 3 and 1 periods respectively, confirming high supply chain volatility. The 'ghost' inventory from historically lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29) total 3,381 units. Current 'In-transit' of 3,167 is entirely comprised of these ghost units and recent orders P38/P39. Specifically, In-transit (3,167) minus Ghost (3,381) results in a negative effective pipeline, meaning the OR engine's 'inventory position' (on-hand + pipeline) is seen as much higher than reality. To force a replenishment order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the on-hand (1438) and the ghost-polluted pipeline. I will set mu_hat based on the recent average of 300 units/week multiplied by (1+L). With L expected to be around 2-3, I will target a mu_hat that overcomes the 3,167 ghost units. By seting mu_hat=4500, I ensure the backend triggers a net order to maintain stock for the upcoming winter weeks.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed at 3,381 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). Demand regime (P34-P39) has stabilized at ~293 units/week with high volatility. Supply lead times remain erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the demand is in a post-peak seasonal phase, appearing to stabilize around a mean of 290-300 units per week following the late September/October volatility. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a cumulative total of 3,381 'ghost' units in the pipeline (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29) which will never arrive. The OR backend's inventory calculation (On-hand: 1178 + In-transit: 3169 = 4347) is severely inflated by these ghost units. To prompt the backend to place necessary replenishment orders, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to artificially overcome the 3,381-unit phantom pipeline. Since current on-hand is 1,178 and the ghost inventory is 3,381, the backend 'thinks' there are 4,559 units available. To trigger an order for a target base stock that accounts for the real demand (approx 300 units/week) + a safety buffer, I will set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the current inflated pipeline perception. Over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), demand averaged 274 units. I will set L=3 to account for the erratic lead times (observed between 1 and 3 periods recently) and set mu_hat to 4,200 (approx 1050 per period over L+1) to ensure the system maintains stock despite the pipeline pollution. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for recent spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-16.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized into a late-autumn regime, with the last 5 periods (P37-P41) showing a mean of 283 units/week. While late-September saw a spike to 704 units, the current trend is more moderate. The supply chain remains erratic: recent lead times have been 1, 3, 2, and 4+ periods. Specifically, order P38 (361 units) is now 3 periods overdue and has not arrived. Ghost inventory is a massive issue; the 'In-transit' figure of 3,348 units is heavily polluted by lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29 totaling 3,381 units). Because the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock, it will not place any new orders unless the parameters are artificially inflated to overcome the ~3,381 ghost units. To ensure inventory continues to flow as we approach December, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a target that accounts for both the 283 unit/week demand and the 3,381 ghost-unit barrier. My target base stock is (Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory = (283 * 3) + 3381 = ~4230. I set mu_hat explicitly to provide the necessary headroom for the OR backend's capped policy to function despite the pipeline pollution.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly erratic (1-3 periods). Ghost inventory total confirmed as 3,381 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). Demand regime (P37-P41) stabilized at ~283 units/week with reduced variance compared to the September peak.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd, entering the peak holiday shopping season for denim/trousers. Period 42 saw a significant demand spike to 598 units, which is double the recent average (~283). Looking at historical data, we observed a similar spike in late September (P33: 704 units), suggesting high volatility and potential seasonal peaks. The cumulative ghost inventory remains at 3,381 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29), while the actual 'In-transit' consists of P38 (361 units), P40 (2 units), and P41 (232 units), totaling 595 units. Current on-hand is 390 units. Lead times have recently been 1-3 periods. To handle the high volatility and potential December peak, I'm setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the high-regime demand while using explicit sigma_hat to account for the massive variance seen in P42. I will use 'explicit' for L=2 to reflect the recent average lead time and avoid under-ordering during this critical window.

Carry-over insight: December seasonal demand spike detected: Period 42 demand reached 598 units (+110% vs P37-P41 average). Actual lead time continues to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season. Period 42 showed a significant demand spike (598 units), which retracted in Period 43 (131 units), a common pattern as consumers wait for final holiday sales. Forecasted demand for the remaining periods (44-47) is expected to be high due to Christmas and year-end shopping. Cumulative 'ghost' inventory of 3,381 units remains in the 'In-transit' field (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29), which blocks the OR backend's capped policy from placing new orders unless parameters are artificially inflated. Lead times remain erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, so I will continue to assume an effective lead time (L) of 2. I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that offsets the ghost inventory while accounting for high holiday demand (~400 units/period * (L+1)). Calculation: (Ghost 3,381) + (Forecast 400 * 3) = 4,581. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the ghost units in the pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has shown significant seasonal volatility: a peak in September (~700), a stabilization period through November (~260-290), and a recent December surge (Period 42: 598). The last two periods (43, 44) saw demand dip to 131 and 171, but with only two weeks left in the simulation, we must ensure enough stock for potential year-end clearance or final spikes. Lead times continue to be highly erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P41 arrived in 2, P40 in 3). The most critical issue is the 'In-transit' of 4341 units, which includes 3381 'ghost' units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). These are confirmed lost as they are several months overdue. The backend OR engine sees these as pending arrivals and will not order enough unless we artificially inflate the demand parameter (mu_hat) to offset the ghost pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 'explicit' at 4800 to ensure the backend recognizes a high target stock level relative to the inflated pipeline, effectively forcing a replenishment order if needed. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile 1-3 period reality. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the high variance of the late-year demand shifts.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 23, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant spike around early December (P42), followed by a return to moderate levels (~160-170 units) in the last two weeks. Based on retail apparel cycles, we are post-holiday peak but may see clearance demand or steady baseline traffic. Lead times remain erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P37: L=1, P39: L=3, P40: L=3, P41: L=2). Cumulative 'ghost' inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29) total 3,381 units. The In-transit figure of 4,667 includes these ghosts plus recent orders: P44 (1227 units) and P45 (326 units). These recent orders are within the delivery window. Because the OR backend subtracts the 3,381 ghost units from my target inventory, it perceives a surplus and will not order. I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock target, effectively offsetting the ghost inventory (3,381) and adding the desired safe stock for the current demand regime. I estimate a forward weekly demand of ~200 units. For L+1 = 3 periods, targeting ~600 units of real inventory + 3,381 units to bypass the ghost bloat = 3,981 units. I use 'calculate' for L and 'default' for sigma to maintain statistical sensitivity while forcing the order through mu_hat.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on December 30th, the end of the calendar year and following the peak December demand (which reached 598 units in Period 42). Demand has recently softened to an average of ~148 units over the last 3 periods as the holiday peak subsides. Lead times remain erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, though recent successful arrivals (P39, P40, P41) arrived within 2-3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 4667 units is heavily distorted by ghost inventory. Total ghost inventory is estimated at 3381 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). Subtracting this from 4667 yields an effective pipeline of 1286 units (largely comprised of the P44 order of 1227 units and P45 order of 326 units). With on-hand inventory at 49 units, the immediate stockout risk for the upcoming period is high if P44 doesn't arrive. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the post-holiday demand level (~235 avg) and use an explicit L of 3 to account for the erratic supply chain behavior observed in recent months, ensuring the backend base-stock calculation remains sufficiently high to trigger replenishment if the real pipeline (excluding ghosts) is low.
