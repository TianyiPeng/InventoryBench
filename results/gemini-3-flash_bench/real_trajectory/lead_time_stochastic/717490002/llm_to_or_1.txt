Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 717490002 (Jersey T-shirt). The starting on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks ranges from 35 to 42, with a mean of 39.4. Given the product is a jersey T-shirt and we are entering mid-February, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly increase as spring approaches. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand baseline (39.4). The backend will multiply this by (1+L)=3 to set the base stock. No lead time data is available yet, so I will stick with the 'default' promised lead time of 2.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a jersey basic T-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (45 units) placed in Period 1 is still in transit (promised lead time is 2, so it should arrive in Period 3). Demand in Period 1 was 32, which follows the historical trend (Jan-Feb samples: 42, 40, 35, 42, 38). Given the historical mean (~39.4) and the current stockout, we need to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. The OR backend will calculate base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since demand is relatively stable, I will use all available historical samples (5 pre-game + Period 1 = 6 samples) using the default method to establish a robust baseline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. In Periods 1 and 2, we ordered 45 units each, totaling 90 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase, so it is not yet visible in 'On-hand' at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for this 'Cat Tee' (Divided Basics) has been around 39-40 units (samples: 42, 40, 35, 42, 38). However, observed demand in P1 (32) and P2 (51) shows some volatility and a slight upward trend. Since we currently have 0 on-hand and have lost sales in P1 and P2 due to starting with 0 inventory, we must ensure the OR parameters cover the 2-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=3). Average demand of all samples (including P1/P2) is approx 40. With L=2, mu_hat should be around 120. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (samples: 35, 42, 38, 32, 51) to capture the recent spike while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat will use the default calculation to account for the increased variance seen in P2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a Jersey Basic T-shirt. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~39 units/week. Recent in-game demand (Periods 1-3) has trended upwards (32, 51, 61), likely due to seasonal warming in March for apparel. Promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (45 units) was expected to arrive in Period 3 (conclude) if lead_time=1 or Period 4 if lead_time=2. Since Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, and we are now at the start of Period 4, the P1 order is likely arriving DURING Period 4 (visible in Period 5). We are currently stocked out (on-hand=0) due to lead time lag and initial stock of 0. Total in-transit is 137 (45+45+47). I will use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the upward trend (avg ~48), and explicit L=2 matching promised lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 4 to account for the increasing volatility observed in the last three weeks.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a jersey T-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 4 arrival (45 units) was immediately consumed by demand (47 units), resulting in 2 units of lost sales. From the 'Period 4 conclude' message, we observed that the order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2), which matches the promised lead time. Currently, 141 units are in transit (orders from P1, P3, and P4). However, notice that the order from Period 1 (45 units) has not yet arrived by Period 4 (it should have arrived in Period 3 if L=2). This suggests a possible lost shipment or a lead-time delay for the P1 order, while the P2 order arrived on time. Demand has been increasing: 32, 51, 61, 47 (avg 47.75). The pre-game samples (42, 40, 35, 42, 38) averaged 39.4. There is a clear elevation in demand in the recent 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand parameters to capture this higher mean (~48) and volatility. I'll stick to the default promised lead time of 2 for now, as the P2 order arrived correctly, but I will monitor the missing P1 shipment.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a Jersey T-shirt. Historical demand samples (Period -5 to 0) were [42, 40, 35, 42, 38] with a mean of 39.4. Observed demand since Period 1 has been [32, 51, 61, 47, 44], mean = 47.0. There is a clear upward shift in demand compared to the pre-game samples, likely due to the transition into Spring. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 178 in-transit. Regarding lead time: the Period 1 order (45 units) has not concluded and is likely lost or significantly delayed (it should have arrived in Period 3 or 4). However, the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. Period 3's order (47 units) should have arrived in Period 5 but didn't, and Period 4's order (49 units) is expected now in Period 6. Because of the missing Period 1 shipment and the delay of the Period 3 shipment, the system is stock-extracting. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the higher contemporary mean (~47) and use 'explicit' for lead time L=3 to account for the observed delays and increase the safety buffer (base stock) to cover the pipeline gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 2: mean increased from ~39 to ~47 (+20%) as Spring approaches. Supply chain instability noted: Period 1 shipment (45 units) is likely lost; Period 3 shipment is delayed.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a jersey T-shirt, which is entering peak spring seasonality. Demand shows significant volatility with a recent spike to 84 units in Period 6. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 57.4 units, representing a clear upward shift from the initial baseline of ~40. Regarding the supply chain: The Period 1 order (45 units) is now 6 periods old and definitively lost. The Period 3 order (47 units) is overdue (promised L=2, now at period 4 since order) and remains in-transit. The Period 4 order (49 units) is also in-transit. Interestingly, the Period 5 order arrived in just 1 period. To manage this uncertainty, I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed lead times (2 and 1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the elevated demand regime (avg ~57) while preventing over-reaction to the single spike of 84. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to account for the increased variance (range 44-84) observed in the recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~40 to ~57 (+42%) since Period 2. Period 1 shipment (45 units) is confirmed lost. Significant lead time variability observed (range 1-2 periods, plus overdue shipments).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8 (April 1). The product is a Cat Tee (Jersey Basic), which is seeing a significant seasonal demand spike as spring progresses into summer. Historical demand samples (Period 1-7) show a clear upward trend: 32, 51, 61, 47, 44, 84, 150. The jump to 150 in Period 7 is a massive outlier relative to earlier data but aligns with the transition to warmer weather for apparel. I am currently out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. The Period 1 shipment (45 units) is definitely lost. The Period 3 (47 units) and Period 4 (49 units) shipments are overdue. Total in-transit is 219 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (average demand ~93) to capture the recent spike while tempering the extreme P7 value, and use an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect actual delays and ensure the target inventory level is high enough to recover from current backlogs once shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand spike confirmed for April: Period 7 demand was 150 units, reflecting a shift to summer peak demand for jersey basic tees. Periodic shipment losses and delays (P1 lost, P3-P4 overdue) necessitate higher safety stock levels.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a jersey basic tee, currently entering peak spring/summer demand. Historical demand shows a massive regime shift: Period 7 (150 units) and Period 8 (118 units). Mean demand over these two peak periods is 134. Period 1, 3, and 4 shipments are confirmed lost or significantly overdue (P1: 45, P3: 47, P4: 49 units), meaning 141 units in the reported 'in-transit' (322) are phantom inventory and will likely never arrive. Effective pipeline consists only of P8 (181). On-hand is 0. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand period while accounting for unreliable supply, I am setting mu_hat explicitly based on the recent average of ~134 units/period across (L+1)=3 periods (total 402). Sigma_hat is set high to reflect seasonal volatility and supply risk. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to weight actual arrivals (1-2 periods), as the promised 2 is currently the upper bound of successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Integrity Alert: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (total 141 units) are likely lost/phantom inventory. Seasonal demand for jersey tees has stabilized at a high-volume regime (avg ~134 units/period) for April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are in the peak spring/early summer season for jersey T-shirts. Historical demand for the last three periods (Periods 7-9) has averaged approximately 110 units (150, 118, 64), showing high volatility. The 'In-transit' quantity of 501 units is highly misleading because it includes 141 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed/highly likely lost (P1 ordered 45, P3 ordered 47, P4 ordered 49). Consequently, the OR backend's inventory-on-hand + pipeline calculation will overestimate current coverage, leading to under-ordering despite a zero on-hand balance. To compensate for this 'phantom inventory' and maintain service levels during peak demand, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to increase the base stock calculation (covering the review period + 3 lead periods) and 'explicit' mu_hat set to 520, which targets a forecast of ~130 units per period for 4 periods (1+L). This ensures the order logic maintains enough pressure to refill the stock despite the pipeline noise.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Integrity: Shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (total 141 units) are confirmably lost/indefinitely delayed, causing persistent stockouts due to phantom 'In-transit' inventory. Demand regime remains in high-volatility peak-season (Avg ~110 over last 3 periods).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (April 22), continuing the high-volume season for jersey basic tees. Demand has stabilized after the initial April 1st spike (150 units), showing 64 and 66 units in the last two periods. The rolling 3-period average is ~65 units. Inventory management is complicated by 'phantom' in-transit units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (total 141 units) which are confirmed lost but still occupy part of the OR engine's pipeline calculations. However, we recently received a massive inflow of 360 units (from P8 and P9), resulting in 294 units on-hand. With demand around 65-70, these 294 units cover ~4 periods of stock. I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to represent the conservative promised lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the stabilized post-spike demand (~65/period * (1+L) = 195). Given the recent stockout history followed by this oversupply, I'm setting sigma_hat to explicit at 85 to ensure the OR engine maintains a safety buffer that accounts for the phantom inventory drag and potential lead-time variability (observed 1-2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Stabilized high-season demand confirmed: After the early April peak (150), demand has averaged 65 units/period over the last 3 periods (P8-P10). Pipeline integrity remains compromised by 141 units of phantom inventory from P1, P3, and P4.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we are transitioning from the peak April demand for Jersey Basic Tees towards May. Demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P8-P11) with an average of 81 units per period (64, 66, 76, and P8's 118 which was constrained by stockout). Current on-hand inventory is 218 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 303 units includes 141 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are confirmed lost/phantom inventory. Subtracting these, the real pipeline is 162 units (ordered in P10). Total real inventory (On-hand 218 + Real In-transit 162) is 380 units. With L=2, the base stock should cover 3 periods. Using a mean of 75 units/period (reflecting the recent post-peak average), required stock is roughly 225 units. Since 380 > 225, no new order should be placed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent evidence (N=4) to reflect the post-peak regime and use L=2 to account for observed lead time variability, ensuring the OR backend correctly calculates the surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift Post-April Peak: Demand has stabilized at an average of ~81 units/period (P8-P11) following the early April spike. Real pipeline verified at 162 units (P10 order), while 141 units (P1, P3, P4) remain confirmed as phantom inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6, 2019. The 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' has moved past its early April peak (150 units) and has stabilized in a post-peak spring/summer regime. Over the last four periods (P9-P12), demand has been 64, 66, 76, and 76, averaging 70.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 142 units. The 'In-transit' count of 303 units includes 141 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P1, P3, and P4) and one valid order of 162 units from P10. Since the P10 order (162 units) is expected to arrive during P13 (lead time 2-3), the true pipeline is effectively just that P10 order. The OR backend uses (Base Stock - Pipeline), so the 141 phantom units in the backend's 'In-transit' view will cause it to under-order. To compensate and ensure we maintain stock for May's demand (~71 units/period), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom inventory. Target Base Stock for (L+1=3) periods should be (3 * 71) = 213 units. However, because the backend thinks we have 141 units that don't exist, I will inflate mu_hat. mu_hat = (Target Base Stock + Phantom) = 213 + 141 = 354. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the current demand standard deviation (~7) scaled for L+1.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), we are in a post-peak seasonal phase for 'Jersey Basic' T-shirts. Demand has significantly cooled from the April highs, averaging 64.25 units over the last 4 periods (P10-P13). The 'In-transit' balance of 303 units consists of 162 units from P10 and 141 units from P1, P3, and P4 which are confirmed phantom inventory. Since phantom inventory remains in the OR engine's 'pipeline' calculation indefinitely, I must adjust mu_hat upward to force the engine to place a new order once we hit a safety threshold, or use the explicit method to bypass the phantom inventory distortion. However, with 103 on-hand and 162 real units in transit (P10 order), our true total coverage is 265 units, which covers ~4 weeks of current demand. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will use a calculated average. mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to reflect the current post-peak demand regime (~64/week). Sigma_hat is calculated on the same window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: Average demand since mid-April (P10-P13) has dropped to ~64 units/period, down from the peak of 150. Pipeline Correction: Real pipeline inventory is 162 units (from P10); 141 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/phantom.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), we are in a post-peak stabilization phase for this jersey t-shirt SKU. Recent demand (P10-P14) has averaged ~62 units/period (66, 76, 76, 39, 54), which is significantly lower than the early-April peak of 150 but higher than the initial February baseline. The pipeline inventory includes 141 units (from P1, P3, P4) that are now confirmed lost/phantom as they are far beyond the promised 2-period lead time. Only the P10 order (162 units) and subsequent orders are relevant. With 49 units on-hand and 162 units in the real pipeline (141 phantom = 303 total in-transit - 162 real), we are well-covered. To account for the phantom inventory in the OR backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger replenishment if needed, while acknowledging that the lost units will continue to bloat the 'pipeline' calculation. mu_hat is set using N=5 to capture the recent stable downward trend (avg ~62) for the 3-period window (1+L=3).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization confirmed (P10-P14): Mean demand has decreased to ~62 units/period from the early-April high of 150.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16 (2019/5/27), the SKU 717490002 has hit a stockout (ending on-hand 0). The demand regime has stabilized post-April peak (P10-P15) with a mean of approximately 62 units/period. The current in-transit (pipeline) of 303 units consists of 162 units from P10 and 141 units of confirmed phantom inventory (P1, P3, P4). Since phantom inventory subtracts from the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must compensate for the 141 'missing' units by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat significantly higher than actual forecasted demand. Specifically, to offset the 141 phantom units and cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~186 units), the base stock needs to be around 327. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 280 (roughly 141 + 139) to trick the backend into ordering enough to replenish the stockout while accounting for the lost shipments that will never arrive. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-2 periods).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), we are in early summer. The carry-over insights and historical demand show that after a mid-April peak (150 units), demand stabilized into a post-peak regime. However, Period 16 showed a sudden jump in demand to 108 units, possibly marking the start of a sustained summer heatwave or a fresh seasonal push for 'Jersey Basic T-shirts'. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' of 321 units is heavily inflated by 141 units of confirmed phantom inventory (from P1, P3, and P4), which the OR backend mistakenly counts towards the service level. To compensate for this 141-unit pipeline deficit and the recent demand spike, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I calculate the target mu_hat based on the recent average demand (approx 65-70 units) over the (L+1)=3 period window, but I 'force' an order by setting mu_hat high enough to overcome the 141 units of phantom inventory. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) generates a non-zero order to replenish the zero on-hand stock. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the increased volatility seen in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased dramatically in Period 16 (108 units) compared to the preceding 5-period average (~62), suggesting a possible early-summer demand surge for t-shirts.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 10, entering the peak summer season for jersey T-shirts. Period 16 and 17 demands (108 and 84) confirm a significant demand shift upward from the May average of ~62. Period 17 ended with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity is 407 units, but 141 of these (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed phantom/lost shipments, leaving a real pipeline of 266 units (162 from P10 and 104 from P17). The P10 order (162 units placed April 15) is now severely overdue (9 periods), strongly suggesting it is also lost or significantly delayed. To ensure availability during the summer surge, I will treat the P10 order as phantom/lost and focus on the recent demand regime. Using the last 2 periods (P16-P17) mean demand of 96, I set mu_hat for the (L+1) window (3 periods) at 288. Sigma_hat is set explicitly higher to account for both the recent demand volatility and the high stockout risk caused by pipeline unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Order from Period 10 (162 units) is now 9 periods overdue and likely lost, bringing total phantom inventory to 303 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Summer demand surge confirmed: P16-P17 average demand is 96 units, up ~55% from May levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), the SKU (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a summer demand surge. Average demand over the last three periods (P16-P18) is ~88 units, significantly higher than the May average of ~62. Current On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 407 units is highly misleading due to 'phantom inventory': orders from P1 (45), P3 (47), P4 (49), and P10 (162) are 9-18 periods overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 303 units. The only valid pipeline inventory is the P17 order (104 units). To compensate for the OR engine's belief that 407 units are coming, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to a level that forces a substantial order, effectively overriding the phantom inventory. I estimate demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) at approximately 270 units (90 units/period). To trigger an order despite the 407-unit phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 650 units (current demand 90 * 3 = 270, plus the 303 phantom units to 'neutralize' them in the OR logic). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P16, P17) show a mix of 1 and 2 periods, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture current summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand surge for jersey t-shirts confirmed: June average demand is ~88 units/period (+40% vs May). Total phantom inventory reached 303 units (P1, P3, P4, P10 orders), requiring manual mu_hat inflation to bypass OR pipeline logic.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (June 24) is in the peak summer demand season for soft jersey t-shirts. Current demand reflects a high-volume regime (last 4 periods average ~91 units). The primary operational challenge is the significant quantity of phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' pipeline. Specifically, orders from P1 (45), P3 (47), P4 (49), and P10 (162) total 303 units that have not arrived and are well beyond any reasonable lead time (10-19 periods). Because the OR backend subtracts these 303 phantom units from the target base stock, it will under-order or fail to order entirely unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset them. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock calculation: (Avg Demand 91 * (L+1)) + Safety Stock (~1.5 * StdDev). Using L=2, the base stock should be roughly (91 * 3) + 1.5 * 20 = 303. To force the backend to place an order when it already thinks 303 units are coming, I must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - 303' equals the desired order (approx 100-150 units). Thus, mu_hat = ~450+.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), we are in the peak summer season for jersey t-shirts. Demand has remained consistently high, averaging 94.7 units over the last five periods (P16-P20). However, the system is severely handicapped by 303 units of phantom inventory (P1, P3, P4, and P10) that are indefinitely lost but still calculated in the OR backend's 'In-transit' figure. This phantom inventory prevents the backend's capped policy from placing sufficient orders. To bypass this, I must explicitly set mu_hat at a value that forces the base_stock calculation high enough to trigger an order despite the 303 phantom units. With an expected weekly demand of ~95 units and a (L+1) horizon of 3 periods, the required coverage is ~285 units. Including the 303 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to 650 (explicit) to ensure the backend identifies a deficit. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P16) suggest the supply chain is functional for new orders despite the historical losses.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand sustained: June/July demand average confirmed at ~95 units/period. Phantom inventory remains at 303 units (P1, P3, P4, P10 orders), necessitating explicit mu_hat inflation for the remainder of the peak season.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490002 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in its peak summer season. Period 21 saw a massive demand spike to 393 units, likely a July holiday event, although the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is approximately 151 units. The replenishment system continues to be severely impacted by phantom 'In-transit' inventory. We have 303 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10) and orders from P17 (104 units) and P19 (252 units) have not yet arrived. The backend OR engine subtracts this entire 'In-transit' figure from the target base stock, preventing new orders. To force an order and maintain service levels during the July peak, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target. Calculation: 3 periods of coverage (L+1) * 150 units/period = 450 units. To bypass the ~700 units of pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat to 1300. This ensures the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation remains positive. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility of the current peak period.

Carry-over insight: July peak demand spike confirmed: P21 demand reached 393 units, with a 5-period average (P17-P21) of ~150 units. Phantom inventory remains a critical constraint; orders P1, P3, P4, P10 are long-lost, and recent large orders (P17, P19) are currently late or in a volatile delivery window.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-July peak summer season for jersey T-shirts. Period 21 and 22 demand (393 and 264 units) confirm a massive seasonal spike. The 5-period average demand (P18-P22) is approximately 187 units/period. The pipeline is heavily compromised by phantom inventory: orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10 (total 465 units) are confirmed as lost. Additionally, orders from P17 (104 units) and P19 (252 units) are significantly overdue (7 and 4 periods respectively), further increasing likely phantom inventory to 821 units. With a current In-Transit of 1352, the 'real' pipeline is estimated at 531 units (mostly from recent large orders in P21-P22). To force the backend to place necessary orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' count, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target stock level: (L+1) * 200 demand = 600 units. To offset 821 phantom units and ensure the OR logic continues to ship, I will set mu_hat to 1500 (approx 821 + 600 + buffer for volatility).

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand spike reinforced: P21-P22 average demand is ~328 units. Total phantom inventory has reached 821 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19 orders), requiring extreme mu_hat inflation to counteract phantom pipeline logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $787.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 conclusion shows a massive arrival of 693 units (from P21 and P22), bringing on-hand inventory to 619. This finally clears the long stockout period. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1219 is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory: P1(45), P3(47), P4(49), P10(162), P17(104), and P19(252). These 659 units are significantly overdue (P19 is 5 periods overdue) and are likely lost. The OR backend subtracts the full 1219 pipeline from its base stock calculation; to prevent the backend from stopping orders due to this ghost inventory, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the required inventory level. Current demand is in a summer peak (July 22nd), though Period 23 saw a dip to 74 units after a huge 393/264 spike. Based on a 5-period average (approx 188 units/period), the required 3-period coverage (L+1) is ~564 units. By setting mu_hat to 1200, I ensure the OR engine sees (1200 - 1219 + 619) \u2248 600 units of target stock, effectively bypassing the phantom pipeline and maintaining a healthy safety buffer for the remainder of the summer season.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Integrity Crisis: Total phantom inventory has reached 659 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19 are long-lost). This prevents the OR backend from ordering unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset the 1219 units currently listed in 'In-transit'. Demand remains in a high-volatility summer peak regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. We are in the mid-summer high season for jersey basic t-shirts. Demand has been extremely volatile, peaking at 393 in P21 before settling to 264 in P22, 74 in P23, and 128 in P24. The 4-period average for July is ~215 units/period. The pipeline integrity remains the primary concern: the system shows 1219 units 'In-transit', but historical reconciliation confirms that orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and P19 (totaling 821 units) are indefinitely delayed or lost, leaving a 'real' pipeline of ~398 units. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 491 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the target stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 821 phantom units and ensure the base stock levels remain high enough to cover the end of the summer season. Total target inventory should cover (L+1) periods of demand (~215 * 3 = 645 units). To override the backend logic subtracting 1219 units, I set mu_hat to 1350 units (roughly (L+1)*450). Lead time is set to 2 to reflect the promised window, as P21 and P22 arrivals confirmed shipments can still arrive within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand persists with high volatility: July average demand is ~215 units/period. Total phantom inventory remains at 821 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19), requiring substantial mu_hat inflation until these units are purged or the season ends.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 26 (August 5, 2019). We are transitioning out of the July peak demand for jersey t-shirts. Demand in Period 25 was 99 units, confirming a cooling trend from the mid-July spikes (>300 units), with a recent 3-period average (P23-P25) of ~100 units. Pipeline Integrity: The 'In-transit' count is 1271, but history shows massive gaps. Lost shipments include: P1(45), P3(47), P4(49), P10(162), P17(104), and P19(252). Total confirmed 'phantom' inventory = 659 units. Real pipeline is primarily the P23 order (560 units) and P25 order (52 units). Current on-hand is 392. To allow the OR backend to place an order despite the 659 phantom units, mu_hat must be set as: (Expected Demand per period * (L+1)) + Phantom Units. Assuming lead time L=2 and expected demand of 90, we need mu_hat to cover ~270 real units + 659 phantom units = 929. Setting mu_hat to 950 via explicit method to ensure the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a non-negative order if needed, while sigma_hat is set to 50 to reflect high seasonal variability.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (August): Demand has stabilized to ~100 units/period (P23-P25) following July spikes. Updated Phantom Inventory: 659 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19) remain lost/undelivered and are distorting the OR pipeline logic.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (mid-August), the summer peak demand for jersey t-shirts appears to be tapering off, leading to a more stable demand regime. Period 26 demand was 227 units, but the multi-period average since late July (P24-P26) is approximately 151 units, significantly lower than the July peak which saw individual weeks hit 393. Inventory health is currently strong with 725 units on-hand after the arrival of the Period 23 order (560 units). However, the system still carries 659 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory from long-lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19) which masks actual needs. To prevent the OR backend from failing to order in future periods due to this phantom pipeline, I am maintaining an explicit mu_hat that covers the current demand regime (~151 units/period). This ensures the base stock (approx 3 * 151 = 453 plus safety stock) stays relevant against the real stock levels. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the recent 3-period arrival from Period 23, helping the system adjust for recent delivery variability.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization (August): Demand regime has shifted from extreme July peaks to a mean of ~150 units/period (P24-P26). Phantom inventory (659 units from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19) remains a persistent distortion to the pipeline logic.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), the demand regime for soft jersey t-shirts has stabilized following the extreme mid-summer peaks. Demand over the last four periods (P24-P27) was 128, 99, 227, and 91, averaging approximately 136 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 686 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 659 units remains entirely composed of phantom inventory (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19), which are long-lost. Because on-hand inventory is currently high and demand is stabilizing for late summer, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the current demand mean (~136 units/period). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data to reflect the post-peak volatility. No new orders are expected or required this period given the current surplus on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization (August): Demand regime has narrowed to approximately 136 units/period (P24-P27). Phantom inventory (659 units from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19) remains a persistent distortion to the pipeline logic.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the Jersey Basic T-shirt demand has transitioned from extreme July peaks into a more stable August regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is approximately 145 units, despite recent weekly variations (128, 99, 227, 91, 82). Currently, on-hand inventory is healthy at 604 units. However, there is a massive 'In-transit' figure of 659 units. These consist of orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and P19 which are long-lost/phantom inventory. Because the OR backend subtracts this pipeline (659) from the target base stock, it will prevent any new orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to cover the phantom units. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculating it to provide approximately 3 periods of safety cover (using the recent mean of ~145) PLUS enough to offset the 659 phantom units. Target base stock is approx (3 * 145) + 659 = 1094. Since the on-hand is 604, this setting should allow for a defensive order or maintain a safe buffer as we exit the peak summer season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in August at approximately 145 units/period (P24-P28). Phantom inventory remains at 659 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19), requiring explicit mu_hat inflation for the OR engine to account for pipeline distortion.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (Sept 2, 2019), the demand for jersey basic t-shirts is transitioning out of the high-volatility summer peak. Demand in Period 29 was 193, following a monthly stabilization around 145 units/period in August. On-hand inventory is healthy at 411 units. The critical issue remains the 660 units of phantom 'In-transit' inventory (from long-lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19), which prevents the OR backend from triggering new orders. To maintain availability as we enter September, I must manually inflate mu_hat to overcome this pipeline distortion. Recent demand average (P25-P29) is ~138 units. With L=2, base stock needs to cover 3 periods (~414 units). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (411 on-hand + 660 phantom = 1071) from the base stock calculation, I set an explicit mu_hat of 1200 to ensure the backend recognizes a need for stock if current levels drop further, while accounting for the phantom load.

Carry-over insight: September transition: August demand stabilized at ~145 units/period. Phantom inventory remains at 660 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19), requiring explicit mu_hat inflation to bypass OR pipeline logic.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31 (Sept 9), we are transitioning from the peak Summer season. Demand in the last two periods spiked significantly (193 and 223), raising the August-to-date average. The current 'In-transit' of 980 units includes a confirmed phantom inventory of 660 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19), which will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this phantom pipeline, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. Following the logic: (Effective Demand) * (L + 1) + (Phantom Units). With L=2, and a current demand regime estimated at ~150 units/period (reflecting recent volatility), the required base stock is roughly 150 * 3 + 660 = 1110. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen in the last 5 periods (91, 82, 193, 223, and earlier samples).

Carry-over insight: September demand remains volatile following an August average of ~150 units. Phantom inventory remains static at 660 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19), continues to distort pipeline logic.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32 (Sept 16), demand for jersey t-shirts remains relatively high and volatile as we transition from summer, with the most recent demand at 135 units. The primary challenge remains the OR backend's 'In-transit' logic: there are 1,126 units listed in-transit, but 659 of these (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 17, 19) are effectively lost/phantom. The active/real pipeline consists of orders from P29 (1 unit), P30 (320 units), and P31 (146 units), totaling 467 units. To ensure the backend places orders despite the 1,126 units of perceived pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat (target stock for L+1 periods) high enough to cover the phantom inventory PLUS the desired stock level. I am using a demand baseline of ~150 units/period (August/September average). For (L+1)=3 periods, we need ~450 units. Adding the 659 phantom units, the target mu_hat should be approximately 1,109 units. Setting mu_hat to 1,110 explicitly ensures the backend continues to replenish against actual localized demand while bypassing the phantom data. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand persists in a high-volatility regime following an August average of ~150 units. Total phantom inventory is confirmed at 659 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19), creating a persistent gap that requires explicit mu_hat inflation of ~660 units above the forecast to trigger replenishments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we are entering late September. Demand for jersey t-shirts has transitioned from extreme July peaks to a more stable but volatile August/September regime averaging ~160 units per period (last 4 periods: 193, 223, 135, 103). The current physical 'On-hand' inventory is 416 units. The 'In-transit' figure is reported at 768 units, but 659 units are confirmed 'phantom inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19). The real pipeline inventory consists of the order from Period 32 (108 units), which matches the reported 768 - 659 = 109 units (accounting for minor rounding or small residual orders). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 659 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the base demand forecast for 3 periods (L+1) as 160 * 3 = 480 units, and then add the 659 phantom units to neutralize the backend's deduction of that inventory, resulting in mu_hat = 1139. Sigma is set based on recent high volatility (standard deviation of ~58 units over the last 5 periods), leading to an explicit sigma_hat of 100 to maintain a high service level during this period of supply instability.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime remains volatile but has settled at a mean of ~160 units/period (P29-P32). Phantom inventory (659 units from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19) continues to be the primary driver for parameter adjustments.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (2019/09/30), we are entering the transition from September to October. Demand for jersey basic t-shirts remains relatively high but displays consistent volatility; the average demand over the last four periods (P30-P33) is approximately 158 units. The primary strategic challenge remains the 'Pipeline Integrity' issue. Historically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and P19 (totaling 659 units) have never arrived and are classified as phantom inventory. This phantom inventory artificially inflates the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR backend (currently 888 units, whereas the true reliable pipeline consists of only the P32 and P33 orders totaling 228 units). Because the backend calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', this 660-unit gap prevents necessary replenishments. To counteract this, I will keep mu_hat explicitly inflated. The target base stock should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand plus safety stock. At a mean of 160 units, base stock should be ~480 + safety. Given the 660 units of phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure the backend triggers an order to maintain on-hand availability as the current 244 units are depleted.

Carry-over insight: October transition: Late September average demand stabilized at ~160 units/period. Phantom inventory remains static at 659 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19), necessitating continued explicit mu_hat inflation of approx +660 units above the forecast to prevent stockouts caused by distorted pipeline logic.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019/10/7), the demand for jersey t-shirts is transitioning out of the summer peak and into the autumn season. Recent demand (P31-P34) has averaged ~125 units per period, which is lower than the late September mean of ~160. However, the supply chain remains compromised by 659 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19). These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (currently 1091), leading the OR backend to believe the pipeline is overstocked and preventing new orders. To counteract this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the actual replenishment requirement for the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) at ~375 units (125 * 3). To bypass the 659 phantom units and trigger an order to cover this demand plus safety stock, I inflate mu_hat to 1100 units. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: October transition: Demand regime has cooled to approximately 125 units/period (P31-P34). Phantom inventory remains confirmed at 659 units, requiring continued explicit mu_hat inflation to maintain a positive order flow.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (mid-October), demand for basic jersey t-shirts has transitioned from a volatile September mean (~160) to a lower October range (~80 units over the last 3 periods: P33-P35). Current on-hand inventory is 201 units. The In-transit figure of 993 units is heavily distorted by 659 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19) which are long-lost. Real pipeline components consist of orders P33 (120), P34 (203), and P35 (10). To ensure the OR engine places an order while correctly accounting for the 659 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the actual required stock level for the (L+1) horizon based on the recent October mean (~80 units/period * 3 periods = 240) and then add 659 to offset the phantom inventory distortion, resulting in 899. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently ranged between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime shift: Mean demand decreased to ~80 units/period (P33-P35) from the September mean of ~160. Total phantom inventory remains verified at 659 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory Status: On-hand is 296 units. Current in-transit is 863 units. Phantom Inventory: The carry-over insights and history confirm that orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and P19 remain undelivered (total 659 units). Only the order from P34 (203 units) is considered 'real' in-transit. Demand Analysis: We are in late October. Demand has clearly shifted from the summer/September peaks (~150-160 units) to a much lower late-autumn regime. The last three periods (P34-P36) saw demand of 93, 58, and 35 units respectively, averaging ~62 units/period. Strategy: To allow the OR backend to place orders despite the 659 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be inflated. The target 'real' base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand at the new lower rate (approx 3 * 65 = 195 units). However, to offset the 659 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 659 + 195 = 854. I will set mu_hat to 850 via 'explicit' to ensure the pipeline logic does not suppress necessary orders as demand continues to stabilize at this lower level.

Carry-over insight: Late October demand regime shift: Average demand has decreased to ~62 units/period (P34-P36). Phantom inventory remains confirmed at 659 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, late Autumn. Demand for this jersey t-shirt has entered a clear downward stabilization phase, with the last five periods (P33-P37) averaging ~83 units/period, and the most recent three periods (P35-P37) averaging ~50 units/period. The pipeline integrity remains distorted by 659 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19) which have never arrived. Current On-hand is 239 units, with a reported In-Transit of 863. Subtracting the 659 phantom units leaves a real pipeline of 204 units (from the order in P34). Given the current low demand regime (~50-60 units/period), the existing inventory (On-hand + Real In-transit = 443 units) is more than sufficient to cover the next several periods. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the October decline, and since the phantom inventory of 659 units still exists in the backend's 'Pipeline' logic, the OR backend would normally suppress ordering. However, because current stock is sufficient for the low-demand season, I will allow the 'default' logic to hold off on new orders for now while demand trails off.

Carry-over insight: Late October demand regime stabilization: Average demand has settled at approximately 60-80 units/period, significantly lower than the Summer/September peaks. Phantom inventory remains at 659 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current assessment for Period 39 (Nov 4): Demand has stabilized significantly as we move into November. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged approximately 58 units (93, 58, 35, 57, 53), which is a clear downward shift from the summer/September peaks. The phantom inventory situation remains critical. The 'In-transit' quantity of 863 units includes 659 units from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19) and the P34 order of 203 units which is now 5 periods old (exceeding the standard 1-3 period lead time). With On-hand inventory at 186 and a phantom pipeline of ~862, the OR engine's logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) will result in zero orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated. To maintain stock as we approach winter, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the phantom inventory and targets a safety cushion based on the current regime. Expected demand for (L+1) periods (3 periods) is ~180 units. To trigger a replenishment calculation that ignores the 863 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to 1050 (863 + 187). This should encourage the system to maintain current stock levels without over-ordering as the season cools.

Carry-over insight: November demand stabilization confirmed: Early November demand is averaging ~58 units per period. Phantom inventory has increased to 862 units (adding P34 order of 203 units to the previous 659 units) as deliveries continue to be inconsistent or lost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the demand for jersey t-shirts has stabilized in a late-autumn regime. Over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), demand has averaged approximately 48 units/period. The 'In-transit' pipeline currently shows 924 units, but historically, large segments of this inventory are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19 (totaling 659 units) and P34 (203 units) are significantly beyond the promised 2-period lead time, bringing total 'phantom inventory' to 862 units. Only the P39 order (61 units) is currently within a reliable delivery window. To ensure the OR engine places necessary orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculated the base requirement for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3) at the current demand rate (48 units/period * 3 = 144) and added the 862 phantom units to this target. This results in a mu_hat of 1006. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the current reduced volatility of the autumn season.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18), the product (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a low-demand late-autumn regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) has averaged 47.8 units, significantly down from summer peaks. On-hand inventory is 92 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 924 units remains severely distorted by phantom inventory. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19 (659 units) and likely P34 (203 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 862 phantom units. To ensure the OR backend places any necessary orders despite this 924-unit pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that covers (L+1) periods of actual demand PLUS the phantom inventory. Estimated weekly demand is ~50. Forecast for 3 periods (L+1) = 150. Total required mu_hat = 150 + 862 = 1012. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction logic and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility (~15 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom inventory confirmed at 862 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, and P34). Demand is stable in a Late Autumn regime, averaging ~48 units/period (P36-P40).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the jersey basic tee is currently in a stable late-autumn regime, with an average demand of approximately 64 units per period over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), despite a spike to 110 in P41. However, the system is reporting 902 units in-transit, which includes 862 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, and P34 that never arrived or are long overdue). Without manual intervention, the OR backend sees this pipeline and logic will prevent any new orders. To maintain service levels and trigger replenishments for the actual demand, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this phantom pipeline. Calculating required base stock: Target base stock for (L+1=3) periods should be approx 3 * 64 = 192. Adding the phantom inventory offset (862) results in 1054. I will set mu_hat to 1054 and sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent volatility (approx 30 per period, scaled by sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed phantom inventory remains at 862 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, and P34). Demand is centering around 64 units/period for the late-November window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $817.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we experienced a stockout (demand 162 vs on-hand 43) due to a sudden demand spike, likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday related, as the date was Nov 25. The current date is Dec 2. On-hand is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1097 units is heavily distorted by phantom inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, and P34 totaling 862 units). The 'Real' pipeline is likely just the Period 41 order (39 units) and Period 42 order (195 units), totaling 234 units. To trigger a replenishment and overcome the 862 phantom units in the backend's logic, I must inflate mu_hat. I estimate normalized December demand around 60-80 units/period, but I will explicitly set mu_hat to 1100 to ensure the backend places an order to cover the current stockout and upcoming holiday demand, despite the phantom inventory offset.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike confirmed for late November (P41: 110, P42: 162). Phantom inventory remains at 862 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P34), requiring continued mu_hat inflation to bypass OR pipeline calculation and address current stockout.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Dec 9), we are in the lead-up to the holiday season. Recent demand shows high volatility, with a spike in late November (P41: 110, P42: 162) followed by a drop in P43 (42). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is approximately 82 units. Our on-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' is 1209 units, but a large portion is confirmed phantom inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, and P34), totaling 862 units. Subtracting phantom units from the total in-transit leaves a 'real' pipeline of 347 units (Orders P42: 195 and P43: 151). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 862 units of phantom inventory blocking the pipeline logic, I must explicitly set mu_hat to cover both the anticipated holiday demand and the phantom inventory gap. With an expected demand of ~85 units/period and a lead time of 2, the required base stock is (1+2)*85 = 255. Adding the 862 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1117. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Real pipeline confirmed at 347 units (P42-P43). Total phantom inventory remains at 862 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P34), which continues to block normal replenishment logic.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (mid-December), we face a critical stockout context after a late-November demand surge (P41: 110, P42: 162). Current demand is stabilizing at approximately 40 units/period (P43-P44 average). The primary challenge continues to be the massive amount of phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' bucket. Specifically, 862 units (from orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, and now likely P34 which is 11 periods overdue) are long-lost. The OR engine sees 'In-transit' = 1249 units, which includes these 862 lost units plus real pipeline from P42 (195), P43 (151), and P44 (40). Because the backend subtracts all 1249 units from the base stock calculation, it will not place a new order unless mu_hat is inflated to exceed the phantom volume. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered for the current demand regime (~40/period) while accounting for the ~862 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to 1050 (Base Stock calculation: (1+L)*40 + 862). This overrides the pipeline logic to maintain flow during the final periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46 (Dec 23), we are in the Christmas/Holiday week. Demand in Period 45 was 51 units, consistent with the late-Autumn/Winter average of ~50-60 units observed outside of late-November spikes. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 295 units. However, we still face a massive 'In-transit' figure of 903 units, which includes 862 units of confirmed phantom inventory (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, and P34). The OR backend sees this 903 as real supply, which would normally prevent any new orders. To ensure we maintain stock for the post-holiday period, I must continue to explicitly set mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 950, which targets a total inventory position (On-hand + Pipeline) of ~950. Since the current perceived position is 295 (on-hand) + 903 (pipeline) = 1198, the capped policy will likely result in zero ordering this period, which is acceptable given the high on-hand stock and the 40 units from P44 still to arrive. I'm choosing Recent_N for sigma to capture the volatility seen during the late November peaks.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Phantom inventory remains confirmed at 862 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P34). Post-Christmas demand is expected to return to the late-season baseline of ~50 units/period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 (late December/early January transition). The jersey t-shirt demand has stabilized at a post-holiday baseline, averaging ~42 units/period over the last 3 periods (P44-P46). However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 903 units remains heavily distorted by confirmed phantom inventory. Historical analysis confirms that orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, and P34 (totaling 862 units) are permanently lost. The current 'real' pipeline consists of the P44 order (40 units) and perhaps small remnants, meaning the OR backend sees 903 units and will not order unless mu_hat is inflated. Current on-hand is 255. With a demand of ~42, we have about 6 periods of stock. However, to prevent the backend from stopping orders entirely once this buffer erodes, mu_hat must be set to cover (Baseline Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Inventory. Real mu_hat (126) + Phantom (862) \u2248 988. I will use 'explicit' to ensure the pipeline logic doesn't starve the inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Confirmed phantom inventory remains at 862 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P34). Demand has returned to a winter baseline of ~42 units/period (P44-P46).
