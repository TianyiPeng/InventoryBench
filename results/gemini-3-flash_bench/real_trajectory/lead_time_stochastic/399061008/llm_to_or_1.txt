Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for a Women's Slim Denim Jacket. On-hand and in-transit inventory are zero. Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows values: 9, 6, 16, 8, 14. The mean of these 5 samples is 10.6 and the standard deviation is 4.04. Given promised lead time (L) is 2, the total exposure period (L+1) is 3 units of time. As this is the first decision period, I will use a conservative estimate based on recent activity. The seasonality for denim jackets often peaks in early spring (March/April), so Feb 11 is slightly ahead of the peak. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand baseline (mean = 10.6, so mu_hat should target approx (1+2)*10.6 = 31.8). Setting L to 'default' as we have no historical lead time data yet to calculate drift.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's denim jacket, likely entering a spring seasonal uptick. In Period 1, we saw a demand of 30 units, which is significantly higher than the average of the five pre-game samples (avg: 10.6). We started with 0 inventory and ended with 0 because the first order (18 units) has a promised lead time of 2 periods and hasn't arrived yet. The pipeline inventory is currently 18. Given the high Period 1 demand (30) relative to pre-game samples, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat (N=5) to include the recent spike while maintaining some stability. For L, I will stick to 'default' as we have no evidence yet that the lead time differs from the promised 2 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a Women's Slim Denim Jacket. Historical data showed low demand in January (avg ~10.6), but recent demand in Feb has spiked significantly (30 in Period 1, 55 in Period 2). This coincides with late February, likely a seasonal transition to spring. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 45 units in-transit (orders from Period 1 and 2). With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order (18 units) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase, becoming visible in P4's start. Demand is trending upward rapidly; current mean over the last 5 samples is (9+6+16+8+14)/5 = 10.6, but the last 2 actual demand points are 30 and 55. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike (combining the last historical 14 with 30 and 55), while keeping L at 'default' (2) as we haven't confirmed any lead-time drift yet. The average of (14, 30, 55) is 33. The OR backend will use this to set a base stock that accounts for (1+L) = 3 periods of this elevated demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The current SKU is a Women's Slim Denim Jacket. Historical data provided shows low demand in January (avg ~10), but actual game performance in Feb shows a significant demand surge: P1=30, P2=55, P3=59. This likely reflects spring seasonality for light outerwear. On-hand remains 0 because the promised lead time L=2 means the order from P1 (18 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start view. However, it hasn't arrived yet (arrived=0 in P3 conclude). This suggests either a delay or that L=2 is just-in-time. I will use recent_N for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~50-60) rather than the historical average (~10). Given the high demand and 0 stock, I'll set L to 'calculate' to let the backend track the true arrival pattern when it finally reconciles.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected from historical ~10 units/week to ~50+ units/week starting P1 (Feb 2019); lead time L=2 is currently being tested as P1 order has not yet appeared in P3 conclude.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a women's denim jacket. Historical demand (Jan) was ~10.6 units/week, but since February, demand has shifted significantly to a higher regime (P1: 30, P2: 55, P3: 59, P4: 43), averaging ~46.75 units/week. This aligns with spring seasonality for outerwear. Regarding lead time: the P2 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=2), but the P1 order (18 units) has not appeared in any 'conclude' message. Given the promised lead time is 2, a P1 order should have concluded in P3. Its absence at the start of P5 suggests it is likely lost. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 117 units in transit (P3: 54, P4: 45, P5: ?). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will stick to the promised lead time L=2 (default) as the P2 arrival confirms L=2 is still the active operational speed, despite the P1 loss.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (18 units) presumed lost as of P5; Demand regime shift confirmed from ~10 to ~47 units/week (+370%) starting Feb 2019 due to spring seasonality.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/3/18), we are in a 'Womens Jacket' spring-season demand regime. Historical demand before Period 1 was ~10 units/week, but since P1, it has averaged ~46 units/week. P4 saw 27 units arrive (ordered P2, L=2), but the 18 units ordered in P1 are officially lost as they haven't appeared in 'conclude' messages by P5 (the P2 order already arrived, proving the pipe is active). Currently, on-hand is 0 with 141 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5). Given the profit/holding ratio (1:1), the critical fractile is 0.5. Since on-hand is 0 and we are missing a shipment, I will use a N=5 recent demand window to cover this new high-demand regime (mu_hat calculation). Lead time L=2 is confirmed by the P2-to-P4 transaction, so I will use 'calculate' to rely on observed data. Recent volatility is higher than historical, so sig_hat will also use recent_N=5.

Carry-over insight: Lost order confirmed: P1 order (18 units) never arrived even after P2 order (27 units) was delivered, indicating a structural loss for that specific shipment.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are managing a 'Jacket Slim' for women, which is experiencing high demand due to spring seasonality (February/March). Reviewing recent history: Period 1's order is confirmed lost (P2 arrived in P4 with L=2, P5 arrived in P6 with L=1). Current on-hand is 0, and we have missed substantial sales (sold 24 units against a demand of 70 in Period 6). The demand mean from the last 6 periods (Feb-March) is approximately 49.8 units/week, far higher than the ~10 units/week in January. Total pipeline inventory is 117 units (Orders from P3: 54, P4: 45, P5: 24, P6: 0, minus arrivals). Actually, looking at history: P1(18) lost, P2(27) arrived, P3(54) in-transit, P4(45) in-transit, P5(24) arrived, P6(0). Current in-transit of 117 matches P3 + P4 + P5_adjustment? No, 54(P3)+45(P4)+18(P1-lost-but-still-in-OR-pipeline)=117. Since P1 is lost but still registered 'In-transit' by the OR engine, I must set the base stock high enough to account for this ghost inventory. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the spring demand regime (avg ~50) and set L=2. Even though P5 arrived in 1 period, P2 arrived in 2; L=2 is the safer promise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P2 arrived in 2 periods, while P5 arrived in 1 period; P1 order remains lost and persists in the 'In-transit' count (18 units), which will suppress OR backend ordering unless parameters are adjusted.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: The product is a Women's denim jacket, and the date is April 1st. Period 7 saw a massive demand spike (272 units), likely driven by spring seasonality and promotional events. Lead time is volatile (L=1 to L=2). Critically, the Period 1 order (18 units) is confirmed lost, but it remains in the OR backend's 'In-transit' count. Total In-transit is currently 150 (P3: 54, P4: 45, P7: 33, P1: 18). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, the presence of the 18 lost units and the massive demand spike require an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure we order enough to meet peak spring demand. I will set L=2 (promised) to be conservative. For mu_hat, I will project (1+L=3) periods based on a demand forecast of ~200 units/period (reflecting the recent surge and seasonal peak), plus an 18-unit buffer to offset the lost P1 shipment, totaling 618. I'll increase sigma_hat explicitly to account for the extreme volatility seen in Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Massive seasonal demand spike confirmed Period 7 (272 units, +475% vs previous average); Demand regime shift from ~50 to ~200+ units/week starting April for spring seasonality.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/4/08). The product is a women's denim jacket, currently experiencing a massive seasonal demand spike. Recent demand in Periods 7 and 8 was 272 and 253 units, respectively, compared to the previous regime of ~50. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 2 to capture this 250+ units/week level. Note that the 18 units from Period 1 are confirmed lost but remain in 'In-transit' (In-transit total is 466, composed of P3: 54, P4: 45, P8: 349, and the lost P1: 18). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P7 arrived in 1, P5 in 1, P2 in 2). I will use 'calculate' for L. To ensure the OR backend orders enough despite the phantom 'In-transit' stock from P1 and the low cap (which uses a long-term average for mu), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to reflect the current high-demand reality (~250-260 units/week). For mu_hat (1+L)*mean, with L=1.5, I expect (1+1.5)*260 = 650. I will set a high sigma_hat to account for the sudden volatility and ensure a high service level.

Carry-over insight: April demand spike confirmed: average demand increased from ~50 to ~260 (+420%) spanning Period 7-8. Lead time is volatile (averaging ~1.5 periods but frequently 1).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (April 15) falls within the peak spring season for this women's stretch denim jacket. Historical demand confirms a massive shift starting Period 7, with demand jumping from ~50/week to an average of 229 units/week (Periods 7-9). Lead times are volatile; while the promise is 2, actual arrivals for Periods 5 and 7 were 1 period, and Period 2 was 2 periods. The Period 1 order (18 units) is confirmed lost, persisting in 'In-transit' and misleading the OR backend's inventory calculation. To compensate for the 18-unit phantom inventory and the extreme seasonal demand, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I forecast demand for the L+1 period (3 periods) at 230 units/week, totaling 690 units. Adding a buffer for the lost 18 units and high volatility, mu_hat is set to 710. L is set to 2 to reflect the promised lead time and provide a larger safety window given recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: April peak demand confirmed: Periods 7-9 average demand is 229 units/week compared to March average of ~50. Significant stockouts occurring due to rapid scaling. Lost P1 shipment (18 units) still affects in-transit visibility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/04/22) finds the SKU 'Jacket Slim' in the midst of its spring seasonal peak. Historical demand for the last few weeks (Periods 7-10) has been: 272, 253, 163, 169. The average demand during this April regime is approximately 214 units/week. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P7 arrived in 1, P8 arrived in 2, P9 arrived in 1). The P1 order of 18 units remains ghosting 'In-transit', which would normally cause the OR engine to under-order. With 364 units on hand and 177 in-transit (effectively 159 usable), we are currently well-stocked for the immediate period but must sustain coverage for the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high-demand April regime (avg ~214, total mu_hat for L=2 should be ~642). Using 'calculate' for lead time allows the engine to adapt to the 1-2 period volatility. These parameters ensure we maintain high availability while accounting for the recent stabilization of the demand spike.

Carry-over insight: April demand regime stabilized at approximately 214 units/week (Periods 7-10) following the initial late-March spike. Lead time displays persistent 'jitter' between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 12 (late April). The product is a women's denim jacket, which has experienced a significant seasonal demand regime shift starting in Period 7 (April seasonality), moving from an average of ~50 units/week to ~200 units/week. Recent observed demand (Periods 7-11) is 272, 253, 163, 169, 168, averaging 205. The spike has stabilized somewhat around 165-170 in the most recent three weeks, but the overall April average remains high. Lead times have been volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P7 arrived in 1, P8 in 2, P9 in 1). Additionally, the Period 1 order (18 units) is permanently lost but still resides in the 'In-transit' count of 279 (which includes P10's 60 units and P11's 102 units, plus the 18-unit ghost, and presumably the pending order from the OR backend). Because the backend OR logic subtracts pipeline inventory (including the lost 18 units) from the target base stock, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the forecast is high enough to compensate for this phantom inventory and the seasonal peak. I will set mu_hat based on (1+L) * average demand of the last 5 weeks (approx 205 units/week) and keep sigma_hat high to cover the volatility observed during the April transition.

Carry-over insight: April demand regime stabilized at ~205 units/week (Periods 7-11). Lead time volatility (1-2 periods) and the persistent 18-unit 'lost' shipment continue to impact inventory calculations.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399061008' (Denim Jacket) is in a high-demand spring season. Period 12 saw a stockout with demand (227) exceeding available inventory (196). Current on-hand is 0. The demand regime for the last 6 periods (P7-P12) has averaged 208.6 units/week. Lead time remains volatile between 1 and 2 periods (P10 saw both P8 and P9 arrive). A critical issue is the P1 order (18 units) which is permanently lost; it remains in the 'In-transit' count (419 units), misleading the OR backend into thinking there is more pipeline stock than actually exists. To counter this 'phantom' inventory and the persistent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the April/May demand level (~209/week), and explicitly setting L=2 (promised) to ensure the base stock calculation covers (L+1) i.e., 3 periods of demand. Using N=6 for sigma_hat captures the recent high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 7-12 average 209 units/week (\xb145). Inventory management is currently hampered by the 18-unit lost shipment from P1 still appearing in 'In-transit' pipeline data.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399061008' (Womens Denim Jacket) is in its peak spring season. Current date is mid-May. After a massive April spike (avg ~210 units/week), demand remains high but has softened slightly in the last two periods (168, 227, 141). The average demand over the last 7 periods (P7-P13) is approximately 195 units/week. Lead time is fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods. A critical factor is the persistent 18-unit lost shipment from Period 1 that still resides in the 'In-transit' accounting. Since the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline inventory' from the target base stock, this 'phantom' inventory causes under-ordering by exactly 18 units every period. To counteract this, I will set 'mu_hat' explicitly. I calculate the base stock requirement for a L=2 (promised) scenario: (L+1) * forecasted demand. Using a recent average of 200 units/week, (1+2)*200 = 600. To offset the 18-unit ghost inventory and provide a small buffer for volatility, I will set mu_hat to 620. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 1.7 * standard deviation of the high-demand regime to handle the high weekly variance (range 141-272).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for this denim jacket spiked significantly in April (averaging ~210 units) and has remained elevated through mid-May (P14 demand was 206). We are currently out of stock (ending inventory 0 for the last three periods) due to this high seasonal demand. The lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (P11 and P12 arrived in 2 periods). Crucially, the 18 units ordered in P1 have never arrived and are permanently lost; these units remain in the 'In-transit' figure on the OR backend, causing it to under-order by 18 units every period. To compensate for both the high demand and the phantom 18 units in pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target weekly demand is ~210; for (L+1) = 3 periods, this is 630. I will set mu_hat to 650 to account for the 18 lost units and maintain a buffer. sigma_hat is set based on the recent period volatility (approx 45 units/week) scaled to (L+1).

Carry-over insight: May demand remains high (approx 200+ units/week), extending the spring/summer seasonal peak beyond the initial April spike.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product (Womens Denim Jacket) is in its peak spring/early summer season. Demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime starting from Period 7 (late March). Average demand from Period 7 to Period 15 is approximately 205 units/week. We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) despite high demand (~200 units/week). The in-transit pipeline of 650 units includes a persistent 18-unit lost shipment from Period 1 (confirmed by multiple 'Period X conclude' messages where later orders arrived but P1 did not). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' inventory, I will set 'L' to an explicit 2.1 to slightly expand the base stock and use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the high-demand regime (P7-P15). Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, implying a critical ratio (target service level) of 0.5; however, given the stockout situation and high variance, capturing the recent mean and volatility is paramount for recovery.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a sustained high-demand season (Spring/Summer) for the 'Jacket Slim' (denim jacket). The current date is early June. Demand has stabilized into a high-level regime since Period 7 (April), averaging roughly 200 units per week. Specifically, over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), mean demand is approximately 191 units. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have significant in-transit stock (650 units). However, the 'In-transit' figure contains 18 units from a 'lost' Period 1 shipment which never arrived. To ensure the backend OR engine orders sufficiently, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 (to cover the 18 'phantom' units and general lead time volatility) and set mu_hat explicitly based on the recent 10-period regime (~191 units/week * 3 periods = 573). I will use a high sigma_hat to account for recent stockouts and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 7 at approximately 190-200 units per week; seasonal peak for denim jackets persists into June.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10) indicates we are in the middle of the summer season for women's denim jackets. The demand regime has remained stable at approximately 190 units/week since Period 7 (April). Specifically, the average demand from Period 7 to 17 is approximately 190.2 units. Recent periods (15-17) show demand values of 202, 209, and 141 respectively. I am using recent_N (N=11) to capture this April-June regime for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=11) to capture the higher volatility seen during this peak period. The promised lead time is 2, and while actual arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, 'default' is appropriate for L as the backend capped policy and baseline calculations rely on this. A critical factor is the 'lost' 18-unit shipment from Period 1 and another 54-unit shipment from Period 3 (which was never concluded) still bloating the 'In-transit' figure by 72 units. This artificially reduces the OR backend's order quantity. To compensate for this 72-unit phantom inventory and maintain a sufficient service level against the ~190 unit weekly demand, I am using mu_hat to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the actual demand and the phantom gap.

Carry-over insight: In-transit measurement error confirmed: 72 units (Ordered P1 and P3) are permanently lost and will not arrive, but remain in the pipeline count.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. This SKU (denim jacket) is in a sustained high-demand regime since April (Period 7), averaging approximately 188 units per week (Periods 7-18). Recent inventory levels have been insufficient to meet demand (stockouts in P15, P16, and P18). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 558 units is heavily distorted by 72 units confirmed lost (Period 1 and Period 3 orders) which remain in the pipeline count. To compensate for this 72-unit phantom inventory and ensure the OR engine actually places necessary orders to meet the ~190 unit/week demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculation mu_hat as (1 + Promised Lead Time) * Average Demand + Lost Units = (1 + 2) * 190 + 72 = 642. This forces the base stock level higher to account for the units the system thinks it has but doesn't. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility between 1 and 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for this denim jacket has remained High/Stable since the April seasonal shift, averaging approximately 181 units/week over the last 5 periods (P15-P19: 202, 209, 141, 163, 152). We are currently stocked out with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' count of 564 units includes 72 units from P1 and P3 that are definitively lost (confirmed in Carry-over Insights), meaning the 'true' pipeline is 492 units. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. To compensate for the 72-unit phantom inventory and maintain a base stock level sufficient for (L+1) periods of demand at ~185 units/week, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 627 (derived from 185 * (2+1) plus the 72 unit offset to force the OR engine to order despite the phantom stock). This ensures the backend targets a pipeline that accounts for actual demand and the measurement error in 'In-transit'.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 21 (July 1, 2019). Analyzing the demand history, we observe a sustained high-demand regime since late March (Period 7), driven by Spring/Summer seasonality for this denim jacket. From Period 7 to Period 20, the average demand is approximately 187 units per week. However, there is a slight cooling trend in June (Periods 18-20 averaging ~151 units). The OR backend calculation for order quantity is 'final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap)'. A significant issue is the 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit) parameter. As noted in historical insights, 72 units from early orders (P1 and P3) are permanently lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' count (currently 627 units). This false inventory suppresses the OR engine's ability to order sufficient stock. To compensate for this 72-unit phantom inventory and the expected lead time (promised L=2, recently jittering between 1-2), I will set mu_hat explicitly. My forecast for (1+L) periods (where L=2, so 3 periods total) at the recent average of ~150 units/week is 450 units. To offset the 72 units of 'lost' in-transit stock that the backend thinks we have, I will provide an explicit mu_hat of 522 (450 + 72). Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to ensure reasonable safety stock.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is July 8th (P22). Analyzing recent demand (P17-P21), we observe a decline from the peak spring levels (~200+ units) to a more moderate summer range of 127-163 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is approximately 144 units/week. Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (mean ~1.5). A critical constraint remains the 72 units (from P1 and P3) that are confirmed lost in previous Carry-over Insights but still populate the 'In-transit' pipeline (Total In-transit: 627, Real In-transit: 555). Additionally, the on-hand inventory is currently 0 with significant stockouts in recent periods. To compensate for the 'phantom' 72 units in the pipeline and provide a safety buffer for the 1-2 period lead time volatility, I will set mu_hat to explicitly cover the expected demand for the review and lead time periods (L+1 = 3 periods) based on the recent average of 144, while adding an adjustment to neutralize the 72 lost units that the OR backend incorrectly assumes are coming. Calculated mu_hat = (144 * 3) + 72 = 504. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of recent demand (approx 15) scaled for L+1, which is sqrt(3)*15 \u2248 26.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: July demand cooling from April/May peaks, stabilizing at ~144 units/week (P17-P21 average).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (July 15, 2019), we observe a continuing downward trend in demand for the denim jacket as summer progresses. Demand has declined from a spring/peak average of ~200 units/week to a July average of approximately 123 units/week (P20-P22). On-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline (In-transit) is 564 units. However, we have confirmed in prior periods that 72 units from P1 and P3 are permanently lost, though they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count. Subtraction of lost units implies an effective pipeline of 492 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the phantom inventory while acknowledging the demand cooling, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime (~120 units/week) and use an explicit L=3 to slightly cushion the 'lost' units' impact on the base stock calculation (base_stock = (L+1)*mu + buffers). This ensures the backend maintains a target level appropriate for the current demand while partially compensating for the visibility error.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: July demand cooling confirmed at ~123 units/week (Periods 20-22) from peak ~200 units/week in May/June.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399061008 (Denim Jacket) is currently experiencing a cooling phase following the spring/summer peak. Demand has stabilized at a lower level, with recent periods (P20-P23) showing demand of 138, 127, 104, and 111. The 3-period average (P21-P23) is approximately 114 units/week. Additionally, we have a significant measurement error in 'In-transit' stock: Period 18 insights and game history confirm that 72 units (from P1 and P3) are permanently lost but remain in the pipeline count (In-transit: 564 units). Since the OR backend subtracts the pipeline from the base_stock to determine the order, this 'ghost' inventory of 72 units must be compensated for by artificially increasing the mu_hat. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the next (L+1) periods despite the 72-unit undercount, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * forecast + 72. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 114 + 72 = 414. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime cooling: average demand for P21-P23 is ~114 units/week, down from May/June peaks of ~190-200. In-transit error remains at 72 units (P1, P3).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (late July), demand for the denim jacket is in a clear seasonal decline, cooling from the April/May peaks of ~200 units/week to a current average of ~114 units/week (Periods 21-24). In-transit inventory shows 564 units, but this includes a cumulative total of 126 units from lost shipments (P1=18, P3=54, and potentially P13=207, P14=96, P19=84 which are significantly overdue). Excluding the confirmed lost orders from P1 and P3 (72 units) and the likely lost orders from P13/P14/P19, the effective pipeline is much lower. Since the OR backend uses the provided 'In-transit' count (564) to calculate new orders (order = base_stock - pipeline), and 564 units is nearly 5 weeks of current demand, the backend will stop ordering entirely unless parameters are significantly adjusted. To force replenishment and account for the lost stock/declining demand, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent cooling trend (~104 units/week) and using explicit L=4. While L is technically 1-2 periods, using L=4 in the mu_hat calculation (3.14 * (1+4)) effectively increases the base stock target to a level that can overcome the phantom 'In-transit' units, ensuring some stock arrives for August.

Carry-over insight: Massive pipeline loss suspected: Orders from P13 (207 units), P14 (96 units), and P19 (84 units) are now multiple weeks past promised lead time; combined with confirmed losses (P1, P3), approximately 459 of the 564 'In-transit' units are likely ghost units that will never arrive.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399061008 is currently facing a critical situation with significant shipment losses. At Period 26, the reported 'In-transit' quantity is 564 units. However, based on the history, at least 459 of these units are 'ghost units' that are unlikely to arrive. These include: P1 (18 units), P3 (54 units), P13 (207 units), P14 (96 units), and P19 (84 units). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit) to calculate the order size (final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory), these ghost units are preventing the system from placing new orders, resulting in continuous stockouts (on-hand = 0 since P23). Demand has cooled from its spring peak of ~200 to a summer level of ~80-100 units/week (last 3 periods average 87.3). To force the backend to place an order despite the 564 'In-transit' units, I must set mu_hat (the basis for base_stock) to a value significantly higher than the false pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 800 (representing ~260 units/week for L+1=3) to clear the 564 unit hurdle and secure enough stock to restart inventory flow, targeting a summer baseline while compensating for the distorted tracking.

Carry-over insight: Massive pipeline failure confirmed: Orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, and P19 (totaling 459 units) have not arrived and are significantly past lead time; current 'In-transit' of 564 units is 81% 'ghost' stock, necessitating inflated mu_hat to trigger new orders.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399061008 (Denim Jacket) is experiencing a severe pipeline failure. As of Period 27, 'In-transit' shows 800 units, but historical analysis confirms a massive portion of these are 'ghost' units that will never arrive. Specific lost shipments include P1 (18), P3 (54), P13 (207), P14 (96), and P19 (84), totaling 459 confirmed lost units. Furthermore, no arrivals have occurred from orders in P20 or beyond, suggesting further potential losses or significant delays. Demand has stabilized in a lower late-summer regime; P23-P26 average demand is approximately 82 units/week. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (Order = Base Stock - In-transit), the inflated 'In-transit' count of 800 (of which 500+ are likely lost) prevents the system from placing necessary new orders. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to artificially inflate the target base stock to overcome this phantom inventory, aiming for a base stock that covers (L+1) weeks of demand (approx 82 * 3 = 246) PLUS the estimated ghost stock (~500+). Setting mu_hat to 1200 will force the capped policy to initiate a recovery order despite the phantom 800 units in transit.

Carry-over insight: Massive pipeline failure confirmed: at least 459 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19) are permanently lost. August demand regime stabilized at ~82 units/week (+/- 15) down from the spring peak of 200+. Current 'In-transit' count of 800 is unreliable due to >60% ghost stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation for SKU 399061008 is critical due to massive pipeline inventory failure. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 1200 units, but historical records indicate that at least 459 units (from P1, P3, P13, P14, P19) are permanently lost. Furthermore, orders from P26 (236 units) and P27 (400 units) have not arrived yet. Since the promised lead time is 2, the P26 order is expected in the current Period 28 (visible in P29 start), and P27 in Period 29. Demand has shifted from a spring peak of ~200 to an August average of ~82 units/week. However, the OR backend's capped policy will see 1200 units in transit and refuse to order any more units. To bypass this and ensure we receive actual stock to meet the 80+ units/week demand, I must set mu_hat to an extremely high explicit value. This compensates for the ~459 'ghost' units and any additional suspected losses in the pipeline, forcing the backend to place new orders. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1800 (triple the expected demand over L+1) to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the 1200 'In-transit' units.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline failure status: Current 'In-transit' of 1200 units is heavily comprised of 'ghost stock'. Confirmed lost: P1 (18), P3 (54), P13 (207), P14 (96), P19 (84) = total 459 units. Orders from P26-27 are currently within lead time but the overall pipeline reliability is extremely low.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim jacket entering late August (Period 29), where demand has stabilized to a lower volume (~70-80 units/week) compared to the spring peak. However, the system is facing a massive 'ghost stock' crisis. The 'In-transit' count of 1800 units is heavily inflated by at least 459 confirmed lost units (Periods 1, 3, 13, 14, 19). Furthermore, recent orders from P26 (236 units), P27 (400 units), and P28 (600 units) have not yet arrived, though they are within or just outside the promised lead time of 2. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and the backend subtracts pipeline inventory from its base stock calculation, the 1800 'In-transit' units are preventing the backend from placing sufficient orders to restart fulfillment. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to an explicitly high value that exceeds the phantom pipeline. Based on current demand (~75) and lead time (2), the true needs for (L+1) are ~225 units. Since pipeline is 1800, mu_hat is set to 2200 to counteract the ghost units and the 0 on-hand status, ensuring the capped policy still triggers reasonable replacement volume for the current late-summer regime while awaiting arrival of the August orders.

Carry-over insight: In-transit ghost stock estimated at ~459 units (confirmed P1, P3, P13, P14, P19) plus potential losses from P15/P16, making the total pipeline inventory metric highly unreliable (>50% error).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a massive inventory delivery failure. While promised lead time is 2 periods, multiple large orders totaling approximately 459 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19) are permanently lost. Furthermore, orders from P26 (236 units), P27 (400 units), and P28 (600 units) have not yet arrived, leaving current on-hand inventory at 0 despite a pipeline of 2200 units. The OR backend's 'cap' and 'base_stock' logic normally subtracts the pipeline (2200) from the target; since 2200 is far higher than any reasonable demand projection, the backend will refuse to order unless parameters are forced. I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the current contaminated 'In-transit' count to force a replenishment order that overcomes the 'ghost' stock. August/September demand has stabilized around 65-85 units per week, but to trigger a shipment through the OR backend pipeline logic, the mu_hat must be set to a level that accounts for the observed loss of over 1500 units in the pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 2600 (sufficient to cover the 2200 pipeline plus roughly 3 periods of actual demand at ~80 units/week) to bypass the capping logic and ensure units are ordered.

Carry-over insight: In-transit ghost stock significantly worsened; as of P30, no arrivals from P26-28 have occurred despite L=2 expectation. Estimated ghost/lost stock is now likely exceeding 1500 units of the 2200 in-transit, as demand for late August dropped to 40-65 units while total pipeline remains stalled.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, a massive delivery of 1000 units (from P27 and P28) arrived, confirming that the pipeline is not entirely broken but suffered from severe delays (L=3 for P27). However, multiple historical orders (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19) totaling 459 units are still confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 1600 includes these 459 'ghost units' plus orders from P26, P29, and P30. Current demand has dropped significantly from the spring peak (~200) and the August recovery attempt (~70) to a September low of around 40-45 units. With 957 units on hand and demand at ~43, we have over 20 weeks of stock. To prevent further overstocking and minimize holding costs while the backend 'In-transit' remains inflated by ghost stock, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (approx. 43 units/week) using recent_N=3. No new orders are needed.

Carry-over insight: In-transit ghost stock update: 459 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19) remain lost; P26 (236 units) is now 5 periods past order date and likely lost as well, bringing total ghost stock to ~695 units. September demand regime stabilized at ~43 units/week.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019), the system has successfully cleared its long-standing stockout following the arrival of P27 and P28 orders (1000 units total) in Period 30. September demand has stabilized at a much lower regime of ~41 units per week (P30: 43, P31: 39). On-hand inventory is currently very high (918 units), which at current demand levels covers over 20 weeks of supply. The 'In-transit' figure of 1600 units is still heavily corrupted by 'ghost stock' from historical losses (approx 695 units including P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, and now likely P26). However, because on-hand inventory is so high, the risk of stockout is zero, and the primary objective shifts to minimizing holding costs by preventing further orders. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low demand regime (approx 41/week) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation stays well below our current inventory level, effectively halting new procurement.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed September demand regime stabilization at ~41 units/week (P30-P31 actuals); Ghost stock in pipeline estimated at ~695 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P26) remains unresolved but less impactful due to inventory surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1234.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent arrival of 1,400 units (Period 30 and 32) has resolved the critical stockout, but has left the system with excessively high on-hand inventory (1,276 units) relative to current demand. The demand regime has stabilized in a 'post-peak' phase for this denim jacket, averaging ~41 units/week over the last three periods (P30-P32). While there are still 'ghost units' in the pipeline from earlier periods (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P26 - totaling approximately 695 units), the on-hand stock alone covers over 30 weeks of current demand. Therefore, the primary objective is to avoid any further ordering to minimize holding costs. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower demand level (N=3) to prevent the OR backend from triggering orders despite the unreliable (high) in-transit count. Lead time is set to calculate to reflect the recent return to ~2-3 period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime confirmed stable at ~41 units/week (P30-P32). Ghost stock persists (~695 units) but is currently offset by an inventory surplus of 1,276 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1176.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Slim Denim Jacket has stabilized in a low-seasonal regime for September/October, averaging approximately 44 units per week over the last four periods (P30-P33: 43, 39, 42, 50). The massive inventory influx from P30 and P32 has resulted in an on-hand balance of 1,226 units, which is significantly above the required base stock for the current demand level. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,200 units remains heavily contaminated by 'ghost stock' (confirmed losses from P1, P3, P13, P14, P19 totaling 459 units, and likely P26 totaling 236 units), but given the high on-hand surplus, these pipe errors are currently non-critical. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to match the current 44 units/week stabilization and leave L at default. No new orders will be triggered by the OR backend due to the inventory surplus, which is appropriate as we aim to reduce holding costs.

Carry-over insight: September/October demand regime confirmed stable at ~44 units/week (P30-P33). Ghost stock in pipeline (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P26) totals ~695 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jacket Slim' has stabilized at a lower level (~43 units/week) following the spring/summer peak. Period 34 demand was 38 units, and the average over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 42.4 units. We currently hold 1,188 units on-hand, which covers roughly 28 weeks of current demand. Additionally, There is a 1,200 unit in-transit pipeline, although a significant portion (~695 units from P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P26) is confirmed or highly likely 'ghost stock' that will never arrive. Even discounting the ghost stock, the remaining authentic in-transit units plus the massive on-hand surplus make additional ordering unnecessary. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 2-3 period lead time variability and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (~42 units/week). The OR backend will see the high inventory and correctly output a zero order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1152.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399061008 (Denim Jacket) is currently in a lower demand regime following its spring/summer peak. Demand for the last 6 periods (P30-P35) has averaged approximately 38 units per week (43, 39, 42, 50, 38, 18), with a notable drop to 18 units in the most recent period, possibly signaling the start of the late-autumn decline. The current on-hand inventory is 1,170 units, which is extremely high (nearly 30 weeks of supply at current rates). The pipeline 'In-transit' of 1,200 units remains heavily distorted by 'ghost stock' (confirmed losses: P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, and now likely P26 and P29, totaling ~1,100 units). Given the massive surplus of physical stock (1,170 units) relative to recent demand (~38), no new orders are required. I will maintain parameters that reflect the current demand level to ensure no new orders are triggered while we bleed off the excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: October demand cooling significantly, dropping to 18 units in P35 from a September average of ~43 units/week. Combined 'ghost stock' in pipeline now estimated at ~1,100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1106.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Denim Jacket (399061008) has entered a significant cooling phase as we move into late October (Period 37). Historically, demand peaked in Spring/Summer (April-June) at ~200 units/week, but has since dropped: September averaged ~44 units/week, and the first two weeks of October have dropped further to 18 and 32 units respectively (average 25). Modern inventory levels (On-hand: 1138) are extremely high relative to this current demand, providing over 40 weeks of cover at current rates. The 'In-transit' figure of 1200 units is heavily distorted by 'ghost stock' (confirmed losses from P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, and now likely P26 and P29), but this is currently irrelevant for ordering as we need to deplete the physical on-hand surplus to minimize holding costs. Parameters are set to reflect this lower demand regime (N=4) to ensure no new orders are triggered while we carry excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: October demand cooling confirmed: P35-36 average demand is 25 units/week, down from September's 44 (-43%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1092.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Slim Jacket (a seasonal outdoor item) has clearly transitioned from its spring/summer peak (~200 units/week) and its September stabilization (~43 units/week) into a late-autumn cooling phase. The average demand over the last three periods (P35-P37) is 24.3 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 1,115 units, which provides over 45 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,200 units remains heavily contaminated by 'ghost stock' from historical losses (approx. 1,100 units spanning P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P26, and P29). Regardless of pipeline accuracy, the massive on-hand surplus dictates a strategy of zero ordering. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3-period cooling regime to ensure the OR backend recognizes the lower demand profile, though the inventory level will prevent any new orders from being triggered for the remainder of the season.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed late-autumn demand cooling: average demand for P35-P37 dropped to ~24 units/week from the September average of 44 (-45%). On-hand inventory (1,115) significantly exceeds seasonal requirements.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 4, 2019. Demand for the 'Jacket Slim' (denim jacket) has undergone a significant seasonal cooling as we move late into autumn. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P35-P38) is approximately 21.5 units/week, a sharp decline from the September average of ~44 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 1,102 units, which is enough to cover the current demand regime for approximately 50 weeks. The OR backend's inventory calculation is still complicated by 'ghost stock' in the pipeline (confirmed lost: P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, and likely P26, totaling ~695 units). However, since on-hand inventory is already so excessive relative to the new lower demand, the priority is to stop all ordering and minimize holding costs. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 will reflect the current low-demand regime (~21 units/week), and since current inventory (1,102) is vastly greater than the resulting base stock, no new orders will be placed.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime shift: average demand for P35-P38 dropped to ~21.5 units/week, down 50% from September. Large inventory surplus (1,102 units) exists against declining seasonal demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11, 2019), the demand for denim jackets is in a late-autumn cooling phase. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) has dropped to approximately 20.4 units/week, a significant decrease from the September average of 44. The on-hand inventory of 1,086 units is extremely high relative to current demand, representing over 50 weeks of stock at current consumption rates. Although the 'In-transit' count of 1,200 is mostly comprised of confirmed 'ghost stock' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P26, and likely others), this is irrelevant for current ordering decisions because the physical on-hand surplus is so large. No new orders are needed. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime and prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders despite the pipeline 'ghost' units.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime shift confirmed: average demand (P35-P39) is ~20 units/week, down 55% from the September average of 44.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is November 18, 2019. Demand has shifted significantly from the spring/summer peak (~200 units/week) to a stagnant late-autumn regime. Over the last 6 periods (P35-P40), the average demand is 19.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 1,071 units, which is enough to cover approximately 55 weeks of demand at the current rate. There is also 1,200 units in-transit, although at least 695 units of this are confirmed 'ghost stock' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P26). Regardless of the status of the in-transit units, the massive on-hand surplus against low seasonal demand dictates that no new orders should be placed. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this low-demand regime and maintain a default lead time of 2, allowing the OR backend to identify that the existing inventory far exceeds the required base stock, thus resulting in zero orders and minimizing additional holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1041.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 42 (late November). Demand for the denim jacket has stabilized at a low late-autumn level, averaging approximately 18 units per week over the last 7 periods (P35-P41). Our current on-hand inventory of 1,056 units is extremely high, covering over 50 weeks of demand at the current rate. Additionally, there is a significant 'In-transit' count of 1,200 units. While much of this is confirmed 'ghost stock' (approx 1,100 units from periods P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P26, and P29), even the ghost stock being cleared wouldn't necessitate new orders given the massive overstock. Lead time remains variable but averages around 2. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders due to the high pipeline inventory and low demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the most recent demand regime (avg ~18), and sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect lower volatility. The high on-hand inventory relative to any realistic base_stock calculation will naturally result in zero recommended orders.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime stabilized at ~18 units/week (P35-P41), a 60% decrease from the September average of 44.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019. Demand for women's denim jackets is in a late-autumn/winter cooling phase. The most recent demand regime (P35-P42) has stabilized at approximately 21 units/week (geometric mean of 21.1), which is a significant drop from the spring/summer peaks of ~200. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,021 units, which covers approximately 48 weeks of demand at the current rate. There is also 1,200 units of 'In-transit' stock, although previous insights suggest at least 1,100 of these are 'ghost' units from historical losses. Given the massive inventory surplus and the holding cost of $1.0/unit, the primary goal is to avoid any further ordering while demand remains low. Parameters are set using a recent_N window (N=8, covering the start of the October cooling trend) to reflect the current low-demand environment, which will result in a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand levels, ensuring zero new orders are placed.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, and demand has significantly cooled as we move deeper into the winter season for this denim jacket. Over the last nine periods (P35-P43), demand has averaged 18.6 units/week, a sharp decline from the spring peak of 200+ and the September average of 44. On-hand inventory is currently 1,015 units, which provides over 50 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,200 units remains heavily inflated by 'ghost' units (confirmed lost shipments from early periods and failed arrivals from P26 and P29). Given the massive inventory surplus and declining seasonal demand, no new orders are required. The priority is to minimize holding costs by allowing the stock to deplete naturally. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (approx. 18 units/week) to ensure the OR backend does not trigger unnecessary replenishment against the unreliable pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime stabilized at approximately 18 units/week (P35-P43), reflecting a 59% decrease from the September average (44 units/week). Massive inventory surplus (1,015 units) exists against current demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 16th (P45). Demand for this denim jacket SKU has reached its seasonal floor, with P44 demand dropping to just 1 unit. This follows a steady decline from the spring peak (~200 units/week) to the autumn/winter regime (~18 units/week). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,014 units, which is sufficient to cover over 50 weeks of demand at the current rate (18 units/week). The 'In-transit' figure of 1,200 remains highly inflated by historical lost shipments ('ghost stock') totaling at least 1,100 units. Given the massive inventory surplus and the end of the year approaching, the goal is to prevent any more orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the low-demand winter regime (~16-18 units), while maintaining L at calculate. The high on-hand inventory relative to the base stock calculation will naturally suppress any procurement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: December floor reached; P44 demand dropped to 1 unit. Winter regime (P35-P44) average is now ~17 units/week. Massive inventory surplus (1,014 units) against seasonal low.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. Demand for women's denim jackets has entered a deep winter seasonal low, with the average demand over the last 10 periods (P36-P45) falling to approximately 17 units/week. P44 and P45 saw demand drop to 1 and 9 units respectively. On-hand inventory is currently 1,005 units, which provides over 50 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. There are 1,200 units in-transit, though carry-over insights confirm that at least 695-1,100 of these are 'ghost units' from lost historical shipments. Regardless of the ghost stock, the massive physical on-hand surplus means no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current winter regime using recent_N=10 to ensure the base stock calculation accurately mirrors the current low-demand environment, though no order will be triggered due to the high inventory level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-989.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a seasonal low during the winter months, with the most recent demand (P44-P46) dropping into the single digits (1, 9, 8). The demand regime for the last 5 periods (P42-P46) averages approximately 13 units/week. There is a massive on-hand inventory surplus of 997 units, which is enough to cover over a year of demand at the current rate. Furthermore, the 'In-transit' figure of 1,200 units remains heavily distorted by confirmed 'ghost stock' from multiple lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P26, and likely P29) totaling over 1,000 units. Given the extreme surplus and low seasonal demand for a denim jacket in late December/early January, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window (N=5) to reflect the current winter floor. No new orders are needed or will be triggered by the OR backend due to the inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor confirmed: P44-P46 demand averaged <10 units/week. Inventory surplus (997 units) remains extreme relative to early Q1 seasonal expectations.
