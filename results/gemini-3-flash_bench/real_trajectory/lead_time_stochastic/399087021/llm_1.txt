Period 1 actual demand was 127. The current average is around 112 units per period. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, I ordered 330 units. According to the timeline, an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives in P3 (visible in P4 start). Nothing arrived in P1 conclude, which is normal. d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 330 (ordered in P1). I am currently stocked out because the initial on-hand was 0 and the P1 order hasn't arrived. e) Sales & Safety Stock: I need to cover demand until the next possible delivery. An order placed now (P2) will arrive in P4. I need enough inventory to cover P2, P3, and P4. Expected demand for 3 periods (P2-P4) = 112 * 3 = 336 units. Since 330 are already in transit for P3, I need to ensure I don't stock out in P4 and maintain a safety buffer. Given Period 1 demand (127) was higher than the historical average, I'll aim for a target of ~130/week. 3 weeks * 130 = 390. I have 330 coming.

Inventory is currently 0, and we have missed sales for 3 periods. To recover and cover the lead time (L+1 = 3 to 4 periods of demand), I need roughly 400-450 units on hand/incoming. Current in-transit is 510, which exceeds this. However, until these shipments arrive, the store remains stocked out.

Regarding logistics: Order from P1 (330 units) is now 1 period overdue (promised L=2, now P5). Order from P2 (130 units) arrived in P4 (L=2).

The mean is approximately 101. Note the drop in Period 5 (demand 63) and Period 3 (77). I will forecast a base demand of ~100. c) Lead time analysis: Promised is 2. P2 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=2). P1 order (330 units) did NOT arrive in P3 as expected and has not arrived by the end of P5. This suggests the P1 order is lost. d) Inventory: On-hand is 0.

P3 order should arrive this period (P6), P4 in P7, and P5 in P8. e) Strategy: Since P1 is lost and inventory is 0, I am stock-out until P3 arrives.

Recent periods (P4-P7) showed a lower mean of ~60-70 units. Period 8 showed a significant drop to 17 units. While this could be a recording anomaly or a sudden drop in style popularity, I will forecast a 'safety' demand closer to the recent stable mean of 60 to avoid excessive stockouts while acknowledging the current surplus. (c) Lead time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2, actuals have been 1-2 periods. Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost as they are significantly overdue. (d) Inventory assessment: On-hand is 245 units. In-transit consists of P8 (120 units) and potentially lingering lost units (though we count total in-transit as 600 in the UI, we must be wary). Assuming P8 arrives, we have 245 (OH) + 120 (P8) = 365 available units.

These in-transit units consist of: 120 ordered in P30 (expected P32 conclude/visible P33) and 480 ordered in P31 (expected P33 conclude/visible P34).

To maintain a safety stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~100 units/period, I need roughly 300-400 units available or in the immediate pipeline. Since the current pipeline (600 units from the last two orders) already exceeds the 3-week demand requirement and I have 0 on-hand, I must avoid massive over-ordering which led to the high holding costs earlier in the year.

With 38 on-hand and 480 theoretically in-transit (some of which likely arrived but weren't logged, or are significantly delayed), any new order placed now (L=2) would only arrive in Period 46, leaving only 2 periods of sales. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the risk of extreme overstocking at the end of the game, I will place a conservative order to cover the gap if the in-transit units do not arrive. Since I have 38 units and expect ~30 demand for Period 44, I will have almost nothing left for Period 45. I will order 80 units to ensure coverage for the final periods while minimizing terminal holding cost risk.",

Period 45 (2019/12/16) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is ladies' super-skinny denim, which showed a significant demand spike (119 units) in Period 42 corresponding to late November/Black Friday. Since then, demand has returned to a lower stabilization regime (24-37 units/period) as we approach the late-December holiday peak and end-of-year clearance season. Today is December 16 (Period 45), and the simulation ends at Period 47. Based on current trends, I expect demand for the remaining 3 periods (P45, P46, P47) to be roughly 30-45 units per period. Currently, I have 1 unit on-hand and 80 units arriving (ordered in P44, likely arriving in P46 or P47). With lead times fluctuating between 1-3 periods, the P44 order is not guaranteed for P45. To prevent a stockout in P45-P46 and capture remaining demand before the simulation ends, I will place a conservative order. Total pipeline (OH 1 + IT 80) = 81 units. Expected total demand for P45-P47 is ~120 units. I will order 400 units to ensure service level through the end, though realistically only a fraction will be sold before P47 concludes. However, the cost of a stockout ($4 profit) vs. minimal inventory holding cost ($1) for only 2 more periods justifies a buffer.",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU '399087021' is a 'Super Skinny' denim item. Historical data shows significant seasonal shifts: high demand in Q1 and Autumn, and a severe trough in Summer. We are currently in Period 46 (2019/12/23), which is the final stretch of the fiscal year. Demand in December (Period 43-45) has stabilized around 24-37 units, though the current period includes Christmas/New Year, which can either see a last-minute spike or a drop. Currently, On-hand inventory is 0. There are 1,040 units in-transit: 80 from Period 44 (lead time 2 indicates arrival in Period 46) and 480 from Period 45 (lead time 2 indicates arrival in Period 47). Another 480 units were incorrectly placed in a previous period (likely Period 45) that are also in-transit. Since we only have one period left (Period 47 concludes the game), the 560 units arriving in Period 46 and 47 are more than sufficient to cover the remaining demand (~30-50 units). Ordering more now would only incur significant holding costs (1.0/unit) at the end of the game with zero chance of additional sales.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The current period is 47, which is the final period of the simulation. Period 47 concludes on 2019/12/30. In this simulation, any orders placed in the current period (N) arrive at best in the same period (if lead time = 0) or in future periods (N+1, N+2, etc.). Since arrivals occur after the decision phase and the simulation ends with the conclusion of Period 47, any units ordered now will not be available to satisfy demand in Period 47 (because demand resolution happens after arrival resolution, but arrivals for orders placed in Period 47 would only be visible/usable starting in Period 47 conclude, and no profit is gained from inventory remaining after the final period). Furthermore, the SKU currently has 1040 units in-transit from orders placed in Period 44 (80 units) and Period 45 (480 units), which already massively exceeds any possible demand for the final day. Ordering more would only incur additional holding costs or simply not arrive in time to be sold. Therefore, the optimal action is to order 0 units.",
