Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11) for SKU 399087021 (Ladies Denim). Historical demand from the previous 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 109 units (114, 94, 135, 102, 100). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory and in-transit units are 0. To provide sufficient inventory cover for the review period plus lead time (1 + 2 = 3 periods), I will use the mean of the available 5 historical samples. There is no clear seasonal trend yet to justify a more aggressive or conservative forecast, so I will apply the default method which utilizes all historical samples for the initial order to establish a baseline. The target service level (q) is 0.8 (4 / (4+1)), which the OR backend will calculate.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is ladies' super-skinny denim. Historical demand samples (Jan-early Feb) show a mean of ~109 units (std ~16.5). Period 1 actual demand was 127 units, which is slightly higher than the historical average but within a reasonable range (approx +1 std). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (136 units) has a promised lead time (L) of 2 periods, meaning it is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). We lost all sales in Period 1 due to 0 starting inventory. For Period 2, I will use all available samples (5 historical + 1 recent) to estimate demand. N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since no orders have concluded yet, I will stick to the default promised lead time (L=2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a denim product (super-skinny jeans). History shows a starting on-hand of 0 and demand around 113-127 units, resulting in stockouts because shipments haven't arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (136 units) should arrive during Period 3 (this period) and be visible in the next 'conclude' message. The order from Period 2 (139 units) should arrive during Period 4. Total in-transit is 275. Demand statistics from seed data (last 5 weeks) show an average of 109 units (114, 94, 135, 102, 100) with a standard deviation of approximately 16. Recent realized demand (Periods 1 and 2) is slightly higher (127 and 113), suggesting a demand level around 110-120. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to allow the OR engine to update as arrivals conclude, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture recent trends while maintaining stability.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is 'Ladies Denim Super-Skinny Jeans'. Historical demand for the first 5 weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) averaged 109 units. Since the simulation started, demand has been P1: 127, P2: 113, P3: 77. The average across all 8 available data points is 108. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 369 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the rules, an order placed in P1 with L=2 should arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in the P3 conclude message. However, the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests the actual lead time is likely 3 periods (with P1's order expected to arrive in P4 and become visible in P5). We are currently experiencing lost sales due to zero on-hand inventory. Increasing the base stock through a higher mu_hat and potentially explicit L to ensure future orders cover the lead time gap is necessary once the pipeline starts clearing.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (March 11, 2019). The product is super-skinny low-rise jeans. Looking at the history, the order from P2 arrived in P4 (lead_time = 2), which matches the promised lead time. However, the order from P1 (136 units) has not yet arrived or been explicitly concluded; it should have arrived in P3 (L=2) or P4 (L=3). Its absence suggests it might be delayed or lost. In-transit inventory is currently 324 (P1: 136, P3: 94, P4: 94). Demand history shows 127, 113, 77, 90, with pre-game samples around 94-135. Average demand is approx 105. Since on-hand inventory is low (49) and a previous shipment (P1) is potentially missing, I will set lead time to 'calculate' to let the backend process the realized L=2 from the P2 arrival, but use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the slightly lower recent levels (approx 90-100) compared to the initial 127-135.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is ladies' super-skinny denim (399087021). We are currently at Period 6 (2019/3/18). Looking at history: demand has been 127, 113, 77, 90, 63 across the first 5 periods. Demand appears to be softening slightly compared to the historical samples (114, 94, 135, 102, 100). Regarding lead time, the order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2 periods), which matches the promised lead time. However, the order from Period 1 (136 units) never arrived and is now 3 periods past its placement, suggesting it is a lost shipment. The order from Period 3 (94 units) should have arrived in Period 5 but did not. This indicates the actual lead time is likely higher than the promised 2 periods, or we are experiencing multiple delays/losses. Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 324 (sum of P1, P3, P4 orders: 136 + 94 + 94 = 324). Since P1 is likely lost, the pipeline is effectively smaller. To account for the delay observed in P3's order and the loss of P1, I will explicitly set L to 3 to increase the protection level. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (period demand avg ~94) to capture the current demand trend. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. The SKU is Ladies' super-skinny denim. Demand history: Jan(114, 94, 135, 102), Feb(100, 127, 113, 77), Mar(90, 63, 61). There is a clear downward trend in demand from an average of ~110 in Jan/Feb to ~70 in March, likely due to post-winter seasonal shifts or fashion cycle for this specific wash. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit consists of 413 units (orders from P1=136, P3=94, P4=94, P6=89). Order from P1 (lead time 2 promised) is now 4 periods overdue (should have arrived P3 conclude/P4 start), suggesting it may be lost. Order from P2 arrived on time (L=2). Order from P3 (due P5 conclude) and P4 (due P6 conclude) are also late or lost. Given the significant quantity in-transit (413) relative to recent demand (~70), the OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent excessive ordering. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the lower March demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For Lead Time (L), I will stick to 'default' (2) as we have seen one successful L=2 arrival, while treating current delays as potentially lost shipments rather than a permanent lead-time shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting March: Average weekly demand decreased from ~110 to ~71 (-35%). Shipments from P1, P3, and P4 are currently overdue, suggesting potential losses in transit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (women's skinny jeans) has entered a lower demand regime. The average demand for the last four weeks (P4-P7) is 67.75, compared to 105.7 during the initial weeks (P1-P3). This represents a shift consistent with early spring demand leveling off. Significantly, order arrivals are highly unstable. While the Period 2 order arrived as expected (Lead Time = 2), the orders from P1 (136 units), P3 (94 units), and P4 (94 units) are now 3+ periods overdue. Only the P6 order (89 units) is still within a 'normal' lead-time window. This suggests a high probability of lost shipments for P1, P3, and P4. The Backend OR logic uses 'pipeline inventory' (in-transit) to calculate orders; if the OR backend believes 413 units are coming while 324 of those (P1+P3+P4) are likely lost, it will under-order or stop ordering entirely. To compensate, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised and last successful lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the base stock levels remain high enough to trigger new orders despite the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. I'm choosing a mu_hat based on the recent average demand (approx 68) * (1+L) = 204. By setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent variance (std dev ~14), I ensure a buffer while avoiding excessive holding costs if shipments suddenly arrive.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Current on-hand is 72, with 324 units in-transit. A notable demand regime shift occurred in March: average demand dropped from ~110 to ~67.6 (last 5 periods: 63, 61, 57, 17, plus 90 from P4). However, the Period 8 demand was unusually low (17), possibly due to the timing of the arrival or a trend shift. Shipments from P1 (136 units), P3 (94 units), and P4 (94 units) are significantly overdue (promised lead time 2, now 5-8 periods later), confirming they are likely lost in transit as noted in carry-over insights. Only P2 and P6 orders have arrived. The pipeline inventory (324) includes these lost units; since the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, the presence of these 'ghost' units will prevent new orders from being placed even though we only have 72 real units. Based on the most recent 5 samples (mean ~58), I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*58 where L=2, totaling 174. Given the massive 'ghost' pipeline (324), the backend will order 0. To compensate and ensure we get stock once the 72 on-hand is depleted, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that exceeds the pipeline or account for the fact that demand is roughly 60-70 per week. However, under the current backend logic, the only way to force an order is to set mu_hat very high, but the cap mechanism will limit it. Given current stock of 72 and demand ~60, we are safe for 1 period. I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the lower demand regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/15. Analysis of the demand history shows a significant and continuing decline: Period 8 (17 units) and Period 9 (8 units) represent a very low demand regime compared to the early March average of ~71 and the initial Jan/Feb mean of ~110. This product (Super-Skinny Low-Rise Jeans) may be facing a seasonal dip as spring turns to summer, or a specific style trend shift. Shipments from Period 1 (136 units), Period 3 (94 units), and Period 4 (94 units) are now extremely overdue (9, 7, and 6 periods since ordering respectively), confirming they are likely lost in transit. However, orders from P2 and P6 arrived exactly with the promised lead time of 2 periods. Therefore, L is set to 'default' (2). mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent sharp drop (averaging ~36 units/period). sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility in this lower demand regime. The high in-transit figure (324) includes the 324 units from the lost P1, P3, and P4 orders; since the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, and it doesn't know these units are lost, it will likely not order more. However, with current on-hand at 64 and recent demand dropping to single digits, the risk of stockout is currently low despite the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: Weekly demand dropped further to an average of ~12 units (P8-P9) from the previous ~71 units. Total of 324 units from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost (surpassing 6 periods since promised arrival).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/22. Demand for this SKU has collapsed significantly following a peak in early 2019. The average demand across Periods 8-10 is 14.33 units, compared to ~71 units in March and >100 units in February. This appears to be a seasonal trend for these low-rise skinny jeans. On-hand inventory is currently 46 units, which is enough to cover over 3 periods of the current demand regime. Shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totalling 324 units) are definitively lost as they are more than 6 periods past their expected arrival; however, since these are already in 'In-transit', I must set OR parameters that reflect a very low demand expectation to prevent the OR engine from ordering more while it waits for those lost units to clear or for inventory to deplete. I will use the last 3 periods (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087021 (Ladies Denim Trousers) has shifted from a high-demand regime (~110-130 units in Feb) to a significantly lower demand regime starting in April. Demand for the last four periods (P8-P11) has been 17, 8, 18, and 6 units respectively, averaging ~12.25 units per week. This correlates with the transition out of the early spring peak. In-transit inventory includes 324 units from orders P1, P3, and P4 which are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time and have been flagged as lost in previous insights; however, since they haven't 'concluded', they technically remain in the pipeline calculation. To avoid the OR engine suppressing new orders due to these 'ghost' units, and to account for the current low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the April slowdown. I will keep L at 'calculate' as the only successful arrivals (P2 and P6) arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~12 units/week throughout April (P8-P11). Lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) still occupy pipeline inventory slots but are unlikely to arrive.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087021 (Ladies Denim) has stabilized at a significantly lower level since April (Period 8). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 13 units per week, compared to historical averages above 100. Additionally, orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 324 units) are over 9 periods delayed and are considered lost. However, these units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count, which suppresses new ordering due to the base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). With on-hand inventory at 24 and current demand ~13, we have roughly 2 weeks of cover. To ensure the backend doesn't prematurely stop ordering once on-hand drops further, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent 'low-demand' regime (avg ~13, std ~5.5). Since L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*13 = 39. sigma_hat = sqrt(3)*5.5 \u2248 9.5. This aligns the OR backend with the current market reality while the phantom 'lost' inventory continues to sit in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~13 units/week since Period 8. In-transit inventory of 324 units (P1, P3, P4) is confirmed lost but persistently occupies pipeline slots.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13, 2019. Demand for 'Ladies Denim Trousers' has significantly dropped and stabilized since early April (Period 8). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P8-P13) is approximately 11.5 units per week, compared to the initial 100+ units. On-hand inventory is 20 units, which covers nearly 2 weeks of the current demand level. The 'In-transit' quantity of 324 is composed of orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4, which are now more than 9 periods overdue and confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. However, the OR backend sees these 324 units as available pipeline inventory, effectively blocking new orders due to the 'base_stock - pipeline' logic. To overcome this and ensure the system maintains the correct safety stock for the current 12-unit demand regime, I am setting L to the promised 2 periods and mu_hat to 36 (i.e., (1+L) * 12). Since the backend subtracts the phantom 324 units from its target, no order will be placed yet, which is appropriate given we have 20 units on hand for a ~12 unit/week demand. As on-hand inventory depletes further, I will need to use 'explicit' values to force the backend to ignore the lost 324 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Super Skinny Low Rise Jeans' has stabilized at a low level since April (Period 8). The average demand over the last 7 periods (P8-P14) is approximately 11.0 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 12 units, which is sufficient for one period of demand. However, the system is burdened by 324 units of pipeline inventory (from P1, P3, and P4) that are confirmed lost. These lost units block the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an 'explicit' method. For L, I will use the promised lead time of 2. I will calculate mu_hat to cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand (3 * 11 = 33). To force an order despite the 324 lost units in the pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the pipeline plus desired safety stock. However, setting an extremely high mu_hat risks massive over-ordering if the backend cap logic is bypassed or if the lost units suddenly arrive. Given the current on-hand of 12 and demand of ~11, we are at risk of a stockout in Period 16. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost pipeline (324) plus 3 periods of demand (33), totaling 357, to signal the engine to maintain availability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of ladies' super-skinny jeans. The current date is May 27, 2019. Since Period 8 (April 1st), the demand has entered a sustained low-level regime. Over the last 8 periods (P8-P15), the demand values are [17, 8, 18, 6, 16, 4, 8, 7], averaging approximately 10.5 units per week. This is a significant drop from the ~71 average seen in March and the ~110 average in February. On-hand inventory is now 5 units. The primary issue remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 324 units from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost, but the OR backend see them as 'in-transit'. This prevents the backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. I must use 'explicit' values to bypass this. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the review+lead window is 3 periods. Total expected demand for this window is ~32 units (10.5 * 3). Including a safety buffer for the low demand variance, I set mu_hat explicitly to 32 and sigma_hat to 10. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) aims for ~40-50 units total. Since on-hand is 5 and the backend sees 354 in transit, the standard policy would order 0. However, by setting these parameters, I attempt to signal the necessary stock level for the current demand regime despite the pipeline distortion.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits two distinct demand regime shifts: initially averaging ~110 units (P1-P4), dropping to ~71 (P5-P7), and further stabilizing at a low-demand regime of ~10.4 units/week since Period 8. The most recent demand samples (P8-P16) range between 4 and 18, with the last 5 periods (P12-P16) averaging 8.6 units. Lead time analysis shows that of the total 354 units in-transit, 324 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost as they are now over 10 periods past their promised arrival. Only the order of 30 units placed in P15 is expected to arrive (likely in P17). Because the OR backend's 'cap' and 'base_stock' logic considers the total pipeline (354 units) against the target, it will likely not place any new orders if it perceives the inventory as 354. To counteract this 'frozen' pipeline caused by lost shipments, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the target stock or 'explicit' L to increase the buffer, however, the most effective way to force an order through a stuck pipeline in this specific OR-controller setup is to set a mu_hat that significantly exceeds the stalled pipeline inventory. However, given the real demand is very low (~11 units), and the order from P15 (30 units) is arriving, we actually have enough 'real' inventory soon to cover the next few periods (30 units / 11 units/week \u2248 3 weeks). Therefore, I will set mu_hat based on the current regime (N=9) to ensure we don't over-order once the P15 shipment arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in the low-regime (~11 units/week) since P8. Pipeline contains 324 units of permanent 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'S.Skinny L.W Epic' jeans has stabilized at a low regime since Period 8 (early April), with an average of approximately 10-12 units per week. The inventory situation is complicated by 324 'ghost' units in-transit from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are confirmed lost but still occupy pipeline slots in the OR engine's calculation. Because 'in-transit' (324) exceeds any reasonable base stock target for a 12-unit/week regime, the OR engine will refuse to place new orders. To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that exceeds the ghost inventory plus the desired safety stock. My target base stock is approximately 3 periods of demand (L+1) at ~11 units/week plus safety stock, which would normally be around 45-50 units. However, to force an order when on-hand inventory (25) is low and 'ghost' inventory is 324, I set mu_hat explicitly high. Period 15's order of 30 arrived on time (L=2), confirming the logistics channel is functioning for new orders. I will use a high explicit mu_hat to overcome the ghost inventory and maintain on-hand availability for the current stable demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). The demand for this SKU (super-skinny jeans) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 8, dropping from a historical mean of ~110 units/week to a low-stable regime of ~10 units/week (average since P8 is approximately 10.2). This low demand has persisted for 11 periods, confirming it as a sustained shift suitable for recent_N analysis (N=11). The lead time remains consistent at 2 periods (observed in P17 with the P15 order). A critical issue remains: 324 units from orders in P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost but are permanently counted as 'pipeline' or 'in-transit' by the OR engine. These 'ghost' units prevent the system from placing new orders because the base-stock calculation thinks the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I must set the mu_hat (target stock for L+1 periods) significantly higher than the actual expected demand to force an order through, or use the explicit method to override the bias. Since on-hand is 22 and demand is ~10/week, and we have an order of 29 in transit from P18 (expected P20), current stock is sufficient. However, to ensure the OR engine doesn't undersupply in the future due to the 324 lost units, I will set mu_hat to a level that accounts for the ghost inventory plus the desired safety stock.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a super-skinny women's denim jean. Since Period 8 (April), demand has settled into a very low, stable regime, averaging approximately 10 units per week (the last 5 periods show 8, 7, 8, 5, 3, 2). Current on-hand inventory is 49 units, which is sufficient for approximately 5 weeks of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 324 units consists of confirmed lost shipments from Period 1, 3, and 4; these units will never arrive but they prevent the OR backend from placing new orders because they occupy the pipeline inventory. To force an order when needed, one would usually need to artificially inflate mu_hat, but currently, with 49 on-hand and demand at ~10/week, no new order is required. The actual lead time seems to be 1-2 periods (most recent order from P18 arrived in 1 period). I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (3 periods * ~10 units/week = 30) and use recent_N to capture the low volatility. No action on 'ghost' inventory is needed this period as on-hand is high.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The demand regime for this SKU (super-skinny jeans) has stabilized at a very low level since Period 8 (April), averaging approximately 8.2 units per week over the last 13 periods (P8-P20). Recent demand has been even lower (0-3 units in the last three weeks), suggesting a seasonal lull or a shift in consumer preference. The 324 units in-transit from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost as they are more than 15 periods overdue. These 'ghost' units occupy the pipeline inventory in the OR calculation (pipeline_inventory = 324). Since current on-hand inventory is 49 units and the average weekly demand is ~8, we have over 6 weeks of stock available. Given the low demand and high 'ghost' pipeline inventory, no new orders are necessary. To prevent the OR backend from factoring in the 324 lost units as future supply, I will set mu_hat explicitly low to reflect the current regime and ensure that (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) remains below zero or the cap, keeping the order at 0. L is set to default (2).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087021 continues to be very low, following the regime shift identified at Period 8. Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand has been [5, 3, 2, 0, 1], averaging approximately 2.2 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 48 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next (L+1) periods. Additionally, the 'pipeline' inventory of 324 units consists of lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 that have never materialized and are considered 'ghost' inventory. Because the inventory on-hand (48) is already well above any reasonable base stock level calculated from recent demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data (N=14 to cover the low-demand regime since April) to prevent further ordering while the system works through the excess stock. No changes to lead time L are needed as recent successful arrivals (P17, P19) show lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087021 (Ladies Denim) is in a low-demand regime (~1-3 units/week) since Period 18, following a steady decline throughout April and May. Current inventory is 48 units on-hand, which is significantly higher than required to meet foreseeable demand (L+1 periods) even at the previous stabilizing average of ~11-13 units. A critical constraint is the 324 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory (orders from P1, P3, and P4) which have never arrived and are confirmed lost. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, these 324 units effectively prevent the system from placing any new orders. However, with current on-hand stock (48) and recent demand nearing zero (0-1 units per week in the last 4 weeks), there is no immediate risk of stockout. I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect the current very low demand (approx 1 unit/week) and keep L at default to maintain stability. The ghost inventory will remain a blocker for new orders until on-hand stock is exhausted, but given current demand, this stock will last for many months.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: Weekly demand has dropped further from ~11 to <1 unit (Avg 0.75 units over P19-P22).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (399087021) is currently in a very low demand regime (Period 19-23), with an average demand of approximately 0.8 units per week. This follows a significant drop from the previous regime (~11 units) that started in Period 8. The seasonality or lifecycle for this denim SKU appears to be winding down as we are in late July. Current on-hand inventory is 47 units, which is significantly higher than the projected demand needs for the next several periods (L+1). Additionally, the pipeline inventory of 324 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4. These 'ghost' units prevent the OR backend from ordering more because it believes the pipeline is full. However, given the current overstock relative to the negligible demand (0.8/week), the system should not place new orders anyway. I will set mu_hat to an explicit low value reflecting the current trailing 5-period average (approx 1.2 units per lead time cycle) and use recent_N for sigma to account for the low volatility. L is kept at default (promised 2) as actual lead times for successful orders have been 1-2 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Ladies Denim Super-Skinny jeans) has entered a very low demand regime since Period 19 (July), with demand averaging less than 1 unit per week (values: 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1). Current on-hand inventory is 46 units, which is significantly higher than any foreseeable demand given the current rate. Additionally, there are 324 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory from lost shipments in Periods 1, 3, and 4. Because the OR backend uses these 324 units in its inventory position calculation (base_stock - pipeline), it will naturally suppress ordering. However, even if those units weren't there, the extremely low demand (average ~0.83 over last 6 weeks) means no ordering is required. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture this near-zero demand phase. I will keep L at default (2) as recent arrivals (P17, P19) show lead times of 1-2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect low volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ladies Denim Super Skinny Jeans'. Demand has effectively collapsed to a near-zero regime (averaging 0.6 units/week since Period 19). With 45 units on-hand and a demand rate of less than 1 unit per week, the current inventory is sufficient for over 40 weeks of demand. Additionally, 324 units of 'ghost' inventory from Periods 1, 3, and 4 remain in the pipeline, which further inflates the pipeline position in the OR backend's logic. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, it is critical to prevent any further orders. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (N=7, covering P19-P25) to ensure the base stock calculation remains below current on-hand levels, thereby stopping replenishment.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 26 spiked to 44 units, contrasting with the extremely low demand regime (<1 unit/week) observed over Periods 19-25. This suggests a potential clearance event or a late-season surge for these 'super-skinny jeans'. Despite the historical average, we must address the persistent 324-unit 'ghost' pipeline (from lost shipments in P1, P3, P4) which prevents the OR backend from ordering. To force an order and maintain stock given the current on-hand of 1 unit, I am setting mu_hat to 400 (explicit) to exceed the pipeline inventory (324) + current on-hand (1). This ensures the base_stock calculation triggers a reorder to buffer against this new demand signal, while keeping sigma_hat moderate to acknowledge the volatility of this spike.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike at Period 26 (44 units), breaking the ultra-low regime (<1 unit) observed since Period 19. Ghost inventory of 324 units still persists in pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state where a significant demand spike of 107 units occurred in Period 27 (the highest since Period 3), following a 44-unit spike in Period 26. This indicates a potential late-August/Back-to-School seasonal surge for these 'super-skinny legs' denim trousers. Currently, on-hand inventory is depleted (0 units). The pipeline total is 421 units, but 324 of these are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) that will never arrive. Only the 97 units ordered in Period 27 are expected. To satisfy the new demand level (avg ~75 over the last two weeks), I must set mu_hat explicitly. I will forecast a weekly demand of 100 units for the next (L+1)=3 periods. Despite the 324 ghost units in the pipeline, the OR backend's capping mechanism (based on mu_hat) and the base stock calculation (mu_hat - pipeline) necessitates an 'explicit' mu_hat that is high enough to trigger a new order, effectively compensating for the lost inventory that the backend still counts as 'in-transit'. L is set to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand surge confirmed: Demand spiked to 44 units (P26) and 107 units (P27), likely related to late-summer/back-to-school transitions, ending the ultra-low regime observed since P19.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal surge (confirmed by Period 26: 44, Period 27: 107, Period 28: 104 units). The product, super-skinny low-rise jeans, is experiencing a typical back-to-school/late-summer peak in late August. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have missed sales in the last two periods. The pipeline inventory is 421 units, which consists of 324 confirmed 'ghost' units (lost from P1, P3, P4) and 97 units ordered in P27. Since the 97 units ordered in P27 are expected to arrive in Period 29 (actual lead time typically 2), they are not yet visible. To force an order despite the 324 'ghost' units clogging the pipeline, I will use an explicit mu_hat. I am forecasting demand to stay high (~105 units/week) for the next few lead periods (L+1=3). Therefore, mu_hat = 3 * 105 = 315. However, since the OR engine calculates order = max(0, base_stock - pipeline), and pipeline is 421, I need the base_stock (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) to exceed 421. Given the volatility, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 550 and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure the backend places a replenishment order immediately to cover the seasonal peak, adjusting for the 324 phantom units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (2019/9/2). The SKU (Ladies Denim Trousers) has shifted from an ultra-low regime (<1 unit) into a high-demand seasonal peak, likely for 'Back to School' or Autumn season. Demand in P26-P29 was 44, 107, 104, and 71 units respectively (Average ~81.5). On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 677. This 677 consists of: 324 confirmed 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P4) which are lost and will never arrive, 97 units ordered in P27 (expected P29-P30, currently overdue or arriving now), and 256 units ordered in P29 (expected P31). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' blindly, it thinks we have 677 units coming. To force an order that covers the current demand of ~80 units per week across L+1=3 periods (approx 240 units needed), we must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 324 'ghost' units. I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to (1+L) * 200 = 600. This should trigger an order of roughly 250-300 units to replenish stock for the high-demand period, offsetting the lost units in the logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: High-demand seasonal peak (P26-P29 avg: 81.5 units) following ultra-low summer regime. 324 units (P1, P3, P4) remain lost 'ghost' inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand seasonal regime (late August/early September peak). Demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) has been: 44, 107, 104, 71, 87, averaging approximately 83 units/week. This follows an ultra-low summer regime (<1 unit/week). The 'Ghost' inventory of 324 units (from lost shipments in P1, P3, P4) is still in the pipeline, which artificially inflates the 'In-transit' count and prevents the OR backend from ordering enough. Total In-transit is 580, but actual viable arrivals expected are only 256 (from P29). With on-hand at 10 and actual demand around 83, there is a severe risk of stockouts. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this seasonal surge and use 'explicit' L=2 to override potential delays seen in P27. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*83 = 249. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 324 ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat significantly or the pipeline inventory logic (base_stock - pipeline) will result in zero orders. I will set mu_hat to 650 (accounting for current demand + the 324 ghost offset) to ensure the system recognizes a need for ~100-200 new units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand seasonal regime (averaging 82 units since P26), likely due to back-to-school or fall transitions. P31 demand was 100 units, but with 0 on-hand, we lost significant sales. Current status: On-hand is 0, and in-transit is 666 units. However, 324 units of this pipeline (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory. Subtracting these, the true pipeline is 342 units (256 from P29 and 86 from P31). We are currently in Period 32 (Sept 16). The lead time for the P27 order was 3 periods instead of the promised 2. I will set L to 'calculate' to account for this variability and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=6 for the current peak) to ensure our mu_hat reflects the current high-demand levels (~82 units/week) rather than the long-term low-demand summer period. Our goal is to recover on-hand inventory to meet this sustained demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand seasonal peak corresponding to late summer/early autumn (Sept 2019). Over the last four periods (P29-P32), demand has averaged 82.75 units (71, 87, 100, 73). Current on-hand inventory is low (13 units). The 'In-transit' figure of 580 is deceptive due to 324 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) that have never arrived and likely never will. Subtracting these 'ghost' units, the true pipeline is 256 units (ordered P29) which should arrive imminently. Observed lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P27 order took 3, P31 order took 1). To ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) period window during this peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods of demand data (N=4) to capture the current regime. L is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average, which accounts for recent variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a high-demand seasonal regime (late August through September), likely corresponding to back-to-school or autumn fashion transitions. Demand over the last 8 periods (P26-P33) has averaged 87.5 units, significantly higher than the summer slump. Most recently (P30-P33), demand has been 87, 100, 73, and 114 (avg ~93.5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 580 units, but 324 of these (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost 'ghost' units, leaving a functional pipeline of 256 units (ordered P29). Since these 256 units haven't arrived by P33 conclude (4 periods later), the lead time is currently unreliable or extended. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand average of ~93 units per period. I am using an explicit mu_hat to ensure the backend accounts for the current 90+ unit pace over the lead time and review period (1+L). Based on the 324-unit ghost inventory, the OR backend's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic will be severely suppressed. By setting a high mu_hat and sigma_hat, I aim to force the order logic to overcome the 'ghost' inventory drag and replenish stock for the current season.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P27 order took 3 periods, P31 order took 1 period. P29 order (256 units) is now overdue (4 periods). Functional pipeline is total in-transit minus 324 ghost units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand seasonal regime (averaging ~89 units over the last 9 periods). On-hand inventory is 0, and there is a massive stockout. The total in-transit is 580 units, but 324 of these are 'ghost inventory' from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that will never arrive. The functional pipeline consists of 256 units ordered in Period 29. This order is now significantly overdue (expected L=2, now at L=5), indicating severe lead-time instability or a potential loss. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 580 pipeline units from the base stock, it will not place new orders unless L and mu_hat are set high enough to overcome this ghost inventory. To force an order and maintain service levels for the ~90 units/week demand, I am using 'explicit' L=5 to reflect the current delay and 'explicit' mu_hat to cover (L+1) weeks of demand (6 * 90 = 540) plus the 324 ghost offset, totaling 864. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock that triggers an order despite the pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Order from Period 29 (256 units) is now 3 periods overdue (Total L=5 without arrival), confirming severe lead-time instability or potential loss of a large shipment.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand seasonal regime (averaging ~88 units since P26). On-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline inventory of 762 units is heavily skewed by 'ghost' shipments: 324 units from P1/P3/P4 are confirmed lost, and 256 units from P29 are now 7 periods old (5 periods overdue), also likely lost. Removing these (580 units) leaves a functional pipeline of 182 units (ordered P35), which matches the current high-demand forecast. Lead times have been unstable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods for successful arrivals, with significant losses). Using L=3 explicitly accounts for this volatility. For demand, the seasonal peak since P26 (N=10) provides the most accurate mean (~88/week). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this regime while allowing the OR backend's cap and the service level (q=0.8) to regulate the order size against the functional pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Order from Period 29 (256 units) is now 7 periods past order date, confirming it as lost 'ghost' inventory. Total ghost inventory in pipeline is 580 units (P1, P3, P4, P29). Functional lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Super Skinny L.W Epic' jeans has settled into a stable late-season/autumn regime following the back-to-school spike. Average demand over the last 8 periods (P29-P36) is approximately 85.5 units per week, which is consistent with the current observed sales and demand (70 in P36, 66 in P35). Lead time remains volatile: recent successful arrivals showed lead times of 3 (P27) and 1 (P31, P35), while several other shipments are confirmed lost. The pipeline inventory currently shows 580 units, but all 580 units are 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4 = 324; P29 = 256). To the OR backend, the pipeline looks full, preventing new orders. I must use the 'explicit' method for L and mu_hat to ensure the backend requests enough stock to cover the true (L+1) period demand window (estimated 3 periods) without being misled by ghost inventory. Setting mu_hat to 256 (roughly 85 * 3) and sigma_hat to 30 will trigger appropriate replenishment if on-hand (112) is insufficient for the expected lead-time window.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087021 (Ladies Denim) is currently in a steady high-demand regime following a late-summer surge. Over the last 12 periods (P26-P37), average demand is approximately 75 units per week, significantly higher than the ultra-low summer regime. Recent peaks reached ~114 units, requiring a higher buffer for safety stock. Lead time remains volatile: while the promised lead time is 2 periods, recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, and multiple shipments (P1, P3, P4, and now P29) are considered lost, totaling 580 units of 'ghost' inventory. This ghost inventory inflates the pipeline, preventing the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To address this, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using an 'explicit' method to override the baseline calculation and account for the 580 units of pipeline inventory that will never arrive. mu_hat is calculated as (Avg Demand \xd7 (1 + L)) + Ghost Inventory = (75 \xd7 3) + 580 = 805. Sigma_hat is set to cover the high-end volatility observed in the current regime (~20-25 units/week) scaled for lead time.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are in a high-demand seasonal regime (P33-P38 average: 74.5 units). Pipeline inventory currently shows 793 units, but 580 units are confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory (P1: 136, P3: 94, P4: 94, P29: 256). The functional in-transit inventory is 213 units (ordered P38). On-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains volatile, with the last two successful arrivals taking 1 period (P31, P35), while earlier ones took 2-3 periods. To account for the 'ghost' inventory occupying pipeline slots, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I'll set mu_hat based on the high-demand regime (74.5 units/week) across (L+1) periods, but I will significantly inflate it to bypass the OR engine's base-stock calculation which incorrectly includes the 580 ghost units as available supply. By setting a high 'explicit' mu_hat, I force an order to maintain service levels despite the pipeline blockage. I'll use L=2 (promised) as recent actual lead times are 1, but volatility suggests caution.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Functional pipeline is 213 units. Total ghost inventory is 580 units (P1, P3, P4, P29). High-demand regime (late-summer/autumn) continues with average ~75 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime (late summer/autumn seasonal peak) with demand averaging ~75 units per period since Period 26. In Period 39, demand was 48 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 839 units contains 580 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, and P29), leaving a functional pipeline of 259 units (P38 order of 213 and P39 order of 46). These functional orders are within the promised lead time window (L=2). To ensure the OR backend ignores the 580 lost units and orders enough to cover the high-demand regime, I will use 'explicit' values for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. I set L=2 (promised). For mu_hat, I use the (1+L) * average demand of the high-regime (P26-P39 avg \u2248 75), which equals approx 225. For sigma_hat, I use sqrt(1+L) * std of the same period (std \u2248 22), which equals approx 38. This allows the logic to refill the functional pipeline correctly despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 839 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 580 of these units are confirmed as 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1: 136, P3: 94, P4: 94, and P29: 256). The functional pipeline consists only of orders from Period 38 (213 units) and Period 39 (46 units), totaling 259 functional units. The order from P38 (placed 3 periods ago) is now overdue (promised lead time 2). Demand has transitioned from the high late-summer/autumn peak (~75 units/period) to a lower November regime. The last two periods show demand of 48 and 32 units, suggesting a cooling trend. I am setting L to explicit 3 to account for current delays and mu_hat to a recent_N of 5 to capture the downward trend in demand (averaging ~55 units recently). This should trigger an order to cover the gap between the functional pipeline and the required base stock while ignoring the 580 ghost units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease in November: Average weekly demand has dropped to ~40 units (P39-P40) from the previous ~75 units. Functional pipeline is 259 units; total ghost inventory remains 580 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the ladies' skinny denim SKU has entered a lower regime since early November (P39). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P39-P41) is approximately 40 units/period (48, 32, 39), a significant drop from the ~75 units seen in the late-summer/autumn peak. Currently, we have 7 units on-hand. The total 'in-transit' inventory is 793 units, but 580 of these are 'ghost' units from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, and P29). Subtracting these leaves a functional pipeline of 213 units (the order from P38). Given the lead time is approximately 2 periods, the P38 order is expected to arrive during P40 or P41 but hasn't appeared in the P41 conclude message yet; it is likely to arrive during P42 and become visible in P43. To prevent over-ordering during this seasonal decline, I will adjust mu_hat to the recent average of ~40 units using recent_N=3. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to reflect recent lower volatility. No new order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend because the functional pipeline (213) already significantly exceeds the required base stock for a 40-unit demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed lower in November: Average weekly demand at 40 units (P39-P41). Functional pipeline is total in-transit minus 580 ghost units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering December (Period 43). Recent demand history indicates a regime shift: after a period of stability around 40 units (P39-P41), a major spike occurred in Period 42 (119 units), likely driven by holiday shopping/Black Friday. The current inventory is zero on-hand with a functional pipeline of 213 units (Total in-transit 793 - Ghost 580). This functional pipeline consists of the order from P38, which is now 5 periods since ordering (3 periods overdue), suggesting significant lead-time instability or potential loss. Given the holiday season, demand is expected to remain high and volatile. I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for observed delays and set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P39-P42) to capture the recent spike (average ~60 units/period * (1+L) = 240). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' to reflect the high volatility (119 vs ~40s).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike in Period 42 (119 units), likely marking the start of a holiday high-demand regime. Order from P38 (213 units) is now 3 periods overdue, increasing total potential ghost inventory to 793 units if it does not arrive soon.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 44 (Dec 09), the height of the holiday shopping season. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 119, followed by 24 in Period 43; this volatility is typical for December. The total in-transit 'pipeline' of 793 units is deceptive because it includes 580 units from confirmed lost shipments (P1=136, P3=94, P4=94, P29=256). Additionally, the order from P38 (213 units) is now 6 periods old (promised lead time 2), strongly suggesting it is also lost or severely delayed. If P38 is lost, the functional pipeline is effectively 0, as we have 0 on-hand. We must treat the 793 units as 'ghost' inventory to trigger a new order from the OR backend. I am using an explicit mu_hat to account for holiday demand volatility (averaging the recent spike and dip) and setting the lead time to 'calculate' to incorporate the average of actual observed arrivals, while maintaining a high sigma_hat for protection against stockouts during this high-stakes period.

Carry-over insight: Significant holiday demand volatility: P42 (119 units) and P43 (24 units). Order from P38 (213 units) is now 6 periods overdue, increasing likely 'ghost' inventory to 793 units (P1, P3, P4, P29, P38).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has been volatile: after a seasonal spike in P42 (119 units), the last two periods (P43-P44) averaged 30.5 units. Historically, late December can see significant shifts due to holiday clearance or final gift shopping. The pipeline inventory is heavily compromised by 'ghost' shipments. Confirmed lost: P1, P3, P4 (324 units) and P29 (256 units). The shipment from P38 (213 units) is now 7 periods old (ordered Oct 28), far exceeding the promised 2-period lead time and the observed max of 3 periods. Given this delay, I now categorize the P38 shipment as 'ghost' inventory. Total ghost inventory is 793 units (324+256+213), exactly matching the current 'In-transit' value. This means the functional pipeline is effectively 0 and on-hand is 0. To trigger a necessary replenishment for the year-end and anticipate potentially higher January demand (referencing Jan history: ~110 units), I will set mu_hat using a Recent_N approach. I'll use N=10 to capture the autumn/holiday average (approx 60 units/period) while accounting for the recent low P43-P44. I will use 'explicit' for L to maintain the promised 2-period baseline while acknowledging the high risk of total shipment loss.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Order from Period 38 (213 units) is confirmed lost/ghost inventory after 7 periods without arrival. Total ghost inventory in pipeline is 793 units (P1, P3, P4, P29, P38), which equals the current total In-transit. Functional pipeline is 0.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. The item is in a holiday demand regime characterized by higher volatility (recent demands: 119, 24, 37, 36). On-hand inventory is 0. The In-transit total is 793 units, all of which are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P29, P38). Period 38's order (213 units) is now 8 periods old and hasn't arrived, confirming it as lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base_stock, and the pipeline is currently 793 units of ghost inventory, it will likely result in a zero order unless the mu_hat is set significantly higher than the ghost inventory. Since we need to refill stock and the functional pipeline is 0, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a value that accounts for the ghost inventory burden. Based on recent demand (4-period average ~54 units), with L=2, a base stock for 3 periods (L+1) would be ~162. To trigger an order of approximately 160 units while the backend subtracts 793, I set mu_hat (explicit) to 950. L is set to 'default' (2) as the promised time is standard, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture recent holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Functional pipeline confirmed at 0. Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) is 793 units (P1, P3, P4, P29, P38).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 47 (end of December). Historical performance shows a transition into a late-year demand regime. Recent demand (P43-P46) has stabilized around an average of 30 units (24, 37, 36, 23). This follows a high-volatility period in late November (P42: 119 units). Total In-transit is 1014 units, but significant 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments is confirmed. Specifically, orders from P1 (136), P3 (94), P4 (94), P29 (256), and P38 (213) have never arrived and are well beyond the promised lead time of 2. Total ghost inventory = 136+94+94+256+213 = 793 units. Functional pipeline = Total In-transit (1014) - Ghost (793) = 221 units (representing the P46 order). Since on-hand is 0, we need to ensure the base stock is set to cover the lead time plus review period. Given recent stabilization, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current mean demand (~30 units). Lead time remains volatile but the backend 'calculate' or 'recent_N' will be skewed by non-arriving orders; however, since ghost inventory is handled by my knowledge of 'L' and the mu_hat calculation, I will maintain L=2 (promised) while adjusting mu_hat to ensure the OR engine orders enough to offset the ghost-occupied slots.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-holiday: Average weekly demand ~30 units (P43-P46). Total ghost inventory remains 793 units (P1, P3, P4, P29, P38).
