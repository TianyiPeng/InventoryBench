Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical lead-time performance or 'conclude' messages to evaluate. The product is a 'Jersey Basic' hoodie for men, a category generally characterized by stable demand but potentially higher interest in late winter/early spring. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks has shown a significant upward trend (61, 41, 106, 145, 133). The most recent three weeks (106, 145, 133) suggest a new, higher demand regime compared to the initial two weeks. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) based on these last 3 samples (recent_N: 3) to capture this higher mean (~128 units/week) and its variance. For lead time, I will use the promised lead time (L=2) via the 'default' method, as we have no evidence of drift yet. This configuration aims to establish a base stock level sufficient to cover (2+1) periods of this elevated demand level while accounting for the recent variability.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the provided historical data (Jan 7 to Feb 11), demand for 'RICHIE HOOD' has shown a clear upward trend: 61, 41, 106, 145, 133, and most recently 91 in Period 1. The average demand across these 6 samples is approximately 96.1. The product is a jersey basic hoodie, which typically sees steady demand in late winter/early spring. In-transit inventory of 161 units (ordered Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 (L=2). Currently code shows 0 on-hand and 161 in-transit. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat to capture the higher demand levels seen since late January (recent 4 samples: 145, 133, 91 plus previous 106), while maintaining the promised lead time (L=2) as the baseline for the OR calculation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history shows a clear upward trend: 61, 41, 106, 145, 133 (pre-game) and 91, 151 (Periods 1-2). The average demand over these 7 periods is approx 104. Lead time is promised at 2 periods. The order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 321 units in-transit (161 from P1 + 160 from P2). mu_hat should reflect the rising demand trend; using the last 4 samples (145, 133, 91, 151) gives an average of 130. Given the lead time L=2, mu_hat = (1+L) * 130 = 390. sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=4 to capture current volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demand average for the first 5 weeks was ~97 units, but the last 3 game weeks show higher volatility (91, 151, 79), averaging ~107 units. The SKU is a basic cotton hoodie, which typically experiences steady demand with slight increases during late winter/early spring. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts (sold=0) because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (161 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in Period 3's conclude message; however, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests a potential lead time delay or loss. However, since it is only 1 period past promise for the first order, I will set L=3 explicitly to account for the delay. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the average of the last 4 available samples (N=4, including the last game period and the 3 preceding it: 145, 133, 91, 151) which is 130. Since mu_hat requires (1+L) * mean, and L=3, mu_hat = 4 * 130 = 520. Sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=4 to capture current volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic Hoodie'. Historical demand has fluctuated: 61, 41, 106, 145, 133 (pre-simulation) and 91, 151, 79, 58 (simulation). The mean demand is approximately 96.2. The promised lead time is 2. We observed an arrival in Period 4 (ordered Period 2), confirming the lead time of 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 102 and in-transit is 473 (from P1, P3, and P4 orders). Note: The P1 order of 161 is still in-transit and should have arrived in P3 if L=2; its absence suggests a possible lost shipment or significant delay, though it's too early to confirm a lost shipment for certain. Given the standard lead time of 2, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods. Mean demand (96) across 3 periods is 288. Our total pipeline (102 + 473 = 575) appears high, but we must account for the potentially lost Period 1 order (161 units). If P1 is lost, effective pipeline is 414. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent simulation demand volatility while maintaining a stable mean forecast.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a basic hoodie. Historical demand samples (before the game) and game history (Periods 1-5) show high variability: [61, 41, 106, 145, 133, 91, 151, 79, 58, 101]. The mean demand is approximately 96.6 units. On-hand inventory is critically low (1 unit). Transition history shows an order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (L=2), but the order from Period 1 (161 units) has not arrived after 5 periods and is now considered lost. Orders from Period 3 (147 units) and Period 4 (165 units) are currently in-transit. Given the high stockout risk and inconsistent lead times, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (P1-P5) to capture recent levels. Since a shipment was lost, I will use an explicit L of 2 to ensure the OR backend attempts to maintain coverage for L+1 periods based on the promised lead time, while mu_hat reflects the 96.6 average demand ($96.6 	imes (1+2) = 289.8$).

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (161 units) likely lost - no arrival after 5 periods. Lead time for Period 2 order was 2 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand history (samples + game history): 61, 41, 106, 145, 133, 91, 151, 79, 58, 101, 64. The mean demand is approximately 93.6 units/period. Lead time analysis: The Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods (Period 4). The Period 1 order is significantly overdue (6 periods passed) and is considered lost. The Period 3 order (147 units) was placed in Period 3 with a promised lead time of 2, so it should have arrived in Period 5 (visible in P6 conclude). Since it didn't arrive by P7 start, there is a risk of a second lost shipment or a significant lead time extension. However, given the 'In-transit' balance of 473 units (P3: 147 + P4: 165 + P5: 0 + P6: 0 = 312? No, P1 is still technically 'in-transit' in the system's view until cleared), we must account for the lost P1 order. Current in-transit 473 = P1(161) + P3(147) + P4(165). Since P1 is lost, effective pipeline is 312. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent volatility (avg ~78.6, but standard deviation is high). I will keep L at 'default' (2) because one order arrived on time, but I am monitoring P3 for potential loss.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 order (147 units) is now 2 periods overdue (should have arrived P5), suggesting either a lead time spike or a second lost shipment.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 685814001 (a cotton-blend hoodie) is experiencing significant supply chain issues. Demand has averaged 86 units over the last 7 periods (91, 151, 79, 58, 101, 64, 59). Despite this consistent demand, on-hand inventory is 0. The shipment from Period 1 (161 units) is definitely lost (7 periods since order). The shipment from Period 3 (147 units) is 3 periods overdue (should have arrived P5), and the shipment from Period 4 (165 units) is 1 period overdue. Given that hoodies are seasonal and we are moving into spring, demand might soften, but the immediate priority is replenishing stock due to the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), which justifies a high service level. I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the full history of this specific lifecycle. For lead time (L), the promised time is 2, but the actual experience is either a 2-period arrival (P2) or total loss/prolonged delay. I will set L to 2 (default) as the OR backend automatically accounts for pipeline inventory, but I acknowledge the risk of lost shipments. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability: Period 1 shipment (161 units) confirmed lost. Period 3 (147 units) and Period 4 (165 units) shipments are significantly overdue as of P8, indicating either systemic lead time extension or multiple lost batches.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), the SKU 685814001 (Jersey Hoodie) is experiencing severe supply chain disruption. While the promised lead time (L) is 2, only the Period 2 order has arrived (at Period 4, L=2). Orders from Period 1 (161 units), Period 3 (147 units), and Period 4 (165 units) are now 6, 4, and 3 periods overdue, respectively. These are treated as lost or severely delayed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 'in-transit' shows 473 units, but these represent the missing stock. Demand has stabilized but persists (avg ~60-70 units). To force the OR backend to place a new order despite the 'phantom' in-transit inventory, I am setting L to 4 (explicitly acknowledging the delay/loss) and mu_hat to a value that reflects (1+L) periods of demand. Since the OR engine's capped policy uses current in-transit (473) against the base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger replenishment or provide a buffer for the ongoing stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Sustained stockout due to total loss of Period 1, 3, and 4 shipments. In-transit inventory of 473 is likely invalid ('phantom stock'). Explicitly increasing L to 4 to account for systemic delays.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), we are in a severe stockout. The product 'RICHIE HOOD' is a basic jersey hoodie, which should have stable demand. Analyzing the history: Orders from P1 (161 units), P3 (147 units), and P4 (165 units) are all significantly past their promised lead time of 2. P1 is now 7 periods overdue, P3 is 5 periods overdue, and P4 is 4 periods overdue. Based on the logic that lost orders remain in 'In-transit' indefinitely, we must conclude these 473 units (161+147+165) are lost 'phantom stock'. Total In-transit is currently 549, meaning only the order from P9 (76 units) is likely viable. Demand has softened recently (avg ~44 units in last 4 periods) compared to the initial weeks (~100 units). To trigger an immediate replenishment order despite the high 'phantom' in-transit inventory, I am setting L to 4 to reflect supply chain delays and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock that covers 5 weeks of demand (L+1) at approximately 75 units/week (blending recent low demand with the expected mean), which equals 375. By setting mu_hat to 375, the OR backend's capped policy should bypass the phantom stock and generate a large order to recover the on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss confirmed for P1, P3, and P4 orders (total 473 units). Current 'In-transit' of 549 includes 473 units of phantom stock that will never arrive. Actual viable in-transit is only 76 units (from P9).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019-04-22), we have finally exited a prolonged stockout thanks to the arrival of the Period 9 order in just 1 period. However, the system still shows 473 units as 'In-transit' which are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4. This 'phantom stock' causes the OR backend to believe the pipeline is full, preventing it from ordering necessary inventory. To force the backend to ignore these non-existent units and replenish stock, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the phantom stock plus the safety stock required for the next 3-4 periods (L+1). Demand is currently in a lower-volume spring phase (mean ~48 over last 10 periods). Average demand of 48 * (L+1=3) = 144 units. To offset 473 units of phantom stock and target a base stock of ~160-180, I will set mu_hat to 650. I will set L to 1 based on the most recent observed lead time to maximize ordering responsiveness, though the backend's capped policy may still limit the order size.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Shift in observed lead time to 1 period (Period 9 order arrived Period 10). Re-stocking initiated. Phantom stock from P1, P3, P4 still persists in backend pipeline calculations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (2019/4/29). The situation is critical because the backend 'In-transit' figure of 681 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom stock'. Based on history, orders from P1 (161), P3 (147), and P4 (165) are confirmed lost, totaling 473 units. The actual viable pipeline consists of the P11 order (208 units) which hasn't arrived yet. Period 11 ended with 0 inventory after a stockout (61 sold vs 90 demand). Demand has stabilized after a very high Jan/Feb start, with recent weeks average (P8-P11) around 44 units/week, but P11 saw a spike to 90. Given the jersey/hoodie category and spring dates, demand is volatile. The OR engine thinks we have 681 units coming, so it will not order anything unless we manipulate mu_hat to be higher than the pipeline. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers current forecasted demand (approx 75/week) plus the 473 lost units to force the OR engine to place a replenishment order despite the phantom stock. I will use L=1 as the most recent successful arrival (P9 order arrived in P10) showed a lead time of 1.

Carry-over insight: P11 demand spiked to 90 units, breaking the recent declining trend (P8-P10 avg 29). Phantom stock from P1, P3, P4 is now confirmed at 473 units, requiring permanent mu_hat inflation until those 'orders' are somehow cleared or offset.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/5/6), the SKU 685814001 (Hoodie) is experiencing a severe stockout. History confirms that 473 units (ordered in P1, P3, and P4) are lost shipments. These remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (Total 692), meaning the OR engine believes we have sufficient pipeline inventory when we actually only have 219 viable units in transit (P11 order of 208 and P12 order of 11). Demand has spiked recently (90 units each for P11 and P12), possibly due to early May promotions or seasonal resonance. To force the OR engine to order despite the 'phantom' 473 units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Predicted base stock (L=2) needs to cover 3 periods of demand. With demand at ~90/week, required base stock is ~270 plus safety stock. To overcome the 473-unit phantom stock deficit, I set mu_hat (which the backend uses as the base stock target) to 850. This 850 target minus 692 in-transit will allow an order of ~158 units. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P2, P9) show lead times of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: P11-P12 demand spike confirmed at 90 units/week, up from the P8-P10 average of 29 units. Phantom stock deficit remains 473 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Hoodie) is experiencing demand volatility and supply chain reconciliation issues. We are now in mid-May. History shows a recent demand spike in P11-P12 (90 units/week) followed by a drop in P13 (49 units). Averaging the last 3 periods (P11-P13) gives a mean demand of ~76 units. There is a critical 'phantom stock' issue: orders from P1, P3, and P4 (total 473 units) are lost but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit reported is 743, but only 259 from P13 and 11 from P12 are viable, totaling 270). The OR engine subtracts this phantom 473 units from the order quantity, leading to continuous under-ordering. To force the OR backend to order sufficient units, I must inflate mu_hat to cover both the real demand for the (L+1) horizon and the 473-unit deficit. Calculation: Target Mu = ((1+L) * Mean Demand) + Phantom Deficit = (3 * 76) + 473 = 228 + 473 = 701. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P9 at 1 period, P11 at 2 periods) suggest the promised lead time of 2 is generally holding despite the earlier losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand regime remains volatile (avg 76 last 3 periods). Phantom stock deficit confirmed at 473 units (P1, P3, P4). Observed lead times for P9 and P11 confirm a return to 1-2 period delivery.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are in a more stable operational phase but still dealing with a massive backend pipeline distortion. The 'In-transit' figure of 732 units includes 473 units of 'phantom stock' (shipments from P1, P3, and P4 that were lost) and 259 units ordered in P13 (expected to arrive in P15). Since the OR backend subtracts the full 732 from its order calculation, it will never place a new order. To force replenishment and maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (L=2) plus review period, I must use 'explicit' values. Recent demand (P11-P14) has averaged ~66 units/week (90, 90, 49, 36), though it is trending downward after a late April spike. I will forecast a mu_hat based on (1+L)*mean of last 4 periods (3 * 66 = 198) and add the 473 phantom units to this total (671). This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the 473 units of invalid pipeline inventory.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), the SKU 685814001 (Richie Hood) is in a post-restock phase. Historical analysis confirms a 'phantom stock' issue: orders from P1 (161 units), P3 (147 units), and P4 (165 units) are lost, totaling 473 units. These remain in the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR backend (732 units), whereas the actual viable in-transit is 259 (from P13). Actual lead times have stabilized at 2 periods (P11 and P12 both took 2 periods). Recent demand (P13-P15) has averaged 41.3 units, significantly lower than the P11-P12 spike (90 units) and the initial season start. To compensate for the 473 units of phantom stock that the backend believes exists, I must intentionally inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to the expected demand for the lead-time window plus the deficit. Calculated demand (1+L=3) * avg(recent 3) = 3 * 41.3 = 124. Adding the 473 unit deficit gives an explicit mu_hat of 597. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Deficit of 473 units (phantom stock from P1, P3, P4) continues to require mu_hat inflation to trigger replacement orders. Demand has stabilized at ~41 units/week over the last 3 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the 'Richie Hood' SKU is currently over-supplied in the OR backend's view due to phantom stock. The 'In-transit' figure of 732 units includes 473 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. Additionally, it contains orders from Period 13 (259 units). Since P13 was ordered with a promised lead time of 2, it is expected to arrive during Period 15, 16, or 17. The 'conclude' messages for P15/P16 did not show it, so it should arrive during this period (P17). If it arrives, on-hand (68) + arrival (259) will be 327, which is more than sufficient for the current demand regime. Recent demand (P14-P16) has averaged 34 units/week, a significant drop from the P11-P12 spike (90 units). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this lower demand level. I will maintain L at the promised lead time of 2, as the most recent arrivals (P11, P12) came in 2 periods. No mu_hat inflation is needed this period as the pipeline (even excluding phantom stock) is sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Demand has stabilized at a lower average of ~34 units/week (Periods 14-16) compared to the previous volatile period.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10th), the demand for the Richie Hoodie has stabilized significantly. The last four periods (P14-P17) show an average demand of approximately 30 units per week (36, 39, 27, 17), confirming the 'Sustained lower average' noted in P17's carry-over. In-transit inventory is listed at 732 units, but we have identified 473 units as 'phantom stock' (lost orders from P1, P3, and P4) that the OR backend still believes are arriving. Subtracting this phantom stock from the total in-transit (732 - 473) yields 259 valid units in transit (ordered in P13). At a 2-period promised lead time, these are expected to arrive in Period 18 or 19. My goal is to maintain inventory to meet the current stable demand of ~30/week. However, the backend's capped policy will look at the inflated 'phantom' pipeline (732) and stop ordering. To force replacement orders despite the phantom stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover the current demand (avg 30) across the (L+1) horizon plus the deficit (473). mu_hat calculation: (30 units/week * 3 weeks) + 473 deficit = 563. I will keep L at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P13, P14) suggest the supply chain has stabilized at the promised lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for the 'RICHIE HOOD' has stabilized at a lower average over the last 5 periods (P14-P18 demand: 36, 39, 27, 17, 20), resulting in a mean of 27.8 units/period. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 732 units, which includes 473 units of 'phantom stock' from lost shipments in P1 (161), P3 (147), and P4 (165). Subtracting the phantom stock, the true pipeline is 259 units (from the order placed in P13). Since lead time has stabilized at 2 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P13/P14), the P13 order is expected to arrive during P15/P16/P17 but hasn't appeared in the 'conclude' messages yet, likely indicating a slight shift back to a 2-3 period lead time or processing delay. However, with true pipeline (259) + on-hand (31) = 290 units, and expected demand over the next 3 periods (L+1) being only ~84 units, we are significantly over-stocked once the P13 order arrives. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the lower demand regime and keep L at default (2) to align with promised expectations, while knowing the OR backend will naturally stop ordering due to the high pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a lower regime: P14-P18 average is 27.8 units/period. True pipeline inventory is 259 units; the remaining 473 units of 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom stock from lost shipments in P1, P3, and P4.

LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Demand has entered a significantly lower, stable regime; the average of the last 6 periods (P14-P19) is approximately 24.7 units, with the most recent sample at 9 units. This decline is consistent with the seasonal transitions for hooded sweatshirts in early summer. On-hand inventory is 22 units. Pipeline inventory is reported as 732, but 473 units are confirmed 'phantom stock' from lost shipments in P1, P3, and P4. The actual viable pipeline is 259 units (from P13), which is still significantly higher than current demand needs. No new orders are needed at this stage. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 6-period regime (P14-P19) to reflect the lower demand. I will use L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P13, P14) confirmed a return to normal 2-period lead times. No mu_hat inflation is required now as the surplus of viable stock (22 on-hand + 259 in-transit = 281) far exceeds the demand forecast for the next 3 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01. Demand has significantly decelerated over the last 7 periods (P14-P20), with the average dropping to 22.1 units/period and the most recent three periods (P18-P20) averaging only 12 units. This represents a clear shift to a low-demand regime for this hoodie SKU as seasonal temperatures rise. On-hand inventory is 15 units. The in-transit inventory is 732, but 473 units of this is confirmed 'phantom stock' from lost shipments in P1, P3, and P4. The viable pipeline is 259 units (ordered P13), which is far more than enough to cover the current demand regime. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders due to the massive phantom stock, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat. I've set mu_hat based on the recent average demand (22 units) and the promised lead time (2), totaling (1+2)*22 = 66. This value is significantly below the current (On-hand + In-transit) of 747, ensuring no new orders are triggered while we wait for the P13 shipment to arrive or for the system to reconcile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Demand has dropped sharply since P17, with P18-P20 average at 12 units/period, down from a P14-P17 average of 30 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8th. The product is a Richie Hood (hoodie/sweatshirt), which is seasonally heading into the warmest months where demand is expected to be at its lowest. Historical demand shows a sharp decline, with the last period's demand spike (29 units) being an outlier compared to the P18-P20 average of 12 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 732 units is heavily skewed by 473 units of 'phantom stock' from lost shipments in P1, P3, and P4 (473 = 161 + 147 + 165). The actual viable pipeline inventory is 259 units (from P13). Since 259 units far exceed the projected demand for the next (L+1) periods given the current low-demand regime and seasonal trough, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from ordering despite the phantom stock, I will set mu_hat to a very low explicit value of 0, effectively signaling that the existing pipeline (even excluding phantom units) is more than sufficient. I will maintain lead time L at 2 based on the most recent reliable arrival history.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-15. Demand context indicates a recent low-volume regime (avg ~12 units for P18-P20) followed by a sharp spike in July (P21: 29, P22: 44), likely representing a seasonal summer clearance or a fresh hoodie demand cycle. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the 'In-transit' of 732 contains 473 units of confirmed phantom stock (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4). This leaves only 259 units in actual pipeline (ordered P13), which are now overdue (ordered P13, currently P23, L=2 promised). These 259 units are the only stock expected to arrive. To force the OR backend to place a replacement order despite the 473 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the backend's default calculation. I am setting mu_hat = (1+L) * (Forecast + Offset). Forecast = 40 (approximate average of recent weeks). Offset = 473 / (1+L) to neutralize the phantom stock. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * (40 + 158) = 594. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for the recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand spike confirmed in July (P21-P22 avg 36.5 units), reversing the previous low-demand regime of 12 units. Actual pipeline remains 259 units (all overdue from P13); the remaining 473 in-transit units are confirmed phantom losses.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. We are in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 732 units is heavily skewed by 473 units of 'phantom stock' from lost shipments in Periods 1, 3, and 4, which the backend still considers active. The remaining 259 units (ordered Period 13) are now significantly overdue (10 periods since order), suggesting they may also be lost or severely delayed. Since the backend policy uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), it will not place new orders if it thinks 732 units are coming. To force replacement orders and overcome this 473-unit (and likely 732-unit) deficit, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Recent demand (P21-P23) has spiked to an average of 38 units/period. Calculating mu_hat as (1+L) * average_demand + deficit: (1+2)*38 + 732 = 846. This will ensure the backend computes a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom inventory. Lead time is set to default (2), as recent deliveries (when they occurred) were around 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Period 13 shipment (259 units) is now 8 periods past promised lead time and 10 periods since order; likely lost. Total phantom inventory now estimated at 732 units (P1, P3, P4, P13).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 25 (Late July). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has recently spiked (July avg ~37 units) compared to June (avg ~12 units), then moderated to 26 units in P24. 

Supply Chain Health: The 'In-transit' figure of 896 units is severely compromised by 'phantom stock' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and now likely P13). 
- Lost P1, P3, P4: 161 + 147 + 165 = 473 units.
- Lost P13: 259 units (ordered 12 periods ago, promised 2).
- Subtotal Phantom Stock: 732 units.
- Genuine In-transit: 164 units (ordered P24).
Total visible 'In-transit' = 732 (phantom) + 164 (real) = 896 units. 

OR Backend Strategy: The backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)'. Because the backend sees 896 units in transit, it will not place new orders unless \u03bc\u0302 is inflated significantly to exceed this 'phantom' total. 

Parameter Selection: 
1. Lead Time (L): Observed L is 1-2 periods. Setting to 'default' (2).
2. mu_hat: We need to overcome the 732 units of phantom stock. Current demand is ~30/week. To force an order, mu_hat must be ~ (Desired Safety Stock + Phantom Stock). I will use 'explicit' and set it to 900. This ensures the OR backend sees a 'need' for at least ~50-100 units of fresh stock above the phantom baseline.
3. sigma_hat: Set to 'explicit' 50 to maintain a healthy safety buffer given recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Confirmed phantom stock total increased to 732 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). Total pipeline (896) minus phantom (732) leaves 164 units of viable stock in transit.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019-08-05), the SKU is currently in a stockout state (on-hand = 0). Demand spiked to 78 last period, confirmed a shift from the July average of ~37. History shows a massive discrepancy in 'In-transit' inventory: the system reports 983 units, but 732 of these (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P13) are effectively 'phantom stock' that have never arrived well past their lead times. The viable in-transit units are from P24 (164) and P25 (87), totaling 251. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (983) from the base stock calculation, it will stop ordering unless mu_hat is inflated to offset the 732 phantom units. Current demand is trending upward (P25=78), suggesting potential late summer/early autumn seasonality for hoodies. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecast_Mean + Phantom_Deficit. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*50 + 732 = 882. This ensures the backend places a replacement order to cover actual demand while overcoming the pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand spike at P25 (78 units) confirmed. Total phantom stock in pipeline revised to 732 units (P1, P3, P4, P13); current viable pipeline is only 251 units (from P24-P25).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are facing a severe supply chain crisis where 732 units (from orders in P1, P3, P4, and P13) are effectively lost but still appear in 'In-transit' as phantom stock. This causes the OR backend to believe our inventory position is much higher than it actually is, preventing necessary replacement orders. To counteract this, I must artificially inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Recent demand (P24-P26) shows a sustained spike averaging 58 units/week, likely due to seasonal demand for hoodies. My inventory target (base stock) needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1 with L=2). Normal base stock would be ~174 units. Adding the 732 phantom units to this target gives a total required base stock of 906. Since the OR engine calculates base stock as mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), I will set mu_hat to 906 to force the engine to place orders despite the phantom inventory. I'm keeping L at 2 as recent orders (P9, P11, P12) arrived with 1-2 period lead times, and sigma_hat at recent volatility levels.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand spike confirmed (P24-P26 average 58 units/period). Total phantom stock confirmed at 732 units (P1, P3, P4, P13); this deficit requires sustained mu_hat inflation until phantom units are removed from backend pipeline data.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand spiked to 130 units, its highest level since P2, confirming a significant seasonal increase in demand for hoodies as we move into August (back-to-school/pre-fall season). The P25 order of 87 units arrived with a 2-period lead time, but the P24 order of 164 units (ordered 3 periods ago) has not yet arrived, suggesting potential delays or losses in the current supply chain. The 'In-transit' total of 896 units is severely inflated by 'phantom stock' from lost shipments: P1 (161), P3 (147), P4 (165), and now P13 (259), totaling 732 units that will likely never arrive. The actual viable pipeline is only 164 units (the P24 order). Because the backend OR calculates orders based on (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to overcome this 732-unit phantom deficit and trigger necessary replacement orders to meet the surging seasonal demand (avg ~93 units/period over the last 3 periods). Using an explicit mu_hat of 1000 to force the backend to place a substantial order despite the phantom stock logic.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand spike confirmed: Late August demand hit 130 units. Total phantom stock (confirmed losses) revised to 732 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). Viable pipeline consists only of the P24 order (164 units).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-08-26. We are in a confirmed late-summer/pre-autumn seasonal demand spike (P27 and P28 demand at 130). The current 'In-transit' of 1115 units is heavily corrupted by phantom stock. Confirmed phantom units: P1 (161), P3 (147), P4 (165), and P13 (259) = 732 units. The viable pipeline consists of P24 (164 units, now 5 periods since order, overdue) and P28 (219 units, placed last period). On-hand is 0. Total viable inventory (OH + Real Pipeline) is roughly 383 units. With demand at 130/week, this covers less than 3 weeks. To offset the 732 units of phantom stock the backend 'sees' when calculating orders, I must use mu_hat 'explicit' to force a base stock high enough to trigger replacement orders despite the fake pipeline. I am setting mu_hat based on the current high demand regime (130/period) over (L+1)=3 periods, plus an inflation factor to neutralize the 732 phantom units: (130 * 3) + 732 = 1122. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation yields a positive order value.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss check: P1, P3, P4, and now P13 confirmed lost (Total 732 units). These 'phantom' units permanently reside in the backend's 'In-transit' data. To maintain service levels during the current seasonal peak (130 units/period), mu_hat must be inflated by at least 732 units until the state is corrected.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: We are entering September, a high-demand period for the 'Richie Hood' (hoodie) as seasonal cooler weather begins. Recent demand has peaked significantly (P28: 130 units). Supply Chain: A major challenge is 'phantom stock'. Our 'In-transit' shows 1205 units, but 732 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The remaining 473 units are 'real' orders from P24 (164), P28 (219), and P29 (90). Parameter Strategy: Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' (1205) in its order calculation (order = base_stock - on_hand - in_transit), it believes we are overstocked and will not place new orders despite our 0 on-hand inventory. To force an order, we must inflate mu_hat to offset the 732 units of phantom stock. Forecast: Recent demand avg (P27-P29) is 106 units/period. For a 2-period lead time, we need to cover 3 periods of demand plus the deficit. mu_hat = (106 * 3) + 732 = 1050. I will use 'explicit' to ensure the order is triggered. L remains 2 (promised).

Carry-over insight: September demand peak confirmed (avg 100+ units). Total phantom stock (lost shipments in backend) remains 732 units (P1, P3, P4, P13).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September is seeing a massive demand spike (Period 30 demand: 242 units). Current on-hand is 0. The 'In-transit' of 986 units is heavily distorted by 732 units of 'phantom stock' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13) that the OR backend still believes will arrive. Viable pipeline is only 254 units (P24: 164, P29: 90). The P24 order is now 6 periods since ordering (4 periods overdue) and may also be lost, but I will treat it as extremely delayed for now. To trigger an order given the 732-unit phantom inventory bottleneck, I must set mu_hat to at least the phantom total plus the forecasted demand for the lead time. With current demand volatility (mean ~150 over last 3 periods), I set mu_hat to 1250 units [(150 * 3) + 732 + safety] and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure a high service level during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Peak season confirmed with Period 30 demand at 242 units. Phantom stock (lost shipments in backend pipeline) remains at 732 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). P24 order (164 units) is now 4 periods overdue, potentially increasing phantom stock to 896.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-September peak for 'Richie Hood' (hoodies), as evidenced by demand of 217-242 units over the last two periods. The supply chain remains unreliable. Analysis of the 1497 units \u2018In-transit\u2019: P1, P3, P4, and P13 (total 732 units) are confirmed phantom stock. P24 (164 units) is now 8 periods old and 6 periods overdue, also likely lost. Total phantom stock is likely 896 units. The viable pipeline consists of P29 (90 units) and P31 (511 units). Since the OR backend subtracts the full 1497 units from its order calculation, we must use an explicit 'mu_hat' to force a replenishment order that sustains the 200+ units/period demand regime. Setting mu_hat to 1500 (covering 3 periods of ~200 demand plus offsetting ~900 units of lost inventory) ensures the backend clears the cap and orders enough to keep up with the seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total phantom stock estimate increased to 896 units as P24 (164 units) is now 6 periods overdue. Seasonal peak for hoodies confirmed at ~220 units/period (Sept).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak September demand season for 'RICHIE HOOD' (hoodies), with demand averaging ~221 units over the last 3 periods (P30-P32). On-hand inventory is 306 units. The backend 'In-transit' figure of 1201 units is heavily distorted by 'phantom stock' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, and likely P24), totaling 896 units. The net viable pipeline is only 305 units (P29 order of 90, P32 order of 215). To maintain service levels during this peak while the backend believes we have 896 extra units, mu_hat must be significantly inflated. I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover expected peak demand (~220/period) plus a significant portion of the phantom deficit to trigger necessary replacement orders, while using a lead time of 2 and higher sigma to protect against recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total phantom stock estimate remains 896 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P24). Peak demand regime for hoodies (~220 units/period) reached in September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak seasonal demand period for hoodies (September/October). Demand in P33 reached a new high of 374 units, far exceeding the previous plateau of ~220. My inventory position is critical: on-hand is 0, and the backend 'In-transit' shows 1201 units. However, as established in previous periods, 896 of these units are 'phantom stock' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P24). The actual viable pipeline is only 305 units (the P29 order of 90 and P32 order of 215). At a current demand rate of ~370/week, a viable pipeline of 305 is insufficient to cover even the next period, especially since the P29 order is now overdue (lead time 4+ periods). I must set mu_hat to offset the 896 phantom units and provide enough safety stock for the high-demand volatility. I'm using an explicit mu_hat of 1200 (which accounts for a base stock goal of ~2000 units minus the total pipeline of 1201) to force the backend to place an order that replaces the lost units and addresses the current 300+ demand regime. Lead time is set to 3 to reflect recent delivery delays and overdue shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Peak season demand surge confirmed (P33 demand 374 units). Total phantom stock (confirmed losses) remains 896 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P24). Viable pipeline is only 305 units, making the stockout risk severe despite high 'In-transit' numbers.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: We are at Period 35, entering October, following a significant September demand peak for hoodies (averaging ~270 units/period over P30-P34). On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is currently 1447 units, but this is heavily distorted by 'phantom stock'. Re-calculating phantom stock: Lost shipments from P1 (161), P3 (147), P4 (165), P13 (259), and P24 (164) total 896 units. These units will never arrive but prevent the OR backend from ordering. Current viable in-transit units are from P29 (90), P31 (511 - already arrived), P32 (215), and P34 (246), confirming the 896 deficit. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. To trigger replacement orders and cover the current demand regime (~260 units/week), I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 896-unit phantom stock deficit. Using mu_hat = (Demand Forecast * (L+1)) + Deficit = (260 * 3) + 896 = 1676. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture high holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed phantom stock (lost shipments) remains at 896 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P24). This requires sustained mu_hat inflation until the backend pipeline is cleared. Demand has transitioned into a high-volume October regime after the September peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/14. We are in the peak hoodie season (September/October), with demand consistently exceeding 200 units/period (P30-P35 average roughly 250). In-transit inventory stands at 1654 units, but significant phantom stock exists. Analysis of history confirms P1 (161), P3 (147), P4 (165), P13 (259), and P24 (164) shipments are lost, totaling 896 phantom units. Subtracting 896 from 1654 leaves a viable pipeline of 758 units (covering orders from P29, P34, P35). On-hand is 0 after P35 demand. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P32 order arrived P35, LT=3). To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite the 'In-transit' phantom stock inflation, I continue to use 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on the current high demand regime (~250 units/period) across (L+1) periods, then add the 896 unit deficit to force the backend to 'replace' the lost stock. Targeting a 3-period coverage (L=2) at 250 units/period + 896 deficit = 1646.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Confirmed that P29 (90 units) is now overdue (LT=7 if still coming), but P31 and P32 arrived. Pipeline status updated: phantom stock remains 896 (P1, P3, P4, P13, P24). Demand remains in high-volume October regime (avg ~250).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak seasonal regime for hoodies (October). Recent demand data shows a stabilization following the September surge, with Period 36 demand at 169. Over the last 4 periods, average demand is approximately 260 units. Current on-hand inventory is 253 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1398 is heavily distorted by 896 units of confirmed phantom stock (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P24). Subtracting phantom stock from the total in-transit leaves a viable pipeline of 502 units (P34 order of 246 units, P35 order of 422 units arrived P36, and P36 order of 166 units). Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods recently. To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite the phantom stock deficit, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock to cover demand for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods) plus a buffer for the 896 units of lost pipeline stock. Forecasted demand is ~210 units/period; hence base demand for 3 periods (~630) plus the 896 unit deficit equals ~1526 units. I will set mu_hat to 1526 to force the replacement of lost inventory and maintain service levels during the high-demand season.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late October, approaching the end of the peak season for 'Jersey Basic Hoodies'. Demand remains high but is tapering off from the September peak (Sept avg: 259, Oct avg: 213). Currently, P37 conclude shows 68 on-hand. The backend 'In-transit' figure of 1495 is heavily distorted by 896 units of 'phantom stock' (losses from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P24). The viable pipeline consists of orders from P34 (246), P36 (166), and P37 (97), totaling 509 units. Since the OR engine uses total pipeline (1495) to calculate orders, the 896 phantom units prevent it from placing necessary replacement orders. To counteract this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to effectively nullify the phantom stock and reflect current high demand. Target base stock should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~200 units/period (600 units), plus the 896 phantom units that the backend believes we have, totaling ~1496. Setting mu_hat to 1496 with the default L (2) will ensure the OR backend subtracts the 1495 'In-transit' and sees a need for a small buffer/correction or holds steady if we are sufficiently stocked. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to reflect the high volatility observed during this peak season.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, entering the late autumn/pre-holiday season. Historical demand for this hoodie peaked in September (avg ~250) and October (avg ~191). Recent demand (P36-P38) has averaged 168.7 units. The supply chain remains plagued by 'phantom stock'. The total confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P24) equals 896 units. Additionally, the P29 order (90 units) is now 10 periods old and clearly lost, bringing total phantom stock to 986 units. The backend sees 1529 units in-transit; subtracting 986 phantom units reveals a viable pipeline of 543 units (Orders from P34, P36, P38). With on-hand at 13, the effective inventory position is 556. To ensure we have enough stock for the next 3 periods (L+1) at a forecasted demand of ~170/period, we need ~510 units. However, the OR backend's capped policy uses its own in-transit data (1529); to force an order through this 'inflation', mu_hat must be set to at least 1529 + 170. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime and the 986-unit deficit to trigger necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total phantom stock estimate increased to 986 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P24, and now P29 with 90 units). November demand regime starting at ~150-170 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. The product is a hoodie, currently in a high-demand late autumn regime (P37-P39 demand: 185, 152, 175; avg ~171). The backend 'In-transit' figure of 1701 units is significantly inflated by 'phantom stock'\u2014shipments that were likely lost but still count against the ordering logic. Confirmed lost shipments include P1, P3, P4, P13, P24, and P29, totaling 986 units. Viable in-transit inventory is approximately 717 units (from P34, P38, P39). To ensure the OR backend places sufficient replacement orders despite this 986-unit 'phantom' inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. Specifically, mu_hat needs to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods plus the phantom deficit. With L=2 (promised and recently observed average), and a forecast of 171 units/period, the base mu_hat is 513. Adding the 986-unit deficit results in an explicit mu_hat of 1499. This will force the capped policy to recognize the actual stockout risk. Sigma_hat is set based on the volatility of the recent high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed phantom stock (lost shipments permanently in backend pipeline) is 986 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P24, P29). November demand (P37-P39) has stabilized at an average of 171 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18. Demand for the RICHIE HOOD has stabilized in a high November regime, with an average of 172 units over the last 4 periods (P37-P40). Total 'In-transit' is 1703 units, but my analysis confirms significant phantom stock due to lost shipments: P1 (161), P3 (147), P4 (165), P13 (259), P24 (164), and P29 (90). Total phantom stock is 986 units. Viable pipeline is actually 717 units (1703 - 986), primarily consisting of the large P39 order (340) and P38 (131). With on-hand inventory at 0 and high seasonal demand, the backend's perception of having 1703 units in transit prevents it from ordering enough. To force the OR backend to place a replacement order despite this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the required base stock to cover demand during lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods) at 172 units/period, then add the 986 phantom units to offset the backend's pipeline deduction. Calculation: (172 * 3) + 986 = 1502. This will ensure the backend triggers a replenishment order to maintain service levels during the winter season.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Richie Hood) is in its peak seasonal period (November). Recent demand (P39-P41) has averaged 192 units/period. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,363 units is heavily distorted by 986 units of confirmed 'phantom stock' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P24, and P29). Subtracting this phantom stock leaves an actual viable pipeline of 377 units. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, which subtracts the full pipeline (1,363) from the base stock, I must inflate mu_hat significantly. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom deficit. With L=2 and average demand ~192, target base stock is (3 * 192) + 986 \u2248 1562. Setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1562 ensures the backend sees a need for more units despite the 'in-transit' data. sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture current high volatility.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Richie Hood) has entered a massive seasonal demand spike at the end of November (Period 42 demand: 690), likely due to 'Black Friday' or similar major retail events. This follows a high October/November baseline of ~180. The inventory position is currently 0 on-hand with 1499 units in-transit. However, historical 'Carry-Over Insights' confirm that a significant portion of this in-transit inventory is 'phantom stock' (lost shipments that remain in the backend pipeline). Specifically, shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P24, and P29 (total 986 units) are confirmed lost. Therefore, the viable pipeline is only 1499 - 986 = 513 units. With demand hitting 690 and likely staying high through the December holiday season, we face a severe stockout. To force the OR backend (which is 'blind' to the 986 phantom units) to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 2500, which covers the 986 phantom units and provides a safety buffer for the 500-700 unit/period holiday demand regime across the review plus lead time (1+2=3 periods). L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike to 690 units confirmed (Black Friday event). Phantom stock remains at 986 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P24, P29). Viable pipeline is only 513 units against a total 'In-transit' of 1499.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 44 (Dec 9), following the Black Friday peak (P42, 690 units) and entering the December holiday demand phase. Demand in P43 settled at 156 units. My primary challenge is the significant 'Phantom Stock' in the backend's In-transit total. To date, shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P24, and P29 (986 units) are confirmed lost. The current internal 'In-transit' count of 2708 includes these 986 units plus legitimate orders from P34 (246), P42 (136), and P43 (1209). Since the OR backend subtracts the full 2708 from the base_stock calculation, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to ensure it still places orders. I estimate December demand to remain around 150-180 units per period. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the 986-unit deficit + 3 periods of expected demand (3 * 165 = 495), totaling 1481. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - 2708) doesn't result in zero orders when we actually need stock to arrive before the game ends in P47. Lead time remains approximately 2 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (Dec 16), we are in the peak hoodie season following Black Friday. Total In-transit is 2708 units, but 986 units of this are confirmed 'phantom stock' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P24, P29 that will never arrive). The actual viable pipeline is 1722 units (P34 order of 246 units is now 11 periods overdue and potentially lost, which would increase phantom stock to 1232). Recent demand (P43-P44) averages 202.5 units/period. The massive P43 order of 1209 units is expected in P45-P46. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 986 lost units as available stock and thus under-ordering, I must continue to inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to a value that covers expected demand (~200 units/period for L+1 periods) plus the total phantom deficit (986 units). I am using L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P39, P41) show lead times of 1-2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high volatility in winter demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: P34 order (246 units) is now 11 periods past the order date and likely lost; total phantom stock remains at 986 units but is being monitored for increase to 1232 if P34 doesn't arrive by P46. Current December demand regime is averaging ~200 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3795.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, 2019 (Period 46). Demand has stabilized after the Black Friday spike (P42: 690), with recent periods showing a consistent December average of ~254 units (P44: 249, P45: 257). On-hand inventory is healthy (1088 units) following the arrival of P42 and P43 orders. The systemic 'phantom stock' issue persists: the backend reports 1363 units in-transit, but 1232 of these are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P24, P29, and now P34 which is 12 periods overdue). This leaves only 131 units of viable in-transit stock (from the P38 order). To compensate for the 1232 units that the OR backend thinks are coming but actually aren't, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To cover the next 3 periods (L=2 + review period) at a forecasted demand of 260/period plus the 1232 unit deficit, mu_hat is set to 2012 (260 * 3 + 1232). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current demand volatility (std dev ~45 * sqrt(3) \u2248 78). Lead time (L) is kept at default (2) as recent arrivals (P42, P43) suggest lead times are aligning closely with the promised 2 periods again.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed phantom stock (lost shipments permanently in backend pipeline) increased to 1232 units as P34 (246 units) is now 12 periods past the order date. Demand has settled into a late-December regime averaging ~255 units/period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (late December). On-hand inventory is healthy at 930 units following the arrival of a large restock (1209 units) in Period 45. However, there is a massive 'phantom stock' issue in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation. As of Period 46, confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P24, P29, and now P34) total 1232 units. The 'In-transit' figure is 1536, but subtracting the 1232 phantom units reveals that only 304 units are actually viable (the P46 order of 173 plus potentially 131 from P38, though P38 is now 9 periods old and likely also lost - I will monitor P38 for one more period). To prevent the OR backend from erroneously stopping orders due to this 'In-transit' glut, mu_hat must be significantly inflated to cover the phantom deficit. Demand has stabilized post-Black Friday at an average of ~200 units/period (P44-P46 avg = 221). I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of real demand (~600) plus the 1232 unit deficit. I am setting L to 2 periods as recent arrivals (P39, P42, P43) averaged a 2.3-period lead time.
