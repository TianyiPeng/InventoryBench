Historical records show an increasing demand trend over the last five weeks (from 557 to 649 units). As we are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11), we are approaching the spring season when demand for denim often remains high or increases. The OR recommendation is 659 units based on a base-stock policy that factors in the promised lead time of 2 periods and the recent demand mean/standard deviation. Given that our current inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is zero, we must place a significant order to cover the lead time (L) plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). The OR recommendation of 659 appears to be a reasonable 'cap' to start building inventory without over-extending, especially since holding costs are $1.0 vs a $4.0 profit.

Demand is relatively stable. 3. Inventory Analysis: We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 1692 units in transit. We have experienced 1540 units of lost sales over the first three periods because nothing has arrived. 4. OR Recommendation: OR suggests 0 units because the pipeline (1692) exceeds the base-stock level calculated using the promised lead time (L=2). 5. Strategy: Since nothing has arrived yet despite being at L+1 for the first order, we are facing a stockout. However, ordering more now won't fix the immediate stockout due to the lead time. Given the large pipeline (1692 units) relative to 3-4 periods of demand (~1500-2000 units), we should wait for the first arrivals to confirm lead time before committed to more stock.

However, the Period 1 order (659 units) is notably absent from the 'conclude' messages.

In-transit is 1043 (comprised of P3: 384 units and P1: 659 units). If P1 is lost, effective in-transit is only 384. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand (pre-game) averaged 526. Game demand (P1-P4) averages 493. Demand is relatively stable for this 'Divided Collection' skinny denim item. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 381 units based on L=2 and historical stats. 5. Strategy: I must account for the likely loss of the 659 units from P1. Total Pipeline (assuming P1 lost) = 214 (on-hand) + 384 (P3) = 598. Target stock for L+1 (3 periods) at ~500/period = 1500 units. The OR recommendation of 381 is based on a pipeline that includes the phantom P1 units. By ordering the OR recommended 381 + replacing the lost 659 units, I would exceed the cap. However, looking at the OR logic, it likely sees the 1043 in-transit and subtracts it.

Demand Analysis: Demand spiked significantly in Period 8 (795 units) compared to the historical average (approx. 515 units).

P10(800) is the only valid unit in-transit (ordered P10, expected arrival P11 or P12).\n2. **Inventory Analysis**: On-hand inventory is 725.

The historical average including the pre-period data is approximately 535 units/period. The current high on-hand (725) and valid pipeline (800) cover approximately 2.8 periods of average demand.\n4. **Collaboration Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it includes all 1843 units in the pipeline (overestimating stock by including lost orders). However, even after excluding the 1043 lost units, the valid inventory of 1525 is still sufficient to cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods).

The order placed in P10 (800 units) is expected to arrive during P12 conclude (ETA P13 observation), as it has been 2 periods since the order. Current 'In-transit' is 1843, but only P10 (800 units) is within the reliable window. Others (P1, P3, and possibly some later accounting discrepancies) are likely lost based on historical supply instability.\n2. Demand Analysis: The SKU is jade skinny denim trousers. Recent demand has stabilized after a peak in P8 (795). P10 (425) and P11 (385) show a cooling trend compared to the spring peak. The historical mean (excluding the P8 spike) is around 480. \n3. Inventory & OR Analysis: Starting on-hand is 340. The OR suggests 0 units because it views the 1843 in-transit units as covering everything. However, most of that pipeline is likely phantom inventory from lost shipments. Given current on-hand (340) and expected demand (~450), a stockout will occur in Period 12. Although the P10 order (800) should arrive during P12, ensuring coverage for P13 (another ~450) is necessary. \n4. Strategy: Total need for P12 and P13 is approximately 900 units. Current on-hand is 340 and P10 arrival is 800 (total 1140). This covers the immediate two periods.

This means only 1250 units (P10 and P12) are reliably in the pipeline. 2. **Lead-Time Inference**: Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P8 and P9 both arrived at/before P10). P10 (ordered 2019-04-15) is now overdue if L=2, suggesting it should arrive during this Period 13 resolution. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand has slowed significantly from the early April peak (from 795 down to 353), likely due to the passing of the spring denim rush. Average demand over the last 3 periods is ~387 units. 4. **OR Recommendation Reconcilation**: OR suggests 0 units because it counts the full (mostly lost) 'In-transit' amount. By correcting the pipeline to 1250 units (P10+P12) and assuming P10 arrives now, we have 450 units arriving in P14.

P10 specifically is now significantly overdue (6 periods since order), suggesting it might also be lost, despite the improved stability mentioned in P12 insights.\n\n2. Demand Analysis: Demand has dropped significantly in recent weeks (P11-P13: 385, 353, 280) compared to the April peak (Avg ~600-800). This suggests the spring denim surge has subsided.

At Period 24 decision phase, looking ahead to L+1 (3) periods of demand: recent demand has stabilized at ~330 units per week. Therefore, the required stock to cover demand until the next order arrives is approximately 3 * 330 = 990 units. Total viable inventory (848 on-hand + 250 in-transit) equals 1098 units. This is slightly above the target level. Ordering 0 units is appropriate this period to let on-hand inventory draw down, as the current stock plus the reliable incoming shipment from Period 23 is sufficient to cover the next three weeks of demand (~990 units).",

However, checking recent history, P29 (ordered 2019-08-26) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived in the P32 conclude message. Given the history of lost shipments (P1, P3, P10 etc.), P29 is likely lost as well. Therefore, the only reliable in-transit order is the 500 units placed in P32. With only 49 units on hand and demand hovering around 500, I need to order to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period. Total expected demand for P33, P34, and P35 is approximately 1500 units. Current reliable inventory (On-hand 49 + P32 order 500) equals 549. This leaves a gap of roughly 950 units.

With recent demand averaging around 535 units over the last 6 periods (including a peak of 781), 151 units is insufficient for Period 36. An arrival of 850 units (P33) is highly likely this period or next. If P33 arrives this period, we will have ~1,000 units against ~535 demand, which is safe. If P33 is delayed, we stock out again. Considering the high loss rate (~50%) and the goal to cover demand through the 2-period lead time (Periods 36, 37, 38), and that we already have three massive orders (2,550 units total) in the immediate pipeline, adding more orders now would drastically over-stock if the current instability resolves.

However, with a lead time of 1-3 periods and current inventory only covering ~2.5 periods, placing a small order now is prudent to avoid a stockout in 3 weeks, especially as we approach potential year-end demand shifts. I will override the OR's 0 and order 300 units to maintain a safety buffer, assuming the true pipeline is empty.",

Historical demand analysis shows a current stable regime of approximately 300 units per week (average of the last five periods: 297 units). The current on-hand inventory is 490 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 5,143 is highly misleading due to a long history of supply instability and lost shipments. Based on the Carry-Over Insights, approximately 5,693 units have been identified as confirmed or highly probable losses throughout the game's history. Subtracting these from the current total in-transit suggests that the only active, reliable order in the pipeline is the 300 units placed in Period 41. Therefore, total reliable inventory (on-hand + realistic pipeline) is 490 + 300 = 790 units. With lead time (L) observed around 2-3 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 42 and the subsequent 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods). Projected demand for 3 periods is approximately 900 units (300 * 3). Our current reliable inventory of 790 units leaves a deficit of 110 units. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it includes the 'phantom' in-transit units in its logic.

Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory analysis is critical: 'In-transit' shows 5,543 units, but according to carry-over insights, at least 5,693 units are confirmed lost/overdue from earlier periods.
