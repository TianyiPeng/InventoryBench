The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a super-skinny high-waisted denim trouser from the H&M Divided collection. Historical data from Jan-Feb 2019 shows a demand range of 438 to 649, with a recent upswing in the last recorded historical week (Period 2019-02-04: 649 units). The current period date is 2019-02-11, which is the start of the Spring season in fashion retail and leads into Valentine's day. Promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now in P1 will arrive during P3's arrival phase and be available for sale in P3 (visible in P4 start). To cover demand for P1, P2, and P3 (L+1 periods), and accounting for the recent upward trend in historical demand (avg ~526, latest 649), I need to establish a pipeline. Since P1 and P2 demand will be lost anyway (0 inventory), I must order enough to cover P3 demand and safety stock once the shipment arrives. Target coverage: ~650 units/period * 3 periods = 1950. However, since I cannot fulfill P1/P2 demand, I will aim for a robust initial stock for P3 delivery.",

As high-waisted skinny jeans are staple items, demand is relatively stable but can fluctuate with seasonal transitions. Feb-April often sees a pick-up in spring shopping. b) Demand Regime Analysis: Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averaged ~523 units. Recent demand (P1: 544, P2: 545) is very stable and slightly higher than the historical average, suggesting a consistent regime around 545/week. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 (Feb 11) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase (visible in P4 start). Order placed in P2 (Feb 18) is expected in P4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and are losing sales (1089 units lost so far). d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: Total pipeline (In-transit) is 2700. On-hand is 0. Projected arrivals: P3 (1900), P4 (800). e) Final Order Logic: We need to cover demand for Period 3 (current), Period 4, and Period 5 (earliest arrival for a P3 order, given L=2). Total projected demand for P3-P5 is ~1635 (545 * 3). Our current pipeline of 2700 units is more than enough to cover this and build a safety stock once arrivals begin. Ordering more now would likely lead to excessive holding costs in P5/P6 given the $1/unit/period cost vs $4 profit.",

Jeans are generally consistent year-round but can see a slight uptick as consumers refresh wardrobes for Spring. b) Demand Regime: Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averaged ~522 units/week (Range: 438-649). Since Period 1, observed demand has been 544, 545, and 451 (average 513). Expect demand to hover around 500-550. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (Period 1) should arrive during P3's resolution and be visible in P4's start. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0', meaning the P1 order (1900 units) is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Order P2 (800 units) is also in transit. d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0 due to lead time lag. In-transit is 2700 (1900 from P1 + 800 from P2). e) Order Logic: We have 2700 units in the pipeline. With a mean demand of ~520, 2700 units cover roughly 5.2 periods. Given the current 0 on-hand status and the stockouts in P1-P3, we urgently need the P1 order to arrive. Adding more to the pipeline now (P4) would not solve the immediate stockout and might lead to excessive holding costs if the delayed orders arrived simultaneously.

Demand analysis of the 5 historical periods (557, 438, 489, 500, 649) and the 4 game periods (544, 545, 451, 435) suggests a mean demand of approximately 510 units per week. There is no immediate seasonal peak expected in mid-March, though general spring fashion interest remains steady. Regarding lead time: the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2, as promised). However, the Period 1 order (1900 units) failed to arrive in Period 3 (when lead_time was promised to be 2) and remains in 'In-transit' as of Period 5 start. This suggests the 1900-unit order is either significantly delayed or lost. I have 365 units on hand. With an average demand of ~510, I face a likely stockout in Period 5 since the next expected arrival (if any) is the missing Period 1 order. To cover the risk of the Period 1 order being lost and to ensure stock for the next 3 weeks (current period + 2-period lead time = 1530 units total), I need to place an order. Pipeline calculation: On-hand (365) + In-transit (1900, though suspect). If I assume 1900 is lost, I need ~1165 units. However, if 1900 arrives, I'd be overstocked ($1/unit holding). Given the 'Lost orders never produce a conclude' rule and the fact that it is 2 periods overdue, I will treat the 1900 as likely lost but hedge slightly to avoid massive holding costs. I will order 1200 units to reset the pipeline based on the 2-period lead time and average demand.",

Recent actual demand (P4-P6) has stabilized around 453 units/week. I will forecast a conservative mean of 465 for the next three periods. c) Lead Time: Promised L=2. While P5 order arrived in 1 period (L=1), the P2 order arrived in 2 periods (L=2) and P1 was lost. I will plan based on L=2 for safety. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 739. In-transit consists of 700 units (ordered P6, expected P8) and 1500 units (ordered P6, expected P8? Wait, the history says P6 order was 1500, but in-transit total is 3400? Let's re-verify).

Lead time analysis confirms a variable lead time of 1-2 periods (Period 5 and 9 arrived in 1 period; Periods 2, 6, and 8 arrived in 2 periods).

Specifically, an order of 800 was placed in Period 10 and is expected to arrive now in Period 13 resolution. With current demand averaging 370 units, the on-hand stock (701) plus the incoming 800 units will total roughly 1500 units by start of Period 14. This covers nearly 4 periods of demand at the current rate (1500 / 370 \u2248 4).

Current demand in Periods 24-25 (178 and 236 units) reflects a mid-summer low, significantly below the previous baseline of ~330. I expect demand to remain in the 200-250 range for the next few weeks before potentially recovering in late August for back-to-school. Lead time is confirmed as 1-2 periods. Inventory check: On-hand is 259. There are 4375 units 'In-transit', but history shows significant lost orders (P1: 1900, P10: 800, P17: 700, P19: 200). Adjusting for these confirmed/likely losses (1900+800+700+200 = 3600), the 'effective' in-transit is closer to 775 (P20: 575, P21: 300 have arrived; P23: 450, P24: 325 remain). My target stock for (L+1) periods (3 weeks) including safety stock is approximately 750 (250 units/week * 3). On-hand (259) + active pipeline (P23: 450, P24: 325 = 775) totals 1034 units.

Therefore, the effective in-transit is 325 units (P24 order). Our current position is On-hand (449) + Effective In-Transit (325) = 774 units.

  "rationale": "The SKU 706016002 is a high-waisted skinny denim item. We are currently in late October (Period 38, Oct 28). Analysis of the demand regime shows that the high autumn peak (which saw demand up to 781) has cooled down. The last three periods (P35-37) show stabilized demand at 349, 325, and 341 units respectively, averaging approximately 338 units per week. The pipeline analysis shows that multiple historical orders (P1, P10, P17, P19, P24, P29) totaling 5425 units are confirmed lost/invalid. The active in-transit pipeline consists of: P34 (1300 units, placed 4 periods ago, potentially delayed or lost but still within a risk window), P36 (300 units), and P37 (200 units). Given the promised lead time is 2 but actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3, I need to ensure coverage for the next 3 periods (current P38 + Lead Time). Targeted inventory for 3 periods at 340 units/period is 1020 units. On-hand is 285. If we assume the P34 order (1300 units) is delayed but may still arrive (it is 4 weeks old), the pipeline is technically overfilled. However, given the high rate of lost shipments for this SKU, relying on an order that is 2 periods past its promised delivery is risky. I will treat P34 as likely lost to ensure service levels. Active pipeline: P36 (300) + P37 (200) = 500 units. Total projected position: 285 (OH) + 500 (Active IT) = 785 units. To reach a safe stock level of ~1050 (3 weeks of demand plus small safety buffer), an order of 250-300 is appropriate.",

Previous seasons showed a decline toward the end of the year, although November data is not yet fully available for this year.

Subtracting these from the total 6540 leaves a realistic pipeline of 1115 units. This includes orders from P34 (1300 units, significantly overdue at 5 periods, potentially lost but P35 arrived at L=3, so we must monitor it), P36 (300 units), and P38 (265 units). Assuming P34 is lost like previous large orders, the working pipeline is only ~565 units. Inventory on hand is 181. Target inventory for a 3-period coverage (L+1) at a 330/week rate is 990 units.
