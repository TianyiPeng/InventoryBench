This sharp increase coincides with the run-up to Valentine's Day (Feb 14th) and the general Spring fashion refresh. Period 1 starts on Feb 11th. Demand is currently in a high-growth regime, likely peaking or plateauing around 100-120 units. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover demand for the next 3 periods (L+1 = 3), I need to account for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 demand. Given the trend (71 -> 102), I'll estimate demand for P1/P2/P3 at ~110 units each. Total requirement = 330 units. Since current on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will order 330 units to establish stock and pipeline.",

  "rationale": "Product 639448001 is a 'Spacious handbag'. Historical demand for Jan 2019 was low (1-22) but spiked significantly at the end of Jan/start of Feb (71-102). In Period 1 (Feb 11) and Period 2 (Feb 18), realized demand was 86 and 118 respectively. This aligns with a Spring transition/Valentine's Day demand period for accessories. Currently, on-hand is 0 with 450 units in transit (330 ordered P1, 120 ordered P2). Promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the logic: P1 order (L=2) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in P4 starting status. Since demand is currently around 100-120 units/week and we expect 330 units to arrive this period (available for P3 demand), the current pipeline (450) covers approximately 4 weeks of demand. We need to maintain a pipeline that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to avoid stockouts. With 0 on-hand and 450 in transit, we have enough to handle P3 (approx 120), P4 (approx 120), and P5 (approx 120), leaving a small buffer. However, the demand trend is slightly upward. I will place a conservative order to ensure continuity while waiting for the P1 delivery to confirm lead time.",

Historical demand data suggests a significant regime shift starting in late January: demand went from ~1-2 units to 22, 71, and 102 units. Realized demand in Period 1-3 was 86, 118, and 55. This decline in Period 3 (55) might be a temporary fluctuation or stock-out artifact, but the overall trend for women's large accessories is generally strong in spring. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed: P1=330, P2=120, P3=50. Total in-transit = 500. According to the timeline, the P1 order (330) was scheduled to arrive in P3 resolution but was not reported in the 'Period 3 conclude' message (which only reports what happened DURING P3). Therefore, P1's order should arrive DURING Period 4 (this period) and be visible in P5's start. This fits a 3-period observation delay for a 2-period lead time. Current on-hand is 0, demand is unsatisfied. I expect ~330 units to arrive this period to satisfy demand. Estimated weekly demand is ~100. Pipeline (500) covers roughly 5 weeks.

Given the lead time of ~2 periods and the rising demand trend (10 in P25, 24 in P26), I need to re-stock to capture the late-summer/autumn recovery.

Shipment loss remains a critical factor: total cumulative lost units are 763 (P1: 330, P3: 50, P13: 60, P14: 50, P17: 45, P29: 100, P34: 128). Subtracting these from the system 'In-transit' of 1048 leaves a reliable pipeline of 285 units (P38: 100, P39: 120, and likely the P37 zero-order). Inventory on hand is 51. Total reliable supply (on-hand 51 + reliable in-transit 220 from P38/P39) is 271 units. Given a 3-period lead time risk and weekly demand of ~85, I need to cover ~340 units of demand over the next lead time window (L+1).

These 405 units consist of orders from P38 (100), P39 (120), and P40 (120), plus an residual 65 units (likely P37 being a late arrival or further lost, but the P38-40 orders are the main focus). Recent lead times have stabilized around 2-3 periods (P36 arrived in 3 periods). For Period 41, I expect demand to remain in the 60-80 range.

We just observed a major demand spike in Period 42 (221 units), which was followed by a sharp drop to 18 and 14 units in Periods 43 and 44. This pattern strongly suggests that the 'Holiday Spike' for this SKU occurred early (possibly for Black Friday/Cyber Monday or early December shopping) and has now peaked, with demand reverting to a much lower baseline as the season concludes. Historically, summer demand was extremely low (<10), while autumn steady-state was ~70.
