To cover three periods of demand and establish a safety stock for the upward trend, I need approximately 450-500 units.

The Period 1 demand was 99. The current date is Feb 18, 2019, which is early spring/transition season for retail, where interest in skirts and denim typically climbs towards the warmer months. Given the previous 5 weeks and Period 1's 99, the average demand is roughly 125-150 units per week. The promised lead time is 2 periods. This means an order placed in Period 1 (500 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible in P4). An order placed now (Period 2) will arrive during Period 4 (visible in P5). My current inventory is 0 on-hand and 500 in-transit. I have missed 99 units of sales in Period 1 due to 0 starting inventory. To cover demand for Periods 2, 3, and 4 (the L+1 window), and accounting for the rising trend, I estimate demand at ~150/week. Total demand to cover: 150 * 3 = 450 units. Since I have 500 units arriving in Period 3, I am technically covered for that window. However, I need to build a small buffer because of the stockout in P1 and potential continued growth in spring demand. I will place a moderate order to ensure a rolling pipeline.",

Demand analysis shows a significant surge starting in late March; while Period 7 demand was 273, Period 8 saw a dip to 126, likely due to stockout recovery or weekly variance. However, historical pre-game data showed a rising trend leading into February (reaching ~150), and the jump to ~270 indicates a new high-season regime. I will forecast demand at approximately 200-250 units per week for the near term. Lead time is variable between 1 and 2 periods (P5 and P7 arrived in 1 period, P2 and P6 arrived in 2 periods). Pipeline: Currently on-hand is 374. In-transit is 850 units (all ordered in Period 8). Since the Period 8 order of 350 units arrived in Period 8 (concluded), the current 'In-transit' of 850 must consist of the Period 8 order (350) which is already accounted for in on-hand? No, the 'In-transit' field usually reflects units yet to be delivered as of the start of P9. In Period 8 I ordered 350. Looking at P8 conclude: Arrived units were 350 (from P6) and 150 (from P7). The In-transit of 850 reflects the order placed at the start of Period 8 (350). Wait, 350 + 500 (from P1)? P1's 500 is likely lost.

Looking at history, no 500-unit order was placed recently. Wait, P1's order was 500. If that order is still considered 'In-transit' but lost, it inflates the pipeline.

Current on-hand inventory is 0. Assessment of the 'In-transit' quantity (770) shows several lost or extremely overdue shipments: Period 1 (500), Period 29 (50), and Period 34 (120). Excluding these 'dead' orders, the active pipeline consists of the Period 39 order (100). Actual observed lead times fluctuate heavily between 1-3 periods. To cover the current demand regime (~60-70 units/period) for the next 3 periods (L+1), we need approximately 180-210 units. With 0 on-hand and 100 in reliable transit (leaving a 110-unit gap), I will order 120 units to secure stock for the late November period, accounting for potential stockouts if lead times stretch to 3 periods again.",

Historical data from P33 onwards shows autumn demand fluctuates between 35-90 units, with a recent average (P37-P40) around 53 units/period. The current 'In-transit' figure of 890 units is misleading because it includes several likely lost orders: Period 1 (500 units), Period 29 (50 units), and Period 34 (120 units), totaling 670 lost units. The reliable active pipeline consists of orders from Period 39 (100 units) and Period 40 (120 units). As of P41 START, On-hand is 0. Period 39 order is expected to arrive in Period 41 or 42 (lead time 2-3). Period 40 order is expected by Period 42 or 43. Total demand for the L+1 period coverage (Periods 41, 42, 43) is estimated at 165 units (55 avg * 3). Reliable pipeline (220) currently covers this, but on-hand is 0, causing stockouts.

The P41 order is likely to arrive in Period 43 or 44. Since demand is currently volatile but generally expected to trend lower in December, I need to restock to cover the gap left by the P42 spike while accounting for the valid pipeline of 220 units.

The 'In-transit' count of 770 is misleading, as 670 units are confirmed lost (P1: 500, P29: 50, P34: 120). Thus, the effective pipeline is only the 100 units ordered in P43. Lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods recently.
