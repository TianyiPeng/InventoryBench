Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear). Historically, demand has shown a steady upward trend over the last 5 samples: 31, 60, 70, 64, 68. The initial mean for these 5 samples is approximately 58.6. Given the product category (underwear) and the current date (post-holiday/early year), the demand seems to be stabilizing around a higher level compared to the first week of January. I will use the recent N=4 samples to capture this newer, higher demand level (avg ~65.5) more accurately than the full history which includes the low outlier of 31. The promised lead time is 2, and since there is no observed lead time data yet, I will use the 'default' lead time setting. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=4 to reflect the current demand regime (65.5 per period * (1+L)).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Ellen Thong (Malva) L 3pk', a women's lingerie item. Looking at the history (including the seed samples), demand has been relatively stable but on an upward trend (31, 60, 70, 64, 68, and now 48 in Period 1). The average of the last 5 samples (excluding the most recent 48) is ~66. The Period 1 demand of 48 resulted in 48 lost sales because on-hand inventory was 0. A shipment of 73 units was placed in Period 1 and is in-transit. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, this shipment is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Since we currently have 0 on-hand and 73 in-transit, and demand is approximately 60-70 units per week, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 180-210 units). I will use recent_N for mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture the recent mean (~62 including the P1 dip) and default for L and sigma_hat to maintain stability while we wait for the first arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history shows a steady trend: 31, 60, 70, 64, 68 (historical) and 48, 69 (recent). Average weekly demand is approximately 59 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals from orders in Period 1 and Period 2 (Lead Time = 2) are not yet visible. Based on the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 should arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclusion (which we will see in Period 4). Total in-transit is 160 (73 from P1 + 87 from P2). mu_hat should cover (1+L) = 3 periods of demand. Using an average of 60/week, mu_hat = 180. sigma_hat is set to capture recent volatility over the last 5 samples.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a pack of women's lingerie/underwear. Reviewing history: orders were placed in P1 (73 units), P2 (87 units), and P3 (58 units). The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, the P1 order (L=2) should have arrived during P3 and been visible at the start of P4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. This suggests either a lead time delay or a lost shipment. Since the item launched with 0 on-hand and has experienced 3 periods of lost sales (demand ~60-70 units per week), we are currently in a stockout. I will explicitly set the lead time to 3 to account for the delay seen with the P1 order and use the last 5 demand samples (including pre-game) to estimate mu_hat. The average demand across the 5 samples is approx 58.6. For a (1+L) = 4 period window, mu_hat = ~234.4.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Lingerie (3pk Underwear)'. Current date is 2019/3/11. The promised lead time is 2. Observation from Period 4 conclude shows that the order from Period 2 arrived (lead_time=2), but the order from Period 1 (73 units) is noticeably missing, as it should have arrived in Period 3 or 4. This indicates a lost shipment for Period 1. Historical demand samples (31, 60, 70, 64, 68) plus live demand (48, 69, 64, 63) suggest a stable mean demand around 60-65 units per week. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent stabilized demand (ignoring the lower initial sample) and set L to 'default' since the one successful arrival matched the promised lead time of 2. Despite the lost Period 1 shipment, the pipeline (192 units) consists of orders from P3 (58) and P4 (61) plus the new order from this period. I will maintain a standard base stock to recover from the stockout caused by the lost P1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (73 units) likely lost - failed to arrive by Period 4 conclude (expected L=2).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The SKU is women's underwear. Historical demand shows a consistent range (31-70). Current demand reflects a stable regime: the last 5 periods averaged 62.2 units (48, 69, 64, 63, 67). Shipments: Period 1 (73 units) is definitely lost (missed expected P3 and late P4/P5 arrival windows). Period 2 (87 units) arrived in P4 (L=2). Period 3 (58 units) was expected in P5 but did not arrive, and Period 4 (61 units) is expected in P6. On-hand is 0. Pipeline is 192, but effectively 119 if we treat P3 (58 units) as potentially delayed/lost (though we only confirm loss after 3 periods of delay). I will use L=2 (promised) as confirmed by P2's arrival. mu_hat will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stable demand mean of ~62.2 (Total mu_hat for L+1=3 periods \u2248 186.6). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current demand level while ignoring the initial lower pre-game samples.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 3 (58 units) delayed: failed to arrive by Period 5 conclude (expected L=2). Monitoring for loss.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), we are managing 'Ellen Thong' (Womens Underwear). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand (Periods 1-6 + pre-game samples) remains stable between 60-70 units per week. The supply chain is highly unstable: 1) Period 1 order (73 units) is officially considered lost (6 periods elapsed). 2) Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2). 3) Period 3 order (58 units) is now 2 periods overdue (calculated L should be 2, currently 4), suggesting either a severe delay or another loss. 4) Period 4 order (61 units) is due now (Period 6 conclude), but did not arrive, indicating L >= 3 for that shipment. Because of these failures, in-transit inventory (211 units from P3, P4, P6) is likely inflated by ghost units that will never arrive. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the observed slowing of the supply chain and use 'recent_N' (N=5) for demand to capture the recent consistency around 63-68 units (P2-P6). I am ignoring the pre-game January peak as demand has stabilized lower in February/March.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 shipment (58 units) is 2 periods overdue; likely lost or severe supply chain disruption. Period 4 shipment (61 units) is 1 period overdue. Reliability is low.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. The product is Women's Lingerie (underwear). Historical demand is stable, averaging around 60 units/period (mean of all samples is 57.7, mean of game history is 60.4). Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: P1 (73 units) and P3 (58 units) shipments are confirmed lost or indefinite delays (P3 is now 3 periods overdue). P4 (61 units) is 2 periods overdue and also highly suspect. P2 (87 units) arrived on time (L=2). Due to repeated losses, 'in-transit' of 270 units is misleading; at least 131 units (P1, P3) are effectively dead stock, and P4 is likely lost too. I will set L=4 to reflect the significantly increased cycle time needed to buffer against these losses/delays. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current stable rate (~62 units/period) and provide a conservative sigma to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger new orders despite the phantom pipe-line inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: P1 (73 units), P3 (58 units), and P4 (61 units) shipments have failed to arrive as of P7 conclude. Effective in-transit inventory is significantly lower than reported due to likely lost orders.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/08. Demand for this SKU (Womens Lingerie) has been stable, averaging 60.5 units over the last 8 periods. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable. As of Period 8 conclude, we have confirmation that orders from P6 (lead_time 2) and P7 (lead_time 1) arrived, while orders from P1, P3, and P4 remain missing and are now considered lost. These lost units (73+58+61 = 192) are still counted as 'In-transit' (270 total - P8 order 78 = 192), which prevents the OR backend from ordering more because it believes the pipeline is full. To fix this, I will set 'L' to 'explicit' with a value of 2 to match the promised lead time, but I will set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that bypasses the inflated pipeline calculation. The goal is to cover $(L+1) = 3$ periods of demand (approx 180 units) plus a safety buffer. Current physical on-hand is 25. The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock'. Since 'In-transit' is 270 (mostly ghost units), I must set 'mu_hat' high enough to force an order that replenishes the stock. I am targeting a base stock of roughly 450 to offset the 192 lost units and still reach a safety-adjusted target for 3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain reliability split: P1, P3, P4 orders (192 units) confirmed lost as of P8. P6 and P7 arrived normally or early (L=1, L=2). Ghost inventory of 192 units persists in pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10, the supply chain reliability is highly volatile. History shows three major shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (total 192 units) are definitively lost as they are far beyond the promised L=2. Conversely, recent shipments from P6 and P7 arrived quickly (L=2 and L=1 respectively). The current 'In-transit' of 433 units includes these 192 lost 'ghost' units, meaning physical in-transit inventory is actually 241 units. Demand has recently softened from a mean of ~60 to 28 last period, likely due to post-seasonal cooling for this underwear SKU. I am setting L to 2 (promised) to stabilize. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=3 to capture the lower demand trend (avg ~44) while providing enough units to recover from the current stockout. I am setting an explicit sigma_hat of 15 per period (scaled to 26.0 for L=2) to handle the demand uncertainty during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean demand decreased from ~60 to ~44 over the last 3 periods following a seasonal peak. Supply chain remains bifurcated: old orders (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost; newer orders (P6, P7) arrive with L=1-2.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the supply chain has stabilized for new orders with lead times of 1-2 periods, while orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 192 units) are definitively lost. These lost units constitute the 'In-transit' figure, meaning the 'pipeline_inventory' used by the OR engine is actually zero. I have on-hand inventory of 201 units. Demand has shifted from a high of ~60-70 units/week during Feb/March to a lower post-seasonal regime of ~40 units/week (last three periods: 28, 40, and the previous history sample showing a decline). I will set L to 'calculate' as recent shipments (P6-P9) have arrived on time or early. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the lower demand regime (avg ~44 units/week), and sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the lower volatility in this new regime. The high on-hand inventory (201 units) relative to current demand (~44) will correctly lead the OR engine to place zero or minimal orders this period, allowing stock to drawdown.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal demand regime confirmed: Avg demand decreased from ~60 to ~40 units/week starting Period 9. Pipeline inventory consists entirely of lost orders (P1, P3, P4 totaling 192 units); actual effective pipeline is zero.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/4/29), the SKU 'Ellen Thong (Malva) L 3pk' (underwear) shows a demand stabilization around 40-50 units following a post-Spring peak. The last three periods (P9-P11) had demands of 28, 40, and 54, averaging 40.6 units. The reported 'In-transit' inventory of 192 units consists entirely of lost orders from Period 1 (73), Period 3 (58), and Period 4 (61), which are now over 8 weeks old. The real pipeline is zero because recent orders from P8 and P9 have already arrived (both with L=1 or 2). On-hand inventory is 147 units. Given the actual demand trend (~40/week), 147 units covers roughly 3.6 weeks of demand. With a lead time of 2, we need to cover 3 periods (L+1). Target inventory = (2+1) * 40.6 = ~122 units. Since 147 > 122, the OR logic should not order more, but the 'In-transit' value of 192 is 'ghost inventory' that will prevent the backend from ordering in the future once on-hand drops. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime and the need to eventually ignore the 192 lost units. For this period, no order is needed, so I will use a 4-week mean for mu_hat (N=4) to reflect the current lower demand level.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Demand for women's lingerie (underwear) is stabilizing after a post-seasonal drop. Looking at the last four periods (9-12), demand was 28, 40, 54, 57 (average ~45 units). This confirms the demand regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (from ~60 to ~40-45). Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' quantity of 192 units consists entirely of lost orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (73 + 58 + 61 = 192). These are 'ghost' units that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from its order calculation. However, on-hand inventory is currently high (90 units). With a lead time of 2 periods and demand around 45, on-hand stock covers roughly 2 periods of future demand. Since the OR engine's 'base_stock' will likely be lower than the 'In-transit' 192, it will order 0 anyway. I will set L=2 (promised), mu_hat to reflect the recent demand of ~45 (N=4), and sigma_hat based on recent volatility to prevent unnecessary holding costs given the high on-hand balance.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-13. Historical demand analysis shows a post-seasonal drop between Periods 9-11 (mean ~40), but the last two periods (Period 12: 57, Period 13: 65) indicate demand is returning to its baseline mean of ~60. I will prioritize the last 5 samples to capture this recovery while acknowledging the higher variance. Regarding the supply chain, on-hand inventory is low (25 units). The 'In-transit' figure of 192 units is composed of orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4, which are long-confirmed lost (as noted in Carry-over Insights). The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see this 192 and refuse to order unless I intervene. To bypass this 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Since L=2, the backend expects the formula (1+L) * mean. To force an order when the pipeline is 'ghosted', I must provide an explicit mu_hat = (forecasted_need + ghost_inventory). Forecasted demand for L+1 periods is ~180 (60 * 3). Adding the 192 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 372. This ensures the OR logic (372 - 192 = 180) targets the correct physical base stock of 180 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand returning to baseline: Periods 12-13 saw demand (57, 65) return to the pre-drop average of ~60 units/week.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507883014' (Women's Underwear) is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). Recent demand analysis shows a recovery from a mid-April dip (~40 units) back to strong pre-seasonal levels: demand in Periods 13 and 14 was 65 and 83 units, respectively. The average of the last 4 periods (P11-P14) is 64.75 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this return to high demand. For lead time, I am using the 'calculate' method as history shows a mix of 1 and 2 periods (avg 1.6). Regarding the pipeline: the 'in-transit' of 341 units includes 192 units confirmed lost (P1: 73, P3: 58, P4: 61) which the OR backend will incorrectly count as valid inventory. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this 'ghost' inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for sigma_hat with a high value (250). Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and critical fractile q is high (0.95), this inflated sigma_hat will raise the target base stock high enough to offset the 192 lost units and trigger a necessary replenishment order to address the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P11-P14 average is ~65 units/week, returning to pre-April levels. Ghost inventory of 192 units (P1, P3, P4) persists in pipeline and must be accounted for by inflating target stocks.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507883014' (Women's Underwear) is experiencing a massive demand spike associated with late May/early June. Period 15 demand surged to 140 units, more than double the previous average of ~60. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, meaning we have missed demand for the last two periods. The pipeline shows 606 units (including 192 'ghost' units from lost orders P1, P3, P4). Recent actual arrivals (P8, P9) showed lead times of 1-2 periods. I need to aggressively raise target inventory to catch the surging demand and compensate for the lost pipeline units. To do this, I set L=3 (explicit) to reflect recent lead time plus a buffer for supply chain unreliability, and mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the high-growth trajectory (avg of P13-15 is ~96 units/period). This will trigger a large order to satisfy the new demand level and refill the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P15 demand spiked to 140 (+115% vs prior average), likely seasonal. Ghost inventory of 192 units (P1, P3, P4) remains in pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: The SKU is women's underwear. Demand has surged significantly in the last two periods (P15: 140, P16: 112), well above the historic baseline of ~60. This aligns with early June seasonality. On-hand inventory is 0, and current in-transit is 606 units. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 192 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and represent 'ghost inventory', meaning the true effective pipeline is 414 units (composed of P14: 149 and P15: 265). These orders are still within a reasonable window for arrival given the erratic supply chain (L for P8-P9 was 1-2, but P14-P15 have not arrived as of P16 conclude). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed variability (L=1 and L=2 seen recently). For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent spike (average ~111 units/week), as using the full history would severely underforecast during this peak. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to reflect the increased volatility associated with this surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge remains sustained: P15-P16 average 126 units/period compared to historical 60 (+110%). Ghost inventory of 192 units (P1, P3, P4) still persists in pipeline data.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current average demand over the last three periods (P15-P17) is approximately 105 units/period (140, 112, 62), reflecting a significant seasonal surge from the prior baseline of 60. Although demand dropped to 62 in P17, the prior two weeks were over 110, suggesting high volatility during this season. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture this recent high-demand regime while accounting for the recent drop. A known 'ghost inventory' of 192 units (orders from P1, P3, and P4) persists in the pipeline but is confirmed lost; this artificially inflates the 'In-transit' count. Since the OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit), the presence of these 192 lost units will cause the system to under-order. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat using an 'explicit' value. My target base stock is (L+1) * 105 = 315. To counteract the 192 ghost units, I must add them to the mu_hat calculation or value. mu_hat = 315 + 192 = 507. This ensures the OR backend places an order that ignores the lost units. I set sigma_hat explicitly high (sqrt(3)*40 \u2248 70) to account for the high volatility observed in the last three weeks.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for this SKU has transitioned from a sharp seasonal spike (P15-P16: avg 126) back toward a stabilized higher baseline (P17-P18: avg 71.5). The average demand over the last four periods (P15-P18) is 98.75. The pipeline inventory of 420 units includes the 'ghost inventory' of 192 units (P1, P3, P4) which are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is actually 228 units (420 - 192). To compensate for the 192-unit deficit in the OR engine's logic (which assumes all 420 units will arrive), I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period coverage (L=2 + 1) using the recent demand mean of ~99, which equals 297 units. To force the OR engine to order despite the ghost inventory, I set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - ghost_inventory' approximates the desired inventory position. Alternatively, setting an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the missing units ensures the capped policy doesn't undersupply. I'll set mu_hat to 480 to bridge the gap created by lost units and ensure we maintain stock for the current 70-100 unit demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Post-spike demand (P17-P18) is averaging 71.5 units, higher than the pre-April baseline (~60). Ghost inventory (192 units) continues to distort pipeline calculations.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Demand for the last three periods (P17-P19) has averaged 75.7 units, which is a stabilization above the old baseline of 60 but lower than the May/mid-June peak (112-140). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this current baseline. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' figure of 377 is heavily distorted by 192 'ghost' units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline includes the P14 order (149 units, which is significantly overdue and potentially lost, but I will stay cautious) and the P19 order (36 units). Total effective pipeline is at most 185 units, not 377. To force the OR backend to order despite the perceived high inventory, I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to inflate the base stock by the 192 lost units. Calculation: (1+L)*Current_Mean + Lost_Units = (1+2)*75.7 + 192 \u2248 419. This ensures the backend covers the demand plus the 'ghost' hole in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand stabilized at ~76 units/period post-peak. Ghost inventory of 192 units (P1, P3, P4) persists and requires target stock inflation. P14 order (149 units) is now 4 periods overdue, suggesting a second wave of supply reliability issues.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-07-01. Demand has stabilized at a higher baseline (avg ~84 units/period over the last 3 periods) compared to previous months. The supply chain has significant 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: P1, P3, P4 (192 units total) and now P14 (149 units), totaling 341 units that show as 'In-transit' but are unlikely to arrive. The actual effective pipeline is only 48 units (P19=36, P20=12). With on-hand inventory at 31 units and target lead time of 2 periods, we must cover 3 periods of demand ((L+1) * 85 = 255 units). Since the OR backend subtracts the full 389 units of pipeline inventory, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target stock and compensate for the 341 lost units. To reach a physical base stock of ~255, I will set mu_hat to approximately 596 (255 + 341).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: P14 order (149 units) is 6 weeks old (ordered P14, current P21) and is confirmed lost along with P1, P3, P4. Total ghost inventory is 341 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 is experiencing a combination of high demand and severe supply chain instability. Demand has transitioned into a new, higher regime: the last 5 periods averaged ~83 units (62, 81, 84, 86, 101), significantly higher than the previous baseline of 60. Most critically, the pipeline inventory is heavily distorted by 'ghost' units. A total of 341 units (73 from P1, 58 from P3, 61 from P4, and 149 from P14) are confirmed lost, as \u043e\u043d\u0438 are multiple periods past their expected delivery. The OR backend subtracts the full 'In-transit' quantity (616 units) from the calculated target stock. Since the effective pipeline is actually only 275 units (616 total - 341 lost), the backend will severely under-order if not corrected. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit method to inflate the target stock by 341 units to offset these lost orders. For mu_hat: Demand mean (last 5) = 83. Lead time L=2. Target stock for (L+1) periods = 3 * 83 = 249. To force the backend to place an order despite the 616 reported transit units, I set mu_hat = 249 + 341 = 590. For sigma_hat: Std Dev (last 5) \u2248 14. Scaling for L=2: 1.73 * 14 \u2248 24. I set sigma_hat to 24 to maintain the desired service level.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/15. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has increased over the last four periods (84, 86, 101, 93), establishing a new regime around ~91 units/period. The pipeline inventory is heavily distorted by lost shipments (ghost inventory). Total in-transit is 618 units, but units from P1, P3, P4, and P14 (73 + 58 + 61 + 149 = 341 units) are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from P19 (36 units) is now 3 periods old and likely lost or significantly delayed given recent volatility. Subtracting these 377 units, the effective pipeline is only 241 units (P21 and P22 orders). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the high reported in-transit value, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am targeting (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock to account for the lost orders. With L=2, (1+L)=3. Target base stock = 3 * 91 (mean) + Z * sqrt(3) * 10 (std estimate). Given the high profit/holding ratio, a high service level is required. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the ghost inventory and satisfy the demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: confirmed ghost inventory increased to 377 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, and P19). Period 19 order (36 units) now 3 periods overdue, treated as lost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 is currently in a stabilized high-demand regime, with the last 5 periods (P19-P23) averaging 88 units/period, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~60. This reflects a shift in demand that occurred around Period 15. The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. Based on the history, orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, and P19 (totaling 377 units) are confirmed lost: P1/3/4/14 are vastly overdue, and P19 (ordered at P19) should have arrived by P23 (L=1-2). Current 'In-transit' is 459, but subtracting the 377 'ghost' units leaves an effective pipeline of only 82 units (the P23 order). With 165 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 82, total effective inventory is 247. To protect against the high 88-unit demand across the review and lead time (L+1=3 periods) and the significant risk of order loss, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 500. This value accounts for (3 * 88) = 264 units of expected demand plus a buffer of 236 units to offset the 377 ghost units that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive. This 'inflation' ensures the system places an order to maintain stock despite the pipeline distortion.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 377 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19). Current demand regime (P19-P23) is stable at ~88 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a post-peak regime; the average of the last 6 periods (P19-P24) is 85.5 units, up from the historical baseline of ~60. The supply chain has a significant reliability issue: orders from P1 (73), P3 (58), P4 (61), P14 (149), and P19 (36) are confirmed as lost, totaling 377 units of 'ghost inventory' that the OR engine incorrectly counts as pipeline inventory. The current reported 'In-transit' is 459, which includes these 377 ghost units and the P23 order of 82 units. Therefore, the true pipeline inventory is 82 units. With on-hand inventory at 92 units, the total effective inventory is 174 units. Given a lead time of 2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (estimated at 85.5 * 3 = 256.5 units). I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a target that compensates for the 377 units of ghost inventory. Target base stock = 256.5 + 377 = 633.5. Setting mu_hat to 634 and L to default (lead time 2) will force the OR engine to subtract the 459 in-transit units from 634, resulting in a net order that maintains the correct service level.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 is currently in a stable demand regime after earlier fluctuations, averaging approximately 73 units/period over the last 5 periods (P21-P25). The critical challenge remains the distortion caused by 'ghost inventory'. As identified in previous carry-over insights, P1, P3, P4, P14, and P19 orders (totaling 377 units) are confirmed lost but remain in the backend's 'in-transit' count. Total In-transit is currently 572 units, which means only 195 units (572 - 377) are actually viable shipments (P23: 82 units, P25: 113 units). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 377-unit ghost inventory, I must inflate mu_hat (target stock). The desired target stock for (L+1)=3 periods at 73 units/period is 219 units. Adding the 377 units of ghost inventory to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of 596. This allows the backend to calculate: order = target (596) - pipeline (572 + 25 on-hand) \u2248 0, then capped appropriately. However, to trigger replenishment, mu_hat must be set high enough to offset the phantom pipeline. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' as recent shipments (P21, P22) arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 377 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19). Current demand baseline is 73 units/period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August. Demand has stabilized at a new baseline of approximately 71 units/period (average of the last four periods: 76, 73, 67, 68). The supply chain remains problematic. We have 377 units of 'ghost inventory' (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19) that will never arrive but still count towards the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation. Total reported in-transit is 530, meaning effective in-transit is 530 - 377 = 153. To ensure the OR engine actually orders enough to cover (L+1) demand despite this 377-unit shortfall, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Target mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory. With L=2, Forecast=71, and Ghost=377, the calculation is (3 * 71) + 377 = 590. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the volatility of this later, more elevated demand regime. L is set to calculate to account for the recent shift to occasionally longer arrivals (e.g., P23 arriving in 3 periods).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. Demand for this item has stabilized after earlier volatility, with the last 5 periods showing a consistent baseline (mean of 67.6 units). I will use N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime. Regarding the supply chain, the 'ghost inventory' situation is significant. The 'In-transit' figure is 473 units, but history shows that orders from P1 (73), P3 (58), P4 (61), P14 (149), and P19 (36) are likely lost, totaling 377 units. The effective pipeline is actually only 96 units (P26: 40, P27: 56). To correct for the OR engine's 'ghost' perception of 377 units, I will set L=10 (explicitly high). This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to overcome the pipeline deduction (base_stock - 473), ensuring a physical order is placed to cover the stable demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Ghost Inventory remains at 377 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19). Effective pipeline is currently 96 units. Demand regime (P23-P27) is stable at ~68 units/period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. Demand has remained stable over the last six periods (P23-P28) with an average of approximately 67.5 units/period. The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 551 units, but this includes 377 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, and P19 that are confirmed lost). This leaves an effective pipeline of 174 units (P26: 40, P27: 56, P28: 78). To account for the 377 ghost units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation (order = base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate mu_hat. Specifically, mu_hat should target (1+L) * mean_demand plus the ghost volume to offset the subtraction. With L=2, mu_hat target = 3 * 67.5 + 377 \u2248 580. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 580 to bridge this gap. Recent demand volatility is relatively low, so I will use the last 6 periods for sigma_hat. Lead time remains approximately 2 periods based on recent successful arrivals (P25 and P23 arriving in 2-3 periods).

Analysis of carry-over insights and game history confirms that 377 units from periods 1, 3, 4, 14, and 19 are lost and will not arrive. Although the 'In-transit' shows 569 units, the effective pipeline is only 192 units (orders from P26 onwards: 40 + 56 + 78 + 18). Demand has stabilized at a lower post-peak regime; the average of the last 6 periods (P24-P29) is approximately 65 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to restore service levels while accounting for the 377 units of 'dead' pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' Mu_hat. Target stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus a buffer for the 377 unit deficit. With L=2, (L+1)=3. Target stock for 3 periods at 65 units/period is 195. To offset the 377 unit ghost inventory held in the pipeline calculation (final order = base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate mu_hat. Adjusted mu_hat = (Ideal Base Stock + Ghost Inventory) = 220 + 377 = 597. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 600 to trigger an immediate replenishment order to bridge the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 377 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19). Current demand has softened slightly to ~65 units/period (P24-P29). Pipeline inventory is heavily distorted by lost shipments.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 31 (2019-09-09). The product is a women's lingerie item. Historical demand analysis shows a stable regime from Period 24 to 30, averaging approximately 66.5 units per period. The supply chain has significant 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) totaling 228 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) and Period 14 (149 units) - making the reliable ghost total 377 units as previously tracked. Recent arrivals (P23, P25, P27, P28) show a realized lead time varying between 2 and 3 periods. To account for the 377 units of lost 'ghost' inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculation, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock: (1+L) * mean_demand = (1+2) * 67 = 201. However, since the OR engine will subtract the 'In-transit' (508) from this target, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the ghost units: Adjusted mu_hat = 201 + 377 = 578. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the overinflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand has remained relatively stable but somewhat softer in the last 5 periods (P27-P31), averaging 61.4 units/period, compared to the broader post-peak regime of ~70-80 units. The pipeline is severely distorted by 'ghost inventory'. Total in-transit is 544 units, but historically confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19) account for 377 units. Furthermore, the P26 order (40 units) is now 6 periods old and the P29 order (18 units) is 3 periods old; given the lead time variability (L=1 to L=3), these are highly suspicious. I now treat P26 (40 units) as lost, bringing total ghost inventory to 417 units. True effective pipeline = 544 - 417 = 127 units (P30, P31, and possibly P29). With 7 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 127, total effective inventory is 134 units. To ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock despite the 417-unit overstatement in its pipeline view, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1) at a forecasted mean of 65 units/period plus the ghost volume. Target = (3 * 65) + 417 = 612. Using mu_hat = 612 and sigma_hat = 40 to account for volatility and ensure the safety stock logic triggers enough of an order to cover upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Confirmed ghost inventory increased to 417 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, and now P26 at 40 units). P26 is 6 periods overdue. Demand regime (P27-P31) stable at ~61 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 is currently in a stable/softened regime. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P27-P32) is approximately 58 units/period. The pipeline inventory (527 units) is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders that are almost certainly lost but still appear as 'in-transit'. Specifically, P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, and P26 (totaling 417 units) are long overdue and confirmed as lost in previous insights. To account for this, the OR backend's target stock must be significantly increased using the 'explicit' mu_hat method, effectively treating this ghost inventory as if it doesn't exist. Without this inflation, the OR engine would see 527 units in-transit and stop ordering, leading to stockouts. I will set mu_hat based on (1 + L) * expected_demand + ghost_inventory. With L=2 and expected_demand=60, target is 180 + 417 = 597. I will set mu_hat to 600. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the moderate volatility seen in recent stable periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand has stabilized at approximately 57 units/period over the last 5 periods (P29-P33). The primary challenge continues to be the significant 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Total in-transit is 561 units, but 417 units are confirmed lost based on historical tracking (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26). This leaves an effective pipeline of 144 units (561 - 417). The OR backend uses the full 561 units in its base-stock calculation (order = base_stock - on_hand - in_transit), which would result in zero orders and stockouts. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the ghost inventory and the current stabilized demand. Target Stock (Base Stock) = (3 periods of demand) + Safety Stock. Calculated Base Stock for ~57 units/period and Lead Time 2 is approximately 230 units. To force the OR engine to order despite the 561 in-transit units, I must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock > on_hand + in-transit'. Effective inventory is 20 (on-hand) + 144 (effective pipeline) = 164. To maintain a safety buffer and cover oncoming demand, I set mu_hat to 660, which effectively bypasses the ghost inventory distortion by aligning the target stock with the reported (but inflated) pipeline figures.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Ghost inventory remains at 417 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26). Demand stabilized at ~57 units/period (P29-P33).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 decision (2019/10/07). Current on-hand is 0 following a stockout in Period 34. Demand has stabilized at a lower level recently (~50 units/period for the last 5 periods) compared to the mid-year regime. The supply chain continues to suffer from lost shipments. Based on history, orders P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, and P26 are confirmed lost (too old relative to promised L=2). Ghost inventory total: 73+58+61+149+36+40 = 417 units. Reported in-transit is 673, meaning effective in-transit is 256. To ensure the OR engine ignores the 417 ghost units and still orders sufficient stock to cover actual demand, I set L=explicit at 2 (recent arrivals P30/P32 show L=1-3, avg ~2) and mu_hat=explicit at 1083. Calculation for mu_hat: Targeted base stock (L+1 periods) = 3 * average demand (57) + safety stock. However, since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (673) from base stock, I must set mu_hat = (Ideal Inventory Position + Ghost Inventory). Ideal Position for 3 periods (~171) + 417 ghost = 588. However, with the current high in-transit vs real need, I keep mu_hat high enough to trigger the cap or maintain flow. Given the 0 on-hand and 256 effective pipeline, I set mu_hat to (3 * 55) + 417 = 582, but to be safe against the large ghost volume subtracting, I use explicit values to bypass the 'default' calculation which might underestimate the need to overcome the pipeline distortion.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 417 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26). Effective pipeline (excluding ghosts) is 256 units. Recent demand (P30-P34) has softened to ~52 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P30-P35) averages approximately 48 units/period, showing a steady decline from earlier peaks. The supply chain continues to face reliability issues: ghost inventory (likely lost shipments) has increased to 417 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26), significantly distorting the pipeline inventory of 581 units. The 'effective' pipeline is only 164 units (581 - 417), consisting of recent orders from P33 and P34. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with P32 arriving in 3 periods. To prevent unnecessary ordering caused by ghost inventory under-reporting and to adjust for the softening demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current 48 units/period trend, and set L=3 via 'explicit' to account for the current lead time variability observed in the latest arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 417 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26). Effective pipeline is 164 units. Demand continues to soften, averaging ~48 units/period over the last 6 weeks.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 is experiencing a cooling demand regime. Demand over the last 7 periods (P30-P36) has averaged approximately 47 units/period, a significant decrease from the previous ~65 units/period average seen in late summer. For the decision in Period 37, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 7 samples (N=7) to capture this downward trend. Sigma_hat is also set to N=7 to reflect current volatility. The supply chain has a significant issue with 'ghost inventory': orders P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, and P26 are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 417 units. These units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (547 units total). Subtracting 417 from 547 leaves an effective pipeline of 130 units (the P34 order of 112 units and any recent system adjustments). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these ghost units, mu_hat and sigma_hat are derived from the recent regime, while the L parameter is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed lead times (averaging between 1-3 periods recently). The current on-hand of 61 units plus the 112 units arriving soon provides sufficient coverage for the next few periods given the lower demand, but the explicit parameterization ensures the OR engine doesn't wait for units that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 30-36 demand averaged 47 units (approx 28% drop from the 65 unit baseline). Ghost inventory remains constant at 417 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 is currently in a lower demand regime compared to earlier periods. Over the last 8 periods (P30-P37), demand has averaged approximately 41.6 units per period, showing a significant softening from the prior 65-unit baseline. The supply chain remains unpredictable with a confirmed 'ghost inventory' of 417 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26) which never arrived and likely never will. Current in-transit is 547, but after subtracting the 417 lost units, the 'effective' pipeline is only 130 units (representing the orders from P34 and any subsequent activity). Since on-hand is only 25 and effective pipeline is 130, we must ensure base stock covers (L+1) demand. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this new lower-demand regime (mu_hat) and set L to 'calculate' to account for the observed lead time variance (often 2-3 periods). By using current demand levels (approx 42 units/period), the OR engine will target a base stock around 126-150 units. Since effective inventory is 155 (25 OH + 130 effective in-transit), the 'ghost' inventory of 417 units will make the OR backend think we are over-stocked (Total In-transit 547 + OH 25 = 572), resulting in no orders. To force an order to maintain safety stock, I must set mu_hat explicitly to offset the 417 ghost units: Target Base Stock = (Historical effective need) + Ghost units. Target Base Stock \u2248 150 + 417 = 567. As current system inventory is 572, it may still not order. I will set mu_hat to 650 (explicit) to ensure the system places an order to bridge the gap and maintain product flow.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering November 2019. Historically, demand was stable around 60, peaked in May/June, and has recently softened. Over the last 9 periods (P30-P38), average demand has shifted down to approximately 41 units per week. I will use N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower regime. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' figure of 670 is heavily distorted by approximately 417 units from known lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26). Additionally, the order from P34 (112 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost. Including P34, total ghost inventory is 529 units. The effective pipeline is therefore only 141 units (670 - 529). Since I cannot manually subtract from the OR engine's pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that forces the desired order. Target stock for (L+1=3) periods at 41 units/period is 123. To overcome the 670 in-transit plus 0 on-hand, the OR engine would normally order 0. To ensure we have stock, I will use an explicit L of 2 and an explicit mu_hat that compensates for the ghost units (Target \u2248 123 + 529 = 652). However, I must be careful with the backend's internal caps. I will set mu_hat to 650 to align with the estimated target stock needed to trigger a replenishment despite the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Ghost inventory increased to 529 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26, and now P34 at 112 units). P34 is 5 periods overdue. Effective pipeline is significantly lower than the 670 units reported.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 is currently facing a dual challenge: a sustained demand decline and significant supply chain unreliability ('ghost inventory'). Demand has shifted from a historical mean of ~65 units to a recent mean of ~36 units over the last 5 periods (P35-P39). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this lower demand regime. The 'In-transit' figure of 693 is heavily distorted by 529 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26, and P34). The actual effective pipeline is only 164 units (orders from P38 and P39). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting L to 5. This forces a higher base_stock calculation (covering 6 periods of demand) which compensates for the 529 ghost units without requiring a manual 'explicit' base_stock value that might be capped too aggressively.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Effective pipeline is 164 units. Ghost inventory remains at 529 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26, P34). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~36 units/period (P35-P39).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces two major issues: a significant amount of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) and a recent softening of demand followed by a potential season-end uptick. At Period 41, total In-transit is 693. Based on carry-over historical tracking, 529 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P4, P14, P19, P26, and P34). The effective pipeline is actually 164 units (the orders from P38 and P39). On-hand is 0, so the system is currently stocked out. Demand has been around 36-37 units lately, but Period 40 saw a jump to 56. I will set L to 2 (promised), as recent successful arrivals have been L=1-3. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=6) to capture the lower demand regime (avg ~39) while acknowledging the Period 40 spike. To compensate for the 529 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory that the OR backend mistakenly thinks is coming, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Expected Demand over L+1 periods = 3 * 39 = 117. Expected On-Hand + True Pipeline = 164. However, the OR backend sees 693 in pipeline. It will order zero if I don't adjust. By setting mu_hat = (Expected Target Stock) + (Ghost Inventory), I can force an order. Target Stock at z=1.75 is approx 160. Target Stock + Ghost = 160 + 529 = 689. I will set mu_hat to 689 to ensure the backend moves closer to a real order.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Ghost inventory remains 529 units. Effective pipeline is 164. Demand showing potential recovery from 36 to 56.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 is currently suffering from a severe supply chain disruption combined with a persistent 'ghost inventory' problem. Total in-transit inventory is 692, but my analysis confirms that 529 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26, P34) are permanently lost shipments. Subtracting these ghosts, the effective pipeline is only 163 units (P38, P40, P41). On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we are relying entirely on arrivals to meet demand. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 42 units/period over the last 7 periods (P35-P41), despite a temporary spike to 56. I am setting L to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P39) show the channel is still functional for new orders. Since the OR backend sees the full 'In-transit' figure of 692, it will naturally try to order 0. To force an order to cover the 0 on-hand and 163 effective pipeline, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. Following the base stock formula: Target Stock = (L+1)*Demand. For L=2 and Demand=42, Target \u2248 126. However, because the backend subtracts 692 (pipeline), I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 529-unit ghost deficit. I set mu_hat=735 (approx 529 ghost + 206 target for 5 periods of safety coverage) and a high explicit sigma_hat to ensure the OR logic triggers a substantial replenishment order to restore physical stock.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2nd, leading into the peak holiday season. Historical demand for this women's lingerie SKU showed a significant surge earlier in the year and demand has recently rebounded from a low of 36 units to 56-66 units in the last three periods. Given the upcoming December peak, demand is expected to accelerate significantly. The primary challenge is the supply chain: there are 529 confirmed 'ghost' units in the pipeline (orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26, and P34 are collectively 5+ periods overdue and considered lost). The 'In-transit' figure of 982 includes these 529 ghosts, meaning the actual effective pipeline is only 453 units (P38: 123, P41: 22, P42: 290, plus whatever is ordered now). On-hand inventory is 0. To compensate for the 'ghosts' and prepare for seasonal demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate seasonal demand to average 100 units/period over the next 3 weeks (L+1). Target base stock = (1+L)*demand + safety stock. With L=2, (1+2)*100 = 300. Adding a safety margin for supply reliability, I set mu_hat (target stock) to 850. Since the OR engine subtracts the full 982 (including ghosts) from this target, the high mu_hat value will bridge the gap and trigger necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory remains at 529 units. Effective pipeline (excluding ghosts) is 453 units. Demand shows upward seasonal trend (avg 52 over last 3 periods vs 36 previously).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand shows a slight upward trend (P40, 42, 43 showing 56, 66, 38 respectively, average of ~53) compared to the previous low regime of 36. This is likely due to the holiday season in December. The on-hand inventory is 0 and the reported pipeline is heavily distorted by lost shipments (ghost inventory). Total ghost inventory is assessed at 652 units: P1(73), P3(58), P4(61), P14(149), P19(36), P26(40), P34(112), and now likely P38(123) which is 5 periods overdue. Effective pipeline (In-transit - Ghost) is 960 - 652 = 308 units. The order placed in P42 (290 units) is the primary effective component of that pipeline and is expected to arrive in P44 or P45. Given the high stockout frequency (on-hand is 0) and seasonal demand, I will set mu_hat using recent data (N=4) to capture the trend while inflating mu_hat slightly via the explicit method to compensate for the inventory 'black hole' created by the reported ghost pipeline. Target stock should cover (L+1) demand; at 60 units/week and L=2, that is 180 units. Since 308 effective units are in flight (P42=290, P41=already arrived/consumed, P43=0), we are currently covered briefly if that large order arrives this week.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Ghost inventory increased to 652 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26, P34, P38). P38 (123 units) is 5 periods overdue and treated as lost. Effective pipeline is 308 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. We are in Period 45 out of 47, meaning only 3 decision periods remain. A massive demand spike is expected based on the historical pattern (late Dec) and the Order placed in P42 (290 units) which has not yet arrived but is within its lead time window (ordered P42, expected arrival P44/P45). Ghost inventory has reached 652 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26, P34, P38). The official 'In-transit' is 960, so the 'Effective Pipeline' is only 308 (960 - 652). The effective pipeline consists of the P42 order (290 units) and the P39/P41 arrivals which already concluded. Since we only have P45, P46, and P47 left, and lead time is ~2 periods, any order placed now (P45) is unlikely to arrive and be sold before the game ends (P47 conclude). However, given on-hand is 0 and we expect a seasonal spike, I will maintain parameters to ensure the OR engine recognizes the need for stock if the P42 order doesn't arrive this period. I'll use 'explicit' for L to account for the supply chain instability and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current lower average before the holiday peak hits.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Significant ghost inventory (652 units) from lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P14, P19, P26, P34, P38. Effective pipeline is 308 units. Game ends Period 47; final orders should consider lead time vs remaining time.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46, the second-to-last period of the simulation. For SKU 507883014, our primary goal is to maximize total reward, which means clearing inventory by the end of Period 47 while minimizing holding costs and missed sales. On-hand inventory is currently 257 units. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P40-P45) is approximately 43 units. Given there are only two demand phases remaining (Period 46 and Period 47), the total expected demand is roughly 86-90 units. Our current on-hand inventory (257) already vastly exceeds any possible remaining demand. In-transit inventory is listed as 670 units, though 652 units of that are confirmed 'ghost' inventory (lost shipments). The effective pipeline is minimal, but irrelevant because on-hand stock is sufficient for the remainder of the game. I will set parameters to ensure no further orders are placed to avoid accumulating more holding cost. By setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat=1.0, and sigma_hat=0.1, the base stock will be extremely low, and the OR backend will stop ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: On-hand inventory (257 units) is sufficient to cover all remaining demand for the final two periods of the game. No further ordering is required.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We have reached Period 47, which is the final period of the game. The current on-hand inventory is 241 units. Historical demand in the most recent periods (P44-P46) has been 32, 33, and 16 units respectively, showing a significant end-of-year decline. Even at a conservative higher demand estimate, 241 units are more than sufficient to cover the final period's demand. Placing any additional order now would only incur holding costs or arrive after the game concludes (given L=2 promise), as the simulation ends this period. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no further orders are placed by the OR backend.
