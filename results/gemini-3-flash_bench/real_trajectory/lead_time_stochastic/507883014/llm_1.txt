  "rationale": "Product 507883014 is 'Ellen Thong (Malva) L 3pk', a staple women's lingerie item. Historical demand from early 2019 shows a steady increase from 31 to a stable range of 60-70 units per week (avg ~58.6 over the last 5 weeks). Valentine's Day falls on Feb 14th, which is during this current period (Period 1, starting Feb 11th). While demand for lingerie typically spikes leading up to and during Valentine's Day, I must account for the 2-period lead time. An order placed now will arrive in Period 3 (starting Feb 25th), which is post-Valentine's Day. Therefore, I should forecast based on the recently established 'normal' demand regime of ~65 units/week. Current inventory is 0. My target inventory should cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (Lead time + 1) to ensure availability when the shipment arrives. Given the 2-period lead time, I need to cover approximately 3 weeks of demand. 65 units/week * 3 weeks = 195 units. Since there is currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order 195 units to build the pipeline and meet the projected demand regime.",

Target pipeline = 60 * 3 = 180 units. Current pipeline (on-hand 0 + in-transit 195) = 195. This already covers the expected demand for Periods 2, 3, and 4.

Since L+1 is 3 periods, I currently have sufficient stock to cover the upcoming lead time without ordering, especially as I monitor if the lower demand regime persists.

Lead times are highly variable: while the promise is 2 periods, we've seen 1, 2, and most recently 3 periods (the P23 order arrived in P26). Currently, on-hand inventory is 73 units, with 1005 units theoretically in-transit. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', approximately 805 of those units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19) are confirmed lost. The valid pipeline consists of orders from P24 (100), P25 (100), and P26 (100).

To cover a 3-period lead time plus the decision period (total 4 periods) at a 75-unit/week rate, I need a target inventory position of 300 units. Current valid inventory (73 on-hand + 300 in-transit) equals 373, which covers the target. However, given the high supplier loss rate (approx. 50% or higher), I will place a standard replenishment order to maintain the pipeline and buffer against the next inevitable shipment loss.",

  "rationale": "The SKU is a 3-pack of women's thongs. Demand has stabilized into a lower-volume regime following a summer peak. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 35 units per week, significantly lower than the previous baseline of ~60-80. Current on-hand inventory is 136 units, which covers approximately 3.8 weeks of demand at the current rate. Regarding lead times and supplier reliability: while the promised lead time is 2, actual arrivals show variance (1-3 periods) and a very high historical loss rate (estimated >50%). However, the current 'In-transit' figure of 1065 units is massively inflated by lost orders from early periods (P1, P3, P13, etc.) and does not represent actual incoming stock. Specifically, the only recent order not yet accounted for is from P34 (60 units), which is now 6 periods old and highly likely lost. Since current on-hand inventory (136) exceeds our safety target (Demand * (L+1)) of ~105 units (35 * 3), no order is placed this period to avoid further holding costs while monitoring if the P34 order eventually arrives or if demand shifts again as we approach the end of the year.",

Historical demand analysis shows a current stable regime of approximately 35-40 units per week (P34-P39 mean), though Period 40 saw a spike to 56. Given the date (Nov 18), we are approaching the holiday season where basic apparel often sees moderate gifting demand. The primary constraint is extreme supplier unreliability; the loss rate is estimated at >50%, and lead times vary between 1-3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 80 units, which covers approximately 2 weeks of the current mean demand. Although 'In-transit' shows 1065 units, historical data indicates most of this is comprised of permanently lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). The only 'active' order that may arrive is 0 units (since no orders were placed in P37-P40). To maintain a safety buffer against the high loss rate and expected end-of-year demand stability/increase, I need to replenish. A target cycle of 3-4 periods of demand (approx 150-160 units) is appropriate. Since on-hand is 80 and no reliable arrivals are expected, I will order 80 units.",

Truly active in-transit orders are likely just those from P41 (80) and P42 (80), plus potentially delayed units from P33 and P35 based on the >50% failure rate observed previously. To cover demand for the next 3 periods (current + L=2) at an expected rate of ~50-60 units/week (safety-adjusted for potential holiday spikes), I need roughly 150-180 units.

History shows a dip in April/May and a surge in June, but limited data for December makes me rely on the current stabilized baseline. Supplier reliability remains the primary constraint: the loss rate is approximately 50%, and lead times vary between 1-3 periods. Regarding the pipeline: the order from P41 arrived in 2 periods (P43). Orders from P42 (80 units) and P43 (80 units) are currently in-transit and expected in P44 or P45. The 'In-transit' figure of 1225 units is largely composed of lost orders; only P42 and P43 are 'live'. Current on-hand is 42. With a target of covering 3 periods of demand (L+1) at ~45 units per period (~135 units total) and adjusting for the high loss rate, I will order 80 units to maintain the pipeline.
