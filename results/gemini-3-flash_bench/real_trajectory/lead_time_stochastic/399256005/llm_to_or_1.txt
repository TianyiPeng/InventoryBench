Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 399256005 (Ladies Ankle-length Denim). Historical data shows a clear upward trend in the last 5 weeks: 41, 38, 65, 85, 137, suggesting the start of a spring fashion ramp-up. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To capture the recent accelerating demand while maintaining enough inventory for the lead-time window, I will use recent_N with N=3 to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent high-demand periods (65, 85, 137). L is set to default (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a pair of ladies' skinny ankle jeans. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 41, 38, 65, 85, and 137 leading into the game. In Period 1, actual demand was 183. This confirms a strong trending demand regime. On-hand inventory is 0 due to the starting condition, and 157 units are in-transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 2, these units are expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current demand of 183 is significantly higher than the initial samples. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this recent surge (85, 137, 183) while setting L to 'default' (2) as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand for 399256005 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) has jumped significantly from early January levels (~40-65) to high levels in February (137, 183, 197). This suggests a strong seasonal transition into spring fashion. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 373 units in transit (157 from P1, 216 from P2). The promised lead time is 2, so the P1 order should arrive during the current Period 3 and be visible in the P4 start message. There is no evidence yet that lead times are deviating from the promised 2 periods. To capture the recent demand surge, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat based on the last 3 samples (137, 183, 197) which average ~172 per period. This results in a mu_hat of ~517 (172 * 3). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility in this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in February: average demand increased from ~60 to ~172 unit/period (+187%) starting Feb 4th.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU '399256005' is a Ladies' Ankle Denim Jean. Starting from Feb 4th (pre-game sample) and continuing through Periods 1-3, demand has stabilized into a high-demand regime averaging approximately 174 units per period (137, 183, 197, 180). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory due to the promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning the Period 1 order (157 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and become visible in Period 4's conclude message. Since we are currently making the decision for Period 4, we have not yet seen that arrival, but it is expected to be available for the current period's demand. Our total pipeline inventory is 597 units (orders from P1, P2, and P3). For the OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'default' (2) as we have no evidence yet that the lead time is anything other than promised. 2) mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stable high-demand regime (Periods 1-3 plus the Feb 4th sample). 3) sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the sustained demand increase without over-reacting to earlier low-demand pre-game data.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/03/11). The SKU is 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans', currently in a high-demand regime. Analysis of the history shows: Period 1 order (157 units) is missing/overdue (lead time should be 2); Period 2 order (216 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2). Current on-hand is low (6 units) with 381 units in-transit (P1 order: 157, P3 order: 224). Demand has stabilized at a high level: mean demand over the last 4 periods is 192.5 units (183, 197, 180, 210). Given the missing Period 1 order, there is a risk of a stockout if P3 doesn't arrive on time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~193). The lead time of 2 is confirmed by the P2 arrival, though P1 is an anomaly; I will stick to 'default' (2 periods) for lead time but use a conservative N=4 for mu and sigma to acknowledge the recent volatility and high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand for Period 1-4 is 192.5 units/period, significantly higher than January levels. Period 1 shipment (157 units) is currently overdue/at risk.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees strong demand in early spring. Historical demand since Feb 11 (Period 1) has been consistently high (183, 197, 180, 210, 130), averaging 180 units/period, compared to the January average (~67). There is a critical inventory issue: Period 1's order (157 units) is now 3 periods overdue (expected arrival was Period 3 conclude, now we are entering Period 6). However, the Period 2 order (216 units) arrived on time in Period 4. This confirms the lead time 'L' is likely 2, but Period 1's shipment is potentially lost. On-hand is currently 0. Pipeline (in-transit) is 597 units (Order P1: 157, Order P3: 224, Order P5: 216). Because P1 is likely lost, I will treat the effective pipeline as 440 units. To compensate for the stockouts and the lost shipment while demand remains high (avg ~180), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the high-demand regime and L at the promised 2. The OR engine's base-stock target will use the full pipeline of 597; to ensure we still order enough to cover the loss of 157 units, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat specifically targeting a higher stock level.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 1 shipment (157 units) confirmed lost/extensively delayed (3 periods past promised delivery). Demand regime since Feb 11 remains stable at approximately 180 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the Period 1 order (157 units) is definitely lost, as it is now 4 periods past its promised delivery date of Period 3. Recent demand (Feb 11 - Mar 18) averages 182.6 units/period (183, 197, 180, 210, 130, 196). Leading into spring, this item (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is entering its core season. Lead times have been volatile: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods, while Period 5 order arrived in 1 period. To protect against the lost inventory and maintain service levels for the ~180 unit/period demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-January shift. I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the observed average lead time (1.5 periods), which better reflects current delivery speeds than the promised 2.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. The product is Ladies Denim (Ankle-length jeans). Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 7 (317 units), likely indicating start-of-season spring demand for ankle-length denim. Looking at history: Period 1 shipment (157 units) is definitely lost. The actual lead time has been inconsistent: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods, but Period 5 order arrived in 1 period (early). Currently, on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 608 units (comprising Period 3, 6, and 7 orders). Demand has shifted from ~180-200 to over 300. I will focus on a recent 3-period window (Periods 5-7) to capture this rising spring demand regime. I will set the lead time to the promised 2 periods as the safest base for the OR backend, even though one recent shipment arrived faster. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot to the higher demand level (average of last 3 periods: (130+196+317)/3 = 214.3 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge detected: Period 7 demand (317) is a 70% increase over the previous 4-week average (~186). Period 1 order (157 units) remains recorded as in-transit but is confirmed lost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8, 2019. We are in a high-demand spring period for 'Ankle-length jeans'. Historical demand in January/February averaged ~60-180, but the last two periods (Period 7: 317, Period 8: 273) show a significant surge to an average of 295 units/week. Inventory is currently 0 with a high pipeline (687 units), part of which includes the lost Period 1 order (157 units) which the OR backend still 'sees'. To compensate for the lost 157 units and the high recent demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate demand at 300 units/period. For L=2, mu_hat = (1+L)*300 = 900. I am also factoring in the lost shipment by effectively 'inflating' the target stock levels so the OR order logic subtracts the pipeline (687) from a larger base. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge confirmed: Period 7-8 average (295) is ~60% higher than the Feb-March baseline (~180). Period 1 order (157 units) remains in-transit but is functionally lost, requiring mu_hat/sigma_hat adjustments to 'pull' more inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant stockout in Period 9 (193 unmet demand). Historical demand analysis shows a defined shift: Jan (avg ~53), Feb-Mar (avg ~180), and the current Spring surge (P7-P9 avg ~261). Period 9 demand (193) was lower than the P7-P8 spike (~295), but still high. The 1075 units currently 'In-transit' include the lost Period 1 order (157 units). Because the OR backend subtracts ALL pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, including lost units results in persistent under-ordering. I set L to 2 (promised). I use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 930 to account for 3 periods of demand (L+1) at a forecasted rate of ~310 units/period (anticipating sustained spring demand) while adding an offset for the 157 lost units to 'trick' the backend into ordering sufficient replenishment. Sigma_hat is set to 120 (recent_N=3) to handle the increased volatility seen during this spring transition.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge mean confirmed at ~261 over last 3 periods (P7-P9), compared to ~180 baseline. Stockouts in Period 7, 8, and 9 highlight that the active pipeline is insufficient due to the P1 lost shipment (157 units) being counted in the 'In-transit' calculation by the OR engine.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/04/22). The product is skinny ankle denim, which is seeing a spring demand surge. Observed demand over the last four periods (P7-P10) has been 317, 273, 193, and 236, averaging ~255 units/period. This is significantly higher than the February/March baseline of ~180. A major constraint is the Period 1 order (157 units) which is confirmed lost but remains in the OR engine's 'In-transit' calculation. This leads the engine to underestimate the required order size because it thinks 157 units are coming that never will. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. With L=2, the target window is (1+L)=3 periods. Using the recent mean of 255 plus a 'lost shipment buffer' of 157 units, I set mu_hat = (255 * 3) + 157 = 922. This simulates the missing inventory so the base stock calculation triggers an appropriately sized order despite the phantom pipeline units. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher volatility seen during this spring surge.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge mean stabilized at ~255 units/period (P7-P10). Period 1 phantom inventory (157 units) continues to distort the OR engine's pipeline calculation, requiring manual mu_hat adjustments to ensure adequate replenishment.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Spring surge' (roughly since Period 7) has shown a mean of approximately 251 units/period (317, 273, 193, 236, 236). Although Period 10 and 11 demand was identical (236), the overall spring regime is higher than the previous winter baseline. A critical factor remains the Period 1 order (157 units) which is confirmed lost but still resides in 'In-transit' (Total In-transit: 615 = 157 [lost] + 35 [P10] + 199 [P11] + 224 [P3 - also likely lost/severely delayed but not yet fully written off]). The OR engine subtracts Pipeline (In-transit + On-hand) from its calculated Base Stock. To force the engine to order despite this 'phantom' inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I will target a 3-period coverage window (L+1=3) for a demand mean of ~250. To compensate for the 157 lost units and the suspicious P3 order of 224 (which is also likely lost given its lead time is now 9 periods), I will inflate mu_hat. Setting mu_hat to 850 ((250 * 3) + 100 buffer) to ensure the system keeps ordering enough to maintain inventory, as the current 222 on-hand will be depleted in one period.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Period 3 order (224 units) is now 8 periods overdue (promised 2) and is likely lost, joining the Period 1 lost order (157 units). Total phantom pipeline inventory is approximately 381 units, requiring continued inflation of mu_hat to bypass OR engine pipeline deductions.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jean shows a clear regime shift from January (~60) to a spring average of ~255 units/period (P7-P12). However, the inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and 'In-transit' is 761 units. This pipeline figure includes 'phantom' inventory from Period 1 (157 units) and Period 3 (224 units), totaling 381 units that are almost certainly lost (8+ periods overdue). The OR engine deducts this 381 units from the base stock calculation, leading to consistent under-ordering. To compensate, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at 255 units/week. For a (L+1) horizon where L=2, base demand is 765 (3 * 255). To offset the 381 phantom units and ensure the OR engine actually places an order, I must set mu_hat = 765 + 381 = 1146. This 'tricks' the backend into seeing the missing units as required future demand, effectively bypassing the phantom pipeline inventory. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect both 1 and 2-period lead times seen recently, and use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the higher volatility (std ~45) of the spring regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 381 units (P1: 157, P3: 224). mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by ~381 units until these orders are cleared or demand significantly changes to prevent perpetual stockouts.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-13. The product is skiny ankle jeans, and demand has transitioned from a spring peak (~250-300 units/period) to a lower stabilization around 170-190 units/period (Period 13 demand was 176). A critical issue persists: the 'In-transit' figure of 1013 units includes 381 units of 'phantom inventory' from Period 1 (157 units) and Period 3 (224 units) which are confirmed lost but still deducted by the OR engine's pipeline logic. To compensate and ensure replenishment, mu_hat must be inflated. The current real pipeline includes orders from P12 (146 units) and P13 (451 units), which are expected within the next 1-2 periods. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of current demand (~180/period) plus the 381 phantom units to bypass the OR engine's deduction (Total mu_hat = (3 * 180) + 381 \u2248 921). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current volatility while ignoring the earlier spring spike.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny Ankle Jeans' has stabilized around a mean of 220 units/period over the last 5 periods (P10-P14). However, the system currently shows 867 units in-transit, which includes 381 units from Period 1 (157 units) and Period 3 (224 units) that are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (867) from the base stock calculation, these 381 'phantom' units prevent new orders from being placed, leading to serial stockouts (ending inventory 0 in P14). To counteract this, I must set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My calculation for mu_hat is: ((1 + L) * average_demand) + phantom_inventory. With L=2, (3 * 220) + 381 = 1041 units. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat based on the recent standard deviation to maintain a proper safety stock (approx 35-40 per period).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256005' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently experiencing high demand variability and a significant inventory distortion issue. Current On-hand is 0, and In-transit is 1157 units. However, based on the historical concluding messages, Period 1 (157 units) and Period 3 (224 units) are confirmed lost/undelivered, totaling 381 units of 'phantom' inventory. These phantom units are subtracted from the base stock by the OR engine, causing persistent stockouts despite high demand. Recent demand (P11-P15) averages ~237 units/period. For Period 16, I need to set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 381 phantom units. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 1100. This is calculated as: (Desired Base Stock for 3 periods [L+1=3] at 240 units/period = 720) + (Phantom Inventory Offset = 381) \u2248 1100. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised), as most recent orders arrived with lead times of 1 or 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatility of the spring/summer season.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Ankle-length jeans' SKU has settled into a stabilized 'Spring/Summer' regime with an average demand of approximately 253 units per period (calculated from Period 7-16). Currently, we are facing repeated stockouts (ending inventory 0 for Period 14, 15, and 16) due to an 'on-hand' inventory of 0 and a distorted 'In-transit' figure. The 'In-transit' count of 1215 includes 381 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost/overdue by 13+ periods. Because the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from your base stock, we must manually inflate 'mu_hat' to compensate for these 381 'phantom' units. My forecast for (1+L) periods of real demand (where L=2) is 3 * 253 = 759. Adding the 381 phantom units brings the 'mu_hat' to 1140. For lead time, I am using the 'calculate' method as actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the higher volatility seen since the Spring demand surge began.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans remains stable in a high-demand regime, with the last three periods (P15-P17) averaging 283.7 units/period. The prompt's stockout history reveals that orders from Period 1 (157 units) and Period 3 (224 units) are definitively lost but still occupy 'In-transit' space (total phantom inventory = 381 units). The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will subtract these 381 phantom units from every calculated order, leading to perpetual stockouts unless mu_hat is manually inflated. To maintain a safety stock that accounts for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~284 units/period plus the 381 unit phantom deduction, the required base stock is (3 * 284) + 381 \u2248 1233. I will set mu_hat explicitly to this value to force the OR backend to place an order that covers real demand while bypassing the phantom pipeline inventory. Lead time 'calculate' is used as actual lead times alternate between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256005 continues to face significant inventory shortages due to two primary factors: sustained high demand and the OR engine's 'phantom pipeline' issue. Demand has stabilized into a high-season regime, with the last 5 periods (P14-P18) averaging ~269 units/period. However, the system's 'In-transit' calculation (1300 units) includes phantom inventory from Period 1 (157 units) and Period 3 (224 units), totaling 381 units that will never arrive. Additionally, the Period 13 order (451 units) is now 6 periods old (promised 2) and is likely also lost, bringing the total phantom pipeline to 832 units. Because the OR engine subtracts this full 1300 units of in-transit inventory from the target base stock, it consistently under-orders. To counteract this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that accounts for (L+1) periods of actual demand (3 periods * 269 = 807) PLUS the 832 units of phantom inventory that the engine is incorrectly deducting. Setting mu_hat to 1639 ensures the OR engine places an order despite the high reported pipeline. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P15, P16, P17) show a mix of 1 and 2-period lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Total phantom pipeline inventory increased to 832 units (P1: 157, P3: 224, P13: 451). mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by ~832 units to bypass the OR engine's pipeline deduction and trigger necessary replenishment for the ~269 unit/period demand regime.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand remains stable in the 'Spring/Summer' regime with an average of approximately 264 units per period over the last 10 weeks (P10-P19). The critical issue remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock. Currently, In-transit is 1318 units. This consists of: P1 (157), P3 (224), P13 (451), P17 (49) which are significantly overdue and likely lost, plus P19 (402) which is expected in Period 20 or 21. Total confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P13) total 832 units. If P17 (49 units) is also lost, the total phantom inventory is 881 units. To trigger replenishment, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory to bypass the pipeline deduction. With L=2, (1+L)=3. Target inventory = (3 * 264) + 881 = 1673. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to ensure the OR engine places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Total phantom pipeline inventory refined to 881 units (P1: 157, P3: 224, P13: 451, P17: 49). Demand regime remains stable at ~264 units/period. mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by ~881 units to offset OR engine pipeline deductions.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (since Period 7) averages approximately 242 units/period, despite a recent dip to 189 in Period 20. The primary challenge is the accumulation of 881 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P13, and P17) which are still counted by the OR engine's base-stock formula (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline), preventing it from placing new orders. To force the OR engine to order, mu_hat must be set to explicitly cover both the expected demand over the lead time and the phantom inventory. Expected demand for L+1 periods (where L=2) is approximately 250 units/period * 3 = 750 units. Adding the 881 lost units gives a required coverage of ~1631 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1650 to ensure the engine triggers replenishment. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual Lead Time (average indicates ~1.6 periods), and sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=14) to capture the volatility of the spring/summer demand regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 230-240 units/period (average of P19-P21 is ~216, but P20/P21 were constrained by zero ending inventory). The major issue remains the massive 'phantom' in-transit inventory. Current In-transit is 1766 units. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed lost or extremely overdue: P1 (157), P3 (224), P13 (451), P17 (49), and potentially P20 (311) which has not arrived after its lead time. Summing P1, P3, P13, P17, and P20 gives 1192 units. To force the OR backend (which uses 'base_stock - In-transit') to place a meaningful order, I must inflate mu_hat. Specifically, base_stock should cover ~3 periods of demand (L+1=3) at 240 units (~720) PLUS the phantom inventory (~1192), totaling ~1912. Given current In-transit (1766), I set mu_hat explicitly to provide a target base stock that triggers replenishment for the current demand regime despite the pipeline distortion.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Phantom pipeline increased to 1192 units (P1: 157, P3: 224, P13: 451, P17: 49, P20: 311). Recent demand (P19-P21) suggests a slightly lower mean of ~240 units/period compared to the spring peak, but stockouts mask true demand. mu_hat continues to require massive inflation to offset phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently steady at approximately 200 units/period (average P20-P22: 196). However, the central challenge remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The OR engine considers all 'In-transit' units (1751) when deciding how much to order. Based on history, several large orders are likely lost or indefinitely delayed: P1 (157), P3 (224), P13 (451), and P17 (49). Additionally, orders from P19 (402) and P21 (137) are currently past their promised lead time of 2 periods. Total likely lost/stalled units sum to 1293 (832 + 58 + 402 + 137). Subtracting these from the 1751 total in-transit leaves an 'active' pipeline of ~458 units. To force the OR engine to order sufficiently for a 200 unit/period demand while it subtracts 1751 units from its calculation, I must set an explicit mu_hat that covers future demand PLUS the phantom inventory. Expected demand for lead time (L+1=3) is ~600. Accounting for the 1751 pipeline deduction, I set mu_hat explicitly to 2350 (600 + 1750) to ensure the backend triggers an order that covers the next period's needs despite the massive phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline inventory updated to approximately 1420 units (Confirmed lost: P1: 157, P3: 224, P13: 451, P17: 49; Likely stalled: P19: 402, P21: 137). Current demand has moderated to ~200 units/period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the product is in a summer demand regime with recent demand (P20-P23) averaging ~187 units/period, showing a cooling trend from the spring peak (~260). The primary SKU management challenge remains the accumulation of 'phantom' pipeline inventory\u2014orders that are significantly overdue and likely lost but continue to be counted as 'In-transit' by the OR engine. The following orders are now considered lost: P1 (157), P3 (224), P13 (451). Additionally, the P19 (402) and P17 (49) orders are now 5 and 7 periods overdue respectively (promised lead time is 2), making them highly likely lost. Total confirmed/highly probable lost inventory is 1283 units. With an current In-transit balance of 1886 and only P23 (568) being 'fresh' and likely to arrive, the phantom pipeline is approximately 1318 units. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to override the base stock calculation, inflating it to cover 3 periods of demand (~187 * 3 = 561) plus the 1318 unit pipeline offset, totaling 1879. This ensures the OR engine perceives a need for new stock despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline inventory increased to ~1318 units (P1: 157, P3: 224, P13: 451, P17: 49, P19: 402, P20: 35). Demand has moderated to a stable summer regime of ~187 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 25 (July 29, 2019). Demand has transitioned to a summer regime, with the last two periods showing 186 and 124 units (avg ~155). However, the primary challenge remains the OR engine's 'In-transit' accounting. The current In-transit balance is 1886 units. Based on historical data, the following orders are confirmed or highly likely to be lost/permanently stalled: P1 (157), P3 (224), P13 (451), P17 (49), and now P19 (402). These total 1283 phantom units. Subtracting these from the current 1886 in-transit balance leaves a 'real' pipeline of approximately 603 units (which includes the large P23 order of 568 and the P20 order of 35). To ensure the OR engine triggers replenishment for the current demand (est. 160 units/period) despite the 1283 phantom units, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. The target base stock (assuming L=2) for a 160/period mean would be roughly 480-600 units (depending on z). Since the engine subtracts the full 1886 from mu_hat, I set mu_hat = (Target Base Stock) + Phantom Units \u2248 480 + 1283 \u2248 1763 units. I will use 1800 to ensure we don't stock out as the P23 order arrives.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline inventory updated to ~1283 units (P1: 157, P3: 224, P13: 451, P17: 49, P19: 402). Summer demand regime has softened further to ~155 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a summer demand regime with a 5-week mean of approximately 165 units/period (P21-P25). Despite an on-hand inventory of 108 units, the 'In-transit' balance of 1886 units is heavily distorted by phantom inventory from lost or severely delayed orders. Specifically, orders from P1 (157), P3 (224), P13 (451), and P19 (402) are clearly lost, totaling 1234 units. Recent orders from P23 (568) and others are currently within or slightly beyond the promised 2-period lead time. To ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment order, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds the current pipeline inventory (1886) plus desired safety stock relative to the expected demand of ~165. Setting mu_hat to 2600 (approx. 15.7x current demand) is intended to force the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation to a positive number, offsetting the 1886 units of phantom stock. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for potential demand variability and to maintain a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline inventory updated to ~1234 units (Confirmed lost: P1: 157, P3: 224, P13: 451, P19: 402). Summer demand regime is stable at ~165 units/period. mu_hat requires massive inflation (>1886) to bypass OR engine pipeline deductions.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 24-26) shows a stable summer regime averaging 137 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 527 units. The critical issue remains the massive 'In-transit' figure of 2336 units, which is heavily distorted by phantom inventory from lost or severely delayed orders (P1, P3, P13, P19, etc.). Based on historical tracking, confirmed or highly likely lost units total approximately 1234 (P1: 157, P3: 224, P13: 451, P19: 402). The OR engine's pipeline calculation subtracts these from the target base stock, preventing new orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated. To ensure the engine continues to place orders and maintain a healthy on-hand buffer against this distortion, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 2000. This value accounts for (1+L) periods of demand plus an offset for the stalled pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Current summer demand regime (P24-P26) stabilized at ~137 units/period. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains approximately 1234 units, requiring significant mu_hat inflation to trigger replenishment.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 24-27) has stabilized at a lower summer average of approximately 126.5 units/period (124+139+149+94 / 4). However, the system faces a massive 'phantom inventory' problem where multiple orders from the past are still recorded as 'In-transit' but are functionally lost or extremely delayed, causing the OR engine to under-order. Confirmed or highly likely lost orders include P1 (157), P3 (224), P13 (451), and P19 (402), totaling 1,234 units. Recent arrivals (P23's order arriving in P26) show that the actual lead time can vary up to 3 periods. To ensure the backend triggers a replenishment order despite the 2,336 units in-transit (of which ~1,234 are phantom), mu_hat must be set high enough to exceed the sum of (on-hand + actual in-transit). I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1,800 to ensure we maintain a safety stock for the current ~127 unit/period demand while bypassing the phantom pipeline deduction.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Aug) further softened to ~127 units/period. Phantom pipeline remains at ~1,234 units (P1, P3, P13, P19), requiring sustained mu_hat inflation.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ladies Denim' skinny ankle jeans has stabilized into a late-summer/pre-autumn regime. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is ~135 units/period. The main operational challenge remains the high 'In-transit' figure (2336 units), which significantly exceeds the actual demand. Analysis of this pipeline shows at least 1,234 units are confirmed lost or functionally vanished (Periods 1, 3, 13, and 19). Furthermore, the Period 26 order (1018 units) is currently in transit and expected in Period 29. Because the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock calculation, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset this 'phantom' inventory and prevent the backend from halting orders for the next 10+ weeks. I will use an explicit mu_hat of ~1639 (reflecting a baseline of 135 units/period across L+1=3 periods plus the 1,234 phantom units). This ensures the base stock remains high enough to trigger replenishment once current on-hand stock depletes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Sept 2, 2019. The demand regime has transitioned from a summer low (~125 units/period in August) to an expected stable early autumn period. For Periods 27-29, demand was 94, 169, and 87, averaging ~117. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 2336 units remains heavily distorted by a massive block of 'phantom pipeline' inventory that the OR engine will subtract from any order it calculates. This phantom inventory includes confirmed lost orders from P1 (157), P3 (224), P13 (451), and P19 (402), totaling 1234 units. Additionally, the P26 order (1018 units) is currently in-transit and 4 periods old (past the promised 2-period lead time). Total in-transit (2336) minus likely valid in-transit (1018) equals the phantom 1318 units identified in previous carry-overs. To continue bypassing the OR engine's pipeline deduction and maintain on-hand stock for the current demand regime (~120-130 units/period), mu_hat must be set to a value higher than the current 'In-transit' plus on-hand inventory. If the OR engine sees 2336 (in-transit) + 177 (on-hand) = 2513 to deduct, mu_hat must be significantly higher than this to trigger an order. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 3000 to ensure the engine generates a replenishment order, as actual on-hand stock is declining (177).

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Phantom pipeline inventory remains the primary constraint for the OR engine, consisting of ~1234 units of lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P19). The 1018 units ordered in P26 are now 4 periods old and potentially stalled/lost, which would raise total phantom inventory to ~2252 units. mu_hat requires massive inflation (3000+) to trigger any replenishment.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (P27-P30) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 111 units/period (avg of 94, 169, 87, 95). However, the primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' units (currently 2,925) from its base stock calculation. This 'In-transit' figure contains significantly overdue and likely lost shipments: P1 (157), P3 (224), P13 (451), P19 (402), and P26 (1,018), totaling approximately 2,252 units. To force the OR engine to place an order despite this internal deduction, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds (In-transit + desired On-hand). With demand at ~111 and lead time L=2, a normal (1+L)mu_hat would be ~333. To bypass the 2,925 deduction, mu_hat must be explicitly set much higher. I am setting mu_hat to 4,000 to ensure the engine triggers replenishment to maintain stock for the upcoming autumn transition, while holding sigma_hat at a level reflecting recent volatility (std of ~34 for the last 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to ~2,252 units with the addition of the P26 shipment (1,018 units), which is now 4 periods overdue. Current demand regime (Late Aug-Sept) stabilized at ~111 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge remains the OR engine's 'inventory view' and 'In-transit' accounting. The 'In-transit' counter currently shows 4,029 units. Based on historical data, the following orders are confirmed lost or significantly overdue: P1 (157), P3 (224), P13 (451), P19 (402), and P26 (1,018). Total 'phantom' pipeline inventory is approximately 2,252 units. To trigger any replenishment from the OR engine, the calculated base_stock (mu_hat) must exceed this phantom pipeline plus the current safety stock requirements. Demand has stabilized at a late-summer/autumn regime; the average demand from Period 27-31 is approximately 104 units/period. Therefore, target mu_hat must be significantly inflated (Base mu_hat for L=2 is ~312; adding 2,252 phantom units requires setting mu_hat > 2564). I will set mu_hat explicitly to 4000 to ensure the OR engine recognizes the need for replenishment despite the bloated in-transit figure, and set sigma_hat to reflect the steady but lower demand volatility seen in recent weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-219.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we finally received the large orders from Period 30 (589 units) and Period 31 (1104 units), bringing on-hand inventory to 1625 units. The phantom 'In-transit' inventory remains massive at 2407 units, largely comprised of lost shipments from earlier periods (P1, P3, P13, P19, and now likely P26 with 1018 units). However, the current demand regime has significantly softened during September to an average of ~81 units/period (P29-P32). With 1625 units on hand, we have approximately 20 periods of cover at current sales rates. Therefore, we should stop ordering entirely. To achieve a zero order while the OR engine calculates using a large phantom pipeline, we set mu_hat and L to their defaults; the engine will see that (on-hand + in-transit) far exceeds any reasonable base stock and will not place further orders. No manual inflation is needed this period as we are in an overstock position relative to recent demand.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (P29-P32) stabilized at a much lower average of ~81 units/period. Significant overstock (1625 units) now exists, mitigating the immediate impact of phantom pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current on-hand inventory is 1538 units, which is extremely high (nearly 18x current weekly demand) following the massive arrival of 1693 units in Period 32. Recent demand (P29-P33) has settled into a low autumn regime averaging ~84 units/period. The 'In-transit' count of 2407 includes significant phantom inventory: P1 (157), P3 (224), P13 (451), P19 (402), and P26 (1018), totaling 2252 units that are over 4 periods overdue and functionally lost. However, because on-hand inventory is so high, we no longer need to 'pull' more stock by inflating mu_hat. Instead, we should allow the system to naturally burn through the current excess. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current demand regime (~84 units/period) for a standard 3-period window (L+1), resulting in ~252. The OR engine will subtract the 2407 units in-transit from the base stock (calculated from mu_hat) and find the net to be negative, ensuring zero new orders are placed until the excess is cleared. This protects against additional holding costs while the true on-hand inventory remains sufficient for ~18 weeks of demand.

Carry-over insight: September/October demand regime confirmed at ~84 units/period (P29-P33). Overstock of 1538 units provides approximately 18 weeks of coverage at current rates. Phantom pipeline inventory remains approximately 2255 units (confirmed lost P1, P3, P13, P19, and P26).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P29-P34) remains stable in a low-demand regime, averaging ~81 units/period. The current on-hand inventory (1,473) is very high, providing approximately 18 weeks of coverage, which is far beyond the 2-period lead time. While the 'In-transit' figure of 2,407 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom' lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P19, and now P26, totaling ~2,252 units), the existing overstock makes this distortion irrelevant for the current period's decision. No new orders are needed. L is kept at default. mu_hat is set to the current demand level (~81 units) using recent_N (N=6) to track the post-summer decline, and sigma_hat is adjusted accordingly to reflect the current lower volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-664.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a significant overstock position (1500 units on-hand) due to high-volume orders placed in Periods 30 and 31. This stock covers approximately 20-25 weeks of current demand, which has stabilized at a lower regime of ~65 units/period (average of P33-P35). The 'In-transit' figure of 2336 units primarily consists of historical 'phantom' inventory (P1, P3, P13, P19, P26) which are long overdue and confirmed lost or stalled. While this phantom inventory usually suppresses the OR engine's replenishment, the current on-hand surplus is the primary driver of strategy now. My goal is to prevent any new orders and minimize holding costs while the overstock is depleted. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the contemporary low-demand regime, which will result in a base stock level far below current on-hand/pipeline totals, effectively halting further ordering.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed at ~65 units/period (P33-P35). Current on-hand inventory (1500) provides ~23 periods of coverage, shifting priority to holding cost mitigation over replenishment.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256005' is currently in a significantly overstocked state with 1,461 units on-hand. At the current demand rate (average of ~66 units over the last 5 periods: P32-P36), this inventory provides approximately 22 weeks of coverage. The demand has shown a clear downward trend from the summer peak (~180) to a stable autumn regime (~65). The OR engine's 'In-transit' figure of 2,336 units is heavily inflated by several confirmed/likely lost shipments: P1 (157), P3 (224), P13 (451), P19 (402), and P26 (1,018), totaling 2,252 units of phantom inventory. Given the high on-hand levels and the seasonal deceleration in demand for ankle-length denim moving into late October, the primary objective is to minimize holding costs by avoiding any new orders. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat with a low value to ensure the base stock remains well below the current on-hand plus pipeline inventory, effectively suppressing the OR backend's order trigger.

Carry-over insight: Late Oct demand regime confirmed at ~60 units/period (P34-P36). Sustained overstock (1461 units) avoids stockout risk despite ~2252 units of phantom pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P13, P19, P26).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a late October demand regime with significant overstock. Demand has transitioned from a summer average of ~130 units/period to a late-autumn/winter baseline of approximately 50-60 units/period (mean of last 4 periods: 49.75). Current on-hand inventory is 1410 units, which provides approximately 28 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. The primary objective remains maximizing profit by minimizing further holding costs while avoiding replenishment. The 'In-transit' figure of 2336 units consists of approximately 2252 units of 'phantom pipeline' (P1, P3, P13, P19, and P26) confirmed lost or excessively delayed, which the OR engine would normally subtract from its base stock calculation. However, since on-hand inventory (1410) is already substantially higher than any reasonable base stock for a 50-60 unit/period demand (which would be ~180-250 units including safety stock), no new orders should be placed. By setting parameters to 'default' or 'recent_N', the base stock will be low (~150-300), and the OR engine will see on-hand (1410) > base stock and naturally output an order of 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the recent downward trend in demand (44, 39, 51, 87, 65).

Carry-over insight: Late Oct/Nov demand regime confirmed at ~50 units/period (P34-P37). Massive overstock (1410 units) provides >25 weeks of coverage, rendering replenishment unnecessary for the remainder of the year.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for November is stable at a low regime (approx. 50-60 units/period). With 1,334 units on-hand, the inventory provides over 20 weeks of coverage. The 'In-transit' figure of 2,336 units is almost entirely composed of lost or stalled shipments from earlier periods (P1, P3, P13, P19, and P26), which would normally prevent the OR engine from ordering. However, given the massive overstock relative to current demand, there is no need for further replenishment. The goal now is to minimize holding costs while the on-hand inventory slowly depletes. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=8) to reflect the current low-demand environment, which will result in a base stock level well below the current on-hand amount, effectively stopping all new orders.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for SKU 399256005 (Ladies Ankle Jeans) has stabilized at a low late-year regime. The average demand over the last five periods (P35-P39) is approximately 51 units/period, significantly lower than the spring/summer peak. On-hand inventory is currently 1,287 units, which provides over 25 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. Despite the presence of 2,336 units in 'In-transit' (which includes approximately 2,252 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments in P1, P3, P13, P19, and P26), no further ordering is required. The priority remains minimizing holding costs given the massive surplus. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime and prevent any new orders by keeping the base stock target well below the current on-hand plus pipeline levels.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime (P35-P39) confirmed at ~51 units/period. On-hand inventory (1287) is sufficient for more than 25 periods, negating any replenishment needs for the rest of the year.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for this SKU has significantly settled into a low-volume late-autumn regime, with the average demand over the last five periods (P36-P40) being approximately 57 units per period. On-hand inventory is currently 1,215 units, which provides over 20 periods of coverage at current demand rates. The 'In-transit' figure of 2,336 units is almost entirely composed of 'phantom pipeline' (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P13, P19, and P26). Because the on-hand inventory is so high relative to demand, there is no risk of stockout for the remainder of the simulation (ending P47). Consequently, the objective is to avoid any further replenishment to minimize holding costs. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method (N=5) will result in values much lower than the current inventory level, ensuring the OR backend places no new orders, even after accounting for the lead time and the phantom pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-255.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for skinny ankle jeans has stabilized at a low end-of-season level. Over the last 7 periods (P35-P41), demand has averaged 54.4 units/period (44, 39, 51, 76, 47, 72, 48), supporting the recent insight of ~50-51 units/period. The on-hand inventory is 1167 units, which at the current demand rate covers more than 20 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 2336 units is almost entirely composed of phantom inventory from lost/stalled shipments (P1: 157, P3: 224, P13: 451, P19: 402, P26: 1018), totaling 2252 units. This means the 'true' pipeline plus on-hand is more than sufficient. Given the late November date (P42, 2019/11/25) and the game ending at P47, no more orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to a minimal value using recent_N (N=7) representing the current low-demand regime to ensure the OR engine does not trigger any orders, effectively allowing the system to coast on the existing massive overstock and minimize holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2213.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high overstock position (998 units on-hand) relative to the current late-year demand regime. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 169 units, possibly due to Black Friday/pre-holiday promotions, but the overall November/early December average remains low (~67 units/period over P39-P42). Even with the recent spike, the existing inventory provides over 14 periods of coverage at current rates. The 'In-transit' figure (2336 units) continues to be dominated by 'phantom' inventory from lost or significantly delayed shipments (P1, P3, P13, P19, and P26), totaling approximately 2252 units. Given the game is approaching Period 47 (end of the simulation) and the significant on-hand surplus, no further replenishment is required. I will maintain default settings for lead time and demand mean/variance, allowing the OR engine to naturally suppress ordering due to the high on-hand and pipeline levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike to 169 units in P42 (Nov 25) likely reflects holiday/Black Friday seasonality, though the preceding 3-week average was ~56 units/period. On-hand inventory represents >10 weeks of safety stock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019. Recent demand (P40-P43) has averaged 86 units/period, influenced by a Black Friday spike of 169 units in P42. Aside from that spike, the underlying late-autumn regime remains low, around 50-60 units/period. The on-hand inventory of 942 units is extremely high, providing approximately 11-18 periods of coverage depending on whether the holiday pace continues or demand reverts to the baseline. The in-transit pipeline of 2336 units remains composed entirely of 'phantom' inventory (lost orders from P1, P3, P13, P19, and P26). Given the massive overstock and the fact that we are approaching the end of the year (Period 44 of 47), the priority remains minimizing holding costs by avoiding any new orders. No mu_hat inflation is required because the current on-hand inventory safely exceeds the base stock level the OR engine would calculate even if the phantom inventory were not present. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent demand increase while allowing the high on-hand balance to naturally prevent ordering.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in a low-demand period following a brief holiday spike in late November (P42: 169 units). The demand for the last two periods (P43-P44) has returned to the stabilized average of approximately 48 units/period observed throughout November. On-hand inventory stands at 902 units, which provides approximately 18 periods of coverage at current demand rates. The 'In-transit' balance of 2336 units is comprised entirely of phantom inventory from historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P19, P26, and likely P30/P31 due to the massive discrepancy between ordered and arrived units in those phases). However, because current on-hand inventory is so high, there is no risk of stockout and no need to trigger replenishment by inflating mu_hat. The objective is now to minimize holding costs by allowing inventory to deplete naturally. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 5-period demand (capturing the holiday spike and subsequent return to baseline) and use default lead time.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime (post-Black Friday) has returned to ~48 units/period. High on-hand inventory (902) removes the need for mu_hat inflation despite ~2336 units of phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. Demand has stabilized after the late November (Black Friday) spike, with the last three periods (P43-P45) averaging 41.6 units per period. On-hand inventory is 873 units, providing approximately 21 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. There are approximately 2,336 units in the phantom pipeline (lost shipments from P1, P3, P13, P19, and P26). However, because on-hand inventory is so high, there is no risk of stockout and no need to inflate mu_hat to trigger new orders. We will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the late-year low-demand regime (averaging ~58 units/period) while ignoring the one-off spike in P42. The primary goal is to minimize holding costs by allowing inventory to deplete naturally.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 30th (Period 47). The demand for the last four weeks (P43-P46) has been 56, 40, 29, and 16, showing a clear post-holiday decline in late December. The average demand over these 4 periods is ~35 units/period. On-hand inventory is 857 units, which is extremely high given current demand levels (representing ~24 periods of protection). The 'In-transit' figure of 2336 units remains composed of long-lost 'phantom' orders (P1, P3, P13, P19, P26) and does not represent actual incoming stock. However, because on-hand inventory is so high, there is no risk of stockout and no need to inflate mu_hat to bypass the OR engine's pipeline deduction. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P42-P46, including the Black Friday spike and subsequent drop) to reflect the low current demand while acknowledging recent volatility, thus maintaining a zero-order signal to minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Late December demand (P44-P46) has dropped significantly to an average of ~28 units/period, down from the November/early December average (~60). High on-hand inventory (857) renders phantom pipeline inventory (~2336 units) irrelevant for current replenishment decisions.
