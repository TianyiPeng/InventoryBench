Historical data (last 5 weeks) shows an upward trend: 39, 38, 59, 55, 73 (Average: 52.8). The most recent demand (73) suggests a rising regime or seasonal shift as we move deeper into February. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To calculate the order, I need to cover demand for current Period 1, plus lead time (Period 2 and 3), totaling 3 periods (L+1). Based on the recent uptick, I estimate demand at ~65-70 units per period. Target pipeline = 70 * 3 = 210 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will order 210 units to establish the pipeline and meet upcoming demand.",

P6 order (120 units) is expected to arrive during P8 (if L=2) or should have arrived P7 (if L=1); since it didn't arrive P7, we expect it this period (P8). d) Inventory: On-hand is 32. In-transit consists of P6 (120 units) and P5 order from P5 (Note: History shows P5 order of 150 arrived in P6, and P1 is lost, so the 'In-transit: 330' reported by the system must include the 120 from P6 and likely the 210 from P1 that is stuck/lost).

(b) Demand Analysis: Prior history showed 50-60 units. Period 10-11 saw a drop (<25), but Periods 12-13 recovered to 47 and 41 units. The 'regime shift' noted in Period 12 was likely a temporary dip (Holiday/Easter effect or noise) rather than a permanent low, as demand is now averaging ~44 over the last two weeks. (c) Lead Time: Promised L=2. Historically, L has fluctuated between 1 and 2. Period 1 order (210) is definitively lost. Recent orders (P8, P9, P11) arrived within 1-2 periods. (d) Inventory: On-hand is 133. In-transit is 250 (P10: 40, P11: 50 - wait, P13 conclude shows P11 ordered 50 arrived. Checking In-transit calculation: Total ordered: P1(210)+P2(150)+P5(150)+P6(120)+P8(100)+P9(50)+P10(40)+P11(50)=870. Total arrived: P4(150)+P6(150)+P8(120)+P10(150)+P13(50)=620. In-transit = 870-620 = 250. However, P1(210) and P10(40) are the remaining components. P1 is lost. Therefore, 'Real' in-transit is likely 40 units from P10). (e) Logic: With demand at ~45/week and L=2, safety stock for 3 periods (L+1) is ~135 units. Current On-hand (133) + Real In-transit (40) = 173 units. This covers nearly 4 weeks of demand.

However, looking at the same time last year (pre-game historical samples: late Jan 59, 55; early Feb 73) and the early game periods (P1-P8 ranging from 38 to 94), demand for this SKU tends to be volatile but generally stronger than the current fortnight.

The valid active pipeline consists of orders from P38 (100 units), P39 (230 units), and the order placed in P40. Lead times have been volatile (1-3 periods). To cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the period of the next order (total 3 periods), I need approximately 384 units (128 units * 3). With 330 valid units in-transit and 0 on-hand, I am slightly short for the L+1 window. Additionally, P38's 100 units are expected to arrive in P41.

The total 'In-transit' is 1230, but based on carry-over insights, 780 units (from P1, P10, P19, P29, and P34) are confirmed lost. This leaves a valid pipeline of 450 units (P38: 100, P39: 230, P40: 120). Given the lead time volatility (range L=1 to L=3) and 0 on-hand inventory, I must ensure the pipeline covers the next 3 periods (L+1 + safety). At an average demand of 125, the required pipeline is ~375-450 units. Since current valid pipeline is exactly 450, but we are starting at 0 on-hand, I will order a buffer to account for potential late-season spikes or further shipment losses.
