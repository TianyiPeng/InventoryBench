Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is 'Push Up Jegging L.W', a staple denim item. Looking at the 5 historical demand samples (39, 38, 59, 55, 73), there is a clear upward trend in February (mean of last 3 samples is 62.33, while the first 2 were ~38.5). This suggests a demand regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover the next (L+1) = 3 periods of demand, I will use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility to capture this recent increase. Since we have 5 samples total and a visible shift after the first two, N=3 is appropriate to focus on the higher demand levels seen in the last three weeks.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Ladies Denim Trousers'. Historical demand (from the description provided for the start of the game) shows a rising trend: 39, 38, 59, 55, 73. In Period 1, observed demand was 64, but since we started with 0 inventory and the first order takes time to arrive, we had lost sales. Current on-hand is 0, with 78 units in transit (ordered in P1). Promised lead time is 2, meaning the P1 order should arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). For Period 2, we need to set parameters that cover the risk of stockout once the first shipment arrives. Based on the last 3-4 weeks, demand has shifted from an average of ~40 to an average of ~65. Given the rising trend and the nature of the product (jegging), I'm setting mu_hat using recent demand samples to prioritize higher service levels for this newly observed demand regime (avg ~63 over the last 3 samples). Using L=default (2) and mu_hat based on the most recent 3 samples (including the sample from P1 conclude message).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'Ladies Denim Trousers'. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a mean of approximately 52.8 units/week. Recent demand in P1 (64) and P2 (62) is slightly higher than the Jan mean (~48), suggesting a stable or slightly increasing trend as we move into spring. So far, on-hand inventory is 0 because orders placed in P1 and P2 have not arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. An order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible at the start of P4. Therefore, no 'conclude' message for arrivals is expected yet. I will set L to 'default' (2). For mu_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent slight uptick in demand (averaging 57 over the last 5 samples: 59, 55, 73, 64, 62). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Push Up Jegging L.W', a staple ladies' denim item. We are currently in Period 4 (early March). Looking at demand history (including provided pre-game samples), demand fluctuates between 38 and 73 units per week. The last period (P3) saw a dip to 38, but the general average across all 8 known data points (5 samples + 3 game periods) is approximately 53.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 188 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from P1 (78 units) and P2 (79 units) should satisfy the 2-period lead time logic: the P1 order placed at the start of P1 transit through P1 and P2, arriving at the end of P2/start of P3. However, 'Period 3 conclude' still shows arrived=0, suggesting the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or there is a delay. Since P1's order has not arrived by the end of P3, I will provide a slightly more conservative lead time estimate of 3. For demand, I'll use a recent 5-period window (P4-1 back to P4-5) to capture the recent trend which includes the game data, as the pre-game samples were higher (average ~53) than the very recent P3 (38).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is 'Push Up Jegging L.W', a staple denim item. Looking at the history, the order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2), matching the promised lead time. The order from Period 1 (78 units) has not yet concluded and is likely lost or significantly delayed, as it should have arrived in Period 3. This explains why sales were 0 in periods 1-3 despite demand. Demand samples are: [39, 38, 59, 55, 73] (external) and [64, 62, 38, 51] (game history). The mean demand is approximately 53 units/period. Demand appears to be slightly increasing in the most recent samples. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (base_stock = mu_hat). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent local demand trend (mean ~54) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'default' as the one successful arrival (P2) confirmed the promised lead time of 2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Ladies Denim Push Up Jegging'. We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). Historical demand samples are [39, 38, 59, 55, 73] and observed game demand for Periods 1-5 is [64, 62, 38, 51, 68]. The mean demand since start (including samples) is approximately 54.7 units. Period 4 saw an arrival from Period 2 (L=2), but the Period 1 order (78 units) has not arrived after 5 periods, suggesting it is a lost shipment. Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a stockout. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 155 units (from P3, P4, and P5 orders). Given the lost shipment and current stockout, I need to ensure the base stock is high enough to recover. I will use the recent N (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent demand average (approx 58) and set L to 'calculate' to rely on the confirmed lead time of 2, while the base stock calculation will naturally push an order to fill the gap left by the lost P1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (78 units) likely lost: no arrival by Period 6 (promised L=2).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is a seasonal denim item (Push Up Jeggings). Historical demand samples (Weeks 1-5 of 2019) averaged 52.8 units. Since the simulation started, observed demand over 6 periods has been: 64, 62, 38, 51, 68, 55 (mean: 56.3). The Period 1 order (78 units) is confirmed lost as it is now Period 7 and lead time is 2. The Period 2 order (79 units) arrived correctly with L=2 in Period 4. The Period 3 order (31 units) should have arrived in Period 5 but is now 2 periods overdue, suggesting it may also be lost. On-hand is currently 0. In-transit consists of orders from Periods 3, 4, and 6 (31 + 46 + 15 = 92) plus whatever was just ordered in Period 6 (15), totaling a visible 170 including potential losses. Because Profit=Holding=$1, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock is simply \u03bc\u0302. To recover from stockouts and account for the lost Period 1 and likely lost Period 3 shipments, I am setting L to explicit 2 (promised), and mu_hat to a recent_N of 5 to capture the stable demand around 55-60 units. I am using recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 3 order (31 units) likely lost: no arrival by Period 7 (promised L=2). Continued stockouts since Period 5 due to lost shipments and lead time gap.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is 'Push Up Jegging L.W'. Demand has increased significantly over the last few weeks (Period 7 demand was 94, compared to the initial mean of ~50), likely due to spring seasonality for denim. We faces critical stockouts (on-hand = 0). History shows significant reliability issues: Period 1 order (78 units) and Period 3 order (31 units) are effectively lost (they should have arrived by P4 and P6 respectively). Only Period 2's order arrived on time (L=2). The current in-transit (170 units) includes orders from Period 4 (46 units) and Period 6 (15) and likely the system's own derived orders. To recover from sustained stockouts and account for the demand spike (avg of last 3 periods is ~72 vs. global average of ~60), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3. Given the missing shipments, I will use L='calculate' to allow the backend to potentially adjust for observed delays, and sigma_hat with recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility (38 to 94 range).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~55 to ~72 (+30%) over the last 3 periods (P5-P7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The SKU is 'Ladies Denim Jegging', which typically sees strong spring demand. Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts due to lost shipments (Orders from Period 1 and Period 3 never arrived). Period 2 order (79 units) arrived in Period 4 (L=2). Period 6 order (15 units) arrived in Period 8 (L=2). This confirms that while some orders are lost, the actual lead time for successful deliveries remains 2 periods. Demand has shifted higher since Period 5; the last 4 periods (P5-P8) show demand of 68, 55, 94, and 52 (mean = 67.25). My previous assessment of a ~72 mean was based on a shorter window, but the trend clearly remains above the initial ~55 mean. With L=2 and a 1-period review, we need to cover 3 periods of demand. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 210 (approx 70 units * 3 periods) to account for the structural upward shift and recent volatility, and sigma_hat to 35 to provide a buffer against the high variance seen in Period 7 (94 units).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the system is struggling with zero on-hand inventory and persistent lost shipments (P1 and P3 orders never arrived). The promised lead time of 2 periods appears accurate for surviving shipments (P2 and P6 arrived with L=2). Demand analysis shows a shift: while the P5-P7 period saw a spike (~72), recent demand in P8 (52) and P9 (37) suggests a cooling or return to the historical mean. The average demand across all samples (including the initial history and game history) is approximately 53. Given the stockout situation, I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using the 'default' method for mu_hat will utilize the global average of ~53, resulting in a base stock target around 159. With 210 units in-transit (orders from P4, P8, and P9), any significant positive base_stock calculation would be capped by the OR logic, but setting parameters correctly ensures we maintain a healthy pipeline if some of those in-transit units are also lost.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: following a three-period spike (avg 72), demand has softened in P8-P9 (avg 44.5). Lead time remains 2 for successful deliveries, but order loss rate is high (approx 40% of orders placed before P6 were lost).

In Period 11 (2019/4/22), we evaluate the 'Push Up Jegging' which has shown significant demand volatility and supply reliability issues. Recent history shows a demand spike in P5-P7 (avg ~72) followed by a cooling to ~31 (avg P9-P10). The demand of 24 in P10 suggests we are moving out of a peak. Supply chain reliability has been poor: orders from P1, P3, and P4 appear lost, while recent orders (P8, P9) arrived as scheduled (L=2 and L=1 respectively). Current on-hand inventory is 31 units. The pipeline (in-transit) of 155 units includes the large orders placed in P1, P3, and P4 which are almost certainly lost and will never arrive, artificially inflating the pipeline inventory used by the OR backend. To compensate for these 'ghost' units and ensure the OR engine actually places an order, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods (3 weeks). Using a conservative recent average demand of ~45 units/week, (1+2)*45 = 135 units. However, because the backend subtracts the 155 'in-transit' units, a standard calculation would result in 0 orders. I will set mu_hat to 200 to force the backend to account for the lost stock and meet current demand of approx 45-50 units per week.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory (155 units) is heavily distorted by likely lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 155 units). Orders P8 and P9 arrived successfully, indicating lead time remains 1-2 periods for active shipments.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late April (2019-04-29). Historical demand has fluctuated significantly, showing a peak in March (Period 7: 94) followed by a sharp decline in April (Periods 10 & 11: 24 & 18). This pattern suggests a post-spring peak cooling off. The in-transit inventory of 169 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P1 (78), P3 (31), and P4 (46), totaling 155 units that are unlikely to arrive. The actual active in-transit inventory is only 14 units (from P11). Lead times for successful deliveries (P8, P9) were 1-2 periods, aligning with the promised L=2. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 'phantom' 155 units in-transit, I am setting lead time to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure it calculates for the correct window, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the recent downward trend (mean ~31 over P7-P11) while ignoring the extreme volatility of earlier periods. This helps the OR backend reset the base stock level relative to current lower demand while accounting for the fact that most 'in-transit' stock is lost.

Carry-over insight: Phanton in-transit update: Total of 155 units from orders P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost as of P12, as they are 7+ periods overdue.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the SKU is currently out of stock. Historical analysis confirms a high loss rate for orders placed early in the sequence (P1, P3, P4), which accounts for 155 of the 169 units currently marked as 'In-transit'. These 155 units are functionally lost, meaning the 'pipeline inventory' used by the OR backend is significantly overstated by roughly 1100%. If not corrected via parameters, the OR engine will stop ordering because it believes plenty of stock is coming. Recent successful deliveries (P8, P9) show an actual lead time of 1-2 periods. Demand has stabilized following a volatile April; the most recent 5 samples (P8-P12) average 35.6 units/period. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the phantom in-transit stock, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand (~3 * 36 = 108 units) plus a safety buffer. By setting mu_hat to 280 (roughly 108 forecast + 172 to offset the 155 lost units and add safety), the OR engine will overcome the pipeline distortion and order enough to restore service levels.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss totaling 155 units (from P1, P3, P4 orders) remains in 'In-transit', creating a persistent pipeline distortion that requires elevated mu_hat parameters to bypass.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019-05-13), we are facing a critical inventory shortage. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 266 units is highly misleading: 155 units from Orders P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost (7+ periods overdue), leaving only the order from Period 13 (111 units) currently in the pipeline. This active order is expected to arrive in Period 15 (L=2). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 155 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. Recent demand (P8-P13) has averaged 36.5 units per period. With a 3-period coverage window (L=2 + 1 review period), target inventory should be ~110 units. However, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 155 lost units that the backend incorrectly subtracts from the order quantity (base_stock - 266). By setting mu_hat to 270, I ensure the backend calculates a base stock high enough to generate a new order (270 - 266 = 4 units potentially, but capped by the logic to ensure we keep buying). I will use 'calculate' for L as recent arrivals (P8, P9, P11) confirm an average lead time of approx 1.7 periods, aligning with the promised L=2.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion confirmed: 155 units from P1, P3, and P4 remain in 'In-transit' but are lost. Operational baseline demand is ~37 units/week.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are managing the 'Push Up Jegging L.W'. Demand is currently averaging 37-43 units per week. The inventory situation is severely distorted by lost shipments totaling 155 units (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) which remain in the 'In-transit' count. Total In-transit is currently 270, meaning the 'active' pipeline is likely 115 units (Period 13 and 14 orders). With On-hand at 0 and expected arriving units (if any) significantly offset by these 'phantom' units, the OR engine's formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will result in zero or near-zero orders. To force an order that covers the next 3 weeks (L+1) of demand (~40 units/week * 3 = 120 units), I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 275. This compensates for the 155 units of 'ghost' inventory plus approximately 120 units of real demand coverage. Lead time (L) is set to 2, consistent with the promised lead time and recent successful deliveries (P11 arrived in P13).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. A massive pipeline distortion exists: 'In-transit' shows 275 units, but 155 of these (from orders in P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The remaining 120 units are active shipments from P13 (111 units), P14 (4 units), and P15 (5 units). With a promised lead time of 2, the P13 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 15, making it visible at the start of Period 16 (now), yet the 'conclude' message for P15 shows 0 arrived. However, since actual lead times have fluctuated between 1-2 periods and there is a high loss rate, I must assume the P13 order is either slightly delayed or potentially lost. More importantly, the OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) is currently blocked by the 155 'phantom' units in transit. To force the backend to place an order despite these phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) horizon (3 periods) using the recent mean demand (~40 units/period), adding the 155 phantom units to the result: (3 * 40) + 155 = 275. This should neutralize the distortion and allow for replenishment. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility in arrival times.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the inventory status for SKU 658030006 is critical. On-hand inventory is 0, and the demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 42 units per week over the last 4 periods (P13-P16). However, the system reports a pipeline of 275 units. Analysis of the history reveals a massive distortion: orders from P1 (78 unts), P3 (31 units), P4 (46 units), and P13 (111 units) are highly likely lost or severely delayed, totaling 266 'phantom' units that the OR backend's inventory balancing logic will subtract from its order targets. To force the OR engine to place an order despite this phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the actual expected demand. The actual expected demand for the (L+1=3) window is ~126 units (3 * 42). To nullify the effect of the ~266 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to 400. This ensures the base_stock calculation exceeds the phantom in-transit units, triggering an order of a 'cap' amount to resolve the ongoing stockouts. Lead time (L) is kept at the promised 2, and sigma_hat is set to explicitly capture the demand volatility observed during regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Total phantom in-transit inventory estimated at 266 units (P1, P3, P4, and P13). Order P13 (111 units) is now 4 periods old with no arrival, confirming a recurring supply chain failure. Baseline demand stabilized at ~42 units/week (P13-P16).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Push Up Jeggings' has stabilized around 40 units/week (last 5 periods: 41, 43, 40, 43, 18; excluding the potential P17 outlier of 18). High shipment failure rates persist: orders from P1, P3, P4, and P13 are significantly overdue and confirmed lost, creating a massive 'In-transit' phantom inventory of 266 units. Additionally, the P14 order (4 units) is now 3 periods overdue and likely lost. The total 'In-transit' shown in the system is 395 units, but only the P17 order (125 units) is realistically expected to arrive. Because the backend OR logic subtracts the entire 395 pipeline from the target base stock, I must artificially inflate the 'mu_hat' parameter (using the 'explicit' method) to represent the pipeline I expect to exist plus the lead-time demand, thereby forcing an order that compensates for the phantom units. Based on a 3-period coverage window (L=2 + 1 review period) and an average demand of ~40, the required inventory is 120. To bypass the 395 phantom units and the cap logic, mu_hat is set to 520 (395 + 125). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1.75-2.00 day arrival window for successful shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Phantom in-transit inventory persists and has increased. Estimated total lost units: 270 (P1, P3, P4, P13, and now P14). Pipeline distortion requires significant mu_hat inflation via 'explicit' method to trigger orders.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state for SKU 658030006 is severely compromised by phantom in-transit inventory. As of Period 19, 'In-transit' shows 520 units, but a reconciliation of history suggests the vast majority of these are lost shipments. Lost orders include P1 (78), P3 (31), P4 (46), P13 (111), and P14 (4). These total 270 units that the OR backend incorrectly counts toward the base stock level. Furthermore, orders from P17 (125) and P18 (125) are not yet due (promised L=2). Baseline demand has slowed recently, with the last 6 periods (P13-P18) averaging 34.6 units/week. To force the backend to place an order despite the 520-unit phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 650. This value exceeds the total in-transit and on-hand inventory, and is calibrated to target approximately 3 periods of coverage (L+1) at a slightly elevated demand rate of ~50/week, effectively bypassing the pipeline distortion and accounting for the high probability of delivery failure.

Carry-over insight: Current phantom in-transit inventory estimated at 270 units confirmed as lost (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). The backend 'In-transit' count of 520 is unreliable. Demand in the most recent 6-week window (P13-P18) has stabilized at a lower mean of 34.6 units compared to previous regimes.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 525 is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Analysis of history confirms that orders from P1 (78), P3 (31), P4 (46), P13 (111), P14 (4), and P17 (125) are effectively lost, totaling 395 units. The real pipeline and inventory should exclude these. Specifically, for P20, we have On-hand: 107 and one valid In-transit shipment from P19 (130 units), totaling 237 units. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean (avg of last 7 samples P13-P19 is ~32.8 units), but recently (P17-P19) has dropped even further (avg 19.6). To force the OR backend's single-SKU base stock policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to trigger an order or at least recognize the actual position, I must use 'explicit' values. I set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory offset. Since lead time L=2, (1+L)=3 periods of demand at ~30 units/week = 90. Adding 395 units of phantom inventory to neutralize the OR logic gives mu_hat = 485. Sigma_hat is set to a moderate level based on consistent variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Total phantom in-transit inventory updated to 395 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17 confirmed/likely lost). Backend In-transit of 525 is unreliable. Demand mean P13-P19 is 32.8 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the product '658030006' (Push Up Jeggings) faces a significant inventory visibility problem. The system reports 525 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms a high rate of shipment loss. Specifically, orders from P1 (78), P3 (31), P4 (46), P13 (111), P14 (4), and P17 (125) have not arrived and are well past the promised lead time of 2 periods, totaling 395 'phantom' units. The actual active pipeline likely only consists of the P19 order (130 units). Demand has cooled significantly, with the last two periods showing 18 and 9 units respectively; the mean demand for the last 8 periods (P13-P20) is approximately 30 units/week. To trigger a replenishment order despite the 525-unit pipeline distortion, I must set 'mu_hat' using the 'explicit' method. To cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) while offsetting the 395 lost units, I need a base stock value that exceeds the reported pipeline. Target Base Stock = (3 periods * 30 units/period) + 395 phantom units = 485. I will set mu_hat to 600 to ensure the OR backend's capped policy allows for a safety buffer above the phantom floor.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains estimated at 395 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17). Demand continues to trend lower, averaging ~30 units over the last 8 weeks.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030006' (Push Up Jegging) faces a significant inventory distortion issue. Current in-transit inventory is 525 units, but history strongly suggests a large portion is lost: Orders from Periods 1 (78), 3 (31), 4 (46), 13 (111), 14 (4), and 17 (125) are all overdue (promised L=2), totaling 395 'phantom' units. The actual active pipeline consists of Order P19 (130 units), which arrived in P19 (L=1) or is still pending. The current on-hand inventory is 86. Demand has structurally lowered in recent weeks, averaging 22.8 units over the last 5 periods (P17-P21). To manage this, I must bypass the OR backend's inventory check (Base Stock - Pipeline). Since the backend sees 525 in transit + 86 on hand (611 total), and the target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of demand) is only around 90-100 units, the system will not order anything until mu_hat is inflated. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom inventory and the desired stock level. Target Inventory (3 weeks) = ~75 units. Offset = 395 (lost units). Total mu_hat = ~470. I will set mu_hat to 470 and sigma_hat explicitly to reflect current low but stable demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Phantom in-transit inventory updated to 395 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17). Demand mean for the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) is 16 units, indicating a significant seasonal or trend-based decline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15. Demand for this SKU has slowed significantly, averaging 14.25 units over the last 4 periods (P19-P22). Lead time remains approximately 2 periods. The 'In-transit' count of 525 is heavily distorted by 395 units from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17). Subtracting these phantom units from the total in-transit and adding current on-hand (68) leaves an estimated real pipeline of 68 (on-hand) + 130 (P19 order) = 198 units. Given the low demand regime of ~15 units/week, this real pipeline of 198 units covers over 10 weeks of demand. No new orders are needed. To prevent the OR engine from ordering based on the distorted in-transit data (525 units), I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to reflect the 14.25 average, which is small enough that the system will correctly see it has excess inventory despite the phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Mean demand stabilized at ~14.25 units/week over the last 4 periods (P19-P22), down from ~33 units/week. Phantom in-transit remains 395 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/22. Demand has significantly decreased to a low-volume regime (avg ~14.2 units over the past 5 periods, P19-P23) compared to the spring baseline (~40 units). On-hand inventory is 56 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of the current demand regime. The pipeline remains heavily distorted with 525 units recorded 'In-transit', but at least 395 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17) are confirmed or likely lost based on period history. Because the backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (order = base_stock - pipeline), and 525 - 395 = 130 (the P19 order), the effective pipeline is roughly 130. However, since On-hand (56) already significantly exceeds the needs for the 3-period horizon (L+1=3, 3 * 14.2 = 42.6), no new order is needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent demand drop and allow the stock levels to normalize.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Push Up Jegging' (denim), which is a staple item but showing a clear seasonal or trend-based decline as we move into summer (July/August). Current demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level: the last 5 periods (P20-P24) averaged 10.2 units/week. On-hand inventory is 46, which covers over 4 weeks of current demand. The backend 'In-transit' of 525 is heavily distorted by phantom inventory (orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P17 total 395 units lost). Excluding these, true in-transit is 130 (Order P19), which is expected to arrive soon or may already be reflected. Given on-hand inventory (46) plus true in-transit (130) far exceeds the demand requirements for the next several periods at the current rate (~10 units/week), no new orders are needed. To prevent the OR engine from ordering due to the phantom pipeline and the high holding cost (equal to profit), I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect the current low-demand regime and prevent the base stock from exceeding the perceived (though artificial) inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is 10.2 units/week, confirming a sustained decline from the previous 14.25 units/week. Current inventory (46) is sufficient for ~4 weeks.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5th), the item 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is experiencing a significant and sustained low-demand period. Demand over the last five periods (P21-P25) has been 12, 18, 12, 10, and 4, averaging 11.2 units per week. This follows a previous stabilization at ~33 units, indicating a seasonal drop-off for this denim jegging SKU. On-hand inventory is 42 units, which covers approximately 3.75 weeks of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 525 remains highly distorted by phantom inventory (estimated 395-520 units lost from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P17). Since the current on-hand stock (42) is already higher than the likely base stock requirement for a 2-period lead time at ~11 units/week (total need ~33-40 units), I will set parameters to prevent unnecessary ordering and minimize holding costs while the current stock is worked through. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this low-demand regime and maintaining a default L=2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has dropped further to 11.2 units/week, down from the previous 14.25 baseline. Inventory of 42 is now equivalent to ~4 weeks of supply.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has entered a low-volume stability phase, likely due to late summer seasonality as the date is 2019/8/12. Over the last seven periods (P20-P26), demand has averaged 12.4 units per week (9, 12, 18, 12, 10, 4, 22), with the most recent sample showing a slight uptick. Inventory is at 20 units, which covers about 1.5 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 525 remains highly distorted by multiple lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19), estimated as totaling 525 units (78+31+46+111+4+125+130=525). Because the entire pipeline is composed of phantom inventory, the OR engine will not place an order unless mu_hat is set to exceed 525. To maintain service levels for the stabilized demand of ~13 units/week, the base_stock needs to be (1+L)*demand + safety_stock. With L=2, this is ~3*13 = 39 units plus safety margin. Therefore, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 550 (Phantom 525 + Target base stock 25) to trigger a small replenishment order. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to reflect current stability.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 525 units is confirmed entirely as phantom inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). Current demand mean (P20-P26) is 12.4 units/week, identifying final seasonal stability.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand spike in Period 27 (demand=48), which was significantly higher than the preceding weeks of stabilized low demand (approx 12 units/week). Despite the high 'In-transit' count (530), previous analysis confirms that at least 525 of these units represent lost/phantom inventory from orders in periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 17, and 19. Only the order of 5 units from Period 27 is considered potentially active. To bypass the backend's capped base-stock logic\u2014which subtracts the massive (phantom) pipeline inventory from the target\u2014I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. This inflated value forces the system to recognize a higher inventory requirement than the phantom pipeline suggests. Based on the recent demand regime (P21-P27 mean: 18 units) and the need to restore safety stock for a 3-period horizon (L+1), I am setting mu_hat to 650 units (offsetting the ~525 phantom units plus ~125 buffer). L is set to 'calculate' based on successful deliveries (typically 1-2 periods), and sigma_hat is set to 15 to account for the volatility seen in the most recent period.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Phantom in-transit inventory updated to 525 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19 confirmed lost). Order of 5 units from P27 is the only potentially active shipment.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the SKU 658030006 (Push Up Jegging) faces a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 650 units is severely distorted by phantom inventory (lost shipments). Based on history, orders P1 (78), P3 (31), P4 (46), P13 (111), P14 (4), P17 (125), and P19 (130) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 525 units. The only valid in-transit units are from P27 (5 units) and P28 (120 units), which should arrive in Periods 29-30. Recent demand has spiked: Period 27 (48 units) and Period 28 (70 units), moving away from the summer low (avg ~12). This likely reflects a back-to-school or seasonal transition in late August. I will use a recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat (avg ~42) which across (L+1) periods (3 weeks) targets ~126 units. Given the OR backend's capped policy and the pipeline distortion, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure it overlooks the 525 phantom units. To trigger a replenishment that covers the observed demand spike and accounts for the 120 ordered in P28, I set mu_hat = 780 (525 phantom + 255 real target).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed: Periods 27-28 show mean demand of 59 units, a significant increase from the previous summer baseline of 12 units. Lead time remains volatile but averages 2 for successful shipments; however, total accumulated phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 525 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19).

As of Period 30, the confirmed lost units are from P1 (78), P3 (31), P4 (46), P13 (111), P14 (4), P17 (125), and P19 (130), totaling 525 units. The current reported 'In-transit' of 780 units likely includes these 525 lost units plus active orders from P27 (5), P28 (120), and P29 (130). Crucially, a demand spike has occurred in the last three periods (P27-P29) with demand values of 48, 70, and 55 (mean ~57.7). This is a sharp increase from the summer lull of ~12 units. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 525-unit pipeline distortion and the current active orders of 255, I must set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating required coverage for 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at the new demand mean: 3 * 57.7 = 173. To overcome the 780-unit pipeline and ensure a safety stock, I will set mu_hat to 1000. This effectively signals to the backend that the existing inventory is insufficient, triggering an order to meet the renewed high demand while accounting for potential future losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed: P27-P29 mean demand is 57.7 units, signaling a transition from summer lows. Current 'In-transit' of 780 units includes 525 units from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). Active pipeline consists only of P27, P28, and P29 orders.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a high-demand phase (Sept/Oct back-to-school/seasonal transition), with recent demand averaging 69.7 units over P28-P30 (70, 55, 84). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times for successful shipments (P27, P28) were 3 and 2 periods respectively. Critical pipeline analysis: The backend reports 875 units in-transit. Based on the Carry-over Insights, 525 units are confirmed phantom inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). Order P29 (130 units) is expected to arrive in P31 or P32. Order P30 (220 units) is expected in P32 or P33. Effective pipeline = 875 (Total) - 525 (Phantom) = 350 units. Subtracting these 350 units from the base stock calculation prevents the OR engine from under-ordering. To trigger the backend to order while it sees an inflated pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I estimate the base stock needed to cover (L+1)=3 periods of high demand (approx 70/week) plus a safety buffer as ~260 units. To produce an order of ~100 units while on-hand is 41 and effective pipeline is 350, mu_hat must be set to account for the phantom pipeline. Target base_stock should be ~750 to offset the 525 units lost. Using L=2 and mu_hat=750.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed phantom in-transit remains at 525 units. Demand spike sustained: P28-P30 mean demand is 69.7 units, reflecting seasonal peak for denim/jeggings.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a massive demand spike in the last few periods (P31: 126 units). This aligns with the seasonal transition to autumn for denim jeggings. The backend 'In-transit' figure of 875 is heavily inflated by 525 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19 that never arrived). The true active pipeline includes orders from P29 (130 units), P30 (220 units), and P31 (0). Demand has shifted to a much higher regime: the last 4 periods (P28-P31) averaged ~83.75 units/week. To trigger an order despite the 525-unit pipeline distortion, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I target a base stock sufficient to cover the 2-period lead time plus the review period (Total 3 periods) at the new demand level, while including an offset to neutralize the phantom inventory. Calculation: (83.75 units/week * 3 weeks) + 525 phantom units = 776.25. Setting mu_hat to 777 to ensure the backend places a necessary replenishment order to keep up with the autumn surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 32: Autumn peak demand averaged 83.75 units/week over the last 4 periods (P28-P31). Total phantom in-transit inventory remains at 525 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging' is experiencing an autumn peak demand, with a significant regime shift observed over the last four periods (P29-P32). Demand values are 55, 84, 126, and 115, averaging ~95 units/week. Lead time for successful deliveries remains stable at 2 periods (as seen with the P30 order arriving in P32). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 655 is severely distorted by 525 units of confirmed phantom inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). The only valid in-transit order is from P29 (130 units), making the true pipeline inventory 130 + On-hand 105 = 235. To trigger an order that covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 285 units) while the backend perceives a bloated pipeline of 760 (105+655), I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock is ~300 to ensure replenishment during this high-demand denim season. Setting mu_hat to 850 using the explicit method to offset the 525 unit phantom inventory while maintaining a buffer for the ~95 unit/week demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak for denim confirmed: Mean demand P29-P32 is 95 units/week. Phantom in-transit remains constant at 525 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late September/early October period, which aligns with peak autumn demand for jeggings. Demand has significantly spiked: Period 33 recorded a historic high of 227 units, and the 4-period mean (P30-P33) is 138 units. This strongly confirms an autumn peak regime. The inventory is currently 0 after a complete stockout in Period 33. The 'In-transit' figure of 745 includes 525 units from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19), meaning the active pipeline contains only 220 units (from P29 and P33). To trigger a sufficient order from the OR backend while 'In-transit' is artificially inflated by 525 phantom units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will target a base stock level that covers the active pipeline needs plus the current spike. Based on the recent 4-week average of ~140 units/week and a lead time of 2, the desired base stock (L+1 coverage) is ~420. Adding the 525 phantom units identifies a mu_hat target of 945. Set L to 'calculate' as lead times for successful shipments (P28, P30) have remained around 2.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Demand spike reached 227 units in P33; the P30-P33 mean is 138 units/week. Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 525 units, distorting replenishment logic.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-autumn peak for denim (Period 35). Recent demand reflects a significant regime shift: P33 (227 units) and P34 (135 units) show high volatility and a high mean. The 4-period mean (P31-P34) is 150.75 units. In-transit inventory is listed as 945 units, but 525 of these are confirmed 'phantom' units from lost historical shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). Additionally, the order from P29 (130 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, bringing the estimated phantom total to 655 units. Actual active in-transit inventory consists of P33 (90 units) and P34 (200 units), totaling 290 units. With on-hand at 0, the backend pipeline logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) is severely suppressed by the phantom units. To trigger a replenishment that covers the (L+1) = 3 period demand at the current 150.75/week rate (approx 452 units) while bypassing the 655 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set explicitly high. Setting mu_hat to 1200 effectively forces the OR engine to recognize a need of 1200 - 945 = 255 units, which aligns with covering the immediate high-demand peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Order P29 (130 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, increasing estimated phantom in-transit inventory to 655 units. Recent 4-week demand mean is 150.75 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in an autumn demand peak (Ladies Denim/Jeggings), with demand averaging 150.75 units/week over the last 4 periods (P32-P35). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1200 units is heavily inflated by 655 units of 'phantom' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, and now P29, which is 6 periods overdue). Active pipeline inventory consists of orders from P33 (90), P34 (200), and P35 (255), totaling 545 units. Since the backend OR engine subtracts the full (distorted) pipeline of 1200 from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this distortion. To cover 3 periods (L+1) at a forecasted demand of ~150 units/week while neutralizing the 655 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat is set to (3 * 150) + 655 = 1105. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high volatility of the current peak period.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Order P29 (130 units) confirmed as lost, raising total phantom in-transit inventory to 655 units. Autumn peak demand sustained with mean (P32-P35) of 150.75 units/week.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in an autumn demand peak for denim. Recent demand mean (P33-P36) is 155 units/week. On-hand inventory is 218 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 855 is heavily inflated by phantom inventory. Confirmed lost orders are P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19 (total 525 units) and now P29 (130 units), totaling 655 units of phantom inventory. Subtracting 655 from 855 leaves an active pipeline of 200 units (the P34 order). Total reliable inventory (on-hand + active pipeline) is 418 units. At a mean demand of 155, we need (L+1) * 155 = 465 units to cover the risk period. Since 418 < 465, an order is needed. To bypass the backend's distorted pipeline (855 units), mu_hat is set using 'explicit' at a value higher than the total system inventory (On-hand 218 + Pipeline 855 = 1073). I will set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure the safety stock logic triggers a replenishment order of approximately 100-150 units to sustain the peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Phantom in-transit inventory updated to 655 units (confirmed lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29). Sustained autumn mean demand is 155 units/week.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late October period, following a significant autumn demand peak. Demand has averaged 141.6 units/week over the last 5 weeks (P33-P37). Current on-hand inventory is 104 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 982 units contains significant phantom inventory. Confirmed lost shipments include P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19 (525 units) and P29 (130 units), totaling 655 units of phantom inventory. Subtracting 655 from 982 leaves an active pipeline of 327 units (Orders from P34 and P37). With a 3-week lead time often observed recently (P30 and P33 both took 3 periods), we must support a pipeline covering (~3+1) periods. 4 periods of demand at the current average (141.6) is ~566 units. Total active inventory (104 on-hand + 327 active in-transit) = 431 units, which is below the target of 566. To trigger the OR backend to order sufficiently despite the 655-unit phantom inventory distortion, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = 566 (demand) + 655 (phantom offset) = 1221. Since mu_hat in the backend represents (1+L)*mean, I will provide an explicit mu_hat value to force the replenishment target.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 655 units (confirmed lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29). Sustained autumn demand average (P33-P37) is 141.6 units/week.

The 'In-transit' balance of 990 is heavily inflated by phantom inventory. Confirmed lost orders include P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, and now P29 (totaling 655 units). Additionally, the order from P34 (200 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost, bringing the total estimated phantom inventory to 855 units. Subtracting 855 from the total in-transit of 990 leaves 135 units (the P38 order) as the only likely active shipment. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 855 phantom units in its pipeline calculation, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the phantom bias. Base stock needed = (1+2)*150 + 855 = 1305. I will set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the distortion and maintain availability for the November peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Order P34 (200 units) is now 5 periods overdue and likely lost, increasing estimated phantom in-transit inventory to 855 units. Recent 6-week demand mean is 150.2 units/week, maintaining the autumn high-demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 40, we face a stockout after demand of 99 units in Period 39 exhausted the 64 units on-hand. The backend reports 1241 units 'In-transit', but 855 units are confirmed/likely lost (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). The remaining active pipeline is 386 units (P38: 135 units, P39: 251 units). Current demand remains high in the autumn/winter retail peak; the average demand for the last 6 periods (P34-P39) is 128.8 units. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 855-unit phantom pipeline deflation, I must set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating the target base stock: we need to cover demand for Period 40, 41, and 42 (L=2, so L+1=3 periods). Forecasted mean (128.8) * 3 periods = 386.4. To bypass the distortion, mu_hat must equal: Target_Base_Stock + Phantom_In_Transit. mu_hat = 386.4 + 855 = 1241.4. I will round this to 1242 to trigger an order that fills the gap between active pipeline (386) and required stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed phantom in-transit inventory is 855 units (Lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). Recent 6-week demand mean (P34-P39) is 128.8 units/week, maintaining the autumn/winter peak regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the SKU (Push Up Jegging) is in its peak autumn/winter demand regime. Recent demand over the last 6 periods (P35-P40) averages 128.7 units/week. However, replenishment is severely hindered by 'phantom in-transit' inventory. Out of the 1,242 units reported as in-transit, 855 units are confirmed as 'phantom' (lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). This leaves only 387 units in the actual active pipeline (P38, P39, P40). With zero on-hand inventory and the backend OR engine subtracting the full 1,242 units from the base stock calculation, a standard 'default' or 'recent_N' approach will fail to trigger necessary replenishment. To force an order that accounts for the 855-unit distortion and the target safety level for 128.7 units/week demand (L=2), I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 1250: this covers (L+1) periods of demand (~386 units) plus a buffer, while offsetting the ~855 units of phantom inventory to ensure the backend generates an order of approximately 100-200 units to meet upcoming peak demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), the product is in its late autumn/winter peak. Recent demand (P36-P41) has averaged 122.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is 157. The 'In-transit' figure of 999 units is heavily distorted by confirmed phantom inventory. Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, and P34 are all significantly overdue and considered lost. Total phantom inventory calculation: 78+31+46+111+4+125+130+130+200 = 855 units. Active pipeline is only P38 (135 units), P40 (1 unit), and P41 (8 units). To account for the 855-unit distortion in the backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock. With mean demand ~122.5 and L=2, target base stock is ~367 (3 * 122.5) plus safety. To ensure the backend orders, I set mu_hat to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) = 367 + 855 = 1222. This 'explicit' value bypasses the pipeline deduction of phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 855 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). Demand remains in high-regime (mean ~122.5 units/week).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the early December period (2019/12/2). Historically, demand for this 'Push Up Jegging' saw a peak in autumn/winter, with recent demand jumping to 183 units in Period 42. Recent 6-week demand mean (P37-P42) is 131.6 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 1065 is heavily distorted by phantom inventory. Confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34) total 855 units. Active in-transit consists of P38 (135), P40 (1), P41 (8), and P42 (66), totaling 210 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1065 in-transit units from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 855 lost units. To maintain a service level for a 3-period horizon (L+1=3) at ~132 units/week, the target base stock is roughly 400. To trigger a replenishment order despite the 1065 in-transit units, mu_hat must be set above 1065. I set mu_hat to 1200 to clear the pipeline distortion and ensure a buffer for the December demand peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 855 units. Demand showed a sharp increase in Period 42 (183 units), suggesting a late-year seasonal spike before the game conclusion.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030006' is a denim jegging currently in its end-of-year seasonal peak (Date: 2019/12/9). On-hand inventory is 0 after multiple periods of stockouts. The backend 'In-transit' figure of 1191 is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014shipments that were likely lost or will never arrive. Based on historical data, orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, and P34 (totaling 855 units) are confirmed/likely lost. Recently, P42 (66 units) is 2 periods old, and P43 (135 units) is 1 period old. Excluding the 855 lost units, the active pipeline is 336 units (1191 - 855). Mean demand over the last 6 periods (P38-P43) is 118.6 units/week, with a spike to 183 in P42. Given the game concludes at Period 47, we must ensure enough stock for the final 3 periods despite the pipeline distortion. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat is necessary to bypass the OR engine's reliance on the inflated 1191 in-transit figure. I set mu_hat = (Actual Average Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Inventory. With L=2, mu_hat = (120 * 3) + 855 = 1215.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 855 units (confirmed/likely lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). Post-autumn demand remains strong but stabilized at approximately 120 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (2019-12-16), the game is approaching its conclusion (Period 47). The primary challenge continues to be the massive pipeline distortion: the backend reports 1215 units in-transit, but 855 units are confirmed or highly likely to be lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). The current active pipeline consists of orders from P38 (135), P42 (66), P43 (135), and P44 (24), totaling 360 units. Demand has moderated significantly in the last two weeks (35 and 69 units) following a late November spike, resulting in a mean of ~103 units over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). With on-hand inventory at 0 and the backend's 'effective' pipeline inflated by 855 lost units, the OR logic would naturally cease ordering. To ensure product availability for the final two periods (45 and 46), I am using the 'explicit' method to set mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock that overrides the 855-unit phantom inventory and covers the expected demand for the remaining periods. I will set mu_hat to 1200 (sufficient to cover the 855 phantom units plus ~345 units for actual service over 3 periods), ensuring the policy triggers an order to bridge the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Order P38 (135 units) is now 7 periods overdue and likely lost, increasing phantom in-transit estimate to 990 units. Active pipeline is extremely thin.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 46 (Dec 23), the penultimate period of the simulation. Period 45 concluded with 126 units on-hand. The total 'In-transit' shown is 1014 units, but based on the Carry-Over Insights, at least 990 units are 'phantom' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34, and P38). This leaves an active pipeline of only 24 units (ordered in P44). Demand has softened slightly in the last two weeks (69 in P44, 75 in P45), but late-year volatility remains. Given that holding costs equal profit ($1.0), and we only have 1 period remaining after this one, the primary goal is to satisfy Period 46 demand while minimizing leftover inventory in Period 47. With 126 on-hand and 24 expected soon, we are covered for approximately 150 units over the next 1-2 periods. I will set mu_hat using the recent 3-period average (approx 60 units/week) to ensure the OR engine recognizes the current demand level without over-replenishing for the game's end.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Final Period). The 'In-transit' figure of 1014 is comprised almost entirely of phantom inventory (confirmed/likely lost shipments: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34, P38 totaling 990 units). Actual active pipeline is essentially zero. On-hand inventory is 95 units. Recent demand has stabilized after the autumn peak, with the last two periods (P45, P46) averaging 53 units/week. Since this is the final decision period of the simulation, the focus is on maximizing profit from current stock rather than replenishing for future periods that don't exist in the simulation. An order placed now (P47) would only arrive in P48 or P49 at the earliest, which is beyond the game horizon. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to 0 to prevent unnecessary final-period ordering, as any arrivals would only incur holding costs or contribute to ending inventory without the possibility of sale.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Final simulation period. Phantom in-transit inventory estimated at 990 units. Demand mean P45-P46 is 53 units/week.
