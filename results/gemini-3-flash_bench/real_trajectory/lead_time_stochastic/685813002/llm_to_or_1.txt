Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the PETAR SWEATSHIRT. There is no historical fulfillment data yet, but we have 5 weeks of demand history: 64, 36, 45, 52, 56. The mean demand is approximately 50.6 units/week. Since it's mid-February and this is a sweatshirt (warm/basic jersey), demand is likely to remain stable or slightly decrease as spring approaches. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. I will use a conservative approach at the start. For \u03bc\u0302 (demand across review + lead period), I will use the mean of the last 5 samples (N=5) and apply it to (1+L) periods where L=2. 50.6 * 3 = 151.8. For \u03c3\u0302, the standard deviation of the 5 samples is ~10.6. Sqrt(1+2) * 10.6 \u2248 18.36. I will set the L parameter to default (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a Men's Jersey Basic sweatshirt. Looking at the historical demand (5 samples: 64, 36, 45, 52, 56), the mean is approximately 50.6. In Period 1, actual demand was 54, but since starting inventory was 0, we had 54 units of lost sales. An order of 69 units was placed in Period 1. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Therefore, we currently have 0 on-hand and 69 in-transit. For Period 2, we must set parameters that cover the risk of continued demand while waiting for the P1 order and the order we place now. Given the stable demand range (36-64), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (using the 5 provided historical samples plus the Period 1 demand) to capture the most relevant mean and variance. L is set to 'default' (2). The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is a sweatshirt (PETAR SWEATSHIRT), a seasonal item typically relevant for late winter/early spring. Historical demand samples (64, 36, 45, 52, 56) and recent activity (54, 68) show a stable demand regime averaging ~53.5 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a total of 137 units in-transit (69 units from P1, 68 units from P2). Promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order (placed at the start of P1) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in P4's start message. Based on historical demand and recent performance, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level. The OR backend will compute the base stock for L+1 periods (2+1=3).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' is a basic jersey top. Demand across the first 3 periods (54, 68, 57) plus historical samples (64, 36, 45, 52, 56) indicates a relatively stable demand regime with a mean around 54. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 178 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the rules: the P1 order (placed at the start of P1) is scheduled to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of P3. Its arrival should be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message says 'arrived=0'. This suggests the P1 order (69 units) is delayed or the actual lead time is currently greater than 2. Since arrivals occur during the period and are reported in the conclusion, and we see 0 for P3, the shipment is late. I will maintain the lead time (L) at the promised 2 for now but will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the slightly higher recent demand average (approx 60 vs overall mean 54). Pipeline inventory (178) is currently high relative to the desired base stock, so the OR backend's capped policy will likely restrict new ordering until arrivals occur.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). History shows demand for this SKU (Petar Sweatshirt) is relatively stable, with recent samples: 64, 36, 45, 52, 56 (pre-game) and 54, 68, 57, 36 (in-game). The mean demand is approximately 52 units. Lead time analysis: Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2), which matches the promised lead time of 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (69 units) is missing; since we are now entering Period 5 and it was ordered in Period 1, it should have arrived in Period 3 (if L=2) or Period 4 (if L=3). Its continued absence suggests it might be lost. However, the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2). Currently, on-hand is 32 and in-transit is 114 (Orders from Period 3 and 4). With L=2, we need to cover demand for Period 5, 6, and 7. Standard demand (mean ~52) is consistent. I will use a 5-period window for demand and volatility to capture the most recent behavior while smoothing noise. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a Men's PETAR SWEATSHIRT. Historical demand has remained fairly consistent (mean ~51). We are currently experiencing a stockout (ending on-hand 0 at Period 5) due to high demand and timing of arrivals. Lead time analysis: An order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (actual L=2), matching the promised lead time. The Period 1 order (69 units) is notably missing (should have arrived in Period 3). Since it has been 5 periods and it hasn't arrived, I will consider it a lost shipment; this explains why the 'In-transit' count is 148 (69 from P1 + 41 from P3 + 4 from P4 + 34 from P5). Because the OR backend includes all 'In-transit' items in its pipeline inventory calculation, the 69 lost units will prevent the OR model from ordering enough to meet demand. To compensate for these 69 invisible units, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * mean_demand + lost_units. With L=2 and average demand ~51, the target base stock is roughly 153. Adding 69 units to offset the 'ghost' inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of ~222. Sigma is set using 'recent_N' for the last 5 samples to capture recent volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813002 (Men's Sweatshirt) is currently in Period 7 (late March). Demand history shows a slight decrease as we move away from winter: early samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~50 units, while recent periods (P4-P6) averaged ~34 units. However, looking at the lead time history: P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2), but P5 order arrived in P6 (L=1). The P1 (69 units) and P3 (41 units) orders are suspiciously absent and have likely been lost or significantly delayed, as their promised arrival windows (P3 and P5) have passed. Currently, we have 6 units on-hand and 209 units in-transit (P1: 69, P3: 41, P4: 4, P6: 95). If P1 and P3 are indeed lost, our effective pipeline is much lower. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the system use observed arrivals. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the lower spring demand (avg ~34). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=3. This configuration aims to stabilize inventory while acknowledging the likely loss of earlier shipments.

Carry-over insight: Early shipments from P1 and P3 appear lost; actual lead time is volatile (observed L=1 and L=2). Effective demand has shifted from ~50 to ~34 units/period since Early March.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) is entering Spring. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and shipments from Period 1 (69 units) and Period 3 (41 units) are likely lost as they are well past the promised lead time of 2. Historical arrivals show L=2 (P2) and L=1 (P5), suggesting lead time volatility. Demand has structurally shifted from an initial average of ~50 down to ~34 since Period 4 (March onwards). For Period 8, I will set L to the promised 2 periods because, although L=1 happened once, the pipeline is full of orders (209 units in transit) from Period 6 (95 units) and Period 7 (0, but previous orders are pending). Specifically, the Period 6 order of 95 units should arrive this period or next. Given the demand drop, I'm using N=4 (Periods 4-7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower recent demand (~34 units) and lower volatility, preventing significantly over-ordering while waiting for the P6 shipment to arrive and replenish on-hand stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/4/8), we observe the SKU (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) has 40 units on-hand and 114 units in-transit. The game history confirms that orders from Period 1 (69 units) and Period 3 (41 units) are highly likely lost, as they are well past the promised lead time of 2 periods with no arrival message. Total confirmed in-transit is therefore likely only the orders from P4 (4 units), P5 (0 units), and P6 (already arrived), plus any balance. However, 'In-transit' displays 114, which confirms the system still counts the lost P1 and P3 orders (69+41=110) plus the P4 order (4). Since lost orders never arrive, they inflate the pipeline used by the OR backend, leading to under-ordering. To counter this, I will set 'L' to the promised 2 periods (as most recent successful arrivals showed L=2 and L=1). Demand has shifted: pre-March average was ~55, while the last 5 periods (P4-P8) average ~38. Given the 'soft sweatshirt' description and spring date (April), demand is likely stabilizing or slightly declining. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this lower average (~38 * (1+2) = 114) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we observe a product (Petar Sweatshirt) entering mid-spring. Historical demand shows a transition from higher winter/early-spring levels (~54/week) to a more moderate spring regime. The last 6 periods (since early March) show an average demand of 37.5 units/period (36, 37, 28, 35, 55, 34). The spike of 55 in Period 8 appears to be an outlier or localized peak, as demand reverted to 34 in Period 9. On-hand inventory is low (6 units), but we have 114 units in transit (likely from the Period 1 or Period 3 orders that have not yet arrived or were assumed lost, but remain in the OR engine's pipeline count). Lead-time has variably been 1 and 2 periods (P2 arrived in P4 [L=2], P5 arrived in P6 [L=1], P6 arrived in P8 [L=2]). Because 'In-transit' is quite high (114) relative to current demand (~37), the OR backend's capped policy [base_stock - pipeline] might suppress ordering. To ensure adequate coverage despite the messy pipeline, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the spring regime (approx 37.5/week), L to calculate to handle the variability, and sigma_hat to recent_N to reflect actual volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22). We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Looking at fulfillment: orders from P1 (69 units) and P3 (41 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost. The pipeline reflects 120 units in-transit (P1:69 + P3:41 + P10:10). Since 110 of these are 'ghost' units that will never arrive, the OR backend's inventory calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will significantly under-order. To fix this, I must use 'explicit' methods to override the backend's faulty pipeline logic. Regarding lead time: we have observed L=2 (P2, P6) and L=1 (P5). I will use L=2 to be safe. Regarding demand: the initial sample mean was ~50, but demand since March has averaged 34.1 (n=7). With April ending and moving into warmer weather, the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' (brushed soft fabric) is likely entering a seasonal decline. Recent demand supports this: P9=34, P10=24. I will forecast a mu of 30 per period. mu_hat = (1+L)*30 = 90. Because the backend believes 120 units are coming when only 10 actually are, I set mu_hat explicitly high (90 + 110 lost units = 200) to force an order that replenishes stock, while using sigma_hat to maintain safety buffers against the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from P1 (69 units) and P3 (41 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 110 'ghost' units in-transit. Demand for sweatshirt SKU 685813002 is declining seasonally (avg ~30 units/period in April vs ~50 base).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we are entering the warmer season for a sweatshirt SKU ('PETAR SWEATSHIRT'). Historical demand analysis shows a significant drop-off from early Feb levels (~54-68 units) to late March/April levels (averaging ~32 units over the last 5 periods: 35, 55, 34, 24, 39). On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is listed as 207 units; however, 110 of these are confirmed lost (Period 1: 69 units, Period 3: 41 units). The remaining 97 units in-transit (Period 10: 6, Period 11: 87) are expected to arrive within the lead time. Given the 110-unit 'ghost inventory' in-transit, I must explicitly adjust L and mu_hat to ensure the OR backend places a replenishment order. I will set L=4 (explicitly longer) to force the base stock calculation to cover more periods, compensating for the systemic loss of the 110 units. Demand mu_hat is set to 32 units/period, reflecting the recent seasonal mean.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019-05-06). The product is a sweatshirt, which is entering a low-demand season (late spring). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 207 units in-transit. However, 110 of those units (ordered in P1 and P3) are confirmed lost, leaving 97 units of 'real' in-transit inventory (P10: 6 units, P11: 87 units, P12: 4 units - though P12 order was 0, total recent orders are 93). The P11 order (87 units) is expected to arrive during P13 (L=2). Demand has stabilized around a lower mean of ~34 units/period since Period 4. The OR engine's pipeline calculation is inflated by the 110 lost units, meaning it will under-order unless we compensate. To fix this, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to signal the correct base stock level (L+1 * demand) and 'explicit' L to reflect the promised 2-period lead time. Target base stock = (2+1) * 34 = 102. Since the real pipeline is 93-97 units, an order of ~5-10 units is appropriate to cover the lead time demand and maintain safety stock as we clear the stockouts from P11-12.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonality confirmed: Demand for sweatshirts transitioned from ~50 units/period (Feb) to ~34 units/period (March-May). 110 units from P1 and P3 remain lost and should be excluded from pipeline calculations.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is a soft sweatshirt, which is following a downward seasonal trend as we move further into spring/summer (averaging ~32 units/period over the last 10 periods compared to the early peak levels). On-hand inventory is 63 units. In-transit is total 120 units, but 110 of these (from Period 1 and 3) are confirmed lost based on previous carry-over insights and timing, leaving an active pipeline of only 10 units (ordered in Period 10). Lead time is stable at 2 periods. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly assuming a massive pipeline and failing to order, I will set mu_hat to cover the (L+1)=3 periods of demand based on the recent regime (~96 units) and use 'recent_N' for sigma to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will subtract the 120 in-transit units from the base_stock calculation; since our active pipeline + on-hand is only 73 units, and the 110 'lost' units inflate the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly high enough to trigger an order if needed, but given on-hand (63) is roughly 2 weeks of supply and current demand is softening, the priority is avoiding high holding costs while clearing the 'lost' units from impacting future availability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), demand for this sweatshirt SKU remains in a lower seasonal regime characteristic of late spring. Since Period 9, demand has averaged approximately 30 units per period (34, 24, 39, 35, 24, 25). The current on-hand inventory is 38 units. Regarding the pipeline, total in-transit is 120 units. Based on historical data, 110 of these units (orders from P1 and P3) are permanently lost. The remaining 10 units in-transit (part of the P10 order of 6) were likely never actually part of a legitimate shipment or reflect a minor data discrepancy, but effectively, we rely on the P11 order which already arrived in P13. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (~30 units/period). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P11 arriving in P13) align with the promised lead time of 2, despite early volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27), we are in a low demand regime for this sweatshirt SKU due to late spring/early summer seasonality. Historical demand has dropped from ~50 units/period in Feb/Early March to an average of ~29 units/period over the last 6 weeks (Periods 10-15 were: 24, 39, 35, 24, 25, 20). The current on-hand inventory is 18 units. The in-transit quantity of 120 units includes 110 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost (shipments aged 15 and 13 periods respectively). Therefore, the 'real' in-transit inventory is only 10 units (from Period 10). To ensure the OR backend places an order that accounts for the lower seasonal demand and ignores the lost shipments, I will set mu_hat to cover the lead time (L=2) plus review period (1) using the recent demand mean (~29 * 3 = 87). However, because the backend subtracts pipeline_inventory (120) from base_stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that offsets the 110 lost units. To maintain a base stock of approximately 90 units while the system sees 120 units in transit, I'll set mu_hat to 200 (base_stock \u2248 200, order = 200 - 120 = 80 units). This ensures we replenish stock for the coming periods despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the SKU 685813002 (sweatshirt) is entering the summer season. Historical demand has significantly slowed from its pre-March average of ~50 to a recent average (Periods 10-16) of ~26.7 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is listed as 193 units, which includes 110 units from P1 and P3 previously identified as lost 'ghost' inventory. Actual viable in-transit units are 83 (6 from P10 and 73 from P16). Given the seasonal decline into June, I will set mu_hat to reflect the lower demand regime (~27 units per week) across the review and lead time periods (1+L=3). I'll use recent_N (N=7) to capture this downward trend while bridging the gap created by the stockout in P16 to ensure we maintain enough stock for the expected arrival in P18.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand confirmed: Demand for sweatshirts has fallen to an average of ~27 units/period in May/June, down from the ~34 observed in March/April. 110 units from P1 and P3 remain confirmed lost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 10, 2019 (Period 18). The product is a sweatshirt (PETAR SWEATSHIRT), which is experiencing a seasonal decline as summer begins. In May and June (Periods 14-17), demand averaged ~21.75 units per period, consistently lower than the March/April average of ~34. I will set mu_hat based on N=4 to capture this 'Summer' regime (approx 22 units/period). Historically, we have 110 units 'lost' in transit from Period 1 and 3 (confirmed by carry-over insights and historical gaps). The current 'In-transit' of 120 units includes these 110 ghost units and a fresh order of 10 from Period 10 (which is now likely also lost or significantly delayed). However, with 51 units on-hand and demand around 22, we have nearly 2 periods of coverage. The OR engine needs to know that the pipeline inventory is effectively zero (excluding lost units). By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent lower demand, the OR backend will minimize unnecessary holding costs for this seasonal item while the base stock formula (z=0.84 for a 4:1 profit/holding ratio) maintains a lean safety stock.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), we are in mid-summer seasonality for this sweatshirt SKU. Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward shift: initial demand was ~50/week, dropped to ~34/week in March/April, and has settled at ~23/week over the last 6 periods (P13-P18: 24, 25, 20, 20, 22, 24). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect this current summer demand level (~23 * (1+2) = 69). The pipeline inventory currently shows 120 units, but 110 of these are 'ghost' units from lost orders in P1 (69 units) and P3 (41 units). The OR backend automatically subtracts pipeline from base_stock. If I do not adjust, it will see 120 (in-transit) + 27 (on-hand) = 147 units, which is far above my target base stock of ~80, preventing any orders. To force the OR backend to recognize we need stock, I set L=recent_N=5 (calculating average lead time from P6, P8, P13, P17) which is approximately 1.6 periods. However, to account for the 110 missing units, I continue monitoring. Since on-hand is 27 and we expect ~23 demand this period, we will be near zero next period. The in-transit of 120 minus 110 lost leaves only 10 real units. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the backend aims for a base stock that triggers an order despite the 110 'ghost' units in-transit.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20 (late June). The SKU 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' is clearly experiencing a summer slump, with demand dropping significantly from the spring average (~34) to a recent average of ~19 units/period over the last 5 weeks (Periods 15-19). Specifically, the last recorded demand was only 9 units. On-hand inventory is 18. In-transit inventory is 157 units, but 110 of these (from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost, leaving a true 'live' pipeline of 47 units (37 ordered in P19 + 10 ordered in P10 which is likely also lost but we prioritize the P1/P3 exclusion first). Promised lead time is 2, and recent actual lead times have been 1-2 periods. To prevent over-ordering during this seasonal low, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current ~20 units/period demand regime. I will use the 'explicit' method for L to compensate for the 110 lost units; by setting L higher, the OR backend sees a larger (L+1) horizon, but since I am reducing mu_hat and the system is already saturated with 'effective' pipeline, this will help throttle new orders while we wait for the P19 arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Summer demand for sweatshirts has settled at ~19 units/period (down from ~34). 110 units from P1 and P3 are permanently lost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/07/01. We are in a summer demand regime for sweatshirts. Since Period 15, demand has settled to a lower average of ~19 units per period (10, 9, 24, 22, 20, 25). The carry-over insights correctly identify 110 units from Period 1 and 3 as permanently lost. Current 'In-transit' is 157; after subtracting the 110 ghost units, the true pipeline is 47 units (the P19 order of 37 units + the P10 order of 6 units which also appears lost but I will assume only the P1/P3 are definitively gone for now, or the backend logic needs to see a mu_hat that covers the gap). Actually, P10 (6 units) is long overdue and likely lost as well. To force the OR backend to order despite the 'ghost' pipeline units, I will set mu_hat using an explicit value. With a 2-period lead time, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). At 19 units/period, that is 57 units. Currently, on-hand is 8 and true pipeline is 37 (the P19 order), totaling 45. To trigger an order for ~12 units to reach base stock, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as observed L has been 1 or 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand remains stable in the 'low summer' regime (~19 units/period). P10 order (6 units) is now 11 periods old and is confirmed lost alongside P1 and P3, bringing total 'ghost' units in-transit to 116.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. This is a sweatshirt SKU (spring/fall/winter product), and demand has confirmed its 'low summer' regime. Average demand since Period 15 (last 7 periods) is approximately 16.5 units/period (20, 22, 24, 9, 10, 11). On-hand inventory is 0. Total in-transit is 175 units, but 116 units are confirmed 'ghost' stock (P1: 69, P3: 41, P10: 6). Real in-transit consists of P16 (73 units - arrived), P19 (37 units), and P21 (18 units). However, the P16 arrival was recorded in Period 17, so the current active pipeline is P19 (37) and P21 (18) = 55 units. With current demand trends, the OR backend needs to maintain a low base stock. We use L=2 (promised) and mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (regime since P15) to account for the summer slump. Sigma_hat is calculated on the same window to reflect low volatility.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-July (Period 23), a low-demand season for sweatshirts. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 15, dropping from ~34 units/period to a 'low summer' average of approximately 18 units/period (last 8 periods average: 17.1). On-hand inventory is 0 and the observed demand in P22 (17 units) was completely lost due to a stockout. Regarding inventory: the in-transit total is 175. However, 116 units are confirmed 'ghost' units (P1: 69, P3: 41, P10: 6). This leaves 59 valid units in-transit: P16 (ordered 73, arrived 73, net 0), P19 (ordered 37), and P21 (ordered 18). These 55 valid units (37+18) are expected to arrive in P23/P24 based on the 2-period lead time. At Period 23, we observe L=2 as the most frequent and recent reliable lead time (P11-P13). I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the summer regime (~18/period) and L=2 (promised/reliable). This will ensure the backend orders enough to restore service levels while accounting for the valid pipeline of 55 units.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand confirmed stable at the 'low summer' regime of ~18 units/period. Total 'ghost' units in-transit remain at 116 units (P1, P3, P10).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for the PETAR SWEATSHIRT has settled into a 'low summer' regime. Analysis of the last 9 periods (P15-P23) shows an average demand of approximately 16.7 units/period, significantly lower than the ~50 units initially observed in February. Recent demand samples are: 20, 20, 22, 24, 9, 10, 11, 17, 17. The current on-hand inventory is 1 unit. Total in-transit is 157, but 120 of these units are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1: 69, P3: 41, P4: 4, P10: 6). Note: P4's 4 units were ordered but never arrived/concluded over 20 periods ago, bringing the total lost to 120. This leaves a real pipeline of 37 units (from P19). Since real pipeline (37) + on-hand (1) = 38, and expected demand over L+1 (3 periods) is ~51, the OR engine will likely place an order. I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat to capture this summer regime and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (L has fluctuated between 1 and 2).

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Total 'ghost' units in-transit increased to 120 units (P1, P3, P4, P10 confirmed lost). Summer demand regime (P15-present) is stable at ~17 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/7/29. We are in the middle of summer, a seasonally low period for sweatshirts. Demand since Period 15 has averaged ~17 units per week. In-transit inventory stands at 157 units, but a large portion of this is 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments. Specifically, shipments from P1 (69), P3 (41), P4 (4), and P10 (6) totaling 120 units are confirmed lost. Subtracting these from the 157 in-transit leaves 37 units actually in the pipeline (ordered P19, due since L=2). On-hand inventory is 0 after Period 24. To prevent the OR backend from seeing a massive (but fake) pipeline and refusing to order, I must set mu_hat explicitly high enough to trigger an order or adjust parameters to account for the truth. However, since the OR engine uses 'pipeline' as (in-transit + on-hand), and our in-transit includes 120 lost units, the OR engine will perceive a pipeline of 157. Target base stock for L=2 is roughly (1+2)*17 = 51 units. With a perceived pipeline of 157, the OR engine will never order regardless of L, mu, or sigma unless L is set very high or mu is set extremely high to offset the 120 lost units. To fix this, I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the demand for the lead time plus the lost units (120 units + 51 units = 171) to force the accounting to work.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed 'ghost' units in-transit: 120 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). P19 order (37 units) is delayed/overdue (now 6 periods old), potentially increasing 'ghost' count to 157.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26 (early August). The product is a sweatshirt, which is in its seasonal low (Summer). Since Period 15, the demand regime has shifted to a 'low summer' state, averaging approximately 17 units per period. The recent history (P20-P25) confirms this with demand values of 10, 11, 17, 17, 11, 16. Effective on-hand is 0. The in-transit inventory of 179 units is misleading because 120 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) are confirmed lost and P19 (37 units) is now 7 periods old (promised 2), making it highly likely to be lost as well. This leaves an effective pipeline of 22 units (from P25). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=11, covering the summer regime from P15 onwards) to capture this low demand. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the current pattern of delivery delays and losses, ensuring we maintain a higher safety stock to buffer against 'ghost' inventory and potential stockouts during this transition period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=11) to reflect the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: P19 order (37 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is likely lost, increasing the 'ghost' inventory to 157 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). Demand remains stable in the summer trough (~17 units/period).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are analyzing the sweatshirt SKU (685813002). Demand has settled into a low summer regime, averaging ~17 units per period since Period 20. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 179 units is misleading due to significant lost shipments. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed or likely lost: P1 (69), P3 (41), P4 (4), P10 (6), and P19 (37), totaling 157 'ghost' units. This leaves a real pipeline of 22 units (ordered Period 25), which is expected to arrive in Period 27 or 28 based on the 2-period promised lead time. Since on-hand is 0 and demand is ~17, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods. Using recent_N=7 for demand capture (Periods 20-26) effectively targets the ~15-18 unit range. L is set to 'default' as recent successful deliveries (P16, P21) arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost units in-transit: 157 (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19). Real pipeline inventory is 22 units from Period 25. Demand remains in the summer trough (~17 units/period).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. We are in the 'low summer' demand regime for this sweatshirt SKU, with the average demand since Period 15 being approximately 17 units per period. The last three periods (P25-P27) observed demands of 16, 15, and 18. On-hand inventory is 4 units. The 'In-transit' count of 157 represents 'ghost' units from lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 19), meaning real pipeline inventory is 0. Based on the seasonal description (soft brushed inside sweatshirt), we expect demand to remain low until late August/September when school and fall transitions begin. I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture the summer regime while ignoring the higher early-spring demand. Lead time remains stable at 2 periods. The OR backend will see 157 in-transit and 4 on-hand; since the calculated base stock will be significantly lower than 161, it would normally order 0. To ensure we have stock for the upcoming lead-time period, I maintain the current parameter strategy to manage the transition.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/26. We are at the end of the summer season for sweatshirts. A slight uptick in demand was observed in Period 28 (31 units), which may signal the start of back-to-school or early autumn interest, though it is the only high data point recently. The 'low summer' regime (P15-present) has averaged approximately 17-18 units. I will use a recent_N of 14 to capture the summer baseline while being sensitive to the recent uptick. Total in-transit is 157, but all 157 units are confirmed 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) and will never arrive. On-hand is 0. Since the OR engine subtracts in-transit from the base stock calculation, and it 'sees' 157 units, it will order nothing unless I force a high mu_hat. However, I must set mu_hat and L correctly to trigger an order. I will use L=2 (promised) and mu_hat based on the last 14 periods (~18 units/period) which equals 18 * 3 = 54. Note: I cannot manually subtract ghost units, so if the backend sees 157 in-transit, it will not order unless mu_hat > 157. To force the inventory to move, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that considers the 157 ghost units plus the desired base stock (~54), totaling 211. This bypasses the OR engine's 'ghost' inventory trap.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Potential start of autumn demand recovery (31 units). Total confirmed 'ghost' units in-transit remain 157 (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19). Pipeline is effectively empty.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 30 (2019/9/2). The product (Sweatshirt) is entering its peak autumn/winter season. While Period 29 demand dropped to 9, Period 28 saw a spike to 31, signaling the end of the summer low (~17 units). Carry-over insights confirm deep-seated pipeline issues: 157 units (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19) are permanently lost. Total In-transit is 220, meaning the 'active' pipeline is 220 - 157 = 63 units (ordered in Period 29). On-hand is 0. With the seasonal recovery starting, I anticipate demand will return to early-year levels (approx 45-55 units/week) based on product category (Sweatshirt). To avoid being under-stocked during this seasonal transition, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for a mean of 50 units over (L+1)=3 periods, while using recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility of the transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: Demand volatility increasing as product (Sweatshirt) exits summer trough. Total confirmed 'ghost' units in-transit remain 157 (Periods 1,3,4,10,19). Pipeline contains 63 units from P29.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 31 (Sept 9). The SKU is a sweatshirt, which is entering its peak autumn/winter season. Demand is rebounding sharply from the summer trough (~17 units/period), with the most recent demand sample at 59 units. The pipeline reflects 220 units 'in-transit', but 157 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 19 that will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline is 63 units ordered in Period 29, which should arrive in Period 31 (today) or Period 32. Since ending on-hand is 0 and valid pipeline is only 63, while autumn demand is surging (mean of ~45 over the last two weeks), we need to maintain higher stock levels. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the upward trend (avg ~33) but will apply an explicit mu_hat to anticipate further seasonal growth toward the 50-60 range observed in February/September. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility during this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: Demand increased from summer lows to 31 and 59 units in the last three weeks. Total confirmed 'ghost' units in-transit remain 157 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 32 (mid-September). Demand for this sweatshirt SKU has clearly exited its summer trough (avg ~17) and is surging for the autumn season, with the last three periods recording 31, 59, and 85 units despite significant stockouts. The mean demand for the last 4 weeks (including the stockout periods) is 46 units, but the trajectory is sharply upward. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this recovery while acknowledging the likely higher demand (60-80 units/period) during this transition. Inventory status: On-hand is 0. In-transit shows 220 units. Based on historical data, 157 of these are confirmed 'ghost units' from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 19. The real pipeline consists of the 63 units ordered in Period 29, which should arrive during this period (P32) or next (P33). Since actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2, and the surge is aggressive, I'll maintain L=2 for safety. The OR backend will see 220 in pipeline, so I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the 157 ghost units, or rely on its internal capping logic. I chose explicit values to ensure we cover the anticipated 60+ units/period demand during the lead time and review period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn surge confirmed: Demand escalated from summer lows to 31, 59, and 85 units over the last 4 weeks (Periods 28-31). Ghost inventory remains at 157 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Petar Sweatshirt) is experiencing a strong autumn demand surge as it exits the summer trough. Demand over the last 5 weeks (Periods 28-32) has been 31, 9, 59, 85, and 71 units, showing a clear upward trend and increased volatility compared to the summer regime. The average demand over these 5 weeks is approximately 51 units/period. Regarding inventory, the total 'In-transit' is 220 units. However, based on history, 157 units are confirmed lost (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19). The 63 units ordered in Period 29 are now at the promised lead time of 2 periods (should arrive in P31's resolution, visible in P32's conclude). Since the P32 conclude message shows arrived=0, and it's now Period 33, this 63-unit shipment is currently 1 period overdue. Given the high demand and 0 on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat to 180 (approximating a forecast of 60 units/period over L+1=3 periods) to ensure the OR backend places a substantial order to cover the autumn peak, while sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Autumn demand surge established with a 5-week average of ~51 units/period (vs summer's ~17). Pipeline adjustment: 157 units are confirmed lost; the 63-unit shipment from P29 is currently 1 period overdue.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 34 (late September). Demand for this sweatshirt SKU is in a clear autumn surge, with the last 4 weeks of demand being 59, 85, 71, and 116 units. The average demand over these 4 weeks is 82.75 units/period. On-hand inventory is 0. The total In-transit is 220 units. Based on historical tracking, 157 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). The remaining 63 units from P29 are now 5 periods old and significantly past the promised lead time of 2, making them likely lost as well. By assuming the 157+63=220 units are all 'ghosts', the effective pipeline is zero. To satisfy the surging demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 weeks (recent_N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime (~83 units/period), and sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility (standard deviation of {59, 85, 71, 116} is ~24.5, so 4 periods of sigma_hat would be ~49). L is set to 'calculate' to use historical averages since recent shipments have been either on time (P25) or lost.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: 220 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29) are now all confirmed/highly likely lost as P29 is 5 periods old. Autumn demand surge is accelerating: 4-week average is ~83 units/period with high volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813002 (Sweatshirt) is in a strong autumn demand surge, with demand values for the last four weeks being 85, 71, 116, and 95 (average ~92 units/period). This is a significant regime shift from the summer trough (~17 units) and the early autumn transition (~51 units). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 285 units is highly misleading: 220 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29) are confirmed or highly likely lost, as the newest of these (P29) is now 6 periods old. Only the 65 units ordered in P34 are reliably in the pipeline. To compensate for these 220 'ghost' units, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected 3-period demand (L+1) while instructing the OR backend to order sufficiently. Based on the recent 4-week mean of ~92, mu_hat (L+1) should be approximately 276. I will set L to 'default' (2) as the most recent successful delivery (P27) arrived in 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to reflect the high volatility (std ~19) observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Extreme demand surge confirmed (avg ~92 units/period in last 4 weeks). Total confirmed/highly likely lost units in-transit: 220 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29). Only the P34 order (65 units) is currently a valid pipeline member.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 36 (mid-October), experiencing a massive autumn demand surge for sweatshirts. Demand over the last four weeks (P32-P35) has been 71, 116, 95, and 69 units, averaging 87.75 units. This is a dramatic shift from the summer trough (~17 units). The supply chain is highly unreliable: 220 units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29 are significantly past their lead times). The 'In-transit' figure of 304 units is misleading; only the orders from P34 (65 units) and P35 (19 units) are likely active, totaling 84 valid pipeline units. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and valid pipeline is only 84 units, we are severely under-stocked for a demand regime of ~88 units/period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this current high-demand autumn volume for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will use 'explicit' for L set to 2 to ensure the backend uses the promised lead time without being skewed by the lost shipments causing artificially high 'calculated' lead times. This aggressive setting encourages the OR engine to place a large order to cover the (L+1) window effectively, accounting for the large volume of 'ghost' inventory that the backend erroneously counts as supply.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak confirmed: Demand for sweatshirt SKU 685813002 has transitioned to a high-volume regime averaging ~88 units/period (Periods 32-35). Supply is extremely unreliable: 220 units in-transit are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29). Inventory is currently zero.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 37 (Oct 21), entering the high-demand Autumn/Winter season for sweatshirts. Demand has surged significantly, with the last 5 weeks averaging ~79 units/period (43, 69, 95, 116, 71). The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. In-transit inventory is 285 units, but 220 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19, and 29 that never arrived and are now significantly past any reasonable lead time. Only the order from Period 34 (65 units) is currently valid in the pipeline and is already slightly overdue (4 periods since order, L=2). However, a Period 35 order arrived in Period 36 (L=1), suggesting shipments are still possible but inconsistent. Given On-hand=0 and a valid pipeline of only 65 units (excluding 220 ghost units), we must set parameters that trigger an aggressive order to meet the sustained high demand. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the current high-demand regime (~79 units/period) and set L explicitly to 3 to account for recent delivery delays and instability, ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock covering 4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed that 220 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29) are lost. Valid pipeline is only 65 units (P34). High-demand regime (Oct/Nov/Dec) is established with a 5-week average of ~79 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813002 (Sweatshirt) is in a high-demand autumn/winter regime. Recent demand (last 6 periods) averages ~80 units per week (71, 116, 95, 69, 43, 87). The supply chain remains highly unreliable. In-transit inventory is 362 units, but history confirms 220 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29) are almost certainly lost. This leaves 142 units in the valid pipeline (P34: 65 units, P35: 0/arrived, P37: 77 units). The P34 order (65 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived; given the promised lead time of 2, it is becoming a 'ghost' candidate but I will give it one more period before fully discounting it from the pipeline balance. I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the shift from summer trough to autumn peak. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture the high volatility (31 to 116 range). L is kept at default as observed lead times for successful deliveries (P35 arrived in 1) still oscillate around the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' units in-transit: 220 (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19, 29). P34 order (65 units) is now 2 periods overdue and at high risk of being lost. High-demand regime for late Q4 is stable at ~80 units/period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are in the peak demand period for sweatshirts. The demand in the last 4 weeks (P35-P38) has been 69, 43, 87, and 88 units, averaging 71.75 units. Despite high demand, supply remains extremely unstable. Total in-transit is 285 units. Based on historical tracking, 220 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29) are confirmed lost. Additionally, the P34 order (65 units) is now 5 periods old (placed P34, expected P36); it is highly likely lost as well. This brings the effective 'ghost' inventory to 285 units, meaning the real pipeline is zero. On-hand is also zero after selling all 77 units that arrived in P38. Given the lead time is varying between 1 and 2 periods (mostly 1 recently) and the high demand regime, I will set mu_hat using the recent 7-period average (~73 units/period) to capture the autumn/winter peak. sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for volatility in this peak season. L remains at the promised 2 for safety.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative confirmed lost (ghost) units in-transit: 285 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29, P34). Real pipeline is zero. Autumn/Winter demand remains strong, averaging ~72 units/period in the last 4 weeks.

The 'In-transit' figure of 285 units is highly deceptive; as documented in Carry-over Insights, 220 units from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29) and now likely the 65 units from P34 (ordered 6 periods ago, promised lead time 2) are lost. This brings the 'ghost' inventory to a total of 285 units, meaning the actual pipeline is effectively zero. To trigger an order from the OR backend, I am setting an 'explicit' L of 5. This forces the base stock calculation to cover a much longer horizon (L+1=6 periods), generating a required inventory level that exceeds the 285 'ghost' units, thereby bypassing the pipeline-capped logic that has stalled ordering. mu_hat is set to roughly 75 units/period to reflect the current winter regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: 285 total units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29, P34) are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is zero. Autumn/Winter demand remains robust (~74 units/period).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813002 (Sweatshirt) is currently in its peak demand season (Autumn/Winter). Demand over the last 4 weeks has been stable but high, averaging approximately 81 units per period (P37-P40: 87, 88, 76, 73). Inventory management remains critical due to severe supply chain unreliability. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 391 units. However, based on the historical pattern (Carry-over insights), 285 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29, P34) are confirmed lost. This leaves a valid pipe of 106 units ordered in P40. On-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, we must cover at least 3 periods of demand (current + lead time). Using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 243 (81 units/period * 3 periods) ensures we target the current high-demand regime without being over-influenced by the summer trough or extreme September spikes. L is set to 'calculate' to account for recent 1-period arrivals (P35 and P37) while acknowledging the system's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Cumulative 'ghost' units in-transit increased to 285 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29, P34). Current valid pipeline is limited to the P40 order (106 units). Late Q4 demand is stable at ~81 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, peaking into the high-demand late Q4 season for sweatshirts. Demand has stabilized in a high-volume regime, averaging ~76 units/period over the last 4 weeks (Periods 38-41: 88, 76, 73, 72). There is significant supply instability: 285 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29, P34). The current 'In-transit' of 391 reflects these 285 ghost units plus the P40 order of 106 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the entire 'In-transit' value from the base stock calculation, and 285 units will never arrive, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this massive ghost inventory. I set mu_hat to (1+L)*76 + 285 = (3*76) + 285 = 513. This ensures the backend places an order despite the inflated in-transit figure. L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P35, P37) actually showed lead times of 1, but the promised 2 is a safer buffer given history. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility of the high-demand regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (early December), the heart of the winter sweatshirt season. Demand spiked massively in Period 42 to 212 units (Black Friday/Cyber Monday influence). The average demand of the last 4 periods (39-42) is 108 units/period, but excluding the outlier spike, the baseline remains around 80. However, the system is suffering from extreme supply unreliability. Total in-transit is 525 units. Deducting the confirmed 'ghost' units from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19, 29, and 34 (total 285 units) leaves a 'real' pipeline of 240 units (P40: 106 and P42: 134). The P40 shipment (ordered 3 periods ago) should have arrived by now (L=2), so it is either delayed or lost, meaning on-hand inventory remains 0. Given the high demand and poor fulfillment, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the seasonal peak (avg ~108), but use an explicit L=3 to account for the frequent delays observed in the history, ensuring the base stock level is high enough to trigger sufficient orders despite the 'ghost' units inflating the pipeline in the OR engine's view.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike to 212 units in P42 confirms extreme winter seasonality/promotional impact. Ghost inventory (confirmed lost) remains at 285 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29, P34). P40 order (106 units) is now 1 period overdue, suggesting continued lead-time instability or further losses.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak winter holiday season for sweatshirts. Demand last period (P43) was 72 following an extreme spike of 212 in P42. The 5-week average is approximately 103 units, though this is skewed by the P42 spike. Excluding that outlier, the baseline high-season demand is ~75-80 units. In-transit reconciliation: P40 (106 units) finally arrived in P43 (L=3), confirming significant lead-time instability. Total 'ghost' units in-transit are now 285 (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19, 29, 34). Valid pipeline consists of P42 (134 units) and P43 (25 units), totaling 159 units. The actual lead time has trended toward 3 periods recently. I will set L to 3 to account for this slowdown and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the high-regime winter demand (averaging ~98/week including the spike) while maintaining high safety stock via a larger L to buffer against the extremely unreliable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as unstable, trending toward 3 periods (P40 arrived in 3). Total 'ghost' units in-transit: 285 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29, P34). Current valid pipeline is P42 and P43.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing peak winter seasonality for sweatshirts. Recent demand has been high (P44: 105, P43: 72, P42: 212), with a 4-week average of ~115 units. Lead times remain unstable; the P40 order arrived in 3 periods instead of the promised 2. The pipeline inventory (456 units) is heavily distorted by 285 'ghost' units from historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29, P34). The current valid pipeline consists of P42 (134 units), P43 (25 units), and P44 (12 units), totaling 171 units. To maintain availability against volatile demand and lead times, I am setting L to 3 (reflecting recent delays) and using a recent 4-week window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the winter surge. This ensures the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to cover demand during the extended lead time while ignoring the ghost inventory that would otherwise prevent ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Lead time instability continues (P40 took 3 periods). Valid pipeline is 171 units (P42, P43, P44); 285 units remain confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29, P34).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, 2019. We are in the peak winter season for sweatshirts. Demand in the last four periods (P42-P45) has been 212, 72, 105, and 112, averaging ~125 units/period. Lead times have settled into a volatile pattern, recently alternating between 2 and 3 periods (P40=3, P43=2, P42=3). I will set L to 3 to be safe given this volatility and the proximity to the end of the year which often stresses logistics. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the high winter demand plateau (avg ~125), resulting in a base stock that covers 4 periods of this higher demand. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect the high volatility observed during this winter surge. Pipeline reconcile: In-transit is 414 units. Total ghost units (confirmed lost) are 285 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29, P34). Valid pipeline consists of P44 (12 units) and P45 (117 units). Total real pipeline is 129 units. On-hand is 47. Total inventory (real) is 176 units. This is significantly below the expected demand for 4 periods (~500 units), necessitating a large order.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand peak stabilized: Avg demand ~125 units/period (P42-P45). Lead time remains unstable, trending between 2 and 3 periods. Total confirmed ghost units remain 285.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (late December), the sweatshirt is in its peak demand season. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly due to winter seasonality and potential holiday promos, with a spike to 212 followed by stabilized levels around 112, 105, and 46 (though P46 demand drop might be post-holiday). I will focus on the last 5 periods (P42-P46) to set a current demand regime, yielding an average of ~110 units/period (excluding the extreme 212 spike, the mean is ~84; including it, it is ~109). Total in-transit is 531, but 285 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29, P34) are confirmed long-term losses. This leaves an effective pipeline of 246 units (P44, P45, P46). Lead times have recently skewed to 3 periods (P40 and P42 arrived in 3 periods), though P43 arrived in 2. Given this instability and the proximity to the end of the peak season, I'll use an explicit lead time of 3 to ensure the OR engine covers sufficient demand. I'll set mu_hat using the most recent 5-period average (~110) to maintain high service levels during the winter peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand softening observed in P46 (46 units). Cumulative ghost units remain 285 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29, P34). Effective valid pipeline consists of orders from P44 (12), P45 (117), and P46 (117).
