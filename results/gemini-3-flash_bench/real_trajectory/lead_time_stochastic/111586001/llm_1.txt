The product is 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights', a basic women's hosiery item. Based on the historical demand provided (Jan 7 to Feb 4), demand grew from 68 to a stable range of 109\u2013126, averaging approximately 114 units over the last four weeks. February 11th is the start of the current period. In many regions, mid-February demand for tights remains steady due to winter weather and the Valentine's Day period. Given a promised lead time (L) of 2, I must cover demand for the current period plus the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Total target inventory = 114 * 3 = 342 units. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order the full 342 units to establish a baseline stock level.

Demand for the coverage window (current period + 2 lead time periods = 3 periods) is estimated at ~155 * 3 = 465 units. Since 592 units are already in the pipeline and on-hand is 0 due to stockouts, I need to ensure arrivals start hitting to satisfy backlogged demand.

To cover demand for the next 3 periods (L+1, where L=2 promised) at ~320 units/period, I need ~960 units.

Total in-transit is 1692, but based on carry-over insights and historical gaps, most of this (historically 1692 units) is categorized as lost or indefinitely delayed. Specifically, the 'real' pipeline (P42, P43) arrived in P45. No orders were placed in P44 or P45. Demand in P45 was very high (475). With On-hand = 559, and one period of demand remaining after this one, we must assess if we need more. Period 46 demand is likely to be high (Christmas week), and Period 47 (last period) will follow. However, any order placed in P46 would arrive, at the earliest, in P47 (if lead time is 1) or P48 (if lead time is 2). Since P48 does not exist in the game timeline, an order placed now only has value if it arrives in P47. Given the supplier's inconsistency and the current on-hand stock of 559 (which covers ~1.5 to 2.5 periods of recent demand), the risk of holding costs on 559 units plus new arrivals outweighs the benefit of ordering for the very last period.
