Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). Historical demand samples show: 15, 50, 198, 60, 68 units. There's a significant spike of 198 on 2019-01-21, possibly related to a specific promotion or post-holiday clearance. Excluding that spike, the demand averages around 48 units. The Mean of all samples is 78.2. However, the most recent values (60, 68) suggest a stabilized regime higher than the initial weeks. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent trend (198, 60, 68) which averages 108.6. This provides a buffer against the high volatility observed. Promised lead time is 2, so L+1=3 periods of demand need to be covered. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using these parameters.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a Rachel LS TVP (fitted top in fine rib knit), which fits the late winter/early spring transition. Historical demand peaked at 198 on 2019-01-21 but has stabilized around 50-70 in recent weeks (2019-01-28: 60, 2019-02-04: 68, Period 1: 53). Promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 237 in-transit (ordered in Period 1). Since lead time is 2, this arrival is expected during Period 3 resolution and visible in Period 4. In Period 1, 53 units of demand were lost because on-hand was 0. Given the recent demand stability (avg ~60), I suspect the 198 spike might have been a clearance or specific event. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the stable post-spike regime (60, 68, 53, and the earlier 50) for demand estimation. Setting L to default (2) as no arrivals have occurred yet to suggest a lead time shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a 'Knitwear/Sweater' item. Demand history shows a steady upward trend through January and February (15, 50, 198, 60, 68). The latest observed demands (Periods 1 and 2) are 53 and 80. The product is out of stock (on-hand: 0) with 446 units in-transit. Based on the promised lead time (L=2), the order placed in P1 (237 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase (visible in P4 start). The order placed in P2 (209 units) is expected in P4. We have no confirmed arrivals yet, which is consistent with L=2. To capture the recent demand level and the mild growth trend, I will use recent_N=5 (covering 2019-01-28 to 2019-02-18) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. This covers the transition from extreme volatility (198 peak) to a more stabilized level around 60-80.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a fitted knit sweater from the Divided collection. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced 3 periods of lost sales (total 221 units) because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Order 1 (placed P1) was expected to arrive in P3 resolution but 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This indicates a potential lead time delay or loss. However, based on the 'Lead Time Definition', the P1 order (L=2) arrives during P3 and visibility occurs at the start of P4. Looking at 'Period 3 conclude', it says arrived=0, which confirms the P1 order has NOT arrived yet as of the end of P3. We expect the P1 order (237 units) to arrive during P4. Demand has been steadily increasing: 53, 80, 88. Historical samples show a spike to 198 in late Jan, suggesting potential volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current upward trend (avg ~74/week) and 'recent_N' for sigma to account for the increasing variance. I will maintain the 'default' lead time for now but keep a close watch on the P1 shipment.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. Reviewing the history for SKU 574109012 (a fitted knit sweater), the promised lead time L=2 is confirmed by the Period 4 arrival of the Period 2 order. However, the Period 1 order (237 units) is now 2 periods overdue (should have arrived in Period 3). This suggests it may be lost. Demand over the last 5 samples (15, 50, 198, 60, 68) shows a significant outlier in late Jan (198), but has stabilized recently around 70-80 units. For the parameters: 1) L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the confirmed lead time of 2 while acknowledging the system's ability to average observations. 2) mu_hat uses 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging approx 78), excluding the noisy high demand from January. 3) sigma_hat also uses 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect current volatility. Because the Period 1 order is likely lost, the 'In-transit' count of 238 (which includes those 237 lost units) creates a risk that the OR backend will not order enough. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent patterns, we ensure the base stock covers current needs, though we must monitor if more orders are needed to compensate for the lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (237 units) is overdue by 2 periods as of Period 5 and likely lost; Demand stabilized around 78 units/period since Feb 11.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18. For SKU 574109012 (long-sleeved sweater), demand has stabilized in a new regime. The last three periods of satisfied demand (P3-P5) show a mean of 76.6 units (88, 75, 67). The Period 1 order (237 units) is now 3 periods past its promised arrival date (should have arrived P3, concluded P4) and is officially confirmed as lost, as it did not arrive in P4 or P5. The Period 2 order (209 units) arrived on time in P4 (lead time 2). Total in-transit is 238 (P1's 237 lost + P3's 1 unit). Since P1's units will never arrive, the pipeline inventory is effectively 1 unit. We must order to cover at least (L+1) periods of demand. Using N=3 for demand parameters (P3, P4, P5) to capture the current stable regime (~77 units/period) while ignoring the initial variability. L remains at the default (promised 2) since the P2 order arrived correctly, suggesting the P1 failure was a loss, not a systemic delay.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 1 order (237 units) confirmed lost after no arrival by P5. Demand regime since P3 (Feb 25) is stable at ~77 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), the product (Rachel LS TVP sweater) is entering a spring phase where demand is tapering. Since the regime shift in Period 3, the average demand has been approximately 70.25 units (P3: 88, P4: 75, P5: 67, P6: 51). The Period 1 order (237 units) is confirmed lost as it is now 4 periods past its promised delivery date of Period 3. The Period 2 order (209 units) arrived correctly with a lead time of 2. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (16 units) and there is one pending order of 1 unit from Period 3 (also likely late/lost) and whatever was ordered in Periods 4-6 (0 units). I need to restock. I will set L to the promised lead time of 2. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the post-spike stabilization and slight downward trend (avg ~70). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=4 to account for the lowered volatility compared to the early seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering observed: average demand fell from 77 to 59 units over the last two periods (P5-P6); confirmed P1 order loss.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (Rachel LS TVP sweater) is entering Spring. Demand has shown a significant downwards trend over the last 4 periods (75, 67, 51, 32), with the most recent demand (32) being less than half of the February average (~74). This timing aligns with a seasonal transition for knitwear. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 16 units of demand lost in Period 7. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 239 units, composed of: P1 order (237 units) which is now 7 periods old and confirmed lost (promised lead time 2), and P3 order (1 unit), also likely lost. A small 1-unit order was placed in P7. Given the P1 order (237 units) is lost, it still incorrectly occupies the 'In-transit' slot in the OR engine's logic (pipeline_inventory). Since the backend subtracts pipeline_inventory from the base_stock, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory. My target base stock for L=2 (covering 3 periods of demand) at the current demand rate of ~32 units/period is roughly 96 units. To force the OR engine to place a new order despite the 239 'phantom' units in transit, I must set mu_hat high enough: mu_hat = target_base_stock + phantom_inventory \u2248 96 + 239 = 335. I will set mu_hat to 335 and L to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand decline confirmed: Weekly demand for knitwear dropped from ~75 in early March to 32 by April 1 (-57%).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product (Rachel LS TVP knitwear) is experiencing a continued seasonal decline in demand. The recent demands (51, 32, 20) indicate a downward trend as spring progresses. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a significant stockout occurring in Period 8. The stockout was caused by the loss of the Period 1 order (237 units) and lean ordering in Periods 5-7. However, an order of 143 units from Period 8 is currently in transit and expected to arrive in Period 10 (given a 2rd period promised lead time). The 'arrived=1' in Period 8 (ordered in P7) indicates a realized lead time of 1, but I will maintain the estimate at the promised 2 for safety. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent lower demand levels (~42.5 average) while acknowledging the downward trajectory. This will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock that inventory levels should aim for once the in-transit units arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-seasonal peak (Feb/Mar) has continued to decline into April; average demand for the last 3 periods is ~34 units, down significantly from the ~75 units seen in early March.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15. The product is a fine-knit sweater, which is entering a low-demand phase as spring progresses. Recent demand samples show a clear decline: 32, 20, 17 over the last three periods. The order from Period 1 (237 units) is confirmed lost. We have an order of 143 units from Period 8 (expected arrival in Period 10 or 11) and an additional 238 units in transit (likely the cumulative 'in-transit' total reported). With on-hand at 0 and total in-transit at 381 units, we are significantly over-committed relative to the current demand regime of ~20 units/week. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this lower demand ceiling (~23 units per week) and maintain the default lead time. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to N=3 to capture the reduced volatility in this lower demand regime. No new orders should be triggered by the OR backend given the high pipeline-to-demand ratio.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal demand floor confirmed: April demand stabilized at ~20 units/period (compared to Feb/Mar peak of ~75), reflecting typical seasonal decline for knitwear.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knit sweater (Divided Collection), which is highly seasonal and currently in a clear post-peak decline as Northern Hemisphere temperatures rise in late April. Current demand has stabilized at a significantly lower floor: the last three periods recorded demand levels of 20, 17, and 13 units (average ~17). The earlier 2019 samples (15 to 198) from January were likely part of the peak winter/spring transition. We are currently well-stocked with 130 units on-hand and an additional 238 units in-transit (assuming the P1 order is still considered lost as per previous insights, but P8 has arrived). Given the current demand of ~17 units per week, the 130 units on-hand provide over 7 weeks of cover, which is more than sufficient given the promised lead time of 2. Placing more orders now would only increase holding costs during a low-demand season. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this new low-demand regime, ensuring the OR engine correctly calculates a lower base stock and does not order further units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved 'Knitwear' top, which is experiencing a significant seasonal decline as Spring progresses. Recent demand for the last five periods (P7-P11) has been 32, 20, 17, 13, and 17 units respectively, clearly demonstrating a stabilized low-demand regime for the off-season. The mean demand over these last 5 periods is approximately 19.8 units. I currently have 113 units on-hand, which is significantly more than needed to cover the promised lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods of demand \u2248 60 units). The 237 units from the Period 1 order remain lost. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current demand floor, the OR backend should not place new orders. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the current seasonal floor (~20 units/period) and L to default (2), which results in a base stock level well below my current stock position, preventing unnecessary holding costs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knitwear item, which has entered a low-demand phase in May (late spring). Following a peak demand period in February/March (averaging ~75 units), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level. Over the last three cycles (P10-P12), demand was 13, 17, and 25 units respectively (average ~18.3). The current on-hand inventory is 88 units and there are 238 units in-transit (P1 order is confirmed lost, P2 arrived, P7/P8 arrived, and more are likely in-pipeline from more recent unrecorded orders or OR backend logic). Given the current on-hand inventory of 88 units, which covers nearly 5 weeks of demand at the current rate (~18/week), and the high service level requirement (profit/holding cost ratio of 19:1), the primary concern is avoiding excessive holding costs on a seasonal item. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P8-P12) to reflect the current low-demand regime (average ~18.4, multiplied by 3 for L+1), and use a recent Window for sigma_hat to account for the reduced volatility in the off-season. Lead time L is set to calculate as recent shipments have arrived in 1-2 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knit top (Rachel LS TVP), which has entered low-season demand during May. Historical demand from Period 10 to Period 13 shows a stable floor averaging 17.25 units/period (13, 17, 25, 14 respectively). Currently, there is 74 units on-hand, which covers over 4 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' quantity of 238 units includes the long-lost Period 1 order (237 units) and a minor remnant from Period 3 (1 unit). Given the on-hand inventory already significantly exceeds the required base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (April-May) to reflect the confirmed lower demand regime, and L remains at the default promised lead time as recent deliveries (Period 8 arrived in 2 periods) have stabilized.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 574109012 is a 'Rachel LS TVP', a long-sleeved knitwear item. As of Period 15 (May 20), we are deep in the off-season for knitwear. Demand has continued to decline, dropping from an April plateau of ~17-20 units to a three-period average (P12-P14) of 15.3 units, with the most recent demand being only 7 units. On-hand inventory is 67 units, which covers over 4 periods of current average demand. Additionally, there are 238 units in-transit (P1 order of 237 is confirmed lost, but P3 order of 1 unit remains in pipe). Given the massive overstock relative to current seasonal demand (stock-to-sales ratio approx 4.5+), no new orders are needed. L is set to calculated (Avg ~1.5) and mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the late-Spring demand floor, which will prevent the backend from triggering unnecessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: May demand for knitwear is significantly lower than April, dropping to an average of ~15 units/period (P12-P14) and reaching a seasonal low of 7 units in Period 14.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knit top, which is experiencing a significant seasonal decline as the environment moves into late May (Period 16). Historical data and recent trends show demand has dropped from ~75 units/period in March to ~6 units in Period 15. The current on-hand inventory of 61 units is more than sufficient to cover demand for several periods, especially since the current demand regime (last 3 periods) averages only 9 units per period. The 238 units in-transit includes the lost Period 1 shipment (237 units), which the OR backend still counts as pipeline inventory; this actually prevents the system from over-ordering. Given the on-hand surplus and the seasonal trajectory, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture the most recent seasonal floor (approx 9 units/period * (1+2) = 27) and keep L at default to maintain a conservative base stock while we wait for on-hand levels to deplete.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knit top, which has entered a sustained seasonal low in the summer months (June). Demand has dropped from ~15 units/period in May to an average of 5 units/period over the last two weeks (P15-P16), with only 4 units sold in the most recent period. Total pipeline inventory (On-hand: 57 + In-transit: 238) remains excessively high relative to the current demand rate of ~5 units/period. The In-transit volume likely includes the stale Period 1 order (237 units) which is confirmed lost. Even ignoring that lost shipment, the 57 units on-hand cover over 11 weeks of demand at the current pace. Therefore, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this seasonal floor (~10 units/period) and prevent further ordering. L is set to calculated as lead times have been consistent at 1-2 periods for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: June demand for knitwear has reached a seasonal floor, averaging ~5 units/period (P15-P16), a 66% decrease from the May average of ~15.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knit top, which is experiencing a significant seasonal demand decline as we enter June. Over the last three periods (P15-P17), demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 5.33 units per period (6, 4, and 6 units respectively). The on-hand inventory of 51 units is more than sufficient to cover this low demand for several months, especially as the current 'in-transit' total of 238 units includes the long-lost Period 1 shipment (237 units) and a negligible 1-unit order from Period 3. Given the current date (June 10) and the product type (knitwear), we are at a seasonal floor. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this current demand regime and avoid over-ordering, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 2 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved knit sweater, which is in a state of extreme seasonal demand decline as summer begins. Demand has reached a very low floor, averaging approx. 5 units/period over the last 4 periods (P15-P18: 6, 4, 6, 4). On-hand inventory is 47 units, and the pipeline contains 238 units (primarily from the lost Period 1 order of 237 units and a small outlier). Since current on-hand inventory (47) covers more than 9 periods of current demand (~5 units/period), and the lead time remains stable at the promised 2 periods (based on P8 order arriving in P10), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent baseline of ~5 units/period across the 3-period coverage window (1+L), and use recent data for sigma_hat to account for the reduced volatility at these low levels.

Carry-over insight: June demand floor confirmed: average demand for knitwear has stayed consistent at ~5 units/period over the last 4 weeks (P15-P18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knit top, which is experiencing a deep seasonal demand trough in late June. Current demand has reached a floor of approximately 2-6 units per week (average ~4 over the last 5 periods). On-hand inventory (45 units) is significantly higher than needed to cover the lead time (2 periods) and review period at current demand rates. The 'In-transit' quantity (238) includes the lost Period 1 order (237 units) and an old Period 3 order (1 unit) that never arrived; these should be ignored as they are likely lost. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime, ensuring the OR engine does not over-order while we draw down existing stock. Lead time remains stable at 2 periods when orders do arrive.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-07-01 (Period 21). The product is a long-sleeve knit top (sweater category). Demand has reached a seasonal low, falling from roughly 75 units/period in Feb/March to an average of just 3.2 units over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), with zero demand in the most recent period. On-hand inventory is 45 units, which is more than enough to cover the expected demand for the next several periods given our current demand floor of ~3-5 units/period. The pipeline inventory (238 units) includes a likely lost shipment from P1. Because on-hand inventory (45) significantly exceeds the projected base stock for a 3-period horizon (L+1) at current demand levels, I will use recent history (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this seasonal floor and prevent any unnecessary ordering.

Carry-over insight: July demand for knitwear is tracking near zero, confirming a deep seasonal trough; average demand over P16-P20 is 3.2 units/period.

Current demand is extremely low, with only 1 unit of demand in the last two periods and an average of 3.2 units over the last five weeks (P17-P21). On-hand inventory is 44 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover several months of demand at current rates. Additionally, there are 238 units in-transit (reflecting the 237 units from Period 1 that are confirmed lost but still tracked in the pipeline by the backend). Given the high holding cost relative to the current negligible demand and the high on-hand stock, there is no need to order. I will use a conservative mu_hat reflecting the recent 5-period demand average (~2.6 units per period, scaled by 1+L=3) to prevent the OR backend from generating unnecessary orders against the phantom in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: July demand trough confirmed with demand dropping to near zero (0.6 units/period avg over P20-P21).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knit top (knitwear), which is currently in its deep seasonal trough during the July summer period. Recent demand has been extremely low, averaging 1.3 units over the last 3 periods (P20-P22: 0, 1, 2) and 2.5 units over the last 6 periods (P17-P22). Lead times for recently arrived shipments (P4, P8, P10) have been 2, 1, and 2 periods respectively, averaging 1.67, which aligns with the promised lead time of 2. There is a large pipeline of 238 units (primarily the lost Period 1 order of 237 units and a small adjustment of 1). On-hand inventory is 42 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the current demand regime (approx 1-3 units/week) for the foreseeable duration of the summer trough. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current low-demand floor while ensuring the OR engine does not overreact to single-period zeros. No new orders are needed as supply vastly exceeds expected seasonal demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knitwear sweater, which is currently in its deep seasonal trough (July). Recent demand has been negligible, with the last 4 periods (P20-P23) showing demands of 0, 1, 2, and 0 units. On-hand inventory is 42 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the current demand regime. The carry-over insights confirm a sustained demand trough. There are 238 units in-transit (the lost 237 units from P1 plus a minor P3/P7 fragment), but since they are long overdue, they do not affect current strategy. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the near-zero demand floor (avg ~0.75 units/period), and sig_hat using the same period to capture low volatility. This will result in a zero order, allowing existing inventory to deplete slowly.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knit sweater, currently in a deep seasonal trough (late July). Demand has stabilized at a near-zero level, averaging approximately 0.8 units per period over the last five weeks (P20-P24). On-hand inventory (41 units) and in-transit units (238, primarily the lost P1 order and likely the long-term impact of order mechanics) are significantly higher than necessary given this demand. Current on-hand inventory alone covers over 40 periods of demand at the current rate. To prevent any further ordering and minimize holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current trough, and maintaining the default lead time. The OR backend will see that (on-hand + in-transit) >> base_stock, resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: August demand for knitwear remains at a seasonal floor, with demand averaging <1 unit/period since late June.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved knit top, which has been in a seasonal trough throughout the summer (July/August), with demand often near zero. As of August 5 (Period 26), demand remains very low (6 units last period, but averaged <1 unit previously). The on-hand inventory of 35 units is more than sufficient to cover current demand levels, which have averaged ~1.8 units over the last 5 periods. The 237 units from the Period 1 order remain lost, and the total in-transit quantity of 238 likely includes that lost shipment plus one small order from Period 7. mu_hat is set using a recent regime of 5 periods (representing the deep summer floor) to prevent the OR engine from triggering unnecessary orders while on-hand inventory is high and demand is seasonally minimal. L is set to calculate as observed lead times have generally adhered to the promised 2 periods (ignoring specifically lost shipments).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for this knitwear product (SKU 574109012) is beginning to rise as the summer floor ends, with demand jumping from single digits to 21 in Period 26. This aligns with the transition from late summer into early fall. Current on-hand inventory is 14 units. However, there are 238 units in-transit: 237 units from Period 1 (confirmed lost/overdue) and 1 unit from Period 3 (also overdue/lost). Since the OR engine's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock calculating the order, these 'ghost' units will prevent the system from placing new orders as demand recovers. To force the system to replenish for the upcoming fall season, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set a forecast that reflects the recent upward trend (averaging the last two periods (~13.5) and projecting a slight increase for the start of the season to ~20 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of 60 (3 * 20). Sigma is set to a moderate level to account for the uncertainty of the seasonal ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: August demand transition: Knitwear demand began rising in early August (P26 demand = 21), marking the end of the summer trough. Persistent lost units (238 total) remain in-transit, requiring explicit parameter intervention to bypass the OR engine's pipeline inventory subtraction.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 19, 2019. Demand for knitwear has exited the summer trough and is sharply increasing (P26: 21, P27: 32). Mean demand for the last two periods is ~26.5 units. Given the transition into late August, I expect demand to continue scaling towards seasonal peaks seen earlier in the year (~75 units). Crucially, the system reports 238 units in-transit, which are confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (237 units) and Period 3 (1 unit). Because the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, a base stock lower than 238 would result in zero orders, leading to stockouts during the autumn ramp-up. To override this, I set mu_hat explicitly to the current seasonal trend (~30 units/period) multiplied by (L+1), plus the lost 238 units. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 30) + 238 = 328. This ensures the OR engine places an order reflecting current demand needs while accounting for the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand ramp-up confirmed: Demand increased from <1 to 32 units/period over the last 3 weeks (P25-P27). Explicit mu_hat correction (Current Trend * (L+1) + 238) is required until lost units are cleared to force replenishment.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its peak autumn season (Knitwear). Current demand has ramped significantly from the summer trough: 21 (P26), 32 (P27), 42 (P28), showing a strong upward trend. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 361 units is misleading because it includes 238 permanently lost units from P1 and P3. The only active shipment is the 123 units ordered in P28, which is expected during P30. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 238 'phantom' units in-transit, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the base-stock formula (base_stock - pipeline > 0). I estimate next period's demand at ~55-60 units. Total demand over (L+1) = 3 periods is ~180. To offset the 238 lost units and still order enough for current demand, I will set an explicit mu_hat of 440 (theoretical 180 + 260 buffer). This overrides the pipeline inventory check. Sigma_hat is set to account for the heightened volatility during the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand ramp confirmed: Knitwear demand reached 42 units in P28, representing a 100% increase over P26 levels. Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 238 lost units (P1, P3), requiring mu_hat inflation of approximately +240 units to maintain ordering.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. We are in the middle of an autumn demand ramp-up for this knitwear SKU as the summer trough has ended. Demand over the last four weeks (P26-P29) has been 21, 32, 42, and 37, averaging approximately 33 units/period. The immediate challenge is that the backend OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' logic is subtracting 238 units from 'In-transit' that are confirmed lost (Period 1 order of 237 units and likely the Period 3 order of 1 unit). Currently, 'In-transit' shows 539 units, but only 301 units (P28 order of 123 + P29 order of 178) are actually expected to arrive. The 238 ghost units prevent the OR engine from ordering enough to meet the rising autumn demand. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the expected (L+1) demand PLUS the 238 units to offset the 'ghost' inventory. With L=2, the forecast for (L+1=3) periods is ~100 units (33.3 * 3). Adding the 238 'ghost' inventory units results in a mu_hat of 338. This forces the base stock calculation high enough to sustain ordering despite the inflated in-transit figure. sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility observed during this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp confirmed (Sep 2): Demand is averaging 33 units/period (P26-P29), up from <1 in July. Ghost inventory of 238 units (P1, P3) persist in pipeline, requiring mu_hat to be inflated by exactly 238 to ensure order generation until those units are manually or automatically cleared.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 31 (Sept 9), witnessing a strong autumn demand ramp-up for the long-sleeved knitwear fitted top. Period 30 demand spike reached 123 units, demonstrating high seasonal sensitivity. On-hand inventory is currently at 0. 'In-transit' shows 416 units, but this includes 238 ghost units from lost shipments in Period 1 (237 units) and Period 3 (1 unit). These lost units have been 'in-transit' for ~30 and ~27 periods respectively, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its order calculation. To force an order despite these 238 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat. Recent demand (P28-P30) averaged ~67 units/period. For a look-ahead of 3 periods (L+1), the baseline mu_hat should be ~200. Adding the 238 lost units correction, the explicit mu_hat target is 438 units. Sigma_hat is set to 45 to handle the high volatility observed in the transition from 37 to 123 units. L is kept at 2 as recent arrivals (P30) confirm the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: Demand spiked from 37 to 123 units in P30 as autumn seasonality for knitwear takes effect. Mu_hat must remain inflated by ~238 units to offset permanent lost shipments from P1 and P3 until they are cleared from pipeline inventory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for knitwear (Fitted top) is experiencing a sharp autumn surge as anticipated. Recent demand values are: P28=42, P29=37, P30=123, P31=139. The average of the last two peak periods is 131. The 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 238 units (Period 1 and Period 3 lost shipments) persists in the 'In-transit' count of 513 (Actual in-transit = 513 - 238 = 275, comprising P29 ordered 178 and P31 ordered 97). To force the OR backend to order sufficiently, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Inventory). With a lead time L=2, the total units required to cover the cycle (L+1=3) at a mean of ~131/period is ~393 units. Adding the 238 ghost units, the targets mu_hat should be approximately 631. I will set mu_hat to 631 and sigma_hat explicitly high (70) to ensure a robust safety stock during this rapid growth phase, as on-hand inventory is currently 0 and demand is exceeding previous expectations.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: Demand increased to 139 units in P31. Ghost pipeline inventory remains at 238 units (P1, P3), requiring mu_hat inflation of +238 until these are cleared.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for knitwear is in a strong autumn surge (Sept 23). Recent demand figures (P30: 123, P31: 139, P32: 121) show a stabilization around an average of 128 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 650 units in-transit. However, 238 of these units are from P1 and P3, which are confirmed lost and represent 'ghost' pipeline inventory. To generate an order that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the review period (total 3 periods of demand), the OR engine needs a mu_hat target that accounts for actual expected demand plus the 238 hidden shortfall. Calculation: (128 units/period * 3 periods) + 238 lost units = 622. I will set mu_hat to 625 to ensure the OR engine maintains a healthy replenishment signal despite the ghost units. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent volatility of the autumn ramp.

Carry-over insight: September demand (autumn peak) has stabilized at approximately 128 units/period (P30-P32). Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 238 lost units from P1 and P3, necessitating a persistent mu_hat offset until these are cleared.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '574109012' (Knitwear fitted top) is in its peak autumn demand season. Demand in Period 33 spiked significantly to 216 units, exceeding the previous stabilized average of ~128. This reflects the transition into colder weather. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and total in-transit is 654. However, 238 of these in-transit units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 (237 units) and Period 3 (1 unit) which were lost but still count against the OR engine's pipeline calculations. To ensure an order is generated, I must adjust mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset for these 238 lost units. I estimate demand for the next 3 weeks (L=2) at ~200 units per week. Target mu_hat = (200 * 3) + 238 = 838. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for high volatility seen in the transition from ~120 to ~216.

Carry-over insight: September/October peak confirmed: Demand spiked to 216 units in P33 (+68% vs P30-P32 average); Ghost pipeline inventory remains at 238 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak autumn/winter season (October). Demand in P33 and P34 averaged ~177 units, confirming a high sustained demand regime. Pipeline inventory is currently 1076 units, which includes 238 confirmed lost units from P1 and P3. These 'ghost' units prevent the OR engine from ordering enough stock. To maintain a sufficient base stock level (target ~600-700 units to cover L+1 visibility at ~200 units/period), I must inflate mu_hat to offset these lost units. Demand analysis: P33=216, P34=139. I will forecast a weekly mean of 180. Using L=2, the required base stock is roughly (1+2)*180 = 540. However, to bypass the 238 units of ghost inventory and the current stockout, I set mu_hat explicitly to (180 * 3) + 238 = 778. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 25% of mean to handle volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: October demand peak confirmed with mean demand shifting to ~180 units/period (P33-P34). Ghost pipeline inventory remains at 238 units (P1, P3), requiring mu_hat inflation of +238 until cleared.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for knitwear (sweaters) is in its peak autumn seasonal phase. Current Period 36 is mid-October. Recent demand (P30-P35) has averaged approximately 140 units per period (123, 139, 121, 216, 139, 104). The 238 ghost units from P1 and P3 are still stuck in pipeline inventory, meaning the OR engine thinks we have 238 more units than we actually do. To force the OR backend to place an order, mu_hat must be inflated by exactly 238 units on top of the forecasted demand for (L+1) periods. Assuming a lead time L=2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand. Forecast: 140 units/period * 3 = 420. Add the 238 ghost offset = 658 units. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 25% of the forecasted lead-time demand to account for the high volatility seen in P33.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for knitwear is currently in its autumn peak, though it has slightly moderated from the late September high (216 units) to approximately 97 units/period over the last two weeks (P35-P36). Currently, on-hand inventory is 44 units, and in-transit inventory is 838 units. This pipeline includes 238 units from P1 and P3 that are functionally lost (ghost inventory), but also includes large replenishment orders from P34 (422 units, ordered Sep 30). With a promised lead time of 2, the P34 order is expected to arrive during the resolution of P36 (visible next period) or P37. The recent observed lead times for P32 and P33 were 3 periods, suggesting potential supply chain congestion. To maintain stock against this high-demand season and compensate for the 238 ghost units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) demand plus the ghost offset. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 600 units (calculated as ~120 avg weekly demand * 3 periods + 238 ghost units) to ensure sufficient ordering once the P34 order arrives or if it is delayed. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the recent shift to 3-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: October demand remains strong but stabilized at ~100 units/period (avg of P35-P36 is 97). Lead times for P32-P33 confirmed at 3 periods, indicating a lengthening from the promised 2.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019, representing the peak/stable phase of autumn demand for knitwear. Demand over the last three periods (P35-P37) has settled at an average of 94 units/period, down from the extreme spike of 216 in P33 but significantly higher than summer levels. On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory is 838 units, but this includes 238 ghost units from P1 and P3 that are confirmed lost. Recent lead times for P32 and P33 were observed at 3 periods, suggesting we should anticipate a lead time (L) of 3 instead of the promised 2. To ensure the OR engine generates an order despite the 238 units of ghost pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat at approximately (1+L) * Forecast + 238. With L=3 and Forecast=94, the required base mu_hat is 376. Adding the 238 offset results in a value of 614. Setting sigma_hat explicitly using recent volatility (standard deviation of P34-P37 is approx 25) scaled by sqrt(1+L) gives approximately 50.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for autumn deliveries has lengthened to 3 periods (confirmed by P35 and P36 concludes). Ghost pipeline inventory remains at 238 units from P1 and P3, requiring a persistent mu_hat offset of +238 to ensure order replenishment triggers.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (Nov 4), the product (knitwear) is in its autumn/winter demand regime. Recent demand has stabilized around 90-100 units/period (avg of P35-P38 is 94). A significant challenge remains: 238 units from P1 and P3 are permanently lost but still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR engine. To trigger a replenishment order, mu_hat must be explicitly set to cover the (L+1) forecast PLUS the lost 238 ghost units. Recent lead times from P35 and P36 concludes were 3 periods, suggesting a lengthening from the promised 2. Using L=3, the (L+1) horizon is 4 periods. Forecasted demand for 4 periods is approximately 376 units (94 * 4). Adding the 238 ghost units correction, mu_hat is set to 614. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to capture autumn volatility.

Carry-over insight: November demand remains stable at ~94 units/period (P35-P38). Lead time for the autumn peak has settled at 3 periods. The 238 ghost units in pipeline inventory still require an explicit mu_hat offset of +238 to prevent stockouts.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40 (Nov 11), we are observing late autumn demand for knitwear. Recent demand has slightly softened from the October peak (139-216) to around 63-93 units/period (P38-P39). The lead time for recent arrivals (P35, P36 conclude) was 3 periods. The most critical issue remains the 238 'ghost units' from Period 1 and Period 3 that have never arrived and are permanently lost, but still count towards the OR engine's pipeline inventory. At an on-hand of 0 and in-transit of 838, the engine sees 838 units. To trigger a new order to cover the current demand (avg ~80) over the L+1 window (4 periods), the base stock needs to exceed 838. Therefore, mu_hat is explicitly set to 600 (approx 150/period * 4) + 238 (offset) = 838. I will set it to 850 to ensure a small buffer order is placed if the engine calculates a high sigma_hat, or to maintain the status quo if the in-transit units are sufficient for the forecast. Lead time L is set to 3 based on recent performance.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18 (Period 41). The SKU is an autumn/winter knitwear item. Demand has moderated from the October peak (~100/period) to a late November level of approximately 60 units/period (avg of P39-P40 is 59.5). Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for recent observed delays (P35, P36). The primary operational challenge is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 238 units (from lost orders in P1 and P3) which still haven't cleared. Current 'In-transit' is 900 units, but 238 of those are lost, and 422 (from P34) are now overdue (P34 order is at L=7 without arriving). Since 0 units are on hand and 660 units (238 lost + 422 overdue/likely lost) are padding the pipeline, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to force orders. I calculate the target base stock based on a current demand of 60/period over (L+1)=4 periods (240 units), then add the 238 ghost units to offset the OR engine's subtraction, plus an additional buffer for the likely lost 422 units from P34. Total mu_hat = (60 * 4) + 238 + 422 = 900. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for high demand volatility during the transition to winter.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Order from Period 34 (422 units) is 7 periods overdue and likely lost; ghost units in pipeline now total 660 (P1, P3, P34). Demand has stabilized at ~60 units/period for late November.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '574109012' (Knitwear fitted top) is in a late autumn/early winter phase where demand is stabilizing around 45-60 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. We have confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (237 units) and Period 3 (1 unit). Additionally, the order from Period 34 (422 units) is now 8 periods overdue and almost certainly lost. This brings the total ghost units in transit to 660. The OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (1032 units) from the base stock. To force any order, mu_hat must be explicitly set to cover (forecasted demand * (L+1)) + ghost_units. With a lead time of 3 periods and current demand averaging ~50, the required base stock is (50 * 4) + 660 = 860. I will set mu_hat to 860 and sigma_hat to 100 to maintain a protective buffer. Lead time L is set to 3 based on confirmed autumn performance.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 42, ghost pipeline inventory is estimated at 660 units (P1: 237, P3: 1, P34: 422). Demand regime has shifted from autumn peak (~100-200) to winter stability (~50 units/period).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Knitwear' has entered the late November/early December regime, characterized by variable winter demand. In Period 42, demand spiked to 168 units, significantly higher than the previous 4-week average of ~55. Ghost pipeline inventory remains a critical operational issue; I have identified a total of 660 ghost units (P1: 237, P3: 1, P34: 422) that are likely lost but remain in the OR engine's 'in-transit' calculation. As of P43, the total in-transit is 1032, meaning 372 units (Orders P29, P40, P41) are actually currently in-transit. To force the OR backend to place orders despite these 660 ghost units, I must continue to inflate mu_hat. I estimate the current demand mean at ~80 units (accounting for potential December spikes) over a lead time (L) of 3 (observed autumn L). Thus, the target base stock is roughly 80 * (3 + 1) = 320. To offset the 660 ghost units, mu_hat is set to 320 + 660 = 980. This ensures that the engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic results in a positive replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost pipeline inventory confirmed at 660 units (P1, P3, P34) as of Dec 2; December demand volatility noted with P42 spike to 168 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 Analysis (Dec 9): The demand for this knitwear SKU has shifted from the autumn peak (~100-200 units) to a steadier winter regime. Recent demand (P39-P43, excluding the P42 outlier of 168) averages approximately 57 units/period. The lead time has stabilized at 3 periods despite the promised 2 (confirmed by P35, P36, P40, and P43 concludes). Pipeline inventory shows 928 units, but 660 of these are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1: 237, P3: 1, P34: 422). To counteract the OR engine's subtraction of these 660 units, I must inflate mu_hat. Forecasted demand for the (L+1) = 4 period window is ~240 units (60 * 4). Adding the 660 ghost unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 900. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current winter volatility while ignoring the summer trough.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stable lead time of 3 periods (average of P35, P36, P40, P43). Total ghost pipeline inventory is 660 units (P1, P3, P34) as of Period 44.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (Dec 16), demand for this knitwear SKU has stabilized around 50-60 units after the early December peak. The current on-hand inventory is 83 units. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is reported as 936 units, but this is heavily distorted by 'ghost' units from lost shipments: P1 (237), P3 (1), and now confirmed P34 (422), totaling 660 lost units. To compensate for these ghost units being subtracted from the inventory position by the OR engine, mu_hat must be inflated. A baseline demand of 60 units/period over (L+1=4) periods is 240 units. Adding the 660 ghost unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 900. L is set to 3 periods based on consistent recent arrival data (P40, P43, P35, P36). sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for recent December volatility (e.g., P42 demand spike).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 45, ghost pipeline inventory is confirmed at 660 units (P1, P3, P34), which are 10+ weeks overdue and permanently lost. Demand has stabilized at a late-season level of ~55 units/period (P43-P44 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1527.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (Dec 23), the product 'Rachel LS TVP' (Knitwear) is in the mid-winter season. Demand has been fluctuating between 45 and 168 units per period over the last five weeks (P41-P45), with a recent average of approximately 82 units/period (avg of P42-P45). The 'ghost' pipeline inventory\u2014units that were ordered but never arrived and are now significantly overdue\u2014remains at 660 units (P1: 237, P3: 1, P34: 422). Since the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock to determine the order quantity, these 660 lost units effectively block new orders unless the mu_hat parameter is manually inflated to offset them. Lead times have recently varied between 2 and 3 periods; I will set L=3 based on recent history to be safe. To ensure the backend places an order to maintain stock for the next 4 periods (L+1), I set mu_hat to (Current Forecast 82 * 4) + Ghost units 660 \u2248 988. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility (standard deviation ~50) observed over the last month across the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Ghost pipeline inventory is confirmed at 660 units (P1, P3, P34), requiring a mu_hat offset of +660 to sustain replenishment. Demand is volatile but averaging ~82 units/period in Dec.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Demand for knitwear remains volatile but elevated during the winter season (Period 46 demand was 93). Ghost pipeline inventory remains a critical issue; orders from Period 1 (237 units), Period 3 (1 unit), and Period 34 (422 units) are clearly lost, totaling 660 'ghost' units in the pipeline that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. This systematically blocks new orders unless mu_hat is inflated. I will set the lead time L to 3 periods, reflecting recent observed delays (e.g., Period 40 arriving in Period 43). To bypass the ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set to (Expected Demand \xd7 (L+1)) + Ghost Units. With a demand floor near 80-90 units/period for late December, expected demand for (L+1)=4 periods is ~340 units. Adding 660 ghost units results in a mu_hat of ~1000. This ensures the backend (base_stock - 1065 + 660) computation triggers a sufficient order to cover real demand while on-hand is zero.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Ghost pipeline inventory remains 660 units (P1, P3, P34), verified by continued non-arrival. Seasonal demand for knitwear is currently in a winter peak/plateau (~80-90 units/period). Sustained lead time is 3 periods.
