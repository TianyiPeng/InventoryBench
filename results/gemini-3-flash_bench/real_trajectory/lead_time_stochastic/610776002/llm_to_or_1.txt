Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Tilly' women's T-shirt. Historical data shows a clear upward trend in demand over the last 5 weeks: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308. The average demand across these 5 samples is 204.8, but the most recent two weeks show a significant jump (233 and 308), likely due to seasonal demand as spring approaches. Given the promised lead time (L) is 2, the pipeline needs to cover 3 periods (L+1). My forecast for the next period is approximately 320 units. To capture the recent momentum, I will use a recent_N method with N=3 for demand and volatility to represent the current regime. Setting L to default (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order of 356 units (placed in P1) is in transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods (expected P3). Historical demand for the last 6 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 11) shows a clear upward trend: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308, and 266. This suggests a seasonal ramp-up in February as spring/summer basics gain traction. The average of the last 3 samples (233, 308, 266) is 269 units/period. Given the trend and the fact that we are currently out of stock, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period average to capture the higher demand regime. L is kept at default (2). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (3) to reflect the recent volatility in the higher demand environment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Current date is February 25. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a clear upward trend (148, 175, 160, 233, 308). The last two concluded periods (Feb 11, Feb 18) confirm this higher demand level with 266 and 316 units respectively. Averaging the last 4 periods (Feb 4, 11, 18, and Jan 28) gives ~280 units/week. Promised lead time is 2, so the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). Although on-hand is currently 0 due to the lead time gap, significant orders (356 and 331) are in-transit. For Period 3, I expect demand to remain in this 'Early Spring' regime of ~280-310. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this recent uptrend in mean demand, while keeping default lead time estimation as there is no evidence yet of performance deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting late Jan: weekly demand increased from ~160 to ~280-310 (approx +80% increase).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's t-shirt entering the spring season (March), which typically sees rising demand. Historical data shows a significant regime shift starting in late January, jumping from an average of ~160 to ~300. Demand in the last three periods (P1-P3) averaged 296, confirming this shift. Currently, stockouts are occurring because on-hand inventory is 0. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (356 units) are expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in P4's starting inventory (which would be the 'Period 3 conclude' message). However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, and since L=2, an order placed in P1 should have arrived in P3. This indicates a potential lead time delay (moving from L=2 to L=3). To prevent further lost sales while balancing holding costs, I am adjusting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delay and using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the higher demand regime, resulting in a more responsive mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Possible lead time shift or delay observed: Order from Period 1 (L=2) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude. Extending L to 3 for planning.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1084.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). In Period 4's conclude, we saw the arrival of the Period 2 order (331 units) with a lead time of 2. However, the Period 1 order (356 units) is still missing from the 'conclude' messages, which strongly suggests it was lost. This loss caused stockouts in Periods 1-3. Our on-hand inventory is currently low (48), while we have 872 units in-transit (Period 1's 356 presumably lost, and Periods 3 and 4 orders totaling 516). Demand has stabilized at a higher regime of ~280-310 units per week since February. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (recent_N=5) to capture this higher demand average (~280). Because the Period 1 order is likely lost, I will use an 'explicit' lead time (L=3) and an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as (1+L)*mean_demand = 4 * 280 = 1120. This forces the OR backend to aim for a higher inventory target to cover the lost pipeline and protect against stockouts given the recent demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Shipment from Period 1 (356 units) confirmed lost (missing 2 periods past promised L=2). Effective pipeline adjusted down manually via explicit parameters.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a basic T-shirt. Demand analysis: Demand has stabilized in a high regime since late January, with the last 5 periods (P1-P5) averaging 284.6 units. Inventory status: Ending on-hand is 0. Shipment reconciliation: P1's order (356 units) is confirmed lost (now 3 periods overdue). P2's order arrived at P4 (L=2). P3's order (ordered P3, L=2) should have arrived in P5 but didn't. This suggests a potential lead time drift or another lost shipment. Given the stockout and the uncertainty of P3's arrival (212 units), I will set lead time L=3 to be conservative. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the current high-demand regime (+80% increase from early year samples). This configuration aims to aggressive replenish stock to meet the high demand while accounting for supply chain instability.

Carry-over insight: Supply instability: Order from P1 confirmed lost. Order from P3 overdue (expected arrival P5, missing as of P6 start). L conservatively adjusted to 3.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic t-shirt. Current inventory is 0. Analysis of history: P1 order (356 units) is lost. P2 order arrived in 2 periods. P3 order (212 units) is overdue (ordered P3, expected P5, now P7 start). P4 order (304 units) is overdue (ordered P4, expected P6). Surprisingly, the P5 order (235 units) arrived in only 1 period (P6 conclude), indicating high lead time volatility. Mean demand from the last 4 periods is stable around 278 units. Given the extreme supply instability (one lost shipment, two overdue, and one early arrival), I will use L=3 to ensure the base stock covers enough future demand. \u03bc\u0302 will be set to (1+3)*278 = 1112. \u03c3\u0302 will be based on recent volatility. Note: Since the OR engine calculates pipeline as In-transit (949) + On-hand (0), and In-transit includes the lost P1 units, I must account for the fact that 356 of those 949 units will never arrive. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory of 356 units, I will set mu_hat explicitly higher: 1112 + 356 = 1468.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability confirmed: P1 order lost; P3 and P4 orders overdue; P5 order arrived in 1 period. Lead time is highly variable.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the SKU 610776002 (Womens Jersey T-shirt) is facing severe supply chain instability and stockouts. Observations: 1) Demand remains strong, averaging ~290 units over the last 7 periods (Regime: 250-360). 2) Supply is highly unreliable: P1 (ordered) is lost; P3 and P4 (totaling 516 units) are overdue by 2+ periods; P5 arrived early (L=1); and P6/P7 are still in transit. On-hand is currently 0. 3) Calendar check: Late March/early April usually sees steady demand for jersey basics. Because of the inconsistent lead times (ranging from 1 to lost), I will use an explicit L of 3 to provide more safety cover for the OR backend's (L+1) calculation. I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand mean and volatility to capture the higher volumes seen since late February while smoothing out recent stockout-driven demand noise.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain volatility: Observed lead times ranging from 1 period to lost shipments; P3 and P4 orders are currently overdue by 2+ periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt'. Demand has stabilized in a higher regime, averaging approximately 310 units/week over the last 5 periods (P4-P8: 283, 252, 270, 364, 372). The supply chain remains extremely volatile. History shows: P1 order (356 units) lost; P2 order arrived in 2 periods; P3 order (212 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P3, expected P5) and likely lost; P4 order (304 units) is 3 periods overdue (ordered P4, expected P6) and likely lost; P5 arrived in 1 period; P6 arrived in 2 periods; P7 arrived in 1 period. Due to these frequent losses and variability, I will set 'L' to 3 to provide a larger buffer in the base-stock calculation. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the current demand level (~310) which includes the recent spring uptick (364 and 372 in the last two weeks), ensuring the OR backend targets a higher safety stock to compensate for the unreliability of the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P3 (212 units) and P4 (304 units) are likely lost (missing 3+ periods past promised L=2). Supply chain is characterized by binary outcomes: either 1-2 period delivery or total loss.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/15. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 weeks has averaged ~306 units, though it peaked at 372. This SKU (Womens Everyday T-shirt) is entering mid-spring, where demand usually remains robust or increases. The critical issue is supply chain reliability. Orders from Period 1 (356 units), Period 3 (212 units), and Period 4 (304 units) are now confirmed lost based on the 'missing 3+ periods' rule. In-transit currently shows 1217 units, but the actual effective pipeline (excluding lost units) consists only of the Period 9 order (345 units). Period 5, 6, and 7 orders arrived with lead times of 1 or 2 periods. Because the OR backend 'In-transit' figure is likely inflated by lost orders that it cannot manually remove, I must set mu_hat explicitly high to force an order that covers the inventory gap. I am targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (L=2 + 1) at ~320 units/week plus a safety buffer. Setting mu_hat to 1200 covers the expected demand and offsets the 'phantom' in-transit units from lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments confirmed for P1, P3, and P4; lead time is binary: either 1-2 periods or lost entirely. Effective pipeline as of P10 is only the P9 order (345 units).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/04/22), the SKU 'Tilly' (Women's Jersey T-shirt) is in a steady-state demand regime with an average of ~300 units per period since late January. Supply chain reliability remains the primary concern. Historical evidence from the 'conclude' messages confirms that shipments from P1 (356 units), P3 (212 units), and P4 (304 units) are lost, as they are now 6-9 periods past their ordered dates. The OR backend does not know these are lost and still counts them in the '939 units' pipeline. To force the backend to place an appropriate order, I must set mu_hat explicitly high or reduce the effective pipeline manually. Given the on-hand inventory is only 35 units and demand is ~300, we are at high risk of stockcutting. The true pipeline consists only of the P10 order (67 units). I will use L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat using an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~900 units) plus a buffer for the lost units currently clogging the calculated pipeline in the backend. I estimate a base stock target of roughly 1300 units to offset the ~872 lost units in the pipeline and cover upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain binary outcome confirmed: shipments either arrive within 1-2 periods or are lost entirely. Currently, orders from P1, P3, and P4 (total 872 units) are confirmed lost and must be bypassed in pipeline calculations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for women's jersey T-shirts has spiked significantly to 564 units in Period 11, likely due to a seasonal shift into warmer weather. This represents a substantial regime change compared to the previous average of ~300. This spike occurred despite having 0 on-hand inventory for the majority of the period (only 35 units available), suggesting true demand is very high. Supply chain reliability remains binary: orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost. Currently, only orders from P10 (67 units) and P11 (396 units) can be realistically expected in the pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 1650 (550 per period * (L+1)) based on the recent surge, and alpha/sigma to reflect high volatility. I am using L=2 (promised) to avoid excessive capping while accounting for the binary 'arrive or lost' nature of the supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Weekly demand surged from ~300 to 564 (+88%), corresponding with seasonal demand for jersey basic t-shirts in late April.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are in a high-demand seasonal regime for 'Jersey Basic' t-shirts. Demand in Period 11 was 564 and Period 12 was 424, averaging 494. This represents a significant shift from the previous ~300 average. The supply chain remains unstable and 'binary': orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost (totaling 872 units). The OR backend's 'In-transit' count of 1945 includes these lost units, which will lead to severe under-ordering if not corrected. The true healthy pipeline consists of P10 (67), P11 (396), and P12 (610), totaling 1073 units. To force the OR backend to order sufficiently, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I set L=2 (promised). I set mu_hat to (1+L)*500 = 1500 to reflect the new demand level. For sigma_hat, I use a value reflecting the higher volatility seen in recent weeks (standard deviation of {564, 424} is ~99, so sqrt(3)*99 ~ 171). This aggressive posture ensures the system accounts for the lost inventory effectively being zero and the higher sales rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~490-500 units per week starting Period 11 (seasonal peak for basic jersey t-shirts).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 13, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt. Period 11 saw a major seasonal demand spike (564 units), and demand has remained elevated, though Period 13 saw a lower realized demand of 304 (likely due to stockouts during the period or volatility). I will use the mean of the last 3 periods (approx. 430 units/week) for forecasting to balance the high spike with recent data. Lead time remains highly volatile and binary: orders arrive in 1-2 periods or are lost. Orders from P1 (356), P3 (212), and P4 (304) are definitively lost. The order from P12 (610 units) is due this period (L=2) and is critical for inventory. Total 'phantom' pipeline is 872 units. Currently, 'In-transit' is 1549. Actual viable pipeline is 1549 - 872 = 677 (P12: 610 + P10: 67). However, P10 is now 4 periods old and likely lost too, leaving only P12 in the viable pipeline. To compensate for the backend's inability to recognize lost shipments, I will set L=1 and use explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat to target a base stock that accounts for the fact that nearly 1000 units in the pipeline do not exist.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand stabilized at ~430 units/week following the seasonal surge. Pipeline integrity remains poor; 939 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) are considered lost, leaving only P12 (610 units) as active pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/20. The demand for product 610776002 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) has stabilized after a seasonal surge, with an average of approximately 430.75 units over the last 4 periods (P11-P14). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with frequent lost shipments. Orders from Period 1 (356 units), Period 3 (212 units), Period 4 (304 units), and Period 10 (67 units) are confirmed lost as they have exceeded the promised lead time by 4+ periods. The current on-hand inventory is 271. The 'In-transit' figure of 1209 includes 939 units from these lost orders, meaning the effective pipeline is only the order from Period 14 (270 units). To account for this, I am using explicit parameters to set a total base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~1290 units) minus the effective pipeline. Since the backend subtracts the full (inflated) in-transit of 1209 from the base stock, I must set the mu_hat high enough to trigger the necessary ordering behavior while using L=2 (the observed arrival speed for successful orders). I will set mu_hat to cover three periods of demand (1292) and \u03c3\u0302 to handle the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain integrity check: P1, P3, P4, and P10 orders (total 939 units) are definitively lost. Effective pipeline as of P15 is only the P14 order (270 units). Demand has stabilized at ~430 units/week following the seasonal peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the product 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' is in its peak seasonal demand period. Demand has stabilized at a high regime of approximately 435 units per week (Period 14: 431, Period 15: 442). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a binary pattern: orders either arrive in 1-2 periods or are lost indefinitely. Lost shipments include Period 1 (356), Period 3 (212), Period 4 (304), and Period 10 (67), totaling 939 units. These must be excluded from the OR backend's 'In-transit' view to ensure it triggers new orders. The effective pipeline consists only of the Period 14 order (270 units) and the Period 15 order (175 units), totaling 445 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and current demand at ~435/week, and a promised lead time (L) of 2, the desired base stock should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~1305 units). To force the OR backend [final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)] to order approximately 860 units (1305 - 445), I will set mu_hat explicitly. I set mu_hat = 1305 (representing 3 periods of demand) and sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent standard deviation observed since the demand regime shift (~65 units per week, scaled by sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity remains compromised: orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10 (939 units total) are confirmed lost. Sustained demand regime confirmed at ~435 units/week since P14.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is a women's lightweight jersey t-shirt. Current date is June 3, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a new sustained regime of approximately 435 units/week since Period 14 (following an April peak). Distribution integrity remains the primary concern: The current 'In-transit' figure of 1400 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Confirmed lost: P1 (356), P3 (212), P4 (304), P10 (67) = 939 units. Effective pipeline consists only of: P14 (270), P15 (175), and P16 (16). Total effective pipeline = 461 units. Period 16 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory and 435 demand, indicating significant stockouts. To recover, I set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the 430-440 demand level. I use 'explicit' for L to maintain a conservative buffer of 3 periods, given the high frequency of lost shipments and the 1-2 period arrival timing. These parameters (L=3, mu_hat for (1+3) periods) will force the OR engine to target a base stock of ~1700-1800 units; subtracting the 461 effective pipeline units should trigger a replenishment order of roughly 1300 units, which correctly ignores the 939-unit phantom inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/10. Demand context: A significant spike occurred in Period 17 (640 units), likely signaling the peak of early summer demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts. The last 4 periods average ~487 units/week, while the last 7 periods (since the late April shift) average ~463 units. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the recent spike. Pipeline integrity check: Total in-transit is 1563. Orders from P1 (356), P3 (212), P4 (304), and P10 (67) are confirmed lost (total 939 units). Effective pipeline is therefore 1563 - 939 = 624 units (consisting of orders from P14 and P17). Since the OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (1563) from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 939-unit phantom inventory. Required base stock: L=2, so (L+1)=3 periods of demand cover. Expected demand over 3 periods = 3 * 487.5 = 1462.5. To compensate for the 939 lost units being subtracted by the OR engine, I set mu_hat = 1462.5 + 939 = 2401.5. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - 1563) results in the correct physical coverage.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Demand spike confirmed at 640 units, indicating early summer peak for jersey t-shirts. Total lost shipments confirmed: P1, P3, P4, P10 (939 units).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' is in a high-demand summer regime. The most recent demand (P17: 640, P18: 419) averages approximately 530 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this higher mean (~480/week) compared to the long-term average. The supply chain is highly unstable with a binary lead time: orders either arrive in 1-2 periods or are lost entirely. Confirmed lost shipments include P1, P3, P4, and P10 (total 939 units). The current 'In-transit' of 2532 units includes these lost units. Subtracting the 939 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 1593 (consisting of P14, P17, and P18 orders). Since on-hand is 0 and demand is high, I will set L to 2 (promised) to trigger ordering, but use explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend's capped policy covers the (L+1) horizon (approx 3 * 500 = 1500 units) against the effective pipeline and potential volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed: P17 demand reached 640 units; current regime average is ~500 units/week. Lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10 = 939 units) are still in system 'In-transit' and must be manually netted out of planning.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24, following a summer demand peak (average demand since P11 is approximately 450 units/period, with a peak of 640 units in P17). Pipeline inventory remains a critical concern: the 'In-transit' figure of 1563 units includes 1006 units from defunct/lost orders (P1: 356, P3: 212, P4: 304, P10: 67, and P16: 67 units - wait, P16 was only 16 units, but P10 was 67. Let's re-verify: P1, P3, P4, P10 totals 939. P16 arrived in P17. P15 arrived in P17. P18 arrived in P19. Current pipeline is P19: 0 units ordered. The in-transit total 1563 is composed of P1 (356), P3 (212), P4 (304), P10 (67), and P17 (354) + 270 (P14) = 1563. P14 (270) and P17 (354) are the ONLY active orders (Total 624 units). P1, P3, P4, and P10 (939 units) are confirmed lost. I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to adjust the base stock to compensate for these phantom units in the OR engine's pipeline calculation. Targeted Base Stock = (L+1) * Expected Demand + safety stock. With L=2, and demand ~500, target base stock should be roughly 2000. To order enough to reach 2000 while the OR engine thinks pipeline is 1563 and on-hand is 530 (Total 2093), I must set an explicit mu_hat that results in an order. However, given 530 on hand and 624 truly arriving, we are relatively safe for the immediate 2 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 9 periods (P11-P19) to reflect the summer demand regime (~490/week).

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10) total 939 units; these must be subtracted from the 'In-transit' 1563 to find true active pipeline (624 units). Summer demand regime (P11-P19) average is 455 units/week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are in the peak summer season for jersey t-shirts. The demand history shows a regime shift at P11 (mid-April), with demand averaging approximately 440 units/week (range 301-640). The most recent demand was lower (301), but this is likely a single-period fluctuation rather than a trend downwards given the season. Pipeline management remains critical: the system shows 1,563 units 'In-transit', but 939 of these (from P1, P3, P4, P10) are confirmed lost shipments. The true active pipeline consists only of the P17 order (354 units, expected now since it's L=2 and P18/P19 arrived quickly) and any decision made this period. Lead times are highly variable, often 1-2 periods, so I will use a conservative L=2 but set \u03bc\u0302 explicitly to account for the lost stock. By setting \u03bc\u0302 to 1,320 (approx 440 units/week * 3), the OR engine will target a base stock around 1,500-1,600. Subtracting the internal 'In-transit' of 1,563 from this will result in a near-zero order, which is appropriate given the current on-hand (229) and the expected arrival of P17 (354 units), totaling ~583 units against a weekly need of ~440.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8th. Demand for 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' is entering a typical mid-summer slowdown, decreasing from a peak of 640/week (Period 17) to 232 in Period 21. The product is out-of-stock as of the end of Period 21. Pipeline integrity remains a major issue: 939 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10) are confirmed lost, leaving only the P17 order of 354 units as 'active' in-transit (1563 - 939 - 270 confirmed delivered P15 = 354). The P17 order is now overdue (ordered P17, now P22, promised L=2), suggesting lead time volatility or another lost shipment. I will set L to 3 to reflect this instability. Demand has shifted downwards; I will use the mean of the last 3 samples (~324 units/period) to forecast mu_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the summer drop while excluding the 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Weekly demand dropped from 15-period average of ~450 to ~260 (-42%) as summer peak subsides. Order from Period 17 (354 units) is now 3 periods overdue; supply chain instability persists.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15. Demand context: The summer peak for women's basic jersey t-shirts has clearly subsided. Observations from P20-P22 (301, 232, 238) confirm a new demand regime significantly lower than the ~450/week seen in early summer. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the average of 257 units/week. Supply Chain: Pipeline integrity remains a critical issue. The 'In-transit' figure of 1563 includes 939 units from P1, P3, P4, and P10 that are definitively lost. Additionally, the P17 order (354 units) is now 5 periods old (ordered June 3rd, currently July 15th) and must be considered lost as it is 3 periods past promised lead time. This leaves an active pipeline of only 270 units (1563 - 939 - 354 = 270). Since on-hand is 0 and the OR engine overestimates inventory due to the 'ghost' lost units, I must use explicit parameters to force an order. I set L=2 (promised) but use mu_hat based on the new regime (3 weeks * 257 = 771) and sigma_hat based on the variance in this recent segment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 confirmed: weekly demand dropped from ~450 to ~257 (-43%) following summer peak. Order from Period 17 (354 units) confirmed lost (missing 3 periods past promised lead time). Total lost units in pipeline: 1293 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status (Period 24 - 2019/07/22): Demand has shifted from a summer peak (~450 units/week) to a post-seasonal lower level. The average demand for the last four periods (Periods 20-23) is 245.75 units/week. Supply chain instability remains a major factor: the total 'In-transit' shown by the system (1563 units) is heavily distorted by lost shipments from P1 (356), P3 (212), P4 (304), P10 (67), and now P17 (354) \u2013 totaling 1293 lost units. The true active pipeline is only 270 units (1563 - 1293), representing no actual replenishment arriving since Period 19. On-hand inventory is 0. To prevent the OR backend from seeing massive 'phantom' inventory, I will use 'explicit' parameters. I estimate demand (mu_hat) over the (L+1) window (where L=2) based on the new regime of ~250 units/week, totaling 750 units. For sigma_hat, I use recent volatility (std dev of last 4 periods is ~38, so sqrt(3)*38 \u2248 66). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the binary outcome of the supply chain, but the 'mu_hat' field will be the primary driver for correct ordering given the inventory distortion.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 confirmed: weekly demand transition from summer peak (~450) to late-summer/fall baseline (~250). Total lost shipments in system 'In-transit' increased to 1293 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17); these must be manually excluded when planning as they will never arrive.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 25 (late July). Historical data and product description (Lightweight Jersey T-shirt) indicate a significant demand decline as the summer peak ends. Demand transitioned from ~450 units/week (P11-P19) to ~220 units/week starting at P21. The last four periods (P21-P24) show demand of 232, 238, 212, and 207, establishing a clear post-peak regime (average ~222). Supply chain integrity remains poor: shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P17 (354 units, ordered 8 periods ago) are confirmed lost. Total lost units in the 'In-transit' figure are 1293 (356+212+304+67+354). The system shows 'In-transit: 1563', meaning the ACTIVE pipeline is only 270 units (1563 - 1293), which is the order from P14. However, that P14 order is also now 11 periods old and must be considered lost as well. Therefore, the REAL active pipeline is 0 units and On-hand is 0. I will use 'explicit' methods to override the OR backend's inflated 'In-transit' view. L is set to 2 (promised), mu_hat is set to (1+L)*220 = 660, and sigma_hat is set to reflect the current regime's lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Order from Period 14 (270 units) is now 11 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total lost units in system pipeline: 1563 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Real active pipeline is currently 0.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5, 2019), the product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) has transitioned from its summer peak demand (~450 units/week) to a late-summer baseline. The demand for the last five periods (P21-P25) has averaged 208.6 units, showing a distinct drop compared to the June/July levels. The supply chain remains highly unreliable; the 'In-transit' count of 1563 units is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 14, and 17. These must be manually bypassed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the actual active pipeline is 0. With a promised lead time of 2 periods and the next demand resolution occurring after the decision, I must cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand. Using the recent 5-period average (approx 209 units) as the forecast, mu_hat is set to (1+2)*209 = 627 units. Because the backend uses a capped policy that subtracts pipeline inventory, and the pipeline is artificially inflated by lost units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure the calculated base stock is large enough to trigger an order despite the 'phantom' 1563 units in transit. Setting mu_hat to 2200 (~627 + 1563) effectively offsets the lost units and targets a base stock that will replenish the current 0-stock position.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand has stabilized at a late-summer baseline of ~210 units/week following the summer peak. Total phantom pipeline inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17) remains at 1563 units and must be manually netted out of ordering logic.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are in a late-summer/early-fall demand regime where weekly demand has stabilized significantly lower (~100-200 units/week) compared to the summer peak of ~450. Period 26 demand was 102. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. The 'In-transit' figure of 2249 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments: P1 (356), P3 (212), P4 (304), P10 (67), P14 (270), and P17 (354), totaling 1563 units. The remaining 686 units in transit are from the P26 order, which is the only active pipeline. Since on-hand is 0 and we are entering a lower demand season, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period average (~154 units/week) to avoid overstocking while holding costs are $1/unit. I will use L=3 to account for the frequent delays and the 'binary' nature of the supply chain, ensuring the OR backend targets enough stock for a 4-week window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~150-200 units/week starting Period 23 following the summer peak. Total lost shipments as of P27: 1563 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey t-shirt has continued to decline following the summer peak, with recent demand droping to approximately 100-120 units per week (the most recent two periods show 102 and 120). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend without over-reacting to single-period noise. Regarding the pipeline, the 'In-transit' figure of 2249 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' shipments. Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P17 (totaling 1563 units) are definitively lost. Additionally, the order from P26 (686 units) is still within a reasonable window for delivery given historical lead time variability (1-2 periods plus some delay). Subtracting the 1563 lost units from 2249 leaves 686 units as the 'real' active pipeline. Since the OR backend uses the total 'In-transit' figure (2249) to calculate the order size, and because my calculated base stock (at approx 150-200 demand) will be lower than the phantom pipeline, the engine will likely order 0 units which is correct given the current surplus and low demand. I will maintain L=2 as the planning horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a late-summer/early-fall trough of ~100-120 units/week (Periods 26-27). Total lost units in system pipeline remains 1563 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29 (late August 2019), the demand for this basic jersey T-shirt is in a late-summer trough, with the last three periods averaging 127 units. The system reports 2249 units in-transit. However, historical evidence confirms significant shipment losses. Lost orders include: P1 (356), P3 (212), P4 (304), P10 (67), P14 (270), and P17 (354), totaling 1563 units. Subtracting these from the reported 'In-transit' 2249 units leaves a real active pipeline of 686 units (the order placed in P26). With a current demand regime of ~130 units/week and a lead time of 2 periods, the 686 units in the pipeline are more than sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~390 units over the lead+review period (1+L=3). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current trough and L=2 as arrival efficiency has stabilized for recent successfully delivered orders. No new order is needed from the OR backend as on-hand (0) + active pipeline (686) > current base stock needs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~130 units/week (P26-P28) as summer demand concludes. Total lost units in system pipeline remains 1563 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/9/2. The product is a jersey basic t-shirt. Demand has stabilized into a post-summer trough, averaging approximately 130 units/week over the last 4 periods (P26-P29). The system shows 'In-transit' as 2249 units; however, historical analysis and carry-over insights confirm that orders from P1 (356), P3 (212), P4 (304), P10 (67), P14 (270), and P17 (354) are lost (total 1563 units). Additionally, the order from P18 (969) arrived in P19, but the 'In-transit' metric sometimes fails to clear correctly in this environment. The only truly active recent order is from P26 (686 units), which is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P26, expected P28 or P29). Given the history of binary lead times (1-2 periods or lost), I will set L to 3 to account for this uncertainty. mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the stabilized lower demand of ~130/week (total 520 for L+1). Providing an explicit sigma_hat allows the OR backend to maintain a buffer despite the supply volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a late-summer/early-fall trough of approximately 140 units per week (average of P26-P30 is 133). The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Specifically, the 'In-transit' figure of 2249 units is heavily inflated by six confirmed lost shipments: P1 (356), P3 (212), P4 (304), P10 (67), P14 (270), and P17 (354), totaling 1563 'phantom' units. Additionally, the P26 order (686 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P26, expected P28, currently P31 start with no arrival confirmed in P30 conclude). This suggests the P26 order may also be lost or severely delayed. To force an order despite the phantom pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1 with L=2) at the current regime of ~140, plus the 1563 units of lost pipeline that the OR engine incorrectly thinks will arrive, plus the 686 units of the overdue P26 order, totaling 2669. This ensures the base_stock (mu_hat + safety stock) exceeds the phantom pipeline (1563 + 686 = 2249), triggering a recovery order of ~500 units to reach the desired availability for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Supply chain collapse. Total lost units in system 'In-transit' = 1563 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Order from P26 (686 units) is 3 periods overdue and likely lost. Effective pipeline is 0 units against a system record of 2249.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' lightweight jersey t-shirt. Current date is mid-September, following a significant summer demand peak (where demand averaged ~450-500) and a late-summer slowdown. Demand has now stabilized at a low-season baseline of ~140 units/week (average of P26-P31). Pipeline integrity is severely compromised. System 'In-transit' shows 2702 units, but historical evidence confirms most are lost: P1(356), P3(212), P4(304), P10(67), P14(270), P17(354), and P26(686) are all significantly past the 2-period promised lead time with no delivery. Total phantom inventory = 2249 units. Real active pipeline = 2702 - 2249 = 453 units (the order from P31). With L=2, demand forecast is based on the recent N=6 stable period (~142 units/week), making mu_hat \u2248 426 for (L+1) periods. Since on-hand is 0 and the active pipeline (453) already covers the next 3 weeks of demand, I will set parameters to maintain this level without over-ordering against the system's incorrect high 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total confirmed lost shipments = 2249 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26). The P26 order (686 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Active pipeline as of P32 start is only P31 (453 units).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt has stabilized at a late-summer/early-fall trough of approximately 135-145 units per week (periods 29-32). The summer peak is long over. Supply chain stability remains poor with a high volume of lost shipments. The backend reports 2249 units 'In-transit', but history confirms that orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P26 (totaling exactly 2249 units) are significantly past their promised lead time and are lost. The arrival of the P31 order in Period 32 (1 period lead time) confirms that the system's actual lead time for successful deliveries remains short (1-2 periods), but the pipeline logic must be manually adjusted because it currently sees 2249 units that will never arrive. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite this 'phantom' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the target base stock level that covers the current demand regime (~140 units/week) for (L+1) periods, while being high enough to overcome the backend's subtraction of the 2249 'In-transit' units. Target Base Stock = (1+2)*140 + z*sigma \u2248 600. To force an order of ~140 units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 2249 + 140 + 318 = 2707.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey t-shirt has stabilized at a late-summer/early-fall trough of approx 140 units per week (average of P29-P33 is 141.6). We are currently in P34 (late September). The system reports an 'In-transit' of 2395 units, but history confirms that orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P26 (totaling 2249 units) are lost. These shipments have exceeded their promised lead time (L=2) by 6 to 32 periods. Therefore, we must manually subtract these phantom units from the planning logic to ensure the backend actually orders. Subtracting 2249 from 2395 leaves 146 units as the true active pipeline (the order from P33). We have 171 on-hand. With demand around 140/week, our target base stock for L+1=3 periods should be roughly 420-450 units. Currently, on-hand (171) + active pipeline (146) = 317 units. To trigger the OR engine despite the 2249 'ghost' units, I am using explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat values calculated by ignoring the lost shipments. I am setting L=2 (promised) to maintain a standard planning horizon, while forecasting demand at 145 units/week. Mu_hat is set to (1+L)*145 = 435. Sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+L)*std_dev (approx 10 units for this stable regime), ensuring a high service level without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Supply chain remains unstable but binary; P31 arrived in 1 period, while P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P26 are confirmed lost (total 2249 phantom units). Demand is stable at ~140-145 units/week.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. This SKU (Womens Jersey Basic T-shirt) has transitioned from its summer peak (avg ~450) to a stable fall baseline. Over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), demand has stabilized at an average of 139 units/week (range 102-158). Lead time remains binary: either 1-2 periods or lost. Specifically, order P31 arrived in 1 period, while the P33 order (146 units) is still in its arrival window. The system 'In-transit' figure of 2395 is heavily inflated by 2249 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26). Subtracting these, the true active pipeline is only 146 units (from P33). To ensure the OR engine orders correctly despite this phantom pipeline, I will use 'explicit' values. I set mu_hat based on the stable recent demand of ~140 units/week for (L+1)=3 periods (140 * 3 = 420). I set L=2 as the planning horizon. Since on-hand (65) + active pipeline (146) = 211, and the target base stock (mu + safety stock) is roughly 520, the OR engine needs to order ~300 units. To trigger this despite the 2395 'In-transit' record, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that covers both the demand and the phantom inventory. Calculation: Target Base Stock (520) + Phantom units (2249) = 2769. I will set mu_hat to 2769 to ensure an order is placed to reach the actual safety level.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36, demand for the Tilly T-shirt has stabilized at a late-fall trough, with the most recent four periods averaging approximately 120 units/week (147, 106, 85). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a confirmed pattern of lost shipments. The 'In-transit' level of 2732 units is largely composed of phantom inventory: P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P26 are confirmed lost (totaling 2249 units). Subtracting these from the system's stock shows the true active pipeline is only 483 units (P33: 146 units, P35: 337 units). With on-hand inventory at 0, the active pipeline must cover demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1). I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 450 (approx 150 units/week * 3) to ensure the OR engine triggers a sufficient order to bridge the gap created by lost shipments and maintain stock for the current demand regime. I am setting L to 2 (promised) but will rely on the explicit mu_hat to account for the pipeline discrepancy.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Confirmed total lost shipments in system 'In-transit' is 2249 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26). Active pipeline consists only of P33 (146) and P35 (337). Demand regime remains stable at ~120-150 units/week.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' has settled into a late-autumn/early-winter baseline. The last 10 periods (P27-P36) show an average demand of approximately 126 units/week, with the most recent 2 weeks dropping below 100 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this stable, lower demand regime. The supply chain has a history of severe instability with 2,249 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26). Since these phantom units remain in the system 'In-transit' count, I must use 'explicit' parameters to force the OR backend to ignore them. As of Period 37 start, on-hand is 399 and the actual active pipeline is 0 (P33 and P35 arrived in P36). The system In-transit of 2249 consists entirely of lost shipments. To prevent the capped policy from suppressing new orders based on this phantom inventory, I set L=1 (reflecting the binary fast-arrival or lost nature) and a mu_hat/sigma_hat that targets a baseline safety stock around 300-400 units, ensuring we maintain availability without over-ordering for a cooling season.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand stabilized at late-autumn trough of ~120-130 units/week. Active pipeline is empty; all 2249 units in system 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a seasonal trough. Demand has stabilized at approximately 100-110 units per week over the last 3 periods (P35-P37). The system 'In-transit' figure of 2249 is entirely composed of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26) confirmed in previous carry-overs. The current on-hand inventory is 290 units, which covers approximately 2.5-3 weeks of the current demand regime. Lead times remain binary (either 1-2 periods or lost), with recent arrivals at 3 periods (P33) and 1 period (P35). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 2249 units of 'phantom' pipeline, I set \u03bc\u0302 explicitly. Using a 3-week horizon (L+1=3) and a demand forecast of ~120 units/week (allowing for slight volatility above the 100 average), \u03bc\u0302 is set to 360. \u03c3\u0302 is set to 40 to account for low recent volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for this lightweight jersey t-shirt has transitioned into a late-autumn trough, averaging approximately 90 units per week over the last three periods (P36: 84, P37: 109, P38: 78). Supply chain instability remains the primary challenge; 2249 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26). The real active pipeline is currently 0. With On-hand inventory at 212 units and demand at ~90 units/week, current stock covers more than 2 periods (L+1). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 2249 phantom units and refusing to order when real stock runs low, I maintain 'explicit' parameters. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand at the current average (3 * 90 = 270) and set sigma_hat to reflect moderate volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation remains grounded in real demand while accounting for the high volume of lost shipments in the system's pipeline records.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand trough confirmed at ~90 units/week for late autumn. Total phantom pipeline remains 2249 units; real active pipeline is 0.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Women's Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' is currently in a late-autumn trough, with the last 5 periods showing a mean of approximately 87 units/week (61, 78, 109, 84, 85). The system shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 2249 units, but historical evidence confirms these are phantom units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26) that will never arrive. As of Period 40, the real active pipeline is 0. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 151 units. Given the lead time is approximately 2 periods and current demand is ~90 units/week, we have roughly 1.7 weeks of coverage. To prevent a stockout while accounting for the phantom pipeline that the OR engine cannot see, I must use 'explicit' parameters. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period demand average (approx 90 units/week) for (L+1) periods. Since L=2, mu_hat = (2+1)*90 = 270. With 151 on-hand and 0 real in-transit, the OR engine will calculate (270 - (151 + 2249)) which would result in no order. To bypass this and ensure the system maintains stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the 2249 phantom units. Target stock (base stock) should be around 350-400 to cover 3-4 weeks. To force a base stock that overcomes the 2249 units and the 151 on-hand, the mu_hat needs to be set explicitly extremely high or I must accept no order this period and wait for on-hand to deplete further, but with L=2, that is risky. Actually, I will set mu_hat to 2600 to trigger an order of approximately 200 units (2600 - 2249 - 151 = 200).

Carry-over insight: Demand trough confirmed: late Oct to early Nov demand characterizes a stable low-regime of ~90 units/week. Real pipeline remains 0 as 2249 units are confirmed lost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a late-autumn trough, with the last 5 periods (P36-P40) averaging 80.2 units/week (84, 109, 78, 61, 69). The system shows 2475 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms massive losses: P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P26 are all confirmed lost, totaling 2249 units. Subtracting these from the system's 2475 leaves an active pipeline of 226 units (the order placed in P40). With 82 units on-hand and 226 units in-transit, the real inventory position is 308. Using L=2 and a recent demand average of ~80 units, the required base stock is roughly (2+1)*80 = 240 units. Since 308 > 240, no new order is strictly necessary, but I will set parameters to maintain this low-demand baseline. I'm using N=5 for demand to capture the most recent trough accurately.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Active pipeline confirmed at 226 units (P40 order). Cumulative lost shipments remain at 2249 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26). Demand regime stable at ~80 units/week since P36.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a late-autumn low, with an average of approximately 78 units/week over the last 5 periods (P37-P41). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a binary outcome: shipments either arrive within 1-2 periods or are lost entirely. Currently, the system shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 2475 units, but 2249 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26). The only active order in the pipeline is from P40 (226 units), which is expected to arrive soon. To account for the 'phantom' inventory while utilizing the OR backend's base-stock logic, I will use 'explicit' values. I set L=2 (promised). For mu_hat, I use the recent low-demand regime (avg ~78) multiplied by (1+L), totaling 234. For sigma_hat, I use a value reflecting recent demand volatility (std ~15) multiplied by sqrt(1+L), totaling approx 26. This allows the backend to target a service level while ignoring the faulty 'In-transit' data that would otherwise prevent ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand regime for late autumn confirmed at ~75-80 units/week. Real pipeline reconciled: 2249 units in system 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26); only P40 (226 units) is active.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a late-autumn/early-winter demand trough. Recent demand (P36-P42) averages ~82 units/week. Historically, Jan/Feb demand was ~160-200, suggesting a potential floor or upcoming slight increase as we move toward the new year. Supply chain integrity remains the primary concern: the system shows 2,475 units in-transit, but 2,249 of these (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26) are confirmed lost. The only potentially active shipment is P40 (226 units), which is now overdue (ordered P40, promised L=2, now P43 start with no arrival). Following the 'binary' lead time pattern observed (either 1-2 periods or lost), the P40 order is likely lost as well. Therefore, real on-hand is 0 and real pipeline is 0. To trigger an order that overrides the phantom 2,475 units in-transit, I set mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom pipeline plus desired safety stock. Target stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + 1) at ~85 units/week is ~255 units; to force an order, mu_hat must be set above 2475. I will use 2750 to ensure the backend places an order to refill the depleted stock for the upcoming period.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Order from Period 40 (226 units) follows the loss pattern (3 periods elapsed with no arrival). Cumulative confirmed lost shipments: 2475 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26, P40). Real pipeline is 0.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/9. Demand has stabilized at a late-autumn/early-winter trough, averaging approximately 75 units/week over the last 8 periods (P36-P43: 84, 109, 78, 61, 69, 67, 109, 61). Supply chain instability continues: the P40 order arrived in 3 periods (Period 43 conclude), confirming that while many shipments are lost, surviving ones take 1-3 periods. The total 'In-transit' quantity is 2553 units, but 2475 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26, P40). The real active pipeline consists only of the P43 order (304 units). My goal is to maintain stock for the current low-demand regime while accounting for the high lead-time variance. I will set L to 3 to reflect the recent successful delivery time and mu_hat based on the recent 8-period demand average (~75/week).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Order from P40 (226 units) arrived in 3 periods. Total cumulative lost shipments remains at 2475 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26, P40). Real active pipeline as of P44 is only the P43 order (304 units). Demand regime remains stable at ~75-80 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. Demand has transitioned into a stable late-autumn/early-winter trough, averaging approximately 70 units/week over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a binary outcome pattern: orders either arrive in 1-3 periods or are lost entirely. Currently, the system shows 2553 units 'In-transit'. However, based on history, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P26 (totaling 2249 units) are confirmed lost. Subtracting these from the total 2553 leaves an active pipeline of 304 units (the order placed in P43). With 110 units on-hand and 304 in active transit, the total effective inventory is 414 units. Given the low demand regime (~70 units/week), this is sufficient to cover approximately 6 weeks of demand, well beyond the L+1 window. Therefore, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand environment, while L is set to 'calculate' to account for the actual delivery times (1-3 periods) of the non-lost shipments.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). We are in a stable winter demand trough for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirts', with demand averaging ~62 units/week over the last 5 periods. Supply chain reliability has slightly improved with P40 arriving in 3 periods and P43 arriving in 2, but the system still tracks 2,249 units in 'In-transit' that are definitively lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26). On-hand inventory is currently 350 units, which covers approximately 5-6 weeks of current demand at \u03bc\u224862. The backend OR engine uses a base-stock policy: order = max(0, base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Since the recorded pipeline (2249) vastly exceeds any reasonable base stock for this demand level, the engine will never order. To force a replenishment calculation, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and setting mu_hat to a value that nets out the phantom inventory: Target mu_hat = (Desired Base Stock) + (Phantom Units). Desired base stock for L=2 and \u03bc=62 is approximately 186. 186 + 2249 = 2435. This ensures the OR logic sees a 'requirement' that offsets the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Consistent demand trough confirmed at ~60-65 units/week since P43. Real pipeline check: All 2249 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost; zero active units are in transit as of P46 start.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. Demand for women's jersey t-shirts has reached a stable late-autumn/winter trough, averaging approximately 70 units/week over the last five periods (P42-P46). The supply chain remains unreliable: 2249 units in the system 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P26), while recent orders P40 and P43 arrived in 3 and 2 periods respectively. On-hand inventory is 258 units, which, at the current demand rate of ~70 units/week, covers the next ~3.7 periods. Since the promised lead time is 2, the current inventory is sufficient to cover the 3-period risk window (L+1). No new order is required this period. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (mu_hat based on recent 5 periods) and the 'explicit' lead time L=2 to match the promised duration, though actual delivery remains binary (on-time/lost).
