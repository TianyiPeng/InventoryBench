Historical data shows demand has fluctuated significantly: 59, 14, 28, 85, 85 (average ~54). The most recent two periods show a high plateau of 85 units each. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 periods) because an order placed now (L=2) won't arrive until the start of Period 4 decision phase.

Recent actual demand (P1-P4) averages 93.75 (91, 110, 111, 63). P4 dipped to 63, but given the stock-out in P3, this might reflect constrained demand or a slight variance.

The mean demand for this 'high' regime is approximately 96 units/period. The outlier in P4 (63) might be due to stock unavailability or localized fluctuations. c) Lead Time/Orders: The P1 order (210 units) is now 6 periods overdue and definitively lost. The P2 order arrived in 2 periods (P4). The P3 order (50 units) is 4 periods old and has not arrived; it is likely lost. The P4 order (120 units) is 3 periods old and has not arrived; it might be delayed or lost. Surprisingly, the P5 order (130 units) arrived in only 1 period (in P6), suggesting lead times are volatile but currently short. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 21. In-transit is 480 (P1: 210, P3: 50, P4: 120, P6: 100). Subtracting the definitely/likely lost orders (P1, P3, P4 = 380 units), the reliable pipeline is just the P6 order (100 units). e) Decision: Target stock is calculated for (L+1) periods. With lead time appearing to stabilize around 1-2 periods, I will plan for 3 periods of demand coverage (approx 300 units). Current reliable inventory (On-hand 21 + Pipeline P6 100) = 121 units.

  "rationale": "The SKU 'Angela hipster' (cotton jersey briefs) is a basic staple with seasonal demand fluctuations. Current date is August 5, 2019.

(b) Demand Analysis: Demand has decreased from a May/June peak (~140-160) to a more stable summer regime of ~65-75 units per period (P21-P25 average = 67). (c) Lead Time & Pipeline: Total visible In-transit is 1210 units. However, based on history, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, and P17 are confirmed lost or severely delayed (totaling 1030 units: 210+50+120+150+100+100+300). Effective Pipeline = 1210 - 1030 = 180 units (from P19, P22, P23, P25 orders - wait, checking history... Actually, looking at the history of orders and arrivals, the only active order not yet arrived after P18 is P19(100)??? No, P19(100) hasn't arrived. P22(100) arrived in P23. P25(80) is in transit. Let's recalculate total 'Real' in-transit: P19(100) + P25(80) = 180. The 1210 nominal in-transit includes the 1030 units clearly lost or delayed over 5+ periods. (d) Inventory & Order Logic: On-hand is 0. Expected demand for P26-P28 (L+1) is ~210 units. Effective pipeline (180) plus expected arrivals is slightly short of the required safety stock + demand coverage. I will order 100 units to bridge the gap and prepare for the late-August transition.",

Recent demand (P37-P38) has been averaging around 35 units, showing a slight uptick from the late September/early October lows. Lead times remain unstable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), with a significant cumulative loss of 1495 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P22, P26, and now P34 are all considered lost/severely delayed). The visible In-transit of 1345 units is therefore treated as entirely unreliable or 'phantom' stock. My goal is to maintain a safety stock covering ~2 periods of demand (approx 70 units). On-hand inventory is 40.

In-transit inventory is listed as 1395, but based on carry-over insights and history, 1495 units are confirmed lost or severely delayed (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P22, P26, and likely P34). This means the effective pipeline is zero or near-zero for orders placed before P38. My inventory position is On-hand: 29. Effective pipeline consists of: Order P38 (50 units, placed 2 periods ago, expected immediately) and Order P39 (50 units, placed 1 period ago). Total effective inventory = 29 + 50 + 50 = 129 units. At a forecast of ~30 units/period, 129 units covers 4.3 periods of demand. Given the severe supply chain unreliability (many lost orders), a buffer is necessary. However, I have enough for the next 2-3 periods already coming. I will place a moderate order of 50 to maintain this rolling 4-period safety buffer.",
