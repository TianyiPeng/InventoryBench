Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a women's pyjama bottom. Historical demand for the last five weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a mean of 60.0 units/week (47, 63, 69, 60, 61) with a standard deviation of approximately 8.1 units. The date is early February, post-holiday season, and demand appears relatively stable across the provided history. There is no lead time history yet, so I will rely on the promised lead time (L=2). The target service level reflected by the OR backend (Profit / (Profit + Holding)) is 0.5, but the backend also applies a cap at 0.95. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock that covers demand across the review period plus the lead time (1+L = 3 periods). I will use the recent N (N=5) to calculate mu and sigma to capture this baseline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is a lightweight pyjama bottom, typically a stable item but potentially influenced by early spring trends. Initial demand in P1 was 41, slightly lower than the January/early February historical average (approx. 60). We have 0 on-hand inventory due to starting at 0 and P1 order (74 units) being in-transit. The promised lead time is 2, so the P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible P4). For Period 2, I need to set parameters based on the observed history (n=5 + P1). Average demand across all 6 samples is 57.3. Given the stockout in P1 and the lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage needed: P2, P3, P4), I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the broader historical context while the system stabilizes from the initial stockout.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a Women's Nightwear item (Pyjama bottoms). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals for Period 1 and Period 2 are still in transit due to the promised lead time of 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (74 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 3 resolution phase, becoming visible in the Period 3 conclude message. The order placed in Period 2 (75 units) is expected to arrive in Period 4. Historical demand samples (47, 63, 69, 60, 61) and recent game history (41, 50) show relatively stable demand with a mean around 56 units. I will use the last 5 samples (P2, P1, and the three most recent historical samples) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the recent demand is slightly lower than the early Jan peak. Lead time is kept at the default (2), as there is no evidence yet of a deviation from the promised timing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is lightweight pyjama bottoms. There is a stockout (on-hand: 0) with lost sales in all past periods because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) should have arrived during Period 3 (arrival resolution) and been visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This indicates the actual lead time is likely at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Historical demand (recent 5 weeks: 47, 63, 69, 60, 61) plus game history demand (41, 50, 62) shows a stable average around 57 units per week. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay and provide more pipeline coverage. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the full breadth of available samples (5 pre-game + 3 game).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 11, 2019. The product is lightweight pyjama bottoms. Historical and recent demand samples (47, 63, 69, 60, 61, 41, 50, 62, 60) show a stable pattern with an average of approximately 57 units per period. The first shipment from Period 1 (74 units) is late (promised lead time 2, now at end of Period 4). However, the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (lead_time 2) at the start of Period 4. This suggests the Period 1 order might be lost or specifically delayed, while the system lead time remains 2. On-hand is low (15) while in-transit is 152 (comprising the missing Period 1 order of 74, and orders from Period 3 and 4). I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they capture the consistent demand level around 55-60. I keep L at default (2) because the Period 2 arrival confirms the promised lead time is still operative.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a lightweight pyjama bottom. Historical demand for the last 10 weeks (5 pre-game + 5 in-game) shows a consistent range of 41-69 units (mean ~58). The promised lead time is 2 periods. We have observed one arrival (ordered P2, arrived P4, L=2). However, the order from P1 (74 units) has NOT arrived as of P5 conclude, which is 4 periods later; this strongly suggests the P1 shipment is lost. The order from P3 (20 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5's resolution (visible next period), and P4's order (58 units) in Period 6's resolution. Current on-hand is 0. With total in-transit at 152 (P1:74, P3:20, P4:58), but P1 likely lost, functional pipeline is 78. We need to maintain a base stock covering (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~174 units). I will use the promised lead time L=2 and recent demand (N=5) to stabilize the forecast, as demand has been stable but we are stock-out due to the missing P1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (74 units) likely lost: 4 periods elapsed with no arrival message.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU is a lightweight pyjama bottom. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has been relatively stable, averaging around 57 units per week. Recent demand in Period 6 dropped to 33, but given the seasonal nature of 'lightweight' pajamas entering spring (late March), demand should remain steady or increase slightly. Inventory state: On-hand is 0. Pipeline (In-transit) is 160 units. However, looking at history: P1 order (74 units) is now 6 periods late and is almost certainly lost. P2 order arrived in P4 (LT=2). P3 order (20 units) was placed in P3 and should have arrived in P5 (LT=2) but hasn't appeared yet (missing for 2 periods past promised). P4 order (58 units) is due P6 (missing for 1 period). P6 order (8 units) is due P8. The OR engine calculates base stock using mu_hat and sigma_hat, then subtracts pipeline. If I leave the pipeline at 160, it won't order because it thinks we're overstocked. To force an order to cover the likely lost/delayed units and current demand, I must set mu_hat explicitly high or L explicitly high. Given the backlog of stockouts (Ending OH = 0 for most periods), I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~60/wk) plus the missing inventory. mu_hat target = (L+1)*60 + (74 units lost). With L=2, mu_hat = 3*60 + 74 = 254.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (74 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed). P3 order (20 units) overdue (4 periods elapsed, promised 2).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019-04-01). Analysis of the supply chain shows significant disruptions: the Period 1 order (74 units) is lost, and the Period 3 order (20 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting it is also lost. The only successful arrival was the Period 2 order (lead time = 2). Current in-transit inventory is 254 (Sum of P3: 20, P4: 58, P6: 8, P7: 94). If P3 and P4 are lost, actual reliable pipeline inventory is likely significantly lower. Demand remains consistent, averaging 50.25 units over the last 8 weeks (including pre-game samples). Given the frequent stockouts caused by lost shipments, I will set L to 3 to simulate a longer replenishment cycle and use a conservative N=5 for demand to capture recent lower volume (ave ~44), while maintaining a slightly higher volatility estimate via 'default' to ensure the base stock is robust against further losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: P3 order (20 units) and P4 order (58 units) likely lost or severely delayed (5 and 4 periods elapsed respectively). Supply chain reliability is low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Reviewing history: P1 order (74), P3 order (20), and P4 order (58) are missing and highly likely lost. The total lost units equal 152. However, the system reports 'In-transit: 152 units', which perfectly matches these three lost orders. This confirms that these units reside in a 'stuck' pipeline and will never arrive, but the OR backend still calculates 'inventory position = on-hand + in-transit'. Because on-hand is 53 and in-transit is 152, the backend thinks we have 205 units, significantly overestimating our coverage. To force the OR backend to place a new order despite this 'ghost' inventory, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since historical mean demand is ~54, and promised L is 2, the desired base stock should be (L+1)*demand + safety. Given the 152 unit offset, I will set mu_hat to 350 to ensure (mu_hat - 152) provides sufficient stock for the next 3 periods (~162 units). Demand remains stable near the long-term mean of 54.

Carry-over insight: System 'In-transit' count (152) consists entirely of lost orders from periods 1, 3, and 4. This persistent pipeline inflation prevents the OR engine from ordering unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset the 152-unit error.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the in-transit inventory is 286 units. Based on historical data, shipments from P1 (74), P3 (20), and P4 (58) are significantly past their 2-period lead time and are confirmed lost (totaling 152 lost units). The remaining 134 units in-transit are from the P9 order, which is still within its promised lead time. The OR engine calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the backend incorrectly includes the 152 lost units in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, it will severely under-order unless we compensate. To force the backend to ignore these ghost units, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. Demand for the last 5 weeks has stabilized around 44 units (mean of P5-P9: 53, 33, 43, 49, 43). With L=2, the base forecast for (1+L) periods is 3 * 44 = 132. Adding the 152 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 284. This ensures the engine maintains a safety stock while accounting for the lost pipeline data error.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation confirmed: 152 units (P1: 74, P3: 20, P4: 58) are lost/unreliable and must be offset in mu_hat to allow the OR engine to order.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019-04-22), the 'In-transit' count of 152 is comprised entirely of units ordered in Periods 1 (74), 3 (20), and 4 (58) which are now between 7 and 10 periods old, confirming they are lost. The OR engine's formula for ordering is 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)'. With a pipeline_inventory of 152 and current demand averaging ~51 units/period, the engine will not order unless mu_hat is manually inflated to cover this 152-unit error. Demand since mid-February has stabilized around a mean of 50.8 units (last 10 periods). I will set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat using the explicit method to (1+L)*50.8 + 152 = 304.4. This ensures the base_stock calculation is high enough to offset the ghost inventory and maintain actual stock. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture recent demand volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a lightweight pajama bottom, typically seeing stable demand in spring. Historical demand (recent mean ~43 over last 5 periods) is much lower than the initial weeks. The major issue is the 'In-transit' count of 203. Analyzing history: Orders from P1 (74), P3 (20), and P4 (58) are still 'In-transit' after 11, 9, and 8 periods respectively, confirming they are lost. This creates 152 'phantom' units. Additionally, the P11 order (51 units) is currently in a valid lead-time window. The OR backend equation is: order = base_stock - (On-Hand + In-Transit). Total In-Transit (203) + On-Hand (63) = 266 units. With a target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of demand) being roughly 130-150 units, the OR engine will never order while the 152 phantom units exist in the pipeline. To force an order, I must set mu_hat (explicitly) to include the required demand PLUS the 152 phantom units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock (3 * 45 = 135) + Phantom Units (152) = 287. I will set mu_hat to 287 to ensure the engine targets a real inventory level of ~135 units. Lead time is kept at 2 as recent successful deliveries (P9, P7, P6) had LT 1 or 2.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 12, the pipeline contains 152 phantom units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4) that have not arrived after 8+ periods. These must be manually offset in mu_hat to allow new orders.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Alex Trs (J)', lightweight pajama bottoms. Demand is stable, but significantly lower than early samples, averaging ~42 units over the last 5 periods. The critical issue remains supply chain reliability: 152 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are definitively lost (observed 12, 10, and 9 periods ago respectively, versus a 2-period promised lead time). Current 'In-transit' = 224 consists of these 152 lost units plus P11 (51) and P12 (21). The OR backend uses 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)'. Because pipeline_inventory (224) incorrectly includes the 152 lost units, I must inflate mu_hat (the target inventory level) to compensate for this phantom 152-unit inventory. Target inventory for (L+1=3) periods of demand at 42 units/period is ~126. To trigger an order despite the 224 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Target + Phantom Units) = 126 + 152 = 278. I will use 'explicit' to ensure the OR engine maintains enough stock for actual demand while ignoring the lost shipments that will never arrive.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Demand for women's pyjama bottoms has stabilized at a lower level compared to early year peaks, with the last 5 periods (P9-P13) averaging 42 units/period. The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' figure of 210 units. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, the following units are identified as lost: P1 (74), P3 (20), and P4 (58), totaling 152 phantom units. The remaining 58 units in-transit are legitimate shipments from P12 (21) and P13 (37). The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent ordering unless we offset the 152 lost units. To ensure an order is placed to meet future demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand for the review + lead time (L+1=3) is 42 * 3 = 126. To offset the 152 phantom units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 126 + 152 = 278. Lead time (L) is set to 2 based on the most recent arrival (P11 arrived in P13). Sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current low volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '536139010' (Women's Pyjama bottoms) shows a steady demand regime with a slight increase in Period 14 (69 units). The primary operational challenge is a persistent 152-unit 'phantom' pipeline inventory caused by lost orders from Period 1 (74), Period 3 (20), and Period 4 (58). Current In-transit is 229, which consists of these 152 lost units plus the orders from Period 13 (37) and Period 14 (40). On-hand is currently 0, and the Period 13 order (37 units) is expected to arrive this period (P15) given the observed lead time of 2 periods. To ensure the OR engine triggers an order, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset for the 152 phantom units. With L=2 and average demand ~45-50, expected\u9700\u6c42 is ~150. Adding the 152-unit offset brings the target mu_hat to approximately 300. This compensates for the pipeline error and allows for a new order of ~40-50 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, there is no inventory on-hand and 302 units are listed as in-transit. Based on historical data, 152 of these units are confirmed lost (Period 1: 74, Period 3: 20, Period 4: 58). Additionally, the order from Period 13 (37 units) is now at its promised lead time (L=2) but has not arrived, and the orders from Period 14 (40 units) and Period 15 (73 units) are still within the standard window. The OR engine uses the 'capped policy' (base_stock - pipeline), meaning the presence of 152 'phantom' units in the pipeline prevents it from placing sufficient new orders. To fix this, I must explicitly set mu_hat to include the expected demand for the (L+1) period window AND an offset for the lost units. Average demand is ~48 units/week. Target demand for L=2 (3 periods) is 144 units. By setting mu_hat to 296 (144 target + 152 offset), the OR engine will perceive a need for stock despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to cover the standard deviation of recent demand (~11.6 over 3 periods).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a nightwear product with fairly stable demand. The primary issue is a high number of 'phantom' units in the pipeline. We have confirmed 152 lost units (from P1, P3, and P4) that will never arrive but remain in the 'In-transit' count (currently 302). The remaining 150 units in transit consist of orders from P13 (37), P14 (40), and P15 (73). Orders from P13 and P14 are now at L=3 and L=4 respectively, meaning they are likely delayed or lost, though not yet fully written off by previous logic. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed sales for two consecutive periods (P15, P16), we must force the OR engine to order. The OR logic is: order = base_stock - (In-transit). With 302 in-transit, we must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this offset. Average weekly demand is ~50. Expected demand for lead time L=2 (3 periods total) is ~150. To generate an order that covers our needs plus the 152 lost units, mu_hat must be ~302 + 150. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 450 to ensure we trigger an order of approximately 100-150 units to replenish stock despite the pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation persists: 152 units from P1, P3, P4 are confirmed lost. Additionally, P13 (37 units) and P14 (40 units) are now overdue at L=4 and L=3 respectively. Current In-transit (302) is at least 50% phantom stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is lightweight pajama bottoms. Demand is stable, with the last 5 samples averaging 46.6 units (P13-P17: 40, 69, 55, 45, 38). Current on-hand is 35. The 'In-transit' figure of 377 is heavily compromised by 'phantom' stock\u2014units that are either lost or severely delayed, which prevents the OR engine from ordering more. Breakdown of the 377 units: P1 (74), P3 (20), P4 (58) are definitively lost (14+ periods old). P13 (37) and P14 (40) are also likely lost or stuck (5 and 4 periods ago with L=2). The only valid in-transit order is P17 (148 units). Total phantom stock is approximately 229 units (74+20+58+37+40). To override the pipeline inflation and ensure the base stock calculation exceeds (In-transit - Phantom), I must use an explicit mu_hat. Targeting coverage for the next 3 periods (L+1) at a mean of ~47/week requires ~141 units plus a safety buffer. However, because the backend subtracts the full 377 in-transit from the base stock, mu_hat must be set to at least 377 + 141 = 518 to trigger any order. I will set mu_hat to 550 to account for demand and safety stock while forcing an order through the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 18, phantom in-transit inventory has increased to 229 units (P1: 74, P3: 20, P4: 58, P13: 37, P14: 40) due to supply chain failures; mu_hat must be artificially inflated to offset this 229-unit error.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. As of Period 19, the 'In-transit' quantity of 515 units contains significant 'phantom stock' from lost or severely delayed orders. Specifically, orders from P1 (74), P3 (20), P4 (58), P13 (37), and P14 (40) total 229 units that are effectively lost (overdue by 5+ periods). Furthermore, orders from P17 (148) and P18 (138) are still within or just past the promised lead time of 2 periods and are not yet confirmed lost. Currently, On-hand is 0. To trigger the OR backend to place an order despite the 515 units in the pipeline, I must set mu_hat (target inventory) to exceed this pipeline value. Demand for women's pyjama bottoms is stable around 40-50 units/week. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 640. This value accounts for desired inventory (approx. 125 units for 3 periods of demand) plus the 515 phantom/in-transit units. This forces the engine to recognize a deficit and place an order to replenish the zero on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 19, confirmed phantom in-transit inventory remains at 229 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Total pipeline of 515 includes 286 units from P17 and P18 which are currently overdue or pending; if these do not arrive by Period 21, the phantom count will increase to 515.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. As of Period 20, the 'In-transit' quantity of 502 units contains massive amounts of 'phantom stock'. These are units the OR backend thinks are coming, but are actually lost or severely delayed. Specifically: P1 (74), P3 (20), P4 (58), P13 (37), P14 (40), and P17 (148) are all overdue. P17 was ordered 3 periods ago with a promised lead time of 2 and has not arrived. This brings the total confirmed phantom inventory to 377 units (74+20+58+37+40+148). The OR engine uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders. With an on-hand of 105 and a fake pipeline of 502, the engine will never order unless we offset the 377 units. Demand is relatively stable around 43 units/period (mean of last 10 samples is 43.1). Target base stock for (L+1=3) periods should be ~130 units. To force an order and maintain service levels, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Phantom stock). 130 + 377 = 507. I will use 'explicit' to ensure the order is placed despite the inventory data errors.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 20, phantom in-transit inventory has increased to 377 units (P1: 74, P3: 20, P4: 58, P13: 37, P14: 40, P17: 148) due to persistent supply chain failure; mu_hat must be inflated by 377 to offset this pipeline error.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show severe unreliability and high loss rates. As of Period 21, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 502 units is largely composed of phantom (lost/overdue) inventory. Using the history and Carry-Over Insights, I calculate the phantom units as follows: P1 (74), P3 (20), P4 (58), P13 (37), P14 (40), and now P17 (148 - 4 periods elapsed, promised 2). This brings the total confirmed phantom inventory to 377 units. The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from its calculated base stock; if I don't offset these 377 phantom units, the engine will believe we have 502 units coming and will stop ordering, leading to stockouts. Current demand (mu_hat) is averaging roughly 40 units per period. For L=2, the base stock targets (L+1) periods of demand, roughly 120 units. To force an order while the pipeline is incorrectly inflated by 377 units, I must set mu_hat explicitly to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Units) = (120 + 377) = 497. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to perform this manual compensation and 'recent_N' for sigma to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 21, phantom in-transit inventory remains at 377 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17). The total pipeline of 502 includes 125 units from P19 which are still within a reasonable window; however, if P19 does not conclude by Period 22, the phantom count will rise to 502.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22, the supply chain remains unreliable. The total In-transit pipeline of 502 units is composed of several orders that are now confirmed or likely lost. Specifically, orders from P1 (74), P3 (20), P4 (58), P13 (37), P14 (40), and P17 (148) are all significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods, totaling 377 units of phantom inventory. Additionally, the order from P19 (125 units) is now at L=3, which is also past the promised lead time. Following the conservative logic of the carry-over insights, if an order does not arrive within 3 periods, it is effectively lost for planning. Thus, all 502 units in the pipeline are now considered phantom inventory. The OR backend uses the formula 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. To force the engine to place an order when the pipeline is filled with 502 units of phantom stock, mu_hat must be set to at least 502 + (Expected Demand * (L+1)). Average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is approx 29.2 units/period. For a look-ahead of L+1=3, we expect ~88 units. Total mu_hat = 502 + 88 = 590. This ensures the engine ignores the dead stock and focuses on current on-hand (66).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 22, the phantom in-transit inventory has increased to 502 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, and P19) as all current pipeline orders are now overdue; mu_hat must be inflated to 502 + expected demand to bypass this pipeline error.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show severe unreliability. While some recent orders arrived (P18 in 1 period, P15 in 2 periods), a significant portion of the pipeline consists of 'phantom' inventory that has never arrived. Specifically, orders from P1 (74), P3 (20), P4 (58), P13 (37), P14 (40), P17 (148), and P19 (125) are all beyond their promised lead time of 2. Total phantom inventory = 74+20+58+37+40+148+125 = 502 units. The OR engine subtracts this entire 'In-transit' count (524) from the base stock. To force the system to order 50 units (covering 2 periods of anticipated demand), I must set mu_hat to (In-transit + On-hand + desired new order) = 524 + 39 + 50 = 613. Demand is currently in a lower regime (avg ~25), so I will use N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 23, the phantom in-transit inventory remains at 502 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19) as these orders are significantly overdue; mu_hat must be inflated to offset this 502-unit discrepancy in the pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. As of Period 24, the 'In-transit' count of 552 is largely comprised of phantom stock from lost orders. This includes orders from P1 (74), P3 (20), P4 (58), P13 (37), P14 (40), P17 (148), and P19 (125), totaling 502 units. Only the order from P23 (50 units) is likely to arrive. To force the OR engine to order despite this 502-unit pipeline error, I must inflate mu_hat. Demand has recently shifted lower (avg ~30 units over the last 5 periods), but I will use an explicit mu_hat calculation: (1 + L) * Expected Demand + Phantom Pipeline = (1 + 2) * 30 + 502 = 592. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the corrupted pipeline value, allowing for replacement orders to be triggered. I will maintain L=2 as the backend's promised lead time while monitoring for any actual arrivals.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 24, phantom in-transit inventory remains at 502 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). mu_hat must be inflated to 502 + (1+L)*demand to bypass the pipeline error, as these orders are significantly overdue and likely lost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. As of Period 25, the 'In-transit' quantity of 573 includes a significant amount of phantom stock from lost or severely delayed orders. My analysis of the pipeline is as follows: P1(74), P3(20), P4(58), P13(37), P14(40), P17(148), and P19(125) are all beyond their promised lead time (L=2) and have not arrived. These total 502 units. The current In-transit (573) also includes P23(50) and P24(21), which are still within a reasonable arrivals window. To allow the OR engine to place a new order while On-hand is 0, mu_hat must be set to at least the sum of the phantom pipeline (502) plus the safety stock and expected demand for the lead time (1+L). Recent demand (Period 20-24) has been lower, averaging ~25 units/week. Setting L=2, the total requirement is 502 + (1+2)*25 = 577. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 577 to ensure the backend triggers an order to replenish the currently empty inventory.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 25, confirmed phantom in-transit inventory remains at 502 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). Demand has stayed in a lower regime (avg ~25 units) since Period 20.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. Based on historical data, several large orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19) totaling 502 units are significantly overdue and likely lost. These 'phantom' units are still counted in the system's in-transit inventory (total 577), which prevents the OR engine from placing new orders unless compensated. The recently placed P23 order (50 units), P24 order (21 units), and P25 order (4 units) total 75 units, making up the rest of the 577 units in-transit. Since Period 20, demand has shifted to a lower regime averaging approx. 25 units per week (periods 20-25: 20, 19, 27, 42, 20, 26). I am calculating mu_hat by taking this recent demand average (approx. 25.6) over the review and lead period (1+L = 3), then adding the 502 units of phantom inventory to bypass the pipeline error. This forces the engine to order enough to cover current demand despite the false in-transit balance. I set L=2 as promised, and use a recent_N sigma_hat (N=6) to reflect the recent volatility in the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 26, the phantom in-transit inventory remains at 502 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). Demand regime since Period 20 averages ~25.6 units/period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward since around Period 20, averaging approximately 25 units per period. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable with persistent phantom in-transit inventory. As of Period 27, the In-transit total of 529 units is heavily inflated by lost orders (P1: 74, P3: 20, P4: 58, P13: 37, P14: 40, P17: 148, P19: 125). Although P23 (50 units) arrived in Period 26 after 3 periods, P24 (21 units) and P25 (4 units) are now either overdue or approaching their limit. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 525+ phantom units in the pipeline, I must set mu_hat to be greater than the 'In-transit' + 'On-hand' minus expected safety stock. Forecasting demand at 25 units/period for L=2 (Total 3 periods = 75 units), I will set mu_hat to 625 (529 + 25 on-hand + approx 71 units for the next few periods) to force the policy to order enough to cover the immediate 3-period demand window while bypassing the pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 27, the phantom in-transit inventory has risen to 502 confirmed units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). Demand regime since Period 20 consistently averages ~25 units/period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable with a persistent 'phantom pipeline' problem. As of Period 28, the in-transit inventory is 596 units. Based on historical data, the following orders are confirmed lost or significantly overdue: P1 (74), P3 (20), P4 (58), P13 (37), P14 (40), P17 (148), and P19 (125), totaling 502 units. The P21 order was 0, so no shipment grew the pipeline then. The P24 order (21 units) is now at L=4 and also appears failed. Therefore, the phantom stock is at least 502 units, likely reaching 523 if P24 is lost. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from its calculated base stock; to force an order, mu_hat must be inflated to counteract this 502+ error. Demand has shown high volatility recently (P27 demand was 59, after several weeks in the 20s). To ensure we order enough to cover current demand despite the 596-unit pipeline penalty, I will set an explicit mu_hat = 750 (approx 523 phantom + (1+L)*35 avg demand) to guarantee the inventory position remains high enough to satisfy customers. I will use L=2 (promised) as the base for logic, but manually override the demand forecast to bypass the broken pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 28, the phantom in-transit inventory has increased to 523 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, and now P24 which is overdue at L=4). Demand remains volatile but averaged ~33 units over the last 8 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable with a significant amount of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Based on the history, the 750 units in-transit includes confirmed lost orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 17, and 19 (total 502 units). Additionally, the order from Period 24 (21 units) is now overdue (L=4). Thus, the confirmed phantom inventory is 523 units. The remaining in-transit consists of orders from P26 (2), P27 (71), and P28 (154), totaling 227 units. Currently, on-hand is 0. Demand has recently shifted again: after a low period (avg ~25), the last two weeks saw a spike (59 and 53). Using the last 9 samples (since P20), the mean demand is ~33 units/period with significant volatility. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 750 units of in-transit (of which 523 are lost), I must set mu_hat to cover the actual projected demand plus the lost inventory. Projected demand for (1+L=3) periods is 3 * 33 = 99. Adding the 523 phantom units results in an offset requirement of 622. Since the OR engine's 'cap' might restrict the order, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the current total in-transit (750) plus enough to cover one period of safety stock to trigger replenishment, as on-hand is zero.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 29, phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 523 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24). Demand shows a recent upward correction, averaging ~33 over the last 9 periods.

LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a cumulative total of 523 units from orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24) confirmed as phantom inventory (lost). The OR engine's 'In-transit' count is 850, of which 523 are phantom units. To allow the backend to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these 523 units. In the recent 10 periods (P20-P29), demand has shifted to a lower regime with a mean of ~32.1 units/period. Therefore, the target base stock must cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the phantom stock offset. With promised L=2, base stock needs to be ~32.1 * 3 + 523 \u2248 619. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 619 and L to default, any remaining pipeline inventory (850 - 523 = 327 units from P27, P28, P29) will be subtracted from this target to determine the final order. Current active in-transit = 71 (P27) + 154 (P28) + 100 (P29) = 325 units. Since 619 - 325 > 0, the OR engine will be able to order to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 30, phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 523 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24). Demand regime for P20-P29 has stabilized at a mean of 32.1 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the SKU remains plagued by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that are significantly overdue and likely never to arrive, yet remain in the 'In-transit' count. As of Period 30, the confirmed lost orders are P1 (74), P3 (20), P4 (58), P13 (37), P14 (40), P17 (148), P19 (125), and P24 (21), totaling 523 phantom units. The current total In-transit is 625, of which 102 units (from Period 29) are still within a plausible delivery window. Demand has shifted: after a low period (P20-25), it has stabilized at a higher regime. The most recent 11 periods (P20-P30) average 34 units/period, but looking at the most recent 5 periods (P26-30), the mean is significantly higher at 45.2. To ensure orders are placed, mu_hat must be inflated to cover both the expected demand for (L+1) periods and the 523 units of phantom inventory. Using L=2, expected demand is approx 136 (45.2 * 3). Total mu_hat = 136 + 523 = 659. On-hand is currently 166 which is healthy, so this approach forces the OR engine to maintain a buffer that ignores the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 31, phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 523 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24). Demand regime has shifted upwards again, averaging ~45 units over the last 5 periods (P26-P30).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. As of Period 32, the 'In-transit' quantity of 625 contains 523 units from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 17, 19, and 24 that are significantly overdue and likely lost. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (in-transit) to reduce current orders; if these units never arrive, the system will chronically under-order. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat (the base stock level) to at least 523 (lost stock) + (1+L)*demand. Recent demand (P26-P31) has shifted back upwards, averaging approximately 51.5 units per period. Using L=2, the required base stock is 523 + (3 * 51.5) = 677.5. I will set mu_hat to 678. Sigma_hat is set based on the volatility in this higher demand regime to ensure adequate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 32, phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 523 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24). Demand has returned to a higher regime, averaging 51.5 units over the last 6 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. As of Period 33, the in-transit inventory sits at 625 units. Based on historical tracking, 523 units are confirmed as 'phantom' stock from orders that are significantly overdue (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24). The remaining 102 units in the pipeline consist of the P26 (2 units) and P29 (100 units) orders. P26 is now significantly overdue at L=7 and should also be considered lost, bringing the total phantom count to 525. Current on-hand is 37 units. Demand has experienced a sustained upward shift over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), averaging 55 units per period. Using a 3-period lead time (the recent actual) and a 1-week review period, we need a total availability of (3+1) * 55 = 220 units. To bypass the 525 phantom units in the backend's calculation, mu_hat must be set to 525 + 220 = 745. This ensures the OR engine places an order to maintain the desired service level despite the corrupted pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 33, phantom in-transit inventory has increased to 525 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, and P26). Demand regime P26-P32 has stabilized at an average of 55 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand spike of 113 in Period 33. Demand has shifted into a higher regime, averaging 55 units/period over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), though P33 suggests it may be even higher. The 'In-transit' count of 708 is heavily inflated by 525 confirmed 'phantom' units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26) which are severely overdue and unlikely to arrive. The remaining 183 units in the pipeline (from P29 and P33) are still within plausible delivery windows. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 525-unit phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*demand + 525. Using L=2 and a base demand of 65 (adjusting slightly up from the 55 average due to the P33 spike), mu_hat = (3 * 65) + 525 = 720. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for the recent volatility (113 vs 30).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 34, phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 525 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26). Demand regime P26-P33 has shifted significantly higher, now averaging approx 62 units/period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable with a significant amount of 'phantom' in-transit inventory. As of Period 35, the total 'In-transit' is 720 units. My analysis confirms that 525 units are likely lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26). Additionally, the orders from P29 (100 units), P33 (83 units), and P34 (12 units) are either pending or overdue. Demand has surged since Period 30, averaging 70.2 units over the last 5 periods (59, 63, 66, 113, 67), compared to the previous regime. The OR engine calculates orders as (base_stock - pipeline), so I must inflate mu_hat by the 525-unit phantom count to ensure any new orders are placed. With L=2, mu_hat should ideally be (1+L)*demand + 525. Using a high-demand estimate of 70, (1+2)*70 + 525 = 735. I will set mu_hat to 735 to bypass the pipeline error and target the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 35, phantom in-transit inventory remains at 525 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26). Demand regime P30-P34 has shifted higher, averaging 70.2 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 536139010 (Women's Nightwear Pyjamas) is entering mid-October, where autumn/winter seasonality typically drives higher demand for cozy sleepwear. Recent demand history confirms this upward trend: Period 33 reached 113 units, and the average over the last 6 periods (P30-P35) is 73.1 units, significantly higher than the previous regime. Pipeline integrity remains the primary issue. We have a confirmed 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 525 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26) that are significantly overdue and likely lost. Additionally, orders from P29 (100), P33 (83), P34 (12), and P35 (15) are also in-transit. Total In-transit is 735. To allow the OR engine to place an order despite the 735-unit pipeline, mu_hat must be set to (Phantom Inventory + Forecasted Demand). I estimate future demand at ~75 units per period. With L=2, the required (1+L) coverage is 3 * 75 = 225 units. Adding the 525 phantom units (which the OR engine thinks are real) results in an explicit mu_hat of 750. Sigma_hat is set to 35 to handle the volatility seen in Period 33.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 36, phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 525 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26). Demand regime P30-P35 has stabilized in a high bracket, averaging 73.1 units/period, consistent with winter pyjama seasonality.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime for pyjama bottoms, coinciding with the shift into late October (winter seasonality). Demand from Period 30\u201336 has averaged 73 units, with a noticeable spike to 113 in Period 33. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory. As of Period 37, the total In-transit is 652 units. Based on historical tracking, 525 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26). Additionally, the order from Period 29 (100 units) is now at L=7 and is likely lost. The order from Period 34 (12 units) is at L=2 and may still arrive. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 652-unit pipeline, I must set mu_hat to cover both the phantom inventory and the expected demand over (1+L) periods. Using a base demand of ~75 units and L=3, expected demand is approx 300. Adding the 640+ units of unreliable pipeline to this target suggests a mu_hat around 940. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the pipeline error and ensure we maintain stock for this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 37, phantom in-transit inventory is estimated at 625 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26 are confirmed lost; P29 is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost). Demand regime P30-P36 has stabilized at an average of 73.1 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the high-demand winter season (pyjama bottoms). Current demand has stabilized at a high level, averaging 71.8 units over the last 5 periods (P33-P37). The pipeline currently shows 911 units, but a large portion is 'phantom' stock from lost orders. Summing historical lost orders: P1(74), P3(20), P4(58), P13(37), P14(40), P17(148), P19(125), P24(21), P26(2), and P29(100) are all significantly past the expected lead time (promised 2, max observed 3). This totals 625 units of phantom inventory. To allow the OR backend to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat to offset this 625-unit error. Target base stock = (1+L)*Target_Demand + Phantom_Offset. With L=2 and Target_Demand ~75, base stock should be roughly 3*75 + 625 = 850. Using an explicit value for mu_hat of 850 ensures the engine overrides the 911-unit pipeline (911 - 625 = 286 real pipeline units) and orders enough to cover the seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 38, phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 625 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Demand regime P33-P37 is high, averaging 71.8 units/period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is women's pyjama bottoms, which is entering peak winter seasonality. Demand in the last 5 periods (P34-P38) has averaged 67.8 units, consistent with the high regime identified. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, and P29 (totaling 625 units) are confirmed lost or severely overdue and comprise the bulk of the 652 units 'in-transit'. Only the P34 order (12 units) and P36 order (15 units) are still within potentially valid delivery windows, though they are currently at L=5 and L=3 respectively. Because the 'in-transit' logic in the OR engine will subtract these 625 phantom units from the target base stock, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass this. To maintain a safety stock of ~1 period of demand on top of the (1+L) requirement, I set mu_hat to offset the 625 phantom units plus cover 3 periods of demand (approx 210 units). Lead time remains volatile (averaging ~2 across successful deliveries), so L=2 is maintained.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 39, phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 625 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Demand regime P34-P38 is high, averaging 67.8 units/period, reflecting winter seasonality for nightwear.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40, the supply chain remains unreliable. The 'In-transit' quantity of 637 units is significantly comprised of historical lost orders. These include confirmed phantom inventory from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, and P29 (totaling 625 units). The only legitimate in-transit items likely consist of orders from Period 34 (12 units), making the effective pipeline nearly zero. Current on-hand inventory is 177 units. Demand has entered a high-activity period consistent with winter pyjama seasonality. Over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), the average demand is 67.5 units/period, despite a dip in the most recent period. To allow the OR backend to place new orders, mu_hat must be inflated to offset the 625-unit phantom pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 'explicit' at 830, which covers (1+L=3) periods of demand (~205 units) plus the 625 unit offset. sigma_hat is also set to 'explicit' to account for higher volatility in this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 625 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29 are lost/severely overdue). Demand regime P30-P39 remains high, averaging 67.5 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, entering the peak winter holiday season for pyjama bottoms. Period 40 concluded with an on-hand inventory of 117 units. The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 653 units. However, based on the carry-over insights and historical gaps, 625 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, and P29) are significantly overdue and confirmed lost. The backend OR logic subtracts the pipeline (653) from the base stock; to ensure the engine places orders to meet real demand, I must inflate mu_hat by the phantom amount (625). Demand for periods 30-40 has been high, averaging 67.5 units/period due to seasonality. Setting L to the promised 2 periods, I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*67.5 + 625 \u2248 827.5 to bypass the pipeline error and maintain stock for the upcoming weeks.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 625 units. Winter seasonality is in full effect; demand regime P30-P40 averages 66.8 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date 2019-11-25 indicates late autumn/early winter, which is peak season for 'Pyjama bottoms'. In-transit inventory is 711 units, but this is heavily inflated by 625 units of confirmed 'phantom' inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). These orders are all at least 5 periods overdue. The real pipeline consists of P34 (12 units), P35 (15 units - though P35 arrived early as per P36 conclude, the logic suggests P34 and P35 counts might be messy, but the primary concern is the 625 phantom units), P40 (16 units), and P41 (58 units). Excluding the 625 phantom units, the effective pipeline is roughly 86 units. To force the OR engine to place necessary orders during the holiday peak, mu_hat must be inflated to cover both actual demand (approx 70 units/period) and the 625 unit pipeline error. I set mu_hat to (1+L)*70 + 625 = 210 + 625 = 835. Demand has stabilized at a high level (regime P30-P41 avg ~65.6), so a forecast of 70 units per period is reasonable given the upcoming December peak.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 42, phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 625 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Demand regime P30-P41 remains high for the winter season, averaging 65.6 units/period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Period 42 showed a massive demand spike (175 units), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday and the onset of peak winter nightwear seasonality. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 770 units contains 625 confirmed phantom/lost units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Subtracting these leaves a 'real' pipeline of 145 units (P34: 12, P40: 16, P41: 58, P42: 59). To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite the 625 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to at least (1+L)*forecast + phantom_offset. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat needs to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 3 * 75 = 225) plus the 625 unit offset, totaling 850. sigma_hat is set to recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Extreme demand spike of 175 units in Period 42 confirms peak winter seasonality/promotional impact. Phantom in-transit remains at 625 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/9), we are in the peak winter season for pyjamas. Period 42 saw a massive spike (175 units) and Period 43 remains extremely high (132 units), suggesting a significant regime shift due to December seasonality/promotions. The demand average for the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is 90.8 units, compared to the previous ~67 unit baseline. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' quantity of 776 is severely inflated by lost orders. Confirmed lost or severely overdue orders include P1 (74), P3 (20), P4 (58), P13 (37), P14 (40), P17 (148), P19 (125), P24 (21), P26 (2), and P29 (100), totaling 625 'phantom' units. The actual reliable pipeline likely only contains orders from P34 onwards. However, since the OR engine subtracts the full 776 units from its target, I must set mu_hat to (1+L)*demand + 625 to ensure it places an order. I will use L=3 based on recent arrivals (P40 arrived in 3, P41 in 2). With L=3, (1+L) = 4. Using the recent demand mean of ~91, the target is 4 * 91 + 625 = 364 + 625 = 989. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to force this correction and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility (sigma \u2248 50).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Confirmed phantom in-transit inventory remains at 625 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Demand has shifted to a peak season regime, averaging 90.8 units over the last 5 periods (P39-P43).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in peak winter seasonality ('Womens Nightwear | Pyjama bottom'). Recent demand (P42-P44) has surged to an average of 146 units per period, far exceeding the previous high regime of ~70. The current In-transit total of 989 units contains 625 confirmed phantom units (orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29) which are significantly overdue and likely lost. To bypass this pipeline error and ensure the OR backend places orders during this peak demand phase, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Phantom units. With L=2, (3 * 150) + 625 = 1075. mu_hat is set to 1100 to account for recent volatility and the risk of stockouts during the Christmas season. I am using recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in the last few weeks (ranging from 52 to 175).

Carry-over insight: Demand has entered a peak seasonal regime for Christmas/Winter: average demand for P42-P44 is 146 units, compared to the previous regime of 67. Phantom in-transit remains confirmed at 625 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, 2019, which is the absolute peak for Christmas and winter nightwear demand. Demand in Period 42-44 averaged 146 units, though Period 45 saw a drop to 72 units. Historically, demand spikes significantly in late December and then begins to taper off in January. The pipeline contains 625 units of confirmed 'phantom' inventory (orders from P1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 17, 19, 24, 26, 29) that have not arrived and are considered lost. The 'In-transit' figure is 961, meaning only 336 units (961 - 625) are actually live. The OR backend uses the full 961 count to decide orders, so I must inflate mu_hat by 625 to offset this error. Given the peak season, I'll forecast a base demand of 110 units/period (considering the recent high average while acknowledging the P45 drop). For a lead time of 2, mu_hat = (1+L)*demand + phantom = 3*110 + 625 = 955. Sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Peak seasonal demand confirmed for Christmas. Phantom in-transit inventory remains confirmed at 625 units; all calculations for mu_hat must include a +625 offset to bypass pipeline inflation.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 47 (Dec 30), concluding the peak winter/Christmas cycle. Demand has dropped from recent peaks (~130 units) back to 53 units in Period 46, signaling the end of the holiday surge. However, pyjama bottoms still maintain winter seasonality. The phantom in-transit inventory remains at 625 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). To prevent the OR engine from halting orders due to this 'ghost' stock, mu_hat must be inflated to cover both the phantom units and the actual forecasted demand for the lead-time window (L+1=3). Given the current demand cooling and seasonal trajectory, I estimate base demand around 60 units/period. The target mu_hat calculation is: 625 (offset) + (3 periods * 60 units) = 805. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility of the holiday-to-post-holiday transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Peak seasonal demand has moderated; demand dropped to 53 units following the Christmas peak. Phantom in-transit remains constant at 625 units.
