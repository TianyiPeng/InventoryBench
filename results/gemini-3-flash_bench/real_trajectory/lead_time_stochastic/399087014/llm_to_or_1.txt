Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for stock 399087014, a ladies' low-rise super-skinny denim. The historical demand for the past 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows values of 82, 35, 31, 48, and 55. The average demand is approximately 50.2 units per week. Although there's a slight upward trend in the last two weeks, the history is short, and we are entering mid-February. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since the promised lead time is 2, the (L+1) factor in the OR backend will calculate base stock for 3 periods (150.6 units). Inventory is currently zero, and there are no units in transit, so a full order is necessary to cover immediate and lead-time demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Super Skinny Low Waist Jeans'. Initial demand samples (Jan-Feb) show a mean of 50.2 units/week (82, 35, 31, 48, 55). In Period 1, the observed demand was 61, slightly higher than the average. We current have 0 on-hand and 84 in-transit (ordered in P1). With a promised lead time of 2, these 84 units are expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible in P4). For Period 2's order calculation, we must cover demand for the lead time plus one review period (L+1 = 3). Using all 6 available samples (the 5 historical plus P1's 61), the mean is 52 units/week. Setting mu_hat to 156 (3 * 52) and sigma_hat using the standard deviation of these 6 samples (approx 18.5 * sqrt(3) \u2248 32) will allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock. We will use the promised lead time of 2 for L.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of ladies' super-skinny jeans. The current date is 2019-02-25. Historical demand samples (Jan-early Feb) averaged ~50 units/period. However, concluded periods P1 and P2 show a significant demand spike (61 and 130), likely due to early spring/late winter fashion transitions or inventory availability. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in 191 units of lost sales over two periods. Promised lead time is 2. The order from P1 (84 units) is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible in P4's start. The order from P2 (83 units) is expected in P4. Total in-transit is 167. I need to set parameters that recognize the recent elevated demand regime (avg ~95 over last 2 weeks) to ensure the OR backend's base stock calculation covers the 3-period risk window (L+1). I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the recent surge while still acknowledging the historical baseline, and use the default lead time as we haven't confirmed any delays yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th. We are managing 'Super Skinny Low-Rise Jeans', a staple denim item. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to significant lost sales (sold=0 vs. demand of ~61, 130, 104 in P1-P3). Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from P1 (Jan 11) was expected to arrive in P3 (Feb 25) and should have appeared in the P3 conclude message read at the start of P4. However, 'arrived=0' is recorded for P3 conclude. This suggests a delay or that the order arrives later in P4. With 251 units currently in-transit (P1:84, P2:83, P3:84), we must reconcile the demand. The initial historical training samples (avg ~50) were significantly lower than the actual demand observed in the first three periods (avg 98.3). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot to this higher demand regime, while keeping L at default until a definitive arrival confirms a lead time shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Actual demand in P1-P3 (avg 98.3) is significantly higher than historical samples (avg 50.2). Initial shipments (P1-P2) are delayed beyond the promised 2-period lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P1-P4 avg: 95.25) is significantly higher than historical samples (avg: 50.2), representing a clear regime shift. In Period 4, the first shipment arrived with a lead time of 2 periods (ordered P2, arrived P4), which matches the promised lead time. However, the Period 1 order (84 units) has NOT arrived yet even though it should have arrived in Period 3 (if L=2). Since we are now in Period 5 and P1 order is still missing from the 'conclude' messages, there is a risk it is lost or severely delayed. With 0 on-hand inventory and consistent high demand (86 units last period), we need to ensure the base stock is set to capture the new demand level (avg ~95/week) over the 2-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=3). I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime for both mu and sigma.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P1-P4 average demand is 95.25, vs historical 50.2. Period 1 order (84 units) is overdue and potentially lost as of Period 5 start.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/3/18), the SKU 399087014 (Super Skinny Ladies Denim) is experiencing a severe stockout. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (avg 93.2) is significantly higher than historical samples (avg 50.2). Most critically, the Period 1 order (84 units) is now 3 periods past its promised delivery date (L=2) and has not arrived; per Period 5 carry-over, it is likely lost. The Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2) in Period 4. The Period 3 order (84 units) was expected in Period 5 conclude but has not arrived, suggesting further delays or losses. Given the in-transit balance (329 units), we must set parameters that account for the elevated demand regime (avg ~93 units/period) and provide enough coverage for a 2+1 period lead time visibility despite the current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (84 units) is officially categorized as a lost shipment (expected P3-P4, still missing P6). Demand regime remains stable at ~90-95 units per week, significantly above the historical average.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), we are managing a high-demand ladies' denim SKU. Historical demand samples (avg ~50) were misleading; real-world demand from P1-P6 has averaged ~91 units. We have experienced significant supply chain instability: the P1 order (84 units) is lost, P2 arrived on time (LT=2), P3/P4 orders are currently late/missing, and the P5 order arrived early (LT=1). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 263 units, which includes the missing P3 (84) and P4 (95) orders. To stabilize stock against these disruptions and the higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the ~91 unit/period average. I am setting L to 3 periods explicitly because even though the promised LT is 2, the combination of a lost shipment and missing P3/P4 orders suggests the Effective Lead Time for reliable replenishment is higher. This increases the base stock target to cover the order cycle plus the extended lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain reliability remains low: P1 order lost; P3 and P4 orders (placed Feb 25, Mar 4) are overdue as of Period 7 start. Effective Lead Time is currently trending at 3+ periods due to delays/losses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 7 spiked significantly to 179 units, likely due to the start of spring and warmer weather in early April, affecting sales for 'Super-skinny washed denim'. This brings the recent mean (P4-P7) to 107.25 units, well above the historical and early-game averages. Supply reliability remains a critical failure: Period 1 order (84) is lost; Period 3 (84) and Period 4 (95) are overdue (placed Feb 25, Mar 4; now April 1). The Period 5 order arrived in 1 period, but the system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand and 393 in-transit. I will set the Lead Time (L) to 3 explicitly to account for the current bottleneck/overdue pattern. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast of 450 (which is (1+L)*112.5), slightly weighting up from the recent 4-period mean of 107.25 to account for the seasonal uptrend. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to reflect the high volatility seen in the jump from ~80 to 179.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand spike detected at Period 7 (179 units) corresponding with April 1 date. Current supply chain status: P3 (84 units) and P4 (95 units) are \u22654 periods old and officially overdue, suggesting effective lead time is currently 3+ periods or shipments are periodically lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P7: 179, P8: 148) confirms a significant seasonal spike starting in April, likely due to spring fashion cycles for ladies denim. The average demand of the last two periods (~164) is much higher than the previous P1-P6 regime (~90). On the supply side, we have significant instability: the P1 order (84) is lost, and the P3 (84) and P4 (95) orders are now significantly overdue (7 and 6 periods since ordering, respectively), while P5 and P7 arrived with a lead time of 1. Because the OR backend counts all 'In-transit' units against the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' L to account for the fact that 179 units (P3 and P4) are likely lost or indefinitely delayed and will not arrive to satisfy this season's demand. I am setting L=3 to reflect the current supply uncertainty and using mu_hat to project demand based on the recent elevated levels (avg 163.5). This will push the backend to order more to cover the seasonal peak and compensate for the pipeline inventory that isn't actually arriving.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed seasonal demand spike: late March/early April demand (avg 163.5) is ~75% higher than Feb/March regime (~93). Supply chain divergence: Orders P3 (84) and P4 (95) are now presumed lost/dead as they are 6+ periods late while subsequent orders arrived in 1 period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), we observe a stabilization following a significant seasonal demand peak in Late March/Early April (Avg demand ~163). Demand in Period 9 dropped to 88, suggesting those peaks were temporary spikes (possibly related to spring/pre-Easter shopping). The supply chain remains highly unreliable: shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 263 units) are now 6-9 periods old and must be treated as lost. However, recent arrivals (P4, P6, P8) showed a lead time of 1-2 periods. Currently, 636 units are in-transit, but 263 of those are presumed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 373 units (P8, P9 orders). With 0 on-hand inventory and the P8 order (125 units) expected to arrive this period, we must set parameters carefully. I am using an explicit lead time of 2 (promised) as recent successful deliveries were 1-2 periods. Demand forecast (mu_hat) is set to a 5-period average (approx 116 units/period) to balance the recent high spikes with the most recent lower observation (88).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain divergence confirmed: Shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (263 units total) are definitively lost. Effective pipeline inventory should exclude these units for accurate ordering. Demand has retreated from the early April peak (179 units) to 88 units in P9.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the system has 299 units on-hand. The recorded 'In-transit' of 263 units corresponds exactly to the lost orders from Periods 1 (84), 3 (84), and 4 (95). Since these orders are essentially dead, the OR backend (which subtracts pipeline inventory from base stock) will under-order unless we compensate. Demand has stabilized after the early April spike (179, 148 shifted to 88, 74). The average demand of the last two periods is 81. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand, assuming a stabilized demand around 80 units/period, but I will use the 'explicit' method to override the pipeline inventory calculation error caused by the 263 lost units. If target base stock for L=2 is roughly 3*80 = 240 plus safety stock, but the backend sees 299 on-hand + 263 in-transit = 562 units, it will not order. However, given the high on-hand inventory (299), no order is actually needed this period as it covers ~3.7 periods of demand. I'll set L to 1 based on recent arrivals (P5, P7, P9 all arrived in 1 period), and use a recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-spike stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized post-April spike; Periods 9-10 average 81 units, down from 163.5 in late March. Effective lead time for successful deliveries has shifted from the promised 2 periods to 1 period (based on P5, P7, and P9 arrivals).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/29 (Period 12). Demand history shows a volatile pattern: a recent spike in late March/early April (avg 163.5 in P7-P8) followed by a drop in P9-P10 (avg 81), and then another spike in P11 (160). This suggests significant weekly volatility or ongoing seasonal fluctuations in the 'Ladies Denim' category. Supply chain analysis: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (263 units) are definitively lost as they are 8+ periods overdue, while P5, P7, P8, and P9 arrived with 1-2 period lead times. The 'In-transit' figure (263) consists entirely of these ghosts, meaning effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. On-hand inventory is 139. I am setting L=1 (recent successful lead times) and using a recent 5-period window (P7-P11) for mu_hat (avg ~130) to capture the higher average demand and volatility. Since effective pipeline is 0 and on-hand (139) is near the expected demand for (L+1) periods (130 * 2 = 260), an order is required.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high post-April spike; Period 11 saw a secondary peak of 160 units. Effective pipeline continues to be distorted by 263 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6. Historical demand for this 'Super Skinny Denim' SKU shows significant volatility: an April seasonal peak (avg ~160) followed by a stabilization/dip (avg ~100 in recent periods). Period 11 saw a secondary spike (160), and Period 12 showed 128 units. The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 1-2 periods, but 263 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/dead stock in the pipeline. Current on-hand is low (11 units). The OR backend calculation of 'pipeline inventory' includes these 263 lost units, causing it to under-order. To compensate and ensure we cover the current demand regime (~120 units/week) across the review and lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), I am setting L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 360 (120 * 3). This bypasses the pipeline distortion by forcing a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the 'ghost' inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent high volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Analysis of demand history shows a sustained higher regime compared to historical training data (avg ~110 vs 50.2). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P9-P13) show an average demand of 113.4, with a recent spike in P11 (160) and a drop in P10 (74), currently settling near the 117-128 range. The supply chain has been unreliable with multiple lost shipments (P1, P3, P4 total 263 units). These units remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 417 but will never arrive. The effective in-transit inventory is actually 154 units (P12 order: 55, P13 order: 99). Recent successful arrivals (P7, P8, P9) showed actual lead times of 1-2 periods. I am setting L=2 (promised) to be safe, but using 'explicit' mu_hat to adjust for the 263 'ghost' units in the pipeline. My forecast for the next 3 periods (L+1) is (1+2)*115 = 345 units. However, because the backend subtracts the full 417 in-transit from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that adds back the lost units to ensure the OR engine actually places an order. Target order = BaseStock - Pipeline. I want an order that covers the current stockout. With 0 on-hand and 154 real units coming, and mean demand at 115/period, I need to raise parameters to trigger an arrival that covers the 117 units of lost sales seen in P13.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion confirmed: 263 units (from P1, P3, P4) are permanently lost but remain in 'In-transit' totals. Parameters must be adjusted explicitly to compensate for this 'ghost' inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-20 (late Spring). Demand reflects higher levels than historical samples, with a recent average (P9-P14) of approximately 119 units per week. Inventory management is complicated by 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 263 units from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost but remain in the In-transit total (635). Subtracting these lost units, the true In-transit is 372 (P13: 99, P14: 273). Current on-hand is 0. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory which prevents the OR engine from ordering enough, I will use 'explicit' methods. Using an effective lead time (L) of 2 (observed average for successful shipments) and a forecasted weekly demand of 120, the target base stock (calculated as (L+1) * mu) should be approx 360-400. However, because the backend subtracts the full 635 'In-transit' from the base stock, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. To ensure an order is placed that covers the true demand despite the 263 unit ghost inventory, I set mu_hat explicitly to incorporate the lost 263 units plus the desired cycle stock.

Carry-over insight: P15: True pipeline inventory is 372 units (P13, P14 orders); 263 units (P1, P3, P4) remain in 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost. Recent demand (P12-P14) averages 131 units, showing sustained high activity into May.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Sustained high demand (avg 138 units over P12-P15) and significant pipeline distortion require explicit parameter control. The 'In-transit' count of 701 units includes 263 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost. The legitimate pipeline consists of P13 (99), P14 (273), and P15 (66), totaling 438 units. Demand for this SKU (super-skinny denim) remains elevated through May. Lead times for successful deliveries (P10, P14) fluctuate between 1-2 periods. I am setting L=2 (promised) but will use 'explicit' mu_hat to handle the ghost inventory. The OR backend uses: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat and order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap). To ensure it orders the necessary inventory, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - ghost_inventory' reflects the actual target demand over the lead time. Target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods at ~138 units/period is ~414 units. To offset the 263 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 677 (414 target + 263 ghost). This forces the backend to recognize the 263 missing units as unavailable for satisfying future demand.

Carry-over insight: P15: Historical demand average (P12-P15) is 138.25 units, representing a sustained +45% shift from the Feb-Mar baseline (~95). Supply chain ghost inventory (263 units) continues to mask a zero on-hand situation.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the aggregate historical demand for this 'superstretch' denim item has shifted significantly. Comparing the historical average (50.2) to the current demand regime (last 8 periods avg: 121.75), there is a clear and sustained high-demand period associated with the spring/summer season. The supply chain continues to present significant challenges: 263 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost, as their lead times have now exceeded 12 periods. The current 'In-transit' figure of 703 units is heavily inflated by these lost units; the actual reliable pipeline contains 440 units (orders from P13-P16). Recent arrivals suggest that actual lead time for successful shipments is approximately 1-2 periods. To account for the 263 units of 'ghost inventory' which the OR backend mistakenly adds to the pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. I am calculating a target base stock for a 2-period horizon (L+1) using a mean of 122 and a buffer for variance, then adding back the 263 lost units to the mu_hat to 'neutralize' them in the backend subtraction: Target Base Stock (122 * 2 + ~60 for safety = 304) + Lost Units (263) = 567. This ensures the OR backend places a replenishment order despite the inflated 'In-transit' count.

Carry-over insight: P17: Ghost inventory (263 units) continues to block auto-replenishment. Reliable pipeline consists of orders from P13 (99), P14 (273), P15 (66), and P16 (2). Total reliable in-transit is 440 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 6 periods (P12-P17) has averaged 124 units, indicating a sustained higher demand regime compared to the early-year baseline. The 'In-transit' total of 635 units is heavily distorted by 263 units confirmed lost from early periods (P1, P3, P4: 84, 84, 95 units respectively). The reliable active pipeline consists of orders from P13 (99 units) and P14 (273 units), totaling 372 units. These orders are now 5 and 4 periods old respectively, exceeding the promised 2-period lead time significantly; however, given prior delivery patterns (P12 arrived in 2 periods, P15 in 2, P16 in 1), these larger shipments (P13, P14) may simply be delayed. To trigger an order despite the 263 'ghost' units in the pipeline and the 372 delayed units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover 2-3 periods of demand at the current average (124 * 3 = 372). To force the OR backend to place an order while it incorrectly perceives 635 units in transit, I will set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the 'ghost' inventory plus my desired additional buffer. I set mu_hat to 1100 to compensate for the 263 lost units and the uncertainty of P13/P14, ensuring the system replenishes against the zero on-hand status.

Carry-over insight: P18: Supply chain bottleneck confirmed for larger orders P13 (99) and P14 (273), which are currently 4-5 periods delayed. Ghost inventory (263 units) remains a persistent calculation hurdle.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), the SKU continues to suffer from extreme stockouts due to high demand and unreliable logistics. The current In-transit total of 1040 is highly misleading. It includes 263 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4) and 372 units severely delayed (P13 ordered May 6 and P14 ordered May 13). Only the order from P18 (405 units) is currently within a 'normal' lead time window. Recent demand (P12-P18) averages 120 units per week, which is significantly higher than the 90-95 units observed in Feb-Mar. To bypass the OR engine's 'ghost' inventory logic\u2014where it sees 1040 units in transit and likely refuses to order\u2014I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a (L+1) window using a lead time of 2 periods (L=2, Window=3). Target = 120 units/week * 3 weeks = 360 units. However, because the backend subtracts the 'ghost' 1040 from this target, a standard calculation will result in zero orders. To force a replenishment that covers the current demand regime and accounts for the 635 'lost/bottlenecked' units (263+372), I set mu_hat explicitly to 1400. This ensures the backend (1400 - 1040) still places a meaningful order (approx 360 units) to maintain stock levels once the bottleneck clears or new orders arrive.

Carry-over insight: P19: Bottleneck confirmed; orders P13 (99) and P14 (273) are now 5-6 periods delayed and should be treated as temporarily lost for planning. Real pipeline currently only includes P18 (405).

The 'reliable' in-transit is likely only the P19 order (395 units). The system's base_stock calculation (Profit=4, Holding=1 => q=0.8) targets ~1.28\u03c3 above mean. To force an order despite the 1030 'In-transit' units, \u03bc\u0302 must be set explicitly high to overcome the pipeline calculation (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline). Average demand over the last 10 periods is ~110. With L=2, the base stock would normally be ~330 plus safety stock. To ensure replenishment handles the 'ghost' inventory of 635 units (263+372), I will set mu_hat to a significantly higher value. I've set mu_hat to 1250 (roughly covering the demand for L+1 periods plus the ghost inventory gap) to trigger appropriate replenishment for the current demand regime of ~100-110 units.

Carry-over insight: P20: Ghost inventory total updated to 635 units (lost: P1, P3, P4; bottlenecked/lost: P13, P14). Demand in late June is softening (Period 19 demand: 67) compared to May peak.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are managing a severe supply chain reliability issue. The 'In-transit' count of 1030 includes 635 units from orders P1 (84), P3 (84), P4 (95), P13 (99), and P14 (273) that are significantly late and presumed lost (Ghost Inventory). The only reliable recent order is P19 (395 units). Period 20 demand dropped to 34 units, confirming a softening trend in early summer after the high activity in May/June. With 304 units on-hand and 395 reliable units in-transit, we are well-covered for the current demand regime. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 635 'ghost' units in its pipeline calculation, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7 to capture the shift from high May demand to lower late-June demand) and extending L to 4. This 'explicit' L of 4 increases the base stock target, effectively offsetting the 635 units of ghost inventory that the engine incorrectly assumes will arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand continues to soften in late June (P20: 34), signaling a shift from the May/June high (avg ~115) to a summer baseline. Ghost inventory remains at 635 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14), requiring explicit lead time inflation to maintain replenishment.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (July 8), demand is stabilizing into a summer baseline after the April/May peak. Demand over the last 3 weeks (P19-P21) has averaged 54 units. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with 635 units definitively 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14), which are older than 6+ periods and will not arrive. True 'In-transit' is 395 units (from P19), not the 1030 reported. With 243 on-hand and 395 reliable in-transit, total effective stock is 638 units. Demand is currently low (avg 54), so current coverage is approximately 11-12 weeks. I will set L to explicit (6) to neutralize the impact of the 635 ghost units in the base stock calculation, effectively forcing the OR engine to recognize that a significant portion of pipeline is inactive. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current lower summer demand (avg 54) to prevent over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline confirmed: P19-P21 average demand is 54 units, a significant drop from the May peak (avg 138). Ghost inventory total remains 635 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (July 15), we are in a summer demand regime. Historical demand for the last four periods (P19-P22) has averaged 56.5 units (67, 34, 61, 64), which is a significant drop from the May-June average of ~115. On-hand inventory is 179 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1030 is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' from lost or severely bottlenecked shipments: P1 (84), P3 (84), P4 (95), P13 (99), P14 (273), and P19 (395). The only recent order that reached inventory was P18 (405 units arriving in P19). As of P23, the only 'live' order that might arrive is P19 (395 units, now 4 periods old), but based on recent reliability, its arrival is uncertain. To trigger replenishment despite this ghost inventory, I will keep mu_hat aligned with the summer regime (recent_N=4) and set L to 'explicit' at 4. This increases the base stock target (L+1 periods of demand), allowing the OR backend to place an order if the target exceeds the 1030 in-transit total, accounting for the reality that many of those units will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline (July) holds steady at approx 55-60 units/week. Ghost inventory total is now 1030 units (including P19's 395 units), which are significantly overdue and unlikely to arrive.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. Demand has shifted into a lower summer regime (averaging 54.25 units over P20-P23) compared to the spring peak. The supply chain has significant 'ghost' inventory: 1,030 units are currently listed as 'In-transit', but history confirms that orders from P1, P3, P4 (~263 units), P13, P14 (~372 units), and P19 (395 units) are significantly overdue (5+ periods for the most recent) and are likely lost or permanently stalled. Reliable pipeline is effectively 0. On-hand inventory is 138, which covers approx 2.5 weeks of current demand. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1,030 units as valid 'pipeline' and never ordering, I must inflate the lead time (L) to bypass the 'ghost' inventory check or explicitly forecast demand to force a positive order calculation. Given the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline), if pipeline (1030) is much larger than base_stock, I will order nothing. To resume replenishment for the summer baseline, I set L=2 to reflect the promised lead time, but use a recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower summer demand (approx 55/week) while ignoring the historical April peaks. I cannot 'delete' the 1030 in-transit via parameters, so I must wait for on-hand to deplete or use a very high explicit mu_hat to trigger an order if needed next period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline confirmed for July: avg 54.25 units (P20-P23). Cumulative ghost inventory (confirmed lost/stalled) has reached 1,030 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19), effectively blocking auto-replenishment until on-hand reaches critical lows or parameters are forced high.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (July 29), the SKU is in a low summer demand regime. Recent demand (P20-P24) averages 45.6 units/period, a significant drop from the May peak. The major challenge is the 'ghost' inventory: 1,030 units are listed as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19). Because the OR engine subtracts all pipeline inventory from the base_stock calculation, it will not place new orders unless the parameters are significantly inflated to overcome the 1,030-unit deduction. On-hand inventory is currently 110 units, enough for roughly 2.5 periods at current demand rates. To force the backend to consider replenishment as stock depletes, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that accounts for both expected demand during lead time and the neutralization of the 1,030 ghost units. Specifically, mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory = (46 * 3) + 1030 \u2248 1168. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of recent stable demand (~15) scaled for the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory total remains 1,030 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19). Summer demand regime (July) stable at ~46 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), the demand for ladies' super-skinny denim remains in a stable summer baseline regime. Over the last four weeks (P22-P25), demand has averaged 41.25 units (64, 41, 28, 32), which is a significant reduction from the May peak (~115+). The supply chain remains highly unreliable; the total 'In-transit' of 1,080 units is almost entirely composed of lost or 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P19 (totaling 1,030 units) are all significantly past the promised 2-period lead time and have not arrived despite more recent orders (like P18) arriving. The only 'real' stock is the 78 units on-hand and the 50 units ordered in P25. To trigger replenishment despite the presence of 1,030 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I am setting the lead time (L) parameter to an 'explicit' value of 25. This inflates the target base stock calculation (which is proportional to 1+L) to a level that exceeds the ghost inventory, forcing the OR backend to place new orders to meet the current demand of ~41 units/week. \u03bc\u0302 is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the current summer demand avg. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=8) to provide a safety buffer for occasional spikes.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a summer baseline, with the last 7 periods (P20-P26) averaging 43.1 units. The technical 'In-transit' total of 1094 units is severely inflated by 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost: P1, P3, P4; bottlenecked/lost: P13, P14, P19). The reliable pipeline currently consists only of orders from P25 (50 units) and P26 (14 units), totaling 64 units. With On-hand inventory at 36, the total reliable inventory (100) is becoming low relative to a two-period lead time. To bypass the ghost inventory blocking the OR backend's automated ordering, I will explicitly set L to 4. This increases the base_stock target enough to overcome the 1030 units of ghost inventory, allowing for a replenishment order. mu_hat is set to reflect the current summer average (~43 units) over the 5-period horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed August summer demand baseline at ~43 units per period (P20-P26). Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 1,030 units, necessitating explicit L inflation for replenishment.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0). Recent demand in August (P25-P27) has fluctuated between 32 and 88 units, with the most recent demand (P27) spiking to 88, suggesting a possible departure from the July-August low of ~43 units per period. The pipeline inventory of 1,044 units is heavily dominated by 'ghost inventory' from historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19), leaving only 14 units (from P26) as 'reliable' in-transit stock. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the calculated base stock, the presence of these 1,030 lost units will prevent any new orders from being placed unless the target base stock is artificially inflated. To force a replenishment order that covers the current demand regime (~55 units/week) and accounts for the ghost inventory blockage, I am setting an explicit L=25. This creates a base stock calculation of approximately (1+25) * 55 = 1430 units, which exceeds the pipeline and allows for an order of ~380 units. Mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the August demand trend, and sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to capture post-peak volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed August demand baseline shift: demand increased to 88 in P27, suggesting the summer lull may be ending. Ghost inventory remains at 1,030 units, requiring extreme L inflation to bypass pipeline deduction in the OR engine.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29 (late August), the summer demand lull (avg ~46 units) appears to be transitioning into a late-summer/back-to-school phase, as evidenced by a higher demand of 88 in Period 27 and 69 in Period 28. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with 1,030 units of 'ghost inventory' (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19) confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled but still appearing in the 'In-transit' total. Since the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the base stock to determine the order quantity, I must proactively bypass this deduction. The current on-hand is 0. To trigger an order despite the 1,126 units in-transit (1,030 ghost + 82 from P28 + 14 from P26), I will continue using an 'explicit' lead time of 20. This artificially inflates the base stock calculation (base_stock = (1+L) * mu), ensuring the backend places an order to replenish the physical stock needed for current demand levels (avg ~75 units recently). I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the recent upward trend (~79 units/week) and sigma_hat with N=10 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed August demand recovery: Avg demand (P27-P28) is ~78.5 units, up from the July baseline of ~46 units (+70%). Ghost inventory remains at 1,030 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a massive 'ghost inventory' challenge where 1,030 units from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, and 19 are stuck in 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled. With current on-hand at 0 and in-transit at 1226, the 'reliable' in-transit is only 196 units (P26: 14, P28: 82, P29: 100). The OR backend's inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 1226, which far exceeds any reasonable base stock, preventing necessary orders. Demand is currently in a recovery phase post-summer (P27-P29 average: 68.3), but the ghost inventory blocks replenishment. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must set the lead time 'L' to an 'explicit' high value. By setting L=15, the base stock (calculated as (1+L) * mean_demand) will rise enough to exceed the 1226 in-transit units, triggering an order. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the post-summer demand trend (P27-P29).

Carry-over insight: September recovery: Demand in late August/early September (P27-P29) has stabilized at ~68 units, up from the July/August low of ~40. Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,030 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31 (Sept 9), we observe the 1,030 units of 'ghost inventory' from periods P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P19 remain in the in-transit total (1,144 units). This significantly exceeds the true useful pipeline. Demand has recovered from the July/August low (~46 units) to a September stabilization around 68-75 units (last 4 periods average ~70). To force an order from the OR backend despite the high in-transit count, I am setting an explicit L=18. This inflates the base stock calculation (mu_hat = (1+L)*demand) enough to overcome the subtraction of the 1,030 ghost units. mu_hat is set based on the recent demand regime (approx 70 units/period * 19) to ensure we target a sufficient stock level for the autumn recovery.

Carry-over insight: September demand recovery confirmed: stabilization around 70 units/period (P27-P30). Persistent ghost inventory remains at 1,030 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the mid-September period where demand has stabilized at a higher baseline than the July summer lows. Demand for the last four periods (P28-P31) has averaged approximately 68.5 units (69, 48, 74, 83). The current 'In-transit' figure of 1,242 units is heavily distorted by 1,030 units of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P19). The true functional pipeline consists only of orders from P29 (100 units), P31 (98 units), and the order about to be placed in P32. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1,030-unit ghost cushion, I am using an 'explicit' lead time (L) of 15. This mathematical inflation offsets the 'In-transit' bloat in the OR calculation (base_stock - pipeline), ensuring active replenishment. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the post-summer recovery.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (Sept 23), the SKU 399087014 is entering a late September/early October retail period. Demand has stabilized at a recovery baseline following the summer lull; specifically, the average demand from Period 27 to 32 is approximately 68.6 units per week, compared to the July/August low of ~40. The most recent demand (P32) was 50 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,144 units continues to be heavily distorted by 'ghost' inventory. Verified lost or indefinitely stalled shipments include P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P19, totaling 1,030 units. The reliable pipeline consists of the P29 order (100 units) and the P31 order (already arrived in P32), plus any small residuals. In reality, with 48 units on hand and 100 units expected from P29, the usable inventory position is about 148 units. To bypass the OR engine's subtraction of the 1,030 'ghost' units from the base stock calculation, I will continue to use an 'explicit' lead time L of 20. This forces the engine to calculate a base stock target that exceeds the ghost pipeline, triggering necessary replenishment orders. Mu_hat is set to 21 periods of demand at the current baseline of ~68 units (approx 1428), and sigma_hat is adjusted to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand recovery confirmed: stabilization around 68-70 units/period (P27-P32). Cumulative ghost inventory remains at 1,030 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19), requiring explicit L inflation in the OR controller to maintain logic flow.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087014 is experiencing a consistent demand recovery in September, moving from a summer low (~43 units/period) to a stable regime of approximately 75 units/period (average of P27-P33 is 71.4). The supply chain remains heavily distorted by 1,030 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost/overdue shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19) which are included in the 'In-transit' total of 1,240, but will likely never arrive. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite this high pipeline figure, I must inflate the L parameter to a very high 'explicit' value. This forces a higher base_stock calculation (base_stock = (1+L) * mu) to overcome the pipeline deduction. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=7 to capture the September recovery while smoothing the weekly volatility. Sigma_hat is set to represent the standard deviation of this recent period.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory (lost/stalled shipments) remains constant at 1,030 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19). September demand has stabilized into a post-summer recovery regime averaging ~72 units per period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the SKU continues to suffer from massive 'ghost inventory' totaling 1,030 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P19). These units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count but are effectively lost or permanently stalled. Current 'In-transit' visible to me is 1,340, meaning only 310 units (from P29, P31, P33, P34 minus those that arrived) are potentially real. Specifically, P29 (100) is now 6 periods overdue, P31 (98) arrived in P32, P33 (96) is due now, and P34 (100) is due next. If I use default lead time, the OR backend sees 1,340 in pipeline and will never order. To force replenishment, I am inflating L to an 'explicit' value. By setting L=15, the base stock formula (L+1)*mu will exceed the ghost pipeline (1,030), triggering the necessary orders. Demand has stabilized post-summer at approximately 72 units per week (P27-P34 avg). Using N=8 for mu_hat captures this recovery phase. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost inventory (lost/stalled) remains at 1,030 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19). Recent demand (P27-P34) has stabilized at a post-summer recovery level of ~72 units/period. P29 order (100 units) is now 6 periods late and also likely lost, potentially raising ghost inventory to 1,130 in future periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P27-P35) has stabilized at a post-summer recovery average of approximately 69 units per week. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this specific post-August regime. Regarding supply, total In-transit is 1340 units, but it includes 1130 units of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost or highly probable losses: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, and now P29, which is 6 periods late). The reliable pipeline currently only contains the orders from P33 (96 units) and P34 (100 units), totaling 196 units. The OR engine subtracts all In-transit units from the calculated base stock. To force the engine to place an order when on-hand is zero and the real pipeline is insufficient, I must inflate the Lead Time (L) parameter. By setting L=19, the base stock (approx 70 * 20) will exceed the ghost inventory (1130) + real pipeline (196), triggering the necessary replenishment to cover future demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Ghost inventory (lost/stalled shipments) is updated to 1,130 units following the loss of the Period 29 order (100 units). Demand regime remains stable in the recovery phase at ~69 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, on-hand inventory is 57 units. The 'In-transit' total of 1312 units is heavily skewed by 'ghost inventory' (lost or stalled shipments). Total ghost inventory is identified as 1,130 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, and now P29, which is 8 periods overdue). The reliable pipeline currently includes P34 (100 units) and P36 (68 units), totaling 168 units. Demand has stabilized post-summer recovery; the average demand from P27 to P36 is 64.3 units. To ensure the OR backend orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I continue to use an explicit lead time L=20. This forces the base stock calculation high enough to overcome the 1,130 missing units. Demand parameters mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N=10 to capture the stable recovery regime (~65-70 units/week).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost inventory identified at 1,130 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P29). Demand regime (P27-P36) is stable at ~65 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a stable post-summer recovery demand regime. Recent demand from Period 27 to Period 37 averages roughly 65 units per week, significantly lower than the May/June peak but higher than the July lull. I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilization. The supply chain remains highly unreliable; the 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled shipments) has stabilized at 1,130 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P29). With total In-transit reported at 1,366 units, the 'real' pipeline is only 236 units (P33 which arrived at 96, P34=100, P36=68, P37=54). Since the OR engine's capped policy subtracts the full 1,366 from the base stock, I must artificially inflate the Lead Time (L) to bypass this check and ensure replenishment happens as On-hand (10) is nearly depleted. Setting L to 20 allows the base stock (calculated as (1+L)*mean) to exceed the ghost inventory barrier.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087014' currently has an 'In-transit' balance of 1312 units, which is heavily distorted by 1130 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost/stalled shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, and P29). On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (7 units). Recent demand (P34-P38) has shifted to a lower baseline of approximately 50 units/period after the September recovery peak. To bypass the OR backend's deduction of the 1130 units of ghost inventory from the base_stock calculation, I am setting 'L' to an explicit value of 25. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base_stock that exceeds the ghost inventory, triggering a replenishment order to meet the actual demand forecast of ~50 units per week. Mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (P34-P38) to capture the current demand trend (avg 49.4) without being influenced by older, higher demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Ghost inventory updated to 1130 units (including P29's 100 units). Demand regime has shifted down from the Sept recovery (~70) to a late Oct baseline of ~50 units/period (P34-P38 avg: 49.4).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. The demand regime in October/early November has cooled from the September recovery, stabilizing at approximately 50 units per period (P34-P39 average is ~50). The primary operational challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. The current 'In-transit' is 1,248 units. Based on historical analysis, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, and P29 (totaling 1,130 units) are significantly overdue and presumed lost. The reliable 'In-transit' inventory is actually only 118 units (P34's 100, P39's 4, and P40's pending arrival of P34). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1,248 units from the base stock calculation, it will not place a replenishment order unless base_stock > 1,248. At a demand of 50/wk, base_stock would normally be ~150-200. To force an order despite the 1,130 lost units, I must inflate the Lead Time (L) parameter to essentially 'bypass' the ghost inventory. I am setting L to 23 periods (promised 2 + 21 to cover the 1,030-1,130 ghost units) to ensure the OR logic continues to function. I will set mu_hat using the recent 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the current ~50 unit demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Ghost inventory confirmed at 1,130 units (Lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P29). Demand regime for late Oct/Nov is stable at ~50 units/period. Effective lead time for successful arrivals oscillates between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 41, the demand for 399087014 remains stable at the late autumn baseline of approximately 50 units (last 5 periods avg: 51.4). The supply chain remains unreliable with significant 'ghost inventory' (1,130 units from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P29) that is likely lost and will never arrive, but continues to inflate the OR engine's 'In-transit' calculation. This ghost inventory currently exceeds any reasonable base stock, which would normally stop all new orders. To maintain service levels and force replenishment, I am using an 'explicit' Lead Time (L) value. By setting L to 20, the OR backend's target base stock calculation [\u03bc * (1+L)] will exceed the ghost inventory total, triggering the necessary replenishment orders. mu_hat is set to 52 units per period (approx. 1092 over the 21-period horizon) and sigma_hat is maintained at a standard volatility estimate (sqrt(21) * 11).

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Late Nov): The SKU has 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' total of 1244 is heavily distorted by 1130 'ghost' units from historically lost or stalled shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P29). Subtracting these, the real pipeline is only 114 units (remaining portions of orders from P34 and subsequent). Demand has stabilized at a late-year baseline of ~50 units per period (P34-P41 avg: 48.6). To bypass the OR engine's logic which subtracts the full pipeline (1244) from the base stock, I am using an 'explicit' lead time L=25. This artificially inflates the base stock calculation: BaseStock \u2248 (1+25)*50 \u2248 1300. This ensures the engine places an order that covers immediate needs plus a buffer, overcoming the ghost inventory deduction. Demand method 'recent_N' with N=8 (P34-P41) accurately reflects the current ~50 units/period regime.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 1,130 units (Lost/Stalled: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P29). Demand regime for Nov/late-year remains stable at ~49 units/period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ladies Denim' spiked significantly in Period 42 (133 units) compared to the late Oct/Nov baseline of ~49 units, possibly due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (Date: 2019/11/25). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,289 is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, and now P29, P31, P34), totaling approximately 1,244 units (1130 previous + 100 from P34/P31 discrepancies). Effectively, the pipeline is nearly empty except for the P42 order of 45 units. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, I must use an 'explicit' lead time (L) to bypass this ghost inventory and an 'explicit' mu_hat to account for both the recent spike and the expected stabilization around 60-70 units for December. Setting L to 30 ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the ghost pipeline, and mu_hat is set to reflect the mean of the recent stable period plus a buffer for the seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost/stalled) is updated to approximately 1,244 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P29, P31, P34). Demand spike in P42 (133 units) confirmed, likely linked to late-November retail events.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Dec 9), we are navigating the post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Demand spiked in P42 (133 units) but returned to a baseline of 43 in P43. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' of lost/stalled shipments. Total In-transit is 1,416, but based on carry-over insights, at least 1,244 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P29, P31, P34) are confirmed lost or permanently stalled. The OR engine subtracts all 1,416 units from the base stock calculation. To force the engine to place an order when on-hand is 0, I must set the lead time parameter 'L' high enough so that (1+L) * mu_hat exceeds the 1,416 ghost units. With a recent demand mean of ~55 (averaging the P42 spike and P43 dip), a value of L=25 is used (26 * 55 = 1,430) to bypass the pipeline deduction logic and trigger replenishment. mu_hat is set to 55 to reflect the post-spike stabilization, and sigma_hat is kept at a default level based on recent history to cover volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost/stalled) remains approximately 1,244 units. Demand has stabilized post-November spike toward a late-year baseline of ~55 units/period. Explicit L inflation is required to maintain replenishment logic against pipeline distortion.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (mid-December), the system is grappling with severe supply chain distortion. In-transit inventory is listed as 1,416 units, but history confirms that approximately 1,244 units are 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P29, P31, P34). These units are significantly past their lead time and likely lost or indefinitely stalled. To bypass this, I must set the lead time parameter 'L' to an extreme value ('explicit': 15). This forces the OR backend to increase the calculated base stock (base_stock = (1+L) * mu) to a point where it exceeds the 1,416 ghost units, triggering a fresh replenishment order. Demand is currently in a post-November spike stabilization phase, averaging approximately 52 units over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). I will set 'mu_hat' based on this recent average to ensure the replenishment order covers current demand levels. 'sigma_hat' is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture the recent volatility seen during the late November spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Ghost inventory (lost units) effectively totals 1,244 units. Replenishment logic requires L to be inflated to at least 15+ to trigger orders while real on-hand remains zero. Recent demand is stable at ~52 units/period post-November.

Daily Reward (R_t): $688.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand reflects a significant holiday spike, with Period 45 recording 204 units. While the late-year demand had stabilized around 50 units (P34-P38: 49.4), the December peak (P42-P45) averages ~103 units, likely due to pre-Christmas shopping. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure is heavily distorted by 1,244 'ghost' units (confirmed lost or permanently stalled shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P29, P31, P34), leaving a real pipeline of only the P45 order (107 units). To ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order despite this massive ghost inventory, I must inflate the lead time 'L' explicitly. Setting L to 28 periods effectively pushes the base stock target high enough to clear the 1,244-unit pipeline deduction. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the December spike and ensure sufficient stock for any remaining holiday or post-holiday rebound.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Massive seasonal demand spike confirmed mid-December (204 units in P45). Cumulative ghost inventory (lost/stalled) remains at approximately 1,244 units, requiring extreme L inflation (L=28) to bypass pipeline deductions. Real pipeline inventory consists only of the P45 order (107 units).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand holiday season/year-end recovery phase. Period 45 saw a massive spike (204 units) and Period 46 remained high (140 units), suggesting a year-end surge for denim products. I am forecasting a mu_hat based on these recent 5 periods (avg ~110 units/period) to capture this elevated demand. The most critical issue remains 'ghost inventory': In-transit shows 1588 units, but based on the Carry-Over Insights, at least 1,244 units from older periods (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P29, P31, P34) are confirmed lost or permanently stalled. If I use a standard Lead Time (L=2), the OR backend will see (Pipeline + On-hand) = 1588, which far exceeds the Base Stock (approx 330), resulting in zero orders. To bypass this and force a replenishment order when on-hand is zero, I must inflate L so that (1+L) * mu_hat > 1588. Setting L=30 creates a base_stock of (31 * 110) \u2248 3410 units, ensuring the logic triggers an order despite the 1588 'ghost' units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the high volatility (31 to 204) seen in Dec.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Ghost inventory (lost units) effectively totals 1,244 units. Year-end demand surge confirmed with P45-P46 averaging 172 units. Replenishment requires L=30 to overcome pipeline distortion.
