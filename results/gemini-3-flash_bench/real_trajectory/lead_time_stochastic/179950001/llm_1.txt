The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 4. I must cover demand for the current period (Period 1) plus the lead time periods (Periods 2 and 3). Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The recent demand sample (2019-02-04) was 36 units. As we move further into February, demand might stabilize or continue to soften after the New Year peak. Taking an average of the last few weeks (approx. 50-60 units) and accounting for the 3-period coverage needed (P1, P2, P3), a safe target is approximately 150-180 units. Since I start with 0 inventory, I need to place a significant order to establish a pipeline and fulfill upcoming demand once the shipment arrives.",

The order placed in Period 1 (160 units) should arrive during Period 3 resolution and be visible now, or arrive during Period 4 resolution. Given lead time = 2, the Period 1 order (160) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 and be usable for Period 4 demand. The Period 3 order (50) is expected to arrive in Period 5. Pipeline total is 210. Calculating (L+1) exposure: Lead time L=2, so we need to cover 3 periods of demand (Periods 4, 5, 6). Average demand is ~65 units/period. Required inventory = 65 * 3 = 195. Current pipeline is 210. However, because we missed all sales in Periods 1-3, there is likely suppressed demand or a need to ensure we don't stock out again once deliveries stabilize. Since we already have 210 in the pipeline and lead time is 2, those units will cover current and near-future demand.

The Period 1 order (160 units) was expected to arrive in Period 3 (1+2=3) or be visible in Period 4. It is now Period 6 and nothing has arrived. The 'In-transit' total is 320 (160+0+50+50+60). Given that Period 1 order is 5 periods old (well past L=2), there is a significant risk that early shipments are delayed or lost. However, assuming the system isn't completely broken, a large volume of stock (320 units) is in the pipeline. With an average demand of ~70, covering L+1 periods (3 periods) requires ~210 units. Our 'In-transit' of 320 theoretically covers this.

However, orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 260 units) are currently missing/late, and only the Period 5 order arrived.

On-hand is currently 10. The 40 units ordered in Period 6 are expected in Period 7 or 8.

Expected demand for the upcoming (L+1) periods (P14, P15, P16) is forecasted at approximately 60-70 units per period, considering the recent upward trend. Current On-hand is low at 9 units. In-transit consists of 370 units, but closer inspection reveals that 260 of these units (orders from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost/missing based on carry-over insights. Effective In-transit is actually 110 units (P12: 50, P13: 60). The P12 order is expected to arrive in P14 (L=2). To cover demand for P14-P16 (approx 180-210 units) and maintain a safety stock against lead time variability, I need to ensure a pipeline of enough units. Current Total Pipeline (On-hand 9 + Effective In-transit 110) = 119. To reach a target of ~230 units (3 periods of demand + safety), I need to order approximately 110 units. However, I must be cautious of the 'shadow' in-transit units (the 260 missing items) and not over-order if they unexpectedly arrive, though they are treated as lost for now.",

Lead time analysis: P23 order arrived in 3 periods (drift from promised 2), and several historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19) are confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 930 reflects many lost units. The 'reliable' pipeline includes orders from P24 (120), P25 (50), and P26 (80). P24 is now due (P27 arrival). Total reliable pipeline is 120 + 50 + 80 = 250 units. Targeting a 3-period coverage (L+1) at a mean of 70 units/period (~210 units). Since the reliable pipeline (250) already covers this, and we have a high in-transit count that might include delayed but still active shipments, a conservative order is placed to avoid excessive holding costs in a cooling demand regime while ensuring we recover from the current stockout.",

  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Austin basic leather hip belt', a fashion accessory. Period 40 falls on Nov 11 (Singles' Day/Early Holiday season), but historically demand has dropped significantly in late autumn (P38: 48 units, P39: 41 units) compared to the Sept/Oct peaks of ~95 units. This suggests we are in a low-demand regime before any potential year-end holiday spike. On-hand inventory is high at 206 units, sufficient for ~5 periods at current demand rates. Total 'In-transit' is 1290, but 1120 units are confirmed lost (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29, and P34). The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P38 (100 units) and P39 (50 units). Lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods. Given the current surplus (206 units) and the low recent demand (avg ~45), the priority is reducing holding costs while maintaining a small buffer for safety. Ordering 40 units maintains the pipeline as we move toward the end of the game (P47).",

The calendar date is mid-November, suggesting a stabilization at this lower level before any potential year-end holiday shifts. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P36 took 3 periods, P37 took 1 period).

  "rationale": "In Period 42, demand spiked unexpectedly to 227 units despite the low-demand regime. Analyzing the date (Nov 25, 2019), this corresponds to the week of Black Friday, which explains the surge for a 'basic leather hip belt' (a giftable accessory). As we move into early December (Period 43, Dec 2), demand is expected to remain elevated due to holiday shopping, though likely lower than the Black Friday peak. Previous holiday patterns (Mother's Day) saw sustained demand for ~5-6 weeks. I will forecast demand at approximately 100-130 for the next few periods. Regarding inventory: On-hand is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1320 is misleading because 1120 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29, P34). The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P38 (100), P40 (40), P41 (20), and P42 (20). The P38 order (100 units) is now at L=5 and is highly likely lost or severely delayed. This leaves a reliable pipeline of only 80 units (P40-P42). To cover the holiday season (L+1 = 4 periods) and replenish stock, I need ~400-500 units. Accounting for the 80 reliable units in transit, an order of 350-400 is necessary to meet demand and rebuild safety stock.",
