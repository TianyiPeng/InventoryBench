Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 179950001, a women's leather hip belt. Current inventory is 0. Historical demand shows a steady decline from early January (105 units) through February 4th (36 units). The product description (Austin basic leather hip belt) suggests it's a staple accessory, but demand likely follows seasonal fashion cycles or post-holiday cooling. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To set initial parameters, I will use a conservative window of the 5 available historical samples to establish a baseline mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N=5 captures the most recent demand behavior while excluding older, potentially irrelevant peaks from early January. Since we have no lead time observations yet, L will remain at default (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Womens leather belt'. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) were 105, 62, 72, 48, 36. Period 1 demand was 40. There is a clear downward trend from the initial January spikes, suggesting the post-holiday/early-year peak is subsiding. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the Period 1 order (109 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 2. Following the lead time rules, that order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. For Period 2, I need to set parameters to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture the recent lower volume (avg ~51) rather than the older high spikes (105). Sigma will also use recent_N to reflect the current volatility. Lead time L will remain at the promised 'default' of 2 as we have no evidence yet of delays.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, representing a transition from late winter to spring. The product is a women's leather belt (Austin basic leather hip belt), a staple accessory. Looking at the demand history (105, 62, 72, 48, 36 from provided samples, and 40, 87 from recent periods), there is a noticeable spike in Period 2 (87 units). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first two orders (109 and 77 units) are still in transit. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (109 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. To ensure sufficient coverage for the lead time + review period (L+1 = 3), I will use the mean of the available historical samples (105, 62, 72, 48, 36, 40, 87). Mean \u2248 64.3. mu_hat should target (1+2)*64.3 = 192.9. Standard deviation of these 7 samples is 26.6. sigma_hat should be sqrt(3)*26.6 \u2248 46.1. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this combined history and account for the recent demand volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'Austin basic leather hip belt' has seen historic demand (pre-game) averaging 64.6 units/week. Game periods 1-3 demand were 40, 87, and 57 (average 61.3). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals for orders placed in P1 (promised lead time 2) are not visible until the start of P4's decision (which we just reached) but the 'conclude' message for Period 3 (where P1's order would have arrived according to the lead time definition) showed arrived=0. However, looking at the 'Period Execution Sequence', an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 3's arrival resolution and is visible in the P3 conclude message. Since P3 conclude shows arrived=0, and the promised lead time is 2, the P1 order is either delayed or lost. Total in-transit is 266 units (109+77+80). I will stick to the promised lead time L=2 for now to see if shipments arrive in the next period before assuming a shift or loss. For demand, I'll use all 8 available data points (5 pre-game + 3 game) which average 62.1. mu_hat will be set to (1+L)*62.1 = 186.3. Sigma_hat is calculated using all available samples.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a women's leather hip belt. We are currently in early March (Period 5). History shows significant lost sales in Periods 1-3 due to zero starting inventory and initial procurement delays. In Period 4, the order from Period 2 (77 units) arrived exactly at the promised lead time (2 periods). However, the order from Period 1 (109 units) has NOT arrived and is now 1 period overdue (placed P1, promised P3, currently P5). This suggests a possible lost shipment or delay, though it remains in 'In-transit'. Demand has been steady, averaging ~57 units per week over the last 5 samples (105, 62, 72, 48, 36) and ~61 units in the most recent periods. Given the promised lead time (L=2) and current review period, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). With demand around 60/week, mu_hat should target ~180. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture volatility. L is kept at 'default' (2) as the Period 2 order arrival confirms the system's baseline, but we monitor the missing Period 1 order.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. The product is a women's leather belt. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 67 units over the last 10 weeks (5 pre-game, 5 in-game). Period 5 saw a demand spike to 98, potentially linked to the lead-up to spring fashion demand. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) and awaiting arrivals. Historical lead time analysis: Only one order (from Period 2) has arrived, taking exactly 2 periods as promised. The Period 1 order (109 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods elapsed), and the Period 3 order (80 units) is also overdue (promised at P5). Given the 'In-transit' total of 211 matches Period 1 (109) + Period 3 (80) + Period 5 (22), we must assume the earlier shipments are significantly delayed or lost. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat based on the recent higher demand (mean of last 3 periods \u2248 72) to capture the upward trend and ensure target stock covers the (L+1)=3 periods. Sigma is calculated from recent volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 analysis: The product is a 'Austin basic leather hip belt'. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history (Samples: 105, 62, 72, 48, 36; Game: 40, 87, 57, 61, 98, 50) shows a mean of approximately 65. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have varied (P4 arrived after 2 periods, while P6 arrived after only 1 period). Orders from P1 and P3 are unaccounted for in concluding messages, suggesting they may be lost or significantly delayed, leaving the current 'In-transit' figure of 262 unreliable regarding actual arrival dates. Given the stockout (on-hand=0) and high demand volatility, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend during the active game period. For Lead Time (L), I will stick to 'calculate' to let the backend average the seen lead times (1 and 2). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N with N=6 to focus on the game's demand realization which seems higher than the pre-game samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/01. The item is a women's leather hip belt. Current inventory is 0 with 262 units in-transit. Historic demand (including pre-game samples) averages around 62 units/week. However, current demand has been consistently around 50-98 units in the last 7 periods (avg ~64). We have a significant issue with lost shipments: Period 1 (109 units) and Period 3 (80 units) orders have not arrived after 7 and 5 periods respectively, well beyond the promised 2-period lead time. Period 2 arrived and Period 5 arrived (the latter with a 1-period LT). Because the backend OR calculates its own base stock and caps, and it doesn't know about 'lost' orders, I must use 'explicit' to override the pipeline estimate. Since 189 units are effectively lost/overdue, the backend might think we are over-stocked. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent evidence (N=7) to reflect the slightly higher demand average (~64) compared to the long-term history including pre-game (~58). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to let the backend observe the actual arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 1 (109 units) and Period 3 (80 units) are confirmed as lost/severely delayed (5+ periods elapsed).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/04/08). History shows demand for this leather belt is relatively stable with a mean of approximately 60.5 units/period across the 8 periods of play. Current on-hand is 26. In-transit consists of 189 units, but 109 (from P1) and 80 (from P3) are confirmed as lost/severely delayed in the Carry-over Insights, meaning effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. The OR backend is unaware of these lost units and will subtract the full 189 from its target stock, likely leading to a zero order when one is needed. To force an order and replenish stock, I will use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat. I am setting L=2 (promised) and mu_hat based on the average demand (~65) for L+1 periods (3 * 65 = 195). By setting mu_hat to 384, I offset the 189 'ghost' units in-transit (384 - 189 = 195 target), ensuring the OR backend targets a net inventory of 195. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=8) to capture volatility (~21 per period, scaled by sqrt(3) is ~36.4).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The item is a 'Womens leather hip belt'. Historically, demand is stable but we've faced stockouts (On-hand is 0). The demand average of all samples is ~66 units/period. The pipeline inventory (351 units) includes confirmed lost/stale orders from Period 1 (109) and Period 3 (80), totaling 189 units that will likely never arrive. Excluding these, the 'effective' pipeline is 162 units (from Period 9). Because the OR engine counts all 'In-transit' units, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat to compensate for the 189 'ghost' units. Promised Lead Time (L) is 2. The required base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Forecasted demand is ~66 units/period. Target Inventory = 66 * 3 = 198 units. However, since the OR backend subtracts 351 units (In-transit), I set mu_hat (explicit) to a value that forces an order. Calculated: 198 (target) + 189 (lost units) = 387. Setting mu_hat to 387 and using a conservative sigma_hat based on the last 5 samples.

Earlier demand (P1-P5) was slightly higher but also affected by stockouts. Actual lead times observed for concluded orders are 2, 1, 2, 1, resulting in an average of 1.5 periods, which is faster than the promised 2 periods. However, orders from Period 1 and Period 3 are confirmed lost. Total in-transit is 288, but this includes the lost orders (109 + 80 = 189). The OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' will incorrectly include these 189 lost units because it does not recognize lost shipments. This would lead to under-ordering. To compensate, I set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost units. Assuming L=2 (promised), mu_hat should cover 3 periods. Forecasted demand = 45/week. Required base stock = 3 * 45 + 189 = 324. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to force the backend to place an order despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: OR engine logic for pipeline_inventory currently includes 189 units from lost orders (P1: 109, P3: 80), requiring explicit mu_hat inflation to maintain stock levels.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU '179950001' (Womens Leather Belt) shows a relatively stable demand regime following the initial volatile phase. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 48.6 units, compared to the overall historical average of 59.8 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 288 units includes 189 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed as lost, as they have not arrived for 9+ periods. The OR backend's 'capped policy' subtracts the full pipeline (288 units) from the calculated base stock. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to these 'phantom' units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Following the logic established in Period 11, I will target a base stock level that covers 3 periods of demand (L=2 + 1) plus a safety buffer, while adding the 189 lost units back into the target. Calculation: Forecasted demand (approx 50/wk) * 3 = 150. Safety stock for 95% service level (~1.65 * std * sqrt(3)) is roughly 60 units. Total base stock target = 210 units. To offset the 189 phantom units in the backend, I set mu_hat = 210 + 189 = 399. L remains 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P6, P9) show lead times of 1-2 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Demand for this leather belt has stabilized after early February fluctuations, with the last 4 periods showing a mean of 49.25 units (46, 43, 50, 58). As previously noted, orders from Period 1 (109 units) and Period 3 (80 units) totaling 189 units are effectively lost. This creates a critical issue: the OR backend considers these 189 units as part of 'pipeline_inventory', which reduces the final order amount and risks stockouts as on-hand inventory (11 units) is low. To compensate, I must explicitly set mu_hat. Following the formula: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. I need the OR backend to order sufficiently to cover upcoming demand while ignoring the phantom 189 units. Target base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 50/wk) at a high service level (~95% or q=0.95) would be ~150 + safety stock. However, since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (189 + recent orders), I must inflate mu_hat by the lost 189 units to force an order. Recent demand average is 50. Mu_hat (L+1) = 3 * 50 = 150. Padded mu_hat = 150 + 189 = 339. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this override. L remains at the promised 2 periods (calculate method). Sigma_hat uses the last 5 samples to reflect recent stability.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (mid-May). Demand has been relatively stable with a slight upward trend in recent weeks (77 last period). The primary challenge is the inventory calculation: current on-hand is 0, and the OR backend sees 389 units in-transit. However, 189 of those units (from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost/severely delayed. The backend policy uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to decide the order. To compensate for the 189 ghost units in the pipeline, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. Promised lead time is 2, so the system targets (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Average demand over the last 5 periods is ~55. Expected base stock without losses would be 3 * 55 = 165. To overcome the 189-unit 'phantom' pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the current 'lost' inventory (189) plus 3 periods of expected demand (165), totaling 354. This forces the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated in-transit numbers. I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. We are experiencing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P12 arrived in 2 periods). Crucially, 189 units from P1 and P3 are lost but remain in the 'in-transit' count (292 total in-transit - 189 lost - 99 from P10 - 4 from P14 = 0, noting P10 is overdue as it's been 5 periods). Since the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' includes these ghost units (189 lost + likely P10 at 99 units), we must bypass the standard logic using 'explicit' mu_hat. Demand in P14 spiked to 139, likely due to late spring/early summer seasonality for accessories. Average demand across the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 73.4. Given the lead time is effectively 2, we target coverage for 3 periods (L+1). Target stock = 73.4 * 3 = 220. To force an order despite the 292 'in-transit', I will set mu_hat to a value that offsets the phantom pipeline units: 220 (target) + 292 (phantom pipeline) = 512. This ensures the backend places an order to reach the physical target. Sigma_hat is set to cover the recent volatility (stdev of last 5 periods is approx 38, scaled: 38 * sqrt(3) \u2248 66).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in P14 (139 units), elevating the 5-period average to 73.4. Lead time P10 (99 units) is now highly suspect/lost (ordered P10, currently P15, no arrival). Total phantom pipeline (P1, P3, P10) is 288 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), the SKU 179950001 is facing severe stockouts (on-hand: 0) and high demand (P14: 139, P15: 138), likely driven by a 40% uptick in late spring/early summer belt demand. The OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) is severely compromised by 'phantom' in-transit units. Analysis confirms Period 1 (109 units), Period 3 (80 units), and now Period 10 (99 units) are lost, totaling 288 units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes are arriving. Total In-transit is 526, but 'real' in-transit is only 238 (P14: 4 units, P15: 234 units). To force a corrective order, use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I estimate next period's demand at 140. Using L=2, demand across (L+1) periods is 420. To offset the 288 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 708 (420 + 288). This forces the backend to subtract the full in-transit (526) from a base stock built on 708, ensuring an order is actually generated to replenish physical stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike sustained (P14-P15 avg: 138.5 vs historical ~50). Period 10 shipment (99 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed since order). Total phantom pipeline inventory reaches 288 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), we are in a high-demand regime for the Austin basic leather hip belt, likely driven by early summer fashion trends. Demand in P14-P16 averaged 138.3 units per period, up from a previous baseline of ~50. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system shows 832 units in-transit. However, 288 of those units are confirmed 'phantom' stock from lost orders in Periods 1 (109 units), 3 (80 units), and 10 (99 units). The OR engine logic calculates orders by subtracting pipeline inventory from the base stock; since 288 units will never arrive, the engine's internal view of the pipeline is inflated, causing it to under-order. To compensate and maintain stock for the current (L+1)=3 period window, I am setting L to the promised 2 periods but using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the recent high-demand average (138.3) over 3 periods (415 units) and add 288 units to offset the phantom pipeline. This results in an explicit mu_hat of 703. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility of the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift confirmed (P14-P16): mean demand increased from ~50 to 138.3 (+176%). This coincides with late Spring/early Summer seasonality for accessories.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1880.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we received both orders from Period 15 (234 units) and Period 16 (306 units), bringing our on-hand inventory to 419 units. This influx resolves the immediate stockout risk. The high demand regime (Periods 14-17) continues, with an average of 134 units over the last 4 periods, significantly higher than the initial average of ~50. I will use recent_N=4 to set mu_hat, capturing this sustained shift. As documented in Carry-over Insights, we must account for 288 units of 'phantom pipeline' inventory (from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, and 10) that stay in the backend's calculation. With 419 on-hand and 292 'in-transit' (288 of which are lost), the OR engine will see 419 + 292 = 711 available units. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover future demand, I will use an explicit mu_hat that adds the 288 phantom units back into the target base stock. Target demand for (L+Review) = (2+1) * 134 = 402. Adding the phantom 288 units to protect against the engine's overestimation of stock gives an explicit mu_hat of 690.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). We have entered a sustained high-demand regime since P14 (avg: ~132 units/period). This matches late spring/early summer seasonality for accessories. On-hand inventory is currently 293 units. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 296 units, which consists of the Period 18 order (4 units), Period 14 order (4 units), and the confirmed 'phantom' units from lost shipments in Period 1 (109 units), Period 3 (80 units), and Period 10 (99 units), totaling 288 phantom units. The OR engine subtracts these 288 units from the calculated base stock, which would lead to severe under-ordering. To compensate, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock target. My target base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~132 units/period is 396 units. To offset the 288 units of phantom inventory subtracted by the backend, I set mu_hat to 396 + 288 = 684. For sigma, I use the standard deviation of the high-demand regime (P14-P18: 139, 138, 138, 121, 126; std \u2248 8.35 over 3 periods \u2248 14.5).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 20 (June 24). Demand Analysis: We are in a sustained high-demand regime for this leather hip belt, likely driven by summer seasonality. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P14-P19) is 130.6 units, compared to the pre-shift average of ~50. Recent demand is stable around this higher level (P17: 121, P18: 126, P19: 122). Inventory/LT Analysis: Promised LT is 2. Recent actual lead times have been 1-2 periods (P15: 2, P16: 1, P18: 1). Pipeline Correction: The 'phantom inventory' issue persists. The OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' units from the target base stock. Currently, in-transit is 411 units. This consists of: 119 (P19 - valid), 4 (P14 - valid/arriving), and 288 units from 'lost' orders (P1, P3, P10). Because the OR engine counts these 288 lost units as available stock, it will under-order unless we inflate mu_hat. Strategy: Set L to calculate (backend average). Use explicit mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~131 units/period) plus the 288-unit phantom deficit. Target Base Stock = (3 periods * 131) + 288 = 681 units. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the 288-unit ghost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Consolidated phantom pipeline: 288 units (Orders from P1, P3, P10) are permanently lost but still included in in-transit counts by the OR backend.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01. We are in the middle of a sustained high-demand regime for leather hip belts (likely driven by summer seasonality), with the last 7 periods (P14-P20) averaging 126 units/week compared to the historical baseline of ~50. However, P20 demand dropped slightly to 98, so I will prioritize the last 7 samples to capture this regime shift properly. The primary challenge remains the OR engine's 'phantom pipeline' of 288 units (orders from P1, P3, and P10) which are confirmed lost but stay in the in-transit calculation. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Calculations: Baseline mu_hat (L=2) for the high-demand regime is (1+2)*126 = 378. To offset the 288 phantom units, I adjust mu_hat to 378 + 288 = 666. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * std_dev(last 7 periods: 139, 138, 138, 121, 126, 122, 98) = 1.732 * 14.8 = ~25.6. Setting L to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P18, P16, P15) vary between 1-2 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, following a sustained demand shift that began in mid-May (Period 14). Over the last five periods (P17-P21), demand has averaged 113 units, significantly higher than the early-year baseline of ~50. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 632 units in-transit. Crucially, 288 units in the 'In-transit' count (from P1, P3, and P10) are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. This 'phantom' pipeline prevents the OR engine from ordering enough real stock because it believes the pipeline is fuller than it is. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: 1) True lead time (L) is approx 2 periods based on history. 2) Target stock level (base stock) needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods at an average of 113 units/period, plus a safety buffer. 3) To neutralize the 288 units of phantom inventory in the backend calculation [final_order = (mu_hat + safety) - (actual_pipeline + phantom_pipeline)], I must inflate mu_hat by approximately the size of the phantom pipeline. My chosen mu_hat of 630 reflects ((113 * 3) + 288) = 627, rounded to 630. This ensures the backend places an order that ignores the 288 lost units and covers current demand levels. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for higher volatility during this elevated demand regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15. We are in a high-demand regime for this Austin basic leather hip belt, likely driven by summer seasonality. Historical demand from P14-P22 has averaged approximately 111 units per period. In P22, we saw 75 units demand, showing a slight cooling but still significantly higher than the early-year baseline of ~50. A major concern remains the 'phantom inventory': orders from P1 (109 units), P3 (80 units), and P10 (99 units) for a total of 288 units are confirmed lost/delayed but still recorded as 'In-transit' by the OR engine. This 288-unit inflation causes the back-end to under-order significantly. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat to a value that covers the expected demand for (L+1) periods PLUS the 288-unit deficit. Using a 5-period recent average (approx 93 units/period) for 3 periods (L=2) gives 279 units. Adding the 288 lost units results in a target mu_hat of 567. We use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this higher demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for the 'Austin basic leather hip belt' has transitioned from a high-summer spike (P14-P19, avg ~130) to a more moderate summer level (P20-P23, avg ~85). Currently, on-hand inventory is healthy at 204 units. The 'In-transit' count of 411 units includes 288 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 109, P3: 80, P10: 99), meaning the functional pipeline is only 123 units (411 - 288). To compensate for the 288-unit 'phantom pipeline' that prevents the OR engine from ordering enough, I must inflate mu_hat. Specifically, for a (L+1)=3 period window, I expect demand to be approximately 85 units per period. Target stock = 85 * 3 = 255. However, since the OR engine subtracts the full 411 in-transit units, I must add 288 units to the forecast to offset the ghost inventory. Therefore, mu_hat = 255 + 288 = 543. L remains at the promised 2 periods as recent deliveries (P20-22) arrived within 1-2 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand has stabilized after the late Spring/early Summer peak (P14-P19), with the last four periods (P21-P24) showing a lower mean demand of 73.25. The phantom pipeline remains a critical factor: orders from Period 1 (109), Period 3 (80), and Period 10 (99) totaling 288 units are confirmed lost but still deducted from our ordering capacity by the OR backend. Current in-transit is 411, meaning 288 units are 'dead' and 123 units are legitimate (likely the order from P19). We must set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the 'pipeline_inventory' deduction. Since the OR logic is 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, we must target mu_hat \u2248 (Desired Base Stock) + 288. Using the lower demand regime (73.25/period) for a lead time of 2+1=3 periods results in a demand expectation of ~220 units. Adding the 288 units of phantom inventory, we set mu_hat to 500 to ensure the backend places orders that cover actual demand despite the persistent phantom data. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent 5-period volatility to reflect current stability.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/5. We are seeing a deceleration in demand from the late Spring/early Summer peak. The last four periods (P22-P25) have seen demand of 75, 72, 52, and 66, which is significantly lower than the P14-P20 average of ~125. This suggests the seasonal peak for the 'Austin basic leather hip belt' is tapering off. Additionally, the 'In-transit' figure of 411 units contains 288 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 109, P3: 80, P10: 99) as identified in Carry-Over Insights. These 'phantom' units prevent the OR backend from ordering enough stock because it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I must explicitly set mu_hat. Following the logic of (1+L)*forecast + phantom_stock, and using a conservative recent forecast of 66 units/period (avg of last 4), for L=2, the required base stock is approximately 3*66 + 288 = 486. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the phantom inventory problem and maintain a service level consistent with a declining but still relevant demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression observed: P22-P25 mean demand dropped to 66 units/period from previous peak of ~125 (-47%). Seasonal plateau/decline phase confirmed for late Summer.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019/08/12), we are in a late summer demand regime for this leather belt. Demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) with an average of approximately 66.8 units per period, down from the early summer peak of ~125. The current on-hand inventory is low (17 units). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 430 units is highly misleading for the OR backend due to 288 units of confirmed lost/phantom inventory from Periods 1, 3, and 10 (109+80+99). The real pipeline inventory is 142 units (430 - 288). To compensate for the 288 units the OR backend wrongly believes are coming, I must inflate mu_hat. Using the recent 5-period mean (66.8) and a lead time of 2, the expected base stock for (L+1) periods is approximately 200 units (66.8 * 3). To offset the 288 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer that ensures the base stock calculation results in a replenishment order despite the high 'In-transit' count. Setting mu_hat to (1+L) * 200 to push the base stock target high enough to clear the phantom units and cover incoming demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/19. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime compared to the late Spring spike; the mean demand for the last 6 periods (P22-P27) is approximately 66.2 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' count of 497 units is heavily inflated by 288 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 109, P3: 80, P10: 99), meaning the functional pipeline is only 209 units. To compensate for the OR backend's use of the inflated pipeline_inventory (which would otherwise prevent necessary ordering), I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the current demand (avg 66.2) for the review + lead period (1+2=3 periods), which is ~199 units. Since the backend subtracts the (phantom) 497 units from this base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the desired replenishment. Adding the 288 'phantom' units to the 199 base stock requirement gives an explicit mu_hat of ~487. However, I must also account for the cap logic: mu_hat/(1+L) + z*sigma_hat/sqrt(1+L). By setting mu_hat to 487 and L to 2, the system should allow for a sufficient order to recover from the stockout.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 179950001 (Austin basic leather hip belt) is currently experiencing out-of-stock conditions. Demand has stabilized into a late-summer regime (P24-P28 mean approx. 67 units/period). The primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline'\u2014a total of 288 units from orders placed in Period 1 (109), Period 3 (80), and Period 10 (99) that are confirmed lost but still counted as in-transit by the OR engine. This reduces the engine's perceived need to order, causing perpetual stockouts. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide the OR engine with a target that includes the true expected demand over (L+1) periods (approx. 201 units) PLUS the 288 units of lost inventory. This forces the base stock level (around 489 units) to exceed the phantom pipeline (currently 511 in-transit, including 288 phantom and recent active orders from P26-P28), triggering the necessary replacement orders.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. The product (Womens leather belt) showed a significant demand peak in early summer (Period 17 context) and has now stabilized at a lower level (~70-80 units/period). However, the system is currently stock-outs (On-hand: 0) because recent orders (P26, P27) haven't arrived yet. Crucially, the 'In-transit' count of 522 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders from P1 (109), P3 (80), and P10 (99) totaling 288 units are confirmed lost. The remaining valid pipeline is 234 units (ordered P26-P29). Because the OR engine subtracts 'total in-transit' (including the 288 lost units) from its target stock, it will under-order unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) projected demand (3 * 75 = 225) PLUS the 288 lost units, totaling 513. This forces the engine to target a higher stock level, effectively neutralizing the phantom units it thinks are coming. Lead time remains erratic (1-2 periods), so I use 'calculate' to reflect the variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: As of P30, total phantom pipeline inventory remains 288 units (P1, P3, P10). Demand regime has stabilized at ~75 units/period following the summer peak.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31, the current status shows 0 units on-hand and 460 units in-transit. However, our carry-over insights confirm that 288 units in the 'in-transit' pipeline are permanently lost (Orders from P1: 109, P3: 80, and P10: 99). This means the actual functional pipeline is 172 units (460 - 288). To compensate for the OR backend subtracting these 288 invisible units from the order calculation, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. The recent demand (P22-P30) has stabilized at an average of 76.5 units per period. The standard required base stock would be (1+L)*76.5 = 229.5. To offset the 288 phantom units and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I set mu_hat to 550 (approx 230 + 320 to ensure replenishment occurs despite the pipeline error). I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat to force this correction. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 (the current demand regime length) to capture recent volatility without overreacting to the P30 spike.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/16 (Period 32). On-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been robust, recently averaging 98 units over the last 3 periods (P29-P31: 83, 111, 100). The internal OR logic for pipeline_inventory currently includes 288 units from 'phantom' lost orders (Periods 1, 3, and 10), which the engine believes are still coming. To compensate for this 288-unit deficit and prevent stockouts, I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat. Following the logic Base Stock = (1+L) * Forecast + Safety Stock, and targeting a forecast of ~95 units/period for the (1+L)=3 period window (285 units) while covering the 288-unit phantom gap, I set mu_hat to 573. This ensures the OR backend issues an order to cover real demand despite the inflated in-transit count. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent demand volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the early year average, with the last 5 periods (P28-P32) averaging 94.4 units. The OR backend's 'In-transit' count of 469 units is significantly inflated by 288 units of confirmed lost inventory from Periods 1, 3, and 10 (109 + 80 + 99). To ensure the OR engine maintains sufficient stock despite this 'phantom' pipeline, I must provide an explicit mu_hat. For a promised lead time of 2 (3 periods total coverage), I am setting mu_hat based on the current 5-period average (94.4 * 3 = 283.2) plus an adjustment to offset the 288 phantom units, targeting a base stock level that ignores the lost shipments. I will use 'calculate' for L as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent 5-period volatility to account for the current demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1292.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 179950001 (Women's leather belt) has shown extreme volatility recently, with a massive spike to 189 units in Period 33, likely driven by late September/early October seasonality. The current 5-period average (P29-P33) is ~114 units, up from the previously stabilized ~75. However, there is a persistent technical challenge: 288 units from lost shipments (P1: 109, P3: 80, P10: 99) are still counted in the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory'. This 'phantom' inventory prevents the engine from ordering enough to cover actual demand. To counteract this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand for (L+1) periods (L=2) is 3 * 114 = 342. To force the OR backend to order despite the 288 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 630 (342 + 288) to ensure the target base stock is high enough to generate an order that covers real customer needs. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture this high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in P33 (189 units), likely related to early Autumn fashion transitions. Total phantom pipeline remains 288 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/07. Demand has been volatile: P33 saw a spike (189), while P34 returned to a more moderate level (95). The average demand over the last 5 periods is 116.8 units. Lead time is generally stable at ~2 periods, though P27 took 3. A critical constraint is the 288 units of phantom pipeline inventory (orders from P1, P3, and P10) that the OR backend includes in its calculation. With on-hand inventory at 0 and 'In-transit' at 753 (of which 288 are lost), the effective pipeline is 465 units. To compensate for the 288 units the OR engine won't order because it thinks they are coming, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at 110 units per period. For a (L+1) horizon where L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 110 = 330. To force the OR backend to ignore the 288 phantom units and actually place an order, I must inflate mu_hat by that amount: 330 + 288 = 618. I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the slight variability and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=5) to account for recent high volatility.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 36 (Date: 2019/10/14) shows 0 on-hand inventory following a period of stockouts. The demand has recently spiked to an average of ~118 units over the last 5 periods (P31-P35: 100, 89, 189, 95, 90), likely due to early Autumn seasonality for leather belts. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. Most critically, the system still tracks 288 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory from lost orders in P1 (109), P3 (80), and P10 (99). With 'In-transit' currently at 725 units, the actual viable pipeline is only 437 units (725 - 288). To compensate for the 288 units the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a current demand mean of 118 units and a lead time of 2. Base stock \u2248 (L+1) * mu = (2+1) * 118 = 354. To offset the 288 phantom units, I inflate mu_hat by 288, setting it to 642 (354 + 288). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent high volatility (P33: 189).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21. The SKU is a women's leather belt. Demand has been volatile recently, with a surge to 189 in P33 followed by a stabilization around 90-100 units. The 4-period mean (P33-P36) is 117.75, while the 20-period mean is approx 95. We are seeing persistent stockouts (ending inventory 0 for 4 consecutive periods) because the OR engine's pipeline inventory is inflated by 288 units of phantom stock (Orders P1, P3, P10) that will never arrive. To counteract this, I must set the mu_hat to cover the expected demand (approx 100/period) PLUS the 288 phantom units to 'trick' the backend into ordering. Required mu over (L+1=3) periods is 300 + 288 phantom units = 588. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this correction is exact. Sigma is elevated due to the P33 spike, so I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed cumulative phantom pipeline remains 288 units (P1, P3, P10). Demand has entered a mid-Autumn regime averaging ~100 units/period (excluding P33 outlier).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the item (leather hip belt) is in a mid-Autumn demand regime. Recent demand (P34-P37) shows consistent levels around 95-98 units/period, excluding the earlier outlier in P33. The 'In-transit' count of 696 units is severely inflated by several factors: 1) 288 units are confirmed permanently lost (P1, P3, P10). 2) Large orders from P34 (215 units) and P31 (138 units - though P31 appears partially resolved or missing in arrival logs) are still pending. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (including the 288 phantom units) from the base stock target, it will under-order unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these 'lost' units. My goal is to maintain a target base stock that covers 3 periods (L=2 + 1) of demand at ~100 units/period (total 300) plus a safety buffer. To force the OR engine to order despite the 288 phantom units, I am using an explicit mu_hat that effectively 'swallows' the phantom pipeline and sets a realistic target for fresh stock. I've set mu_hat to 650 (representing roughly (1+L)*120 + 288) to ensure the system keeps placing orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04 (Period 39). Demand in P38 was 48, which is a significant drop compared to the mid-Autumn average of ~100 observed since P34 (excluding the P33 spike). This likely signals a transition into a late-Autumn/pre-holiday lull or a shift in the sales regime. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 739 units includes 288 units of confirmed 'phantom inventory' (P1, P3, P10 orders) that the OR backend erroneously includes in its pipeline calculations. To counteract this, mu_hat must be inflated to account for the (1+L) periods and the 288-unit deficit. Lead times have been variable (1-3 periods); I will set L to 2 (promised). Demand mean for the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 85.8. Multiplied by (1+L=3), base mu_hat is 257.4. Adding the 288-unit phantom deficit gives a required mu_hat of ~545. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * std(P34-P38).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: detected drop to 48 units, possibly marking the end of the Autumn peak (avg dropped from ~100 to 48). Total phantom pipeline remains 288 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11 (Period 40). We have observed a demand drop in the last two periods (P38: 48, P39: 41), which suggests the autumn peak has subsided, contrasting with the previous average of ~100 units/period. The item (leather belt) likely sees reduced demand as we move deeper into November before any potential holiday spike. The critical issue remains the 288 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (from lost orders in P1, P3, and P10) that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available. To counteract this and prevent under-ordering, I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat'. I will estimate the new 'base' demand at ~45 units/period. For a (L+1=3) period window, the needed stock is ~135 units. To offset the 288-unit phantom deficit, I will set 'mu_hat' to 423 (135 + 288). Service level (q) is high ($19/$20 = 0.95), suggesting a z* of ~1.64. Following the recent volatilities, I will set 'sigma_hat' to 150 (explicit) to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety buffer despite the phantom inventory drag.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level for late autumn (~45 units/period). Phantom pipeline remains 288 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a late autumn regime for ladies' accessories, where demand has dropped significantly from the early autumn levels. Demand in P38-P40 averaged 39.3 units, compared to ~100 units previously. The most critical factor remains the 288 units of phantom pipeline inventory (Orders from P1, P3, and P10) which the OR backend still counts as available stock. This phantom stock prevents the engine from placing necessary orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset it. With 0 on-hand inventory and the 'true' in-transit inventory being 411 (699 total - 288 phantom), we must ensure mu_hat is high enough to trigger an order to cover the (L+1) period demand. Estimated demand for the next 3 periods (L=2) is approximately 120-135 units. However, because the backend thinks we have 699 units in the pipeline against zero on-hand, it will not order. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 288 phantom units by adding them to the forecast (approx 45 * 3 + 288 = 423) to force the backend to maintain a realistic stock level, while using 'calculate' for L as lead times have recently fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has shifted to a lower late-autumn regime, with recent observations in Periods 38-41 being 48, 41, 29, and 33 (avg: 37.75). The OR backend includes a stable 'phantom pipeline' of 288 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P10) that will never arrive. Additionally, the orders from P34 (215 units) and P38 (43 units) are now overdue (promised lead time 2, current period 42), but given the recent lead time history of 3 periods (P32, P33, P36), they might still arrive. Total In-transit is significantly inflated (699 units) compared to real expected stock. To compensate for the 288 phantom units and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to (1+L)*38 + 288 = (3)*38 + 288 = 114 + 288 = 402 units. For sigma, I will use the recent 5-period volatility (including the transition from the P37 demand level) to maintain a safety buffer.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike to 227 units, which corresponds to the start of the holiday shopping season (late November/Cyber Monday). This is a significant regime shift from the late autumn average of ~45 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the in-transit pipeline (699 units) includes 288 units of confirmed 'phantom' inventory from Periods 1, 3, and 10 which will never arrive. To ensure the OR engine orders enough to meet both the immediate spike and the likely sustained high demand through December, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I will set mu_hat to 450 (covering 3 periods at an average of 150 units/period to account for the holiday season) and sigma_hat to 120 to handle the high volatility seen in P42. I will set L to 3 to reflect the recent trend of 3-period lead times observed in Periods 34-39.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed in Period 42: demand surged to 227 units (+400% vs previous 3-period average), initiating the December peak regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday season (Date: 2019/12/9). Period 42 showed a massive demand surge to 227 units, and Period 43 remained elevated at 87 units despite zero on-hand inventory (demand often registers as lower when stock is zero, but the spike is still clear). Given the product is a 'Leather belt with a metal buckle', it is a strong gifting item. I expect Period 44-46 to remain high. The phantom pipeline remains a critical issue: 288 units (from Periods 1, 3, and 10) are lost but still counted as 'In-Transit' by the OR engine. To compensate and ensure an order is triggered despite this inflated pipeline, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I am forecasting a mean demand of 150 units per period for the remainder of the holiday peak. Total target inventory (on-hand + pipeline) for L=2 (which covers 3 periods) should be around 450 units. However, because the backend subtracts the phantom 288 units, I must inflate the mu_hat to approximately (Actual Target + Phantom Units) / (1+L). Calculation: (450 + 288) / 3 = 246 units. I will set mu_hat to 738 (which is 3 * 246) using the 'explicit' method to override the OR engine's conservative capping and trigger sufficient stock arrivals for the final periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak (Date: 2019/12/16). Demand has surged significantly starting from Period 42 (227 units), followed by P43 (87 units) and P44 (108 units). The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 140 units. The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 977 units in-transit. Crucially, the 'in-transit' count includes the 288-unit 'phantom pipeline' (P1, P3, P10) that will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficiently despite these ghost units, mu_hat must be set to cover the elevated holiday demand while overcoming the pipeline bias. Given the proximity to the holiday peak and the observed spike, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~140) and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility introduced by the 227-unit spike. Lead time (L) is set to calculate to reflect the actual historical performance (often 2-3 periods).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday season (Date: 2019/12/23). Recent demand from P42-P45 (227, 87, 108, 104) confirms a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 131 units per period. Despite placing large orders recently, On-hand inventory remains 0 because the shipments from P44 (278 units) and the massive P34 order (215 units, now 12 periods overdue and likely lost) have not arrived. The In-transit count of 977 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom pipeline' inventory\u2014specifically orders from P1, P3, P10, and now likely P34 (total 503 units). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this high (but unusable) in-transit figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 896, which represents (1+L) * expected demand (3 * 131 = 393) plus a 503-unit buffer to offset the lost shipments the OR engine thinks are coming. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to 503 units. Order from Period 34 (215 units) is now 12 periods overdue and confirmed lost, joining P1 (109), P3 (80), and P10 (99).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30, the end of the December holiday peak. Recent demand (P42-P46) has been volatile but high, averaging approximately 120 units/period (227, 87, 108, 104, 72). However, we face a critical inventory visibility issue: the on-hand inventory is 0 and the OR backend counts 1099 units as 'In-transit'. Based on history, 503 of these units are confirmed 'phantom pipeline' (P1: 109, P3: 80, P10: 99, P34: 215) and will never arrive. Because the backend subtracts these 503 units from the target stock level, it significantly under-orders. To compensate and ensure any order is generated, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I am targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at the recent average of 120 units (~360 units) PLUS the 503 phantom units to bypass the backend's subtraction. Total mu_hat = 863. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen in the December peak.
