Historical demand for the last 5 weeks of Jan/early Feb 2019 shows a mean of 37 units (28, 38, 34, 44, 41), indicating a slight upward trend or stabilizing around 40 units/week. Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To calculate the order for Period 1, I need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods (Periods 1, 2, and 3). Expected demand for these periods is approximately 40 units/period, totaling 120 units. I will add a small safety stock buffer of 20 units since I'm starting from zero, resulting in a total order of 140 units. This allows us to satisfy demand immediately upon arrival in Period 3 (after placing in P1) while accounting for the current period's demand which will go unserved due to zero starting stock.",

Period 1 actual demand was 43, which aligns with the higher end of the recent historical range.

This order is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current inventory is 0 on-hand, with 140 in-transit. Based on an average demand of ~40, the 140 units currently in-transit cover roughly 3.5 periods. To ensure a safety stock and cover the (L+1) exposure window (Periods 2, 3, and 4), I need to account for approximately 120-130 units of demand. Since 140 are already in-transit, I have enough for the immediate lead-time window, but I must order now to cover Period 5 demand to avoid a stockout immediately after the first shipment arrives.

Since Period 1 (Feb 11), demand has shifted upward to an average of 55 units/week (43, 66, 57), likely due to seasonal transition towards spring/warmer weather where 'trainer socks' are more popular. Lead time is promised at 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (140 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 resolution and be visible in Period 4 (current). However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and since it was ordered in Period 1, a lead time of 2 would mean it arrives in Period 3. Since 'arrived=0' in Period 3 conclude, we must assume the lead time is at least 3, or the shipment is delayed/lost. Total in-transit is 255 (P1: 140, P2: 45, P1: 70). Current on-hand is 0, leading to stockouts. Assuming a lead time of 3, the 140 units should arrive during Period 4 and be available for Period 5.

  "rationale": "Product Analysis: The SKU '372860024' consists of fine-knit trainer socks. Trainer socks typically see increasing demand as spring approaches (March/April) when customers transition to lighter footwear. Demand Regime: Historical demand (Jan/Feb) averaged ~37 units/week. Since Period 1, observed demand has been 43, 66, 57, and 44 (average ~52.5). This represents a clear step up from the pre-game samples, likely due to seasonal transition and stock-outs biasing perceived demand. Lead Time Inference: The Period 4 conclusion confirms an order from Period 2 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods. The Period 1 order (140 units) is now 1 period overdue (was expected in Period 3). I must assume this order might be lost or delayed. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 1. In-transit is 260 (P1: 140, P3: 70, P4: 50). If we exclude the likely lost P1 order, the reliable pipeline is 120 units (P3 and P4 orders). Decision Logic: Based on an estimated weekly demand of 50-60 units and a 2-period lead time, I need to cover Periods 5, 6, and 7 (~150-180 units). Total reliable stock (1 on-hand + 120 pipeline) is 121. To reach our safety target of 180 units, I need to order approximately 60.

Current on-hand inventory is 327 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate (65 units/week). Total in-transit is theoretically high (1280 units), but given the ~50% mortality rate of orders and the potential for seasonal demand to drop further as autumn approaches, I will hold off on ordering this period to avoid excessive holding costs. The existing stock and high volume of theoretical in-transit orders provide sufficient buffer for the next few periods while I monitor for further demand decay or delivery clusters.",

Current demand is low, averaging ~30 units over the last 5 periods (except for a brief spike in P42). On-hand inventory is 0. The defining characteristic of the recent history is a total supply chain collapse: zero units have arrived for 16 consecutive periods (since Period 27), despite 1,280 units being in-transit. This suggests that the 1,280 units (ordered between Periods 10-26) are likely lost in a major shipment failure. Placing new orders is futile and potentially detrimental given the game is at Period 44 of 47. Even if an order were placed now, it could only arrive by Period 46 or 47 (assuming L=2-3), and the extreme historical loss rate (now >80% based on recent months) makes delivery highly improbable. Any sudden bulk arrival of the 1,280 in-transit units would create a massive holding cost liability. Therefore, the most prudent action is to remain at zero orders to avoid adding to potential losses or holding costs as the simulation concludes.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Total supply chain failure confirmed: No arrivals for 16 consecutive weeks (P28-P43). Current in-transit quantity (1,280 units) represents nearly 4x the remaining potential season demand and is likely a total write-off.",

Period 45 (2019/12/16) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are now in Period 45 of 47, deep into the winter trough for trainer socks. Current demand is stabilized at approximately 25-35 units per week, significantly lower than the summer peak. The supply chain has experienced a catastrophic failure, with zero arrivals recorded for 17 consecutive periods (since Period 27) despite 1,280 units being 'in-transit'. This in-transit volume represents over 10x the remaining lifecycle demand forecast (~90-100 units total for Periods 45-47). Given the absolute lack of arrivals for over four months and the fact that any new order placed now would likely not arrive before the game ends (given the 2-period promised lead time and historical unreliability), ordering more stock is irrational. The profit potential of the few units we might sell is heavily outweighed by the risk of incurring holding costs on items that likely won't arrive, or the massive overstock risk if the 'in-transit' dam finally breaks. I will maintain a zero-order position to minimize further risk.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Supply chain failure has reached 17 consecutive periods of zero arrivals; the 1,280 units in-transit are functionally lost. Seasonal demand for trainer socks remains in a winter low (25-35 units/week) as the game approaches its final two periods.",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are currently in Period 46 of 47, specifically December 23rd. The product is 'fine-knit trainer socks', an item with high seasonal demand in spring/summer and low demand in winter. Current demand has shown a late-season spike in Period 45 (81 units), which is likely driven by pre-Christmas shopping. However, the primary constraint remains a total supply chain failure: zero units have arrived for 18 consecutive periods (since Period 27) despite 1,280 units in-transit. On-hand inventory has been 0 since Period 34. With only 1-2 periods remaining in the game and a 2-period promised lead time (which is currently unreliable/zero-arrival), any order placed now would not arrive in time to be sold. Furthermore, the 1,280 units in-transit already massively exceed any possible remaining demand. Adding more units to the pipeline would only increase potential holding cost risk if the blockage cleared, without any possibility of generating additional sales revenue before the game ends.",

The SKU (trainer socks) is in its winter demand trough, though it recently spiked to 81 and 67 units in late December, likely due to holiday gifting or clearance cycles. However, the supply chain for this SKU has fundamentally collapsed: there have been zero arrivals for 19 consecutive periods (since Period 27) despite an in-transit pipeline of 1,280 units. These units are effectively lost. Since this is the final period, any order placed now would not arrive before the game ends (even with a 0-period lead time, the demand resolution for P47 occurs after the P47 decision phase, and any arrival would only be visible/usable in P48, which does not exist). Furthermore, the 1,280 units in-transit already vastly exceed any possible single-week demand. Therefore, placing an order would incur unnecessary holding costs (if it arrived) or simply add to the lost-order metrics without generating profit.",
