  "rationale": "Product 675068002 is a women's straight-cut cotton blouse. Historical demand from early January to early February shows a steady increase: 41 (Jan 7, 14, 21), rising to 47 (Jan 28) and 51 (Feb 4). This suggests a gradual build-up as we move towards the spring season. The current date is Feb 11. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive in Period 3 (Arrivals 2+1 observation delay). My pipeline must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Average demand is currently around 45-50 units per week. To maximize profit while minimizing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I target a coverage of roughly 3.5 weeks of demand plus a small buffer to account for the upward trend. Total needed: ~50 * 3.5 = 175 units. Since On-hand and In-transit are zero, I will order 175 units.",

The current date is March 11, entering peak spring season. Demand seems to have stabilized around an average of 314 units per week over the last 3 periods. (b) Current demand regime is significantly higher than pre-game. (c) Lead time analysis: P2 order (305 units) arrived in P4 conclude (lead_time=2). This confirms the promised 2-period lead time. However, the P1 order (175 units) is conspicuously missing; as it was due in P3 conclude and failed to appear in P4 conclude either, it is likely lost. (d) Inventory assessment: On-hand is 42.

I'll forecast demand around 180-200 units per period. (c) Lead time: P2 arrived in P4 (L=2). P1 (ordered P1, expected P3) is confirmed lost. P3 (720 units) and P4 (600 units) are currently in-transit. P3 was ordered on Feb 25, so with L=2, it arrived during P6 and should be visible in P6's conclude message; however, P6 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests either a lead time drift to L=3 or that P3 is also lost. If L=3, P3 arrives during P7 (available for P8 start). (d) Inventory: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 1495 (P3=720, P4=600, P5=0, P6=0, P7=?). (e) Order Logic: We have high in-transit vs. current demand. If P3 and P4 arrive, we will have 1320 units.

The average demand over the last 7 periods is approx 260 units/week. (c) Lead time analysis: P2 arrived in P4 (L=2). P1 (175 units) is confirmed lost. P3 (ordered 2019-02-25, 720 units) is now significantly overdue; it should have arrived in P5 (if L=2) or P6 (if L=3). As of P7 conclude (read at P8 start), it still hasn't arrived. Given the lost P1 order, P3 is highly likely lost as well. (d) Inventory evaluation: On-hand is 0. In-transit consists of P4 (600 units). If L=2, P4 was expected in P6 conclude (read P7). Since it is not in P7 conclude, we check P8. If P4 is also lost or L=4, we are in a severe stockout. (e) Decision logic: We must assume P1 and P3 are lost.

Re-calculating: P3 (720) + P4 (600) + P5 (0) + P6 (0) + P7 (0) = 1320. The system reports 1495, suggesting an discrepancy or a missed order record. Regardless, we have 0 on-hand and have missed sales in P5, P6, and P7.

In-transit shows 1945, but subtracting the 1495 units and the 450 units ordered in P10 (which should arrive shortly), the pipeline is essentially just the P10 order. Calculating target inventory for L+1 (3 periods) using the recent mean (~150) plus safety stock for supply volatility: 150 * 3 = 450 units. My current On-hand (856) is already sufficient to cover nearly 6 periods of demand at the current rate. Even if the P10 order (450 units) is lost, I have sufficient stock. I will place no order this period to allow the high inventory level to deplete and minimize holding costs ($1/unit), as the current stock provides ~5.7 weeks of coverage.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a cotton blouse, which experienced a spring peak and is now in a second seasonal surge associated with the holiday season/End-of-Year sales. Demand in Period 42 spiked significantly to 295 units, following a stable November regime of ~120 units. This mirrors the behavior seen in the spring (Feb/March). Inventory is currently 0, with 2680 units in-transit. However, supply reliability is historically poor; 1495 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) and 70 units from P34 are effectively lost. Of the current in-transit, we expect the following arrivals: P40 (250 units, now 3 periods out), P41 (150 units, 2 periods out), and P42 (150 units, 1 period out). Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. Given the demand spike to 295, I need to protect against a continued holiday peak. The pipeline (excluding lost units) is 250+150+150 = 550 units. If demand remains at ~250-300, 550 units covers barely 2 periods. To reach a safe stock level for the final periods (up to P47) and account for the high loss rate, an order of 300 is placed to ensure availability for the December peak.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand peak accelerated in Period 42: demand jumped to 295 units (from ~120 avg), confirming a high-intensity seasonal regime. Supply chain remains hit-or-miss with older orders (P34 and earlier) confirmed lost, but recent orders (P35-P41) are arriving within 1-3 periods.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is an airy cotton blouse, which experienced a spring peak followed by a significant holiday surge starting in late October (Period 38). Demand in Period 42 reached 295 units but dropped sharply to 60 units in Period 43. Looking at the December 9th date, we are past the initial holiday peak and moving toward the end of the game (Period 47). Supply chain reliability remains a concern, with lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods and significant historical losses (though recent orders from P39-P41 arrived successfully). Current on-hand inventory is 340 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand of 60. In-transit inventory is listed as 2580, but approximately 1570 of these units are from very old/lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P34). The reliable pipeline consists of P42 (150 units) and P43 (300 units). Total reliable inventory (on-hand + reliable in-transit) = 340 + 150 + 300 = 790 units. Given only 4 periods remaining and demand seemingly cooling from its 295 peak, 790 units should provide more than enough coverage to avoid stockouts while managing holding cost risks.",

  "rationale": "The SKU is a women's blouse, which saw a major holiday demand spike in Period 42 (295 units) and has since significantly cooled (60 units in P43, 73 units in P44). The current date is December 16, and the game ends at Period 47. Based on the spring pattern, demand tends to drop off sharply after a peak. I expect demand for the remaining periods (45, 46, 47) to remain in the range of 60-80 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 267 units. Expected total demand for the rest of the game is approximately 210-240 units (75 units * 3 periods). With 267 units on hand and a high holding cost ($1.00 vs $4.00 profit), I am already covered for the duration of the campaign. Any further ordering would just increase holding costs and end-of-game inventory without contributing to additional sales, especially given the supply chain's unreliability. I will place no further orders to maximize profit and minimize waste.",

Historical demand showed a massive spike in late November (P42: 295), followed by a sharp drop and stabilization (P43-P45: 60, 73, 59). This suggests the 'Holiday demand peak' has passed, and we have entered the post-peak phase where demand is significantly lower. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 658), ensuring coverage for several months at the current demand rate (~64 units/week). Period 45 conclude showed the arrival of P42 and P43 orders (450 units total), which has significantly bolstered the stock. Lead times are relatively stable at 2-3 periods for recent successful shipments. Given the high carry-over of inventory and the forecasted lower demand regime for the remainder of December and early January, No additional inventory is required.",

Historical pre-game data from Jan/Feb 2019 showed demand starting at approximately 41-51 units per week. Recent period demand (P43-P46) has stabilized in a post-holiday regime of ~52-73 units (averaging ~61). With 606 units on-hand, the inventory covers approximately 10 weeks of current demand. Additionally, although 1500 units in the 'in-transit' figure are confirmed lost from early-game supply issues, there are no recent confirmed arrivals outstanding that would deplete the current stock significantly. Given high holding costs ($1/unit) relative to profit ($4/unit), and the fact that we are entering a seasonally lower demand period before the spring bounce, the current inventory is excessive.
