Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11), managing the 'Nora T-shirt', a basic women's jersey T-shirt. The historical demand for the past 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a clear downward trend (78, 58, 47, 42, 40), suggesting the end of a post-holiday or early-year peak. Current inventory is zero. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we have a short history showing a declining trend, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the more recent, lower demand levels (average ~43), and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to maintain a buffer for volatility. For the lead time L, I will use the 'default' method (2 periods). This ensures our base stock level factors in the expected demand over the next 3 periods (L+1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 2 (2019-02-18). Examining the demand history for the Nora T-shirt (a basic women's jersey t-shirt), we see a clear downward trend: 78 -> 58 -> 47 -> 42 -> 40 (Jan-Feb) followed by 48 in Period 1. This suggests the post-holiday/early-year demand has stabilized around a mean of 40-50 units per week. In Period 1, we ordered 69 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the execution sequence, that shipment is in-transit and should arrive in Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, and we lost 48 sales in Period 1 due to being stockless at start. To set parameters for Period 2: 1) L: Use default (2). 2) mu_hat: Use the last 4 samples (42, 40, 48) plus the historical context. The average of the most recent 3 samples is 43.3. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this stabilized regime. The backend will calculate (1+2)*43.3 = 130. 3) sigma_hat: Use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a women's jersey T-shirt. Historical demand shows a downward trend in January (78 to 40), but post-February, arrivals in our environment have been zero, and demand spiked significantly to 120 in Period 2. This suggests a seasonal shift as we approach spring. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 120 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2, so the P1 order (69 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and will be visible at the start of Period 4. Demand is clearly transitioning from the winter lows; the last two weeks saw demand of 48 and 120. Using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat captures this recent jump while acknowledging the previous low (40, 48, 120). This balances the need to recover from stockouts without over-reacting to a single spike. Sigma is set to default to reflect the increased volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Historical demand shows 78, 58, 47, 42, 40 (pre-game) and 48, 120, 77 (in-game). The demand jump in Period 2 (120 units) followed by 77 suggests a possible early spring lift or high volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 237 units in transit. Looking at the promised lead time of 2 periods: the order placed in Period 1 (69 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 3's conclude message (read at the start of Period 4). However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This indicates the lead time is likely 3+ periods or the shipment is delayed. Since we have no 'conclude' confirmations of arrival yet, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for this observed delay and ensure the OR engine targets a larger pipeline. For mu_hat, the recent average (last 3 periods: 48, 120, 77) is 81.6 units/period. With L=3, the coverage needed is (1+L)=4 periods. 4 * 81.6 = 326.4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the recent volume increase while accounting for the likely longer lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a women's basic T-shirt. Looking at the history, the demand is quite volatile: P1=48, P2=120, P3=77, P4=39. The average demand across these 4 recorded periods is ~71. The historical samples provided (Jan-Feb) had an average of ~53, suggesting an upward trend or higher volatility as we enter spring. Lead time: Promised is 2. The order from P2 arrived in P4 (L=2), but the order from P1 (69 units) has NOT arrived as of the end of P4. If P1 had L=2, it should have arrived in P3. If L=3, it should have arrived in P4. Since it hasn't arrived, there is a high probability the P1 shipment is lost. Our current On-hand is low (12), and while 328 units are in transit, the immediate concern is the missing P1 stock. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent higher demand (avg ~71), and lead time L=2 (promised) as calculate/recent_N will be skewed by the missing P1 order. L=2 means mu_hat covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic 'Nora T-shirt', and we are entering March, where demand for short-sleeved jerseys traditionally begins to rise. Historical demand shows variability (40-120 range). We have experienced a stockout because the order from Period 1 (69 units) has not yet arrived (it is now Period 6, and it was placed in Period 1; promised lead time is 2). The order from Period 2 arrived on time in Period 4. The missing Period 1 order or potential delays mean we need to ensure the pipeline is replenished. The 328 units in-transit include the missing Period 1 (69), Period 3 (117), and Period 4 (142). Since demand spiked to 120 in mid-February but averaged lower recently, I will use a 5-period average for demand to capture recent volatility. I will keep Lead Time at 'calculate' to let the backend observe the delay evidence, but I will explicitly set mu_hat to ensure we cover the current stockout and rising spring demand. Given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning we should target a high service level.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 25th (Spring), and historical demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' (a basic jersey item) shows a significant recent spike in Period 2 (120 units), followed by a return to baseline (avg ~45-55 units). Logistics observation: The Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2), but the Period 1 order (69 units) is notably missing/lost as it should have arrived in Period 3 or 4. Similarly, Period 3 order (117 units) has not arrived. Since 328 units are in-transit (P1:69, P2:0, P3:117, P4:142), we are facing severe inventory stockouts (0 on-hand). I will maintain the promised lead time L=2 for calculations but assume a higher mean demand for the (L+1) window to ensure the base stock formula accounts for the recent demand volatility and the need to recover from stockouts once shipments resume. N=5 is chosen for mu_hat to capture the post-spike stabilization while acknowledging the Period 2 volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 58.5 units (excluding the outlier of 120 in P2). The promised lead time (L) is 2. Analyzing historical arrivals: P2's order arrived in P4 (L=2). However, P1's order (69 units) and P3's order (117 units) are significantly delayed. P1's order is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting it is lost. P3's order is 3 periods overdue. Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 328 (from P1, P3, P4). Since P1 is likely lost, the pipeline inventory is effectively lower than the system's 'In-transit' count. To compensate for the stockout and the lost shipment, I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR backend places a new order. I'll forecast demand at ~50 units/period. For a (L+1) horizon, mu_hat = 3 * 50 = 150. Given 'In-transit' is 328, the OR engine's capped policy might block orders. By setting mu_hat higher (explicit 250) and setting sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (std dev of demand is ~28, so sqrt(3)*28 ~ 48), I aim to trigger a replenishment to end the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (69 units) is likely lost (5 periods overdue). Demand remains steady around 50-60 units, but availability is 0.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Current inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have been out of stock for 4 periods despite high demand. Examining the history: Orders from Period 1 (69 units) and Period 3 (117 units) are severely overdue (lead time 2 promised, but it's now Period 9). Only the Period 2 order arrived (Period 4). The 'In-transit' balance of 328 units likely includes these missing/stalled shipments (69+117+142=328), meaning we cannot rely on current pipeline visibility to satisfy demand. The product is a women's basic t-shirt, which should see steady or increasing demand as spring progresses. Recent demand (last 8 weeks) averages ~66 units, but has spiked as high as 120 and 83. Because the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from the 'base_stock', and 186 units are likely lost/stalled, I must use 'explicit' values to force an order that bypasses the inflated pipeline count. I calculate mu_hat for (L+1)=3 periods. Average demand is ~65; 65*3=195. I will set mu_hat explicitly to a higher value to ensure the 'capped policy' allows a new order despite the 328 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 1 (69 units) and Period 3 (117 units) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (6+ periods since P1, 5+ periods since P3). Total unreliable pipeline is 186 units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019-04-15). The product is a Nora T-shirt, a basics item. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of the pipeline reveals significant reliability issues: the shipment from Period 1 (69 units) is 9 periods old, and Period 3 (117 units) is 7 periods old; given the promised lead time is 2, these 186 units are confirmed lost. The Period 4 order (142 units) is now 6 periods since ordering (4 periods overdue) and is also highly suspect or lost. The only reliable in-transit order is the 161 units ordered in Period 9. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 51 units over the last 5 samples (39, 55, 47, 83, 55, 28 excluding the very low P9 which was likely affected by zero availability for 5 consecutive periods). To recover from these lost shipments and zero on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (1+2=3 periods). I use an explicit mu_hat of 180 (approx 60/week * 3) to ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order that ignores the 'ghost' pipeline of lost units, while setting a high sigma_hat of 50 to account for demand volatility and supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 4 (142 units) is now 4 periods overdue (6 periods total since order) and should be considered lost alongside P1 and P3 orders. Total lost pipeline is 328 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). The inventory situation is critical: out of 328 units in-transit, all are from orders placed in Period 1 (69), Period 3 (117), and Period 4 (142). Given we are now in Period 11, these are respectively 10, 8, and 7 periods old. Since the promised lead time is 2, and we recently saw a Period 9 order arrive in just 1 period (Period 10), these legacy orders are confirmed lost. The backend OR engine incorrectly counts these 328 units as 'pipeline inventory', which would prevent it from ordering more. To fix this, I must use 'explicit' values that effectively nullify this ghost inventory. Demand for this basic T-shirt is stable: the last 10 samples (including pre-game) average ~56 units. Predicted demand for L+1 (3 periods) is ~168. With 118 real units on hand, and 0 real units in transit, we need to order more to cover the lead time. Setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' high value forces the backend to see a gap between demand and the (false) pipeline, triggering an order. I will target a base stock high enough to account for the 328-unit error plus the desired target inventory.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (328 units total) are definitively lost. P9 order arrived in 1 period, suggesting actual lead time is 1-2 periods. Demand remains in the range of 40-60 units/week.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's basic t-shirt with steady demand. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) has averaged 50 units (83, 55, 28, 43, 41), showing consistency. As noted in carry-over insights, orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 328 units) are definitively lost as they are many weeks past the promised 2-period lead time. However, the order from P9 arrived in just 1 period (lead_time=1), and the order from P11 (129 units) is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 12 or 13. The current on-hand inventory is 77, and the valid pipeline is 129 units (excluding the lost 328 units). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover (L+1) periods of demand based on the recent average of ~50 units/week. Since the backend calculates pipeline as 'total ever ordered - total ever arrived', I must adjust mu_hat to offset the 328 units of 'phantom' inventory that will never arrive. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the recent 1-period arrival while respecting the promised 2-period baseline.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time remains variable (observed 1 and 2 periods). Phantom inventory from lost orders P1, P3, P4 totals 328 units and must be manually offset in mu_hat calculations to avoid stockouts.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/06), we are managing the 'Nora T-shirt', a basic staple. In-transit inventory stands at 457 units, but 328 of these (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are over 9 periods old and confirmed lost. The active pipeline consists only of the 129 units ordered in Period 11, which should arrive this period or next (L=1-2). On-hand inventory is 36 units. Recent demand (P9-P12) has stabilized between 28-43 units (avg ~38). To account for the 328 phantom units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in 'pipeline_inventory', I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I calculate the required target stock as (L+1)*Demand + Z*Sigma + Phantom Offset. With L=2, avg demand = 50 (to be safe), and a buffer for variance, target is ~150. Adding the 328 lost units, I set mu_hat to 478. This forces the backend to order if (478 - (129 + 328) - 36) > 0, ensuring we maintain stock despite the data corruption caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Lost pipeline remains at 328 units. Recent demand (last 4 periods) has lower mean (~38) than initial samples, likely due to stockouts or seasonality, but forecasting 50 for safety.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/05/13 (Period 14). The product is a Women's Everyday Jersey T-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 134 units, and the recorded in-transit is 328 units. However, as established in prior periods, these 328 units (from orders in P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost/phantom and will never arrive. The OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. To account for this, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat to offset the 328 phantom units, as the backend is unaware they are lost. Lead time has stabilized between 1 and 2 periods (L=2 is the safe promised value). Recent demand mean (last 5 periods) is approximately 37.4 units. Looking at mu_hat = (1+L) * mean + offset: (1+2)*37.4 + 328 \u2248 440. Under this setting, the backend calculation [base_stock - 328] will target the actual physical safety level required for the real demand. Demand volatility (sigma_hat) is set using recent history (N=5) to reflect current jersey basic demand stability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's basic t-shirt, which typically sees stable or slightly increasing demand in late spring/early summer. Looking at recent demand: P10-P14 show [43, 41, 41, 31, 67], with an average of 44.6. However, looking at the full history including the first 5 samples provided [78, 58, 47, 42, 40], demand generally hovers around 45-55 units. I will use a forecast of 50 units per period. The critical issue is the 'In-transit' quantity of 328 units. These units correspond exactly to the lost orders from Period 1 (69), Period 3 (117), and Period 4 (142). Because the OR engine subtracts 'pipeline inventory' from the target base stock, it will assume these 328 units are actually coming and will not place new orders despite the risk of stockout. To force the OR engine to place an order, I must set mu_hat (target stock) high enough to offset this phantom inventory. Promised lead time is 2, so the system looks at (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Target stock = (3 periods * 50 units/period) + 328 units (lost) + 1.28 * sigma * sqrt(3). I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to set the target at roughly 530 units (150 requirement + 328 lost + buffer), ensuring the capped policy still allows an replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Sustained phantom inventory of 328 units (P1, P3, P4) is skewing the automated pipeline calculation; mu_hat must be manually inflated by 328 to trigger necessary orders.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we enter the summer season for a women's Jersey T-shirt, which explains the recent demand surge (87 units in Period 15, despite a stockout). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit units are 488, but this includes 328 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. The 'real' pipeline consists of only the Period 15 order (160 units). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts the full 488 units from the target base stock, preventing necessary replenishment. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods of demand) using a mean demand of 75 units/period to account for summer seasonality. Base target = 3 * 75 = 225. I then add the 328 'phantom' units to this target (225 + 328 = 553) so that the OR logic (553 - 488) results in a net order that covers my physical needs. I maintain L at 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P10, P13) suggest actual lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonality confirmed: P15 demand rose to 87 units. Effective pipeline remains only the orders from P15 onwards; P1, P3, and P4 (328 units) are permanently lost but still occupy 'In-transit' slots.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), we are entering the summer peak for the Nora T-shirt. Demand in Period 15 spiked to 87 units. While Period 16 showed a slight dip to 51, this was likely constrained by zero on-hand availability. There is a major supply chain issue: 328 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are permanently lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' figure of 587 units. This creates 'phantom inventory' that prevents the OR backend's inventory-position logic from placing new orders. To fix this, I must set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for both the expected lead-time demand and the 328 units of lost pipeline. Based on recent demand, I forecast 75 units/period for the next 3 weeks (L+1). Calculation: (3 periods * 75 units/period) + 328 lost units = 553 units. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period lead time and mu_hat to 'explicit' at 553 to force the system to ignore the lost 328 units and order based on real needs.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 10, 2019 (Period 18). Both orders from P15 (160 units) and P16 (99 units) arrived in P17, resulting in a healthy on-hand inventory of 224 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 328 units remains composed entirely of lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline' from the base stock calculation, and it is permanently lost, I must set mu_hat high enough to neutralize this phantom 328 units. Recent demand (P14-P17) shows a mean of ~60 units/period (67, 87, 51, 35). With a lead time of 2, the desired base stock is (1+L) * mu = 3 * 60 = 180 units. To trigger a replenishment once the valid pipeline is empty, I add the 328 units of lost inventory to this requirement, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 508. Since valid on-hand (224) + valid pipeline (0) = 224, which is currently > 180, this mu_hat level will prevent the backend from ordering unnecessarily this period while preparing to cover the 328-unit gap once on-hand levels drop further. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it captures the recent 1-2 period variance correctly.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17 (Period 19). The product is a women's T-shirt, which is in peak season. Recent demand has fluctuated but shows an upward trend (Periods 14-18 demand: 67, 87, 51, 35, 43), with an average of 57 units over the last 5 weeks. There is a confirmed critical issue with 'In-transit' inventory: 328 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are permanently lost but remains in the pipeline calculation according to the OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Since On-hand is 181 and the phantom Pipeline is 328, the backend sees a total of 509 units, which is much higher than the desired base stock for a 2-period lead time product. To force an order and maintain stock for the upcoming weeks, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to override this deficit. Based on a target base stock (L+1) of 3 * 60 = 180, plus the 328 phantom units, I need a mu_hat around 508 to trigger any replenishment. However, with 181 on-hand, I am currently safe for ~3 weeks. I will set mu_hat to 510 to ensure the system considers the lost inventory and maintains a healthy safety buffer for the summer season.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we are in the peak summer season for the Nora T-shirt. Demand has shown higher volatility recently, with spikes up to 92 units in Period 19. The 'In-transit' figure of 360 units is heavily skewed by 328 units from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are definitively lost but still occupy the pipeline in the backend's logic. This means the 'real' pipeline is only 32 units (from Period 19). To force the OR backend to place an order when it incorrectly believes we have 360 units in transit, I must explicitly increase mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at a summer-peak rate of ~80 units/period (240 units), plus an offset for the 328 'phantom' units. 240 + 328 = 568. This ensures we maintain inventory through the high-demand summer weeks despite the system's incorrect perception of our pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019-07-01), the Nora T-shirt is experiencing a significant summer demand peak, with Period 20 reaching 131 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The system reports 518 units in-transit, but 328 of these (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are definitively lost 'phantom' units that will never arrive. The true reliable pipeline consists of orders from P19 (32 units) and P20 (158 units), totaling 190 units. To compensate for the 328 phantom units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its inventory calculation, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by 328 units. I will set the base 'real' demand forecast (mu) to 210 for the 3-period window (L=2 + 1 order cycle), reflecting the recent summer surge (average ~70/week), and then add the 328 unit offset, resulting in a mu_hat of 538. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent high volatility in demand (ranging from 35 to 131).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Demand spiked to 131 in late June. High volatility (35-131 range) observed in the last 5 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer demand period for the 'Nora T-shirt' (July 8th). Demand in the last two periods spiked significantly to 131 and 142 units, confirming a strong seasonal trend. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system reports an In-transit total of 606 units. However, 328 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 278 units (orders from P19, P20, P21). To force the OR backend to order sufficiently, I must manually inflate mu_hat to offset these 328 'phantom' units. Given the recent demand surge, I will forecast an average demand of 120 units per period. For a lead time of 2 periods (total coverage of 3 periods), the required stock is 3 * 120 = 360 units. To neutralize the 328 false units in the calculation, mu_hat is set to 360 + 328 = 688. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for high summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak intensified: Early July demand reached 140+ units/week. Combined with 328 units of permanent phantom inventory, highly aggressive mu_hat inflation is required to maintain stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is July 15, the height of the summer season for T-shirts. Recent demand has surged significantly (P20: 131, P21: 142, P22: 133), representing a clear upward regime shift from the spring average. The rolling 3-period average is approximately 135 units. The primary structural challenge remains the 328 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments in P1, P3, and P4 that are still counted in the 'In-transit' pipeline by the OR engine. To force an order despite this 328-unit inflation, I must adjust mu_hat. For a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3), the expected demand is ~405 units. To offset the 328 ghost units and maintain safety stock, I set mu_hat explicitly to 750 (representing the required 405 demand + 328 phantom offset + safety buffer). This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger a purchase even with a seemingly large (but largely fake) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime confirmed (July): Average weekly demand has increased to ~135 units, up from ~40-60 in spring. Ghost inventory of 328 units (P1, P3, P4) persists in pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season (July) for the Nora T-shirt. Demand has stabilized at a high regime of approximately 140 units per week (Period 21: 142, Period 22: 133, Period 23: 141). Lead times are consistent at 1-2 periods. The critical issue remains the 328 units of 'phantom' inventory (orders from P1, P3, and P4) that are indefinitely lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 582, but active pipeline is only P23 order of 222 units and any residual from P19/P20). To ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock for the next (L+1)=3 weeks of demand (approx 420 units), mu_hat must be inflated to counteract the 328 units of ghost inventory that the OR logic subtracts from the base stock. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (Forecasted Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory = (140 * 3) + 328 = 748. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the current high-demand volatility (std of approx 15-20 across 3 periods) scaled for 3 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 25 (July 29, 2019), the Nora T-shirt is in a clear high-demand summer regime. Demand over the last four periods has been consistently high (131, 142, 133, 141, 146). The average lead time observed recently is 1.5 periods (1 or 2). Inventory management is currently complicated by 328 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, and P4) that are definitively lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure, which the OR engine uses to subtract from the target base stock. Current on-hand is 0, and total in-transit is 690. Subtracting the 328 phantom units leaves an effective pipeline of 362 (orders from P23 and P24). To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the high summer demand (~140 units/week) over the review and lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), I must adjust mu_hat. A target base stock for 3 periods at 140 units/week is 420. However, the backend will subtract the full 690 in-transit from the base stock. Therefore, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 690' produces a sufficient order. Given the cap constraint, I will use 'explicit' values to force a replenishment order that accounts for the ghost inventory and sustained high demand.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand remains at peak summer levels (~145 units/week). Phantom inventory of 328 units remains in system.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/8/5), the Nora T-shirt is in its peak summer season. Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged ~144 units (131, 142, 133, 141, 146, 157), significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~50. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 860 units, but 328 of these (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. This leaves a functional pipeline of 532 units (Orders P23:222, P24:108, P25:170, and any P19 remnant). With current on-hand inventory at 0 and lead time fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods, the OR engine's 'base stock' calculation (mu_hat) must be explicitly set to ensure a new order is triggered. To offset the 328 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, mu_hat must be set to: (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Units. Using an expected weekly demand of 150 and L=2, mu_hat = (150 * 3) + 328 = 778. I will set mu_hat slightly higher at 850 to ensure the safety stock (sigma) and the phantom offset are both fully addressed during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime remains strong into early August with demand averaging ~145-155 units. Phantom inventory from lost orders P1, P3, and P4 totals 328 units, requiring sustained manual inflation of mu_hat to prevent stockouts while In-transit counts are inflated.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the peak of the summer demand season for a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt'. Demand over the last 7 periods (since P20) has averaged approximately 141 units per week (min 131, max 157), representing a sustained upward shift from the spring baseline. Lead times remain variable, with the P23 order arriving after 3 periods, while others arrive in 1-2. Importantly, the 'In-transit' count of 642 units includes 328 units from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are permanently lost. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (including this phantom inventory) from the base stock. To ensure the backend places an order that covers the current demand regime, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * average_demand + phantom_inventory. For L=2, this is 3 * 145 + 328 = 763. This manual inflation 'neutralizes' the lost 328 units in the inventory calculation, directing the backend to maintain a physical stock level aligned with high summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime extends into mid-August (P27) with demand stable at 140-150 units/week. Lead time for Period 23 was 3 periods, indicating continued variability in fulfillment.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (2019/08/19), we are transitioning from the peak summer season (July-August) where demand for this t-shirt averaged ~140 units/week. Recent weeks (P26-P27) show a slight deceleration from 157 to 118, which is common as the high summer season winds down. However, we must continue to account for 328 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P1, P3, P4) that are still counted in the 'In-transit' total (520 units). The effective pipeline is actually only 192 units (520 - 328). To force the OR backend to place orders despite this inflated pipeline count, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of 125 units over (L+1)=3 periods (375 units) and then add the 328 units of phantom inventory to offset the internal subtraction performed by the OR engine. This ensures the engine sees a need for stock. Lead time remains variable (1 to 3 periods), so I use 'calculate' to reflect historical reality.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late August (Period 29), nearing the end of the summer peak season for the 'Nora T-shirt'. Recent demand remains high (P28: 163, P27: 118, P26: 136, P25: 157), averaging roughly 145 units/week over the last 4 periods. However, holding inventory is expensive ($1 vs $4 profit), and we have 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 28. The 'In-transit' count of 586 is heavily inflated by 328 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, and P4 that are permanently lost but still registered in the backend pipeline). This leaves an effective pipeline of 258 units (586 - 328). To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to account for both the expected demand over (L+1) periods and the 328-unit deficit caused by the phantom inventory. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high demand level and adjusting mu_hat with an 'explicit' value to manually offset the 328 lost units. I estimate necessary base stock around 750+ units (Demand 145 * 3 periods + 328 offset) to ensure the backend generates an order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in high summer peak (avg ~145 units/week since P25). Lead times fluctuate between 1-3 periods. Phantom inventory of 328 units from P1, P3, P4 remains confirmed lost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019-09-02), demand remains in the peak summer regime observed since July, with recent demand hitting 180 units in Period 29. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is approximately 151 units per week. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue using the promised lead time of 2 as the baseline for (L+1) calculations while remaining cautious. A critical factor is the persistent 'phantom inventory' of 328 units from lost orders P1, P3, and P4, which remains in the In-transit count. To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target inventory by exactly these 328 units. Calculating mu_hat: (L+1) * forecast + phantom offset = (2+1) * 155 + 328 = 465 + 328 = 793. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility of the summer peak (~15-20 units), scaling to sqrt(3) * 20 \u2248 35.

Carry-over insight: September transition: Demand remains at summer peak levels (approx 150-180 units/week) despite the transition into September. Lead time variability continues (1-3 periods).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the first week of September. Demand remains high, averaging ~150 units over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), despite some backlogging due to stockouts. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the 'In-transit' figure of 709 units contains 328 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, and P4 which are permanently lost). The effective pipeline is therefore 709 - 328 = 381 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite this inflated pipeline count, mu_hat must be manually adjusted. Assuming a lead time (L) of 2 (conservative average), the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. At 150 units/week, that is 450 units. To offset the 328 lost units, I will set mu_hat to 450 + 328 = 778. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx 45 * sqrt(3)) to account for current demand volatility (114 to 180 range).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019), the 'Nora T-shirt' is transitioning from the summer peak towards fall. Recent demand in Period 31 dropped to 87 units from the 140-180 range, suggesting the peak is ending. I will adjust the mu_hat forecast using a recent window (N=5) to capture this cooling demand while remaining conservative. The most significant constraint remains the 328 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P4) that are visible in the 'In-transit' count (846 units) but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this inflated pipeline, I must continue to manually inflate mu_hat. Base forecast: ~135 units/period (average of last 5). Review + Lead time coverage (L+1=3) = 405. Adding the 328 phantom offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 733. Observed lead times recently were 2-3 periods; I will set L to 2 to maintain responsiveness while managing the inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed in mid-September (P31: 87 units) marking the end of the summer peak. Phantom inventory offset of 328 units remains necessary while total In-transit includes lost shipments from P1, P3, P4.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33 (Sept 23, 2019), demand is showing a clear post-summer softening (87 units in P31, 103 units in P32), compared to the summer peak of ~150-180 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 681 units incorrectly includes 328 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4), meaning the effective pipeline is only 353 units. To compensate for the 328-unit phantom inventory and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method. My target base stock calculation: Expected demand for (L+1) periods + Ghost Offset. With L=2, L+1=3. Using a recent demand average of ~95 units, base stock should be (3 * 95) + 328 = 613. I set mu_hat to 613 and sigma_hat explicitly to 50 to maintain a high service level during this transition period, ensuring that the backend correctly calculates 'order = base_stock - (effective_pipeline + on_hand)' without being misled by the 'In-transit' count.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand softening confirmed: late September demand dropped to ~95 units/week from summer peak of ~150+ units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sep 30), the product has exited the high summer peak (which averaged ~150 units). Demand in the last three periods has settled into a lower range (87, 103, 112), averaging approximately 100 units per week. I am setting the demand forecast to 100 units per week to reflect this softening. The lead time remains variable (1-3 periods), so I am using the 'calculate' method to utilize the historical average. A critical core issue is the 328 units of 'phantom inventory' from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, and 4 (69+117+142=328). These units are permanently listed as 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Because the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (order = base_stock - on_hand - in_transit), it will under-order by exactly 328 units unless accounted for. Therefore, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by adding 328 units to my forecast to offset this ghost pipeline. Calculation: mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Offset = (1 + 2) * 100 + 328 = 628. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the 328-unit inflation in its pipeline tracking.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019/10/07), the SKU 554598001 (Women's Jersey T-shirt) is transitioning out of the summer peak. Recent demand has stabilized around 80-110 units (P31: 87, P32: 103, P33: 112, P34: 83). The system currently shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 681 units, but 328 of these are confirmed 'phantom inventory' from lost orders in P1, P3, and P4. The remaining 353 units in pipeline (from P29: 209 and the rest in more recent periods) haven't arrived yet. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To trigger a new order, mu_hat must be set to account for the (L+1) period demand plus an offset for the 328 units of phantom inventory that the OR backend erroneously includes in its pipeline calculation. Using a post-summer average demand of ~95 units and an expected L=2, the required base stock is approximately (3 * 95) + 328 = 613 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 613 to ensure the backend sees the need to cover the gap effectively while overcoming the 'lost' units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (October) settled at ~95 units/week. Phantom inventory remains 328 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Ongoing stockout at P36 with 0 on-hand inventory. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Demand analysis shows a clear exit from the peak summer regime (approx. 150 units/week) into a stable autumn regime of approximately 80-100 units/week (P31-P35: 87, 103, 112, 83, 64 - mean of 90). The 'In-transit' count is 681, but 328 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 353 units. However, no orders have been placed since P31, meaning no incoming stock is expected in the immediate periods. To resolve the stockout and counteract the 328 units of 'phantom inventory' that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base stock logic, I must manually inflate mu_hat. Setting mu_hat to 650 (projected demand of ~100/week * (L+1) + 328 ghost offset) to force the solver to ignore the lost shipments and trigger a replenishment order. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P30, P32) show lead times of 1-3 periods, averaging near the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (October) settled at ~90 units/week. Phantom inventory remains 328 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37 (Oct 21), we are in the post-summer demand regime. Since Period 32, demand has softened from summer peaks of ~150 to a more stable range of roughly 80-110 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 681 units is highly misleading because it includes 328 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, and P4 that are definitively lost). Subtracting 328 from 681 leaves a 'real' pipeline of 353 units, which are primarily orders from P19 (32 units) and P29 (209 units) that are significantly overdue and likely also lost, though I will focus on the most reliable recent pattern. Since actual on-hand is 0 and recent demand averages ~85, I need to place an order. Using N=5 forRecent demand covers the current softening period (P36: 80, P35: 64, P34: 83, P33: 112, P32: 103). To force the OR engine to order despite the 328 units of phantom inventory in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, I must inflate mu_hat by at least 328 units. Base mu_hat for (L+1=3) periods would be ~255; after adding 328, I set an explicit mu_hat of 600 to ensure replenishment occurs.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late October (P38). Demand has transitioned from the summer peak (avg ~145) to a post-summer steady state of ~80-110 units/week (last 7 available demand points: 87, 103, 112, 83, 64, 80, 88; avg ~88). Critically, our on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a stockout. The 'In-transit' count of 681 units is highly misleading because it includes 328 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P1, P3, and P4) that will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline is 681 - 328 = 353 units (representing the large orders placed during the summer peak that are likely still arriving or were recently placed). Since on-hand is 0 and we need to satisfy current demand of ~90 units/week with a lead time of roughly 2 periods, we must ensure the OR backend orders enough. To account for the 328-unit 'In-transit' bloat which prevents the OR engine from ordering, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target base stock. Target stock = (1 + L) * Forecast + Phantom Offset. With L=2, Forecast=90, and Offset=328, the target is (3 * 90) + 328 = 598. I set mu_hat to 600 to trigger a recovery order.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand has shifted from a summer peak (~150 units) to a stable post-summer regime of approximately 80-90 units per week (the mean of the last 8 periods is ~83). On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory stands at 681 units, but 328 units are known 'phantom inventory' from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, and 4. This leaves an effective pipeline of 353 units (681 - 328). Since no new orders were placed between Periods 32 and 38, and no arrivals have occurred since Period 32, we are facing stockouts. Currently, the most recent valid order in the pipeline is from Period 29 (209 units), which is extremely overdue (9 periods). If P29 is also lost, the effective pipeline is actually only 144 units. However, I will assume a mean demand of 85 units. With L=2, the required base stock is (2+1)*85 = 255 units. To account for the 328 phantom units in the OR engine's pipeline calculation, I must inflate mu_hat by 328. Total mu_hat = 255 (target) + 328 (offset) = 583. Sigma_hat is set to reflect recent volatility (~20 units/week).

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Order from Period 29 (209 units) is now 9 periods overdue and likely lost, similar to P1, P3, and P4. Total suspected lost pipeline may now be 537 units (328 + 209).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (mid-November), the SKU 554598001 is facing a severe stockout. Demands for the last few periods (P35-P39) have stabilized in a post-summer regime averaging ~68 units/week. However, on-hand inventory is 0 and the 'In-transit' figure of 681 units is significantly compromised by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P1 (69), P3 (117), P4 (142), and now P29 (209) are significantly overdue (9+ periods for P29) and must be considered lost. Total 'ghost' inventory is 537 units. The OR engine calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. With 681 units in-transit, the backend thinks the pipeline is full, but the TRUE effective pipeline is only 144 units (681 - 537). To force the engine to place an order, I must manually inflate mu_hat. I will set L to 2 (recent average). I will set mu_hat to 800 (calculated as: (1+L)*70 + 537 lost units + ~50 safety buffer) to clear the phantom 537 units and cover 3 weeks of demand. I will set sigma_hat to 30 to account for recent demand volatility (range 49-88).

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed lost pipeline increased to 537 units (P1, P3, P4, and now P29 which is 11 periods past order). Effective in-transit inventory is currently 144 units despite the reported 681 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-November (Period 41). Demand has stabilized post-summer at approximately 60-70 units per week, significantly lower than the July/August peak of 150+. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 826 units is highly misleading. History confirms that shipments from P1 (69), P3 (117), P4 (142), and P29 (209) are lost, totaling 537 units of 'phantom inventory'. This phantom inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a recent demand mean of 65 units and a lead time of 2. Target = (L+1) * Mean = 3 * 65 = 195 units. To trigger an order despite the 537 units of lost stock, I must inflate mu_hat by the lost amount. New mu_hat = 195 + 537 = 732. This ensures the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the fake pipeline, allowing us to maintain on-hand inventory for the upcoming weeks. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual variability (1-3 periods) observed in concluded shipments.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-25. The environment is recovering from a prolonged stockout period (Periods 33-39) where NO orders were placed, despite demand continuing at ~45-60 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The reported In-transit inventory is 826 units, but 537 of these are confirmed 'phantom' units from lost shipments (P1: 69, P3: 117, P4: 142, P29: 209). This leaves an effective pipeline of 289 unts (P40: 145, and a new implied order from P41 which isn't visible in history yet but contributes to the total). Demand in the last two periods (P40: 28, P41: 47) suggests a late autumn baseline of ~40-50 units. To clear the stockout and account for the 537 lost units in the pipeline calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the necessary base stock at (L+1) * 50 = 150 units, plus the 537 units needed to offset the phantom inventory, totaling 687. Lead time remains around 2 periods. Setting L=2 and mu_hat=687 will force the OR engine to place an order that covers immediate demand once the first effective shipment (P40) arrives.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), we are in a post-summer demand regime where weekly demand has stabilized around 40-65 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit inventory of 826 units is highly misleading due to 'phantom inventory' from 4 definitively lost shipments: P1 (69), P3 (117), P4 (142), and P29 (209), totaling 537 lost units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 289 units (826 minus 537), most of which is the P40 order (145 units) that should arrive in Period 43 based on the average lead time of 2. Since the OR backend uses the inflated 'In-transit' figure (826) to calculate orders, it will incorrectly see a massive surplus and potentially not order anything. To force a correct order and recover from the stockout, mu_hat must be manually inflated to offset these 537 lost units. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' with a value of 717 (Calculated as: 3 periods of expected demand [50*3=150] + 537 phantom units + small buffer). This ensures the backend subtracts the phantom 826 from a target level that actually reflects desired stock + the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) has risen to 537 units (P1, P3, P4, and P29). These units remain in the 'In-transit' census indefinitely. Manual mu_hat inflation of approximately 540 units is required for all future periods to bypass the OR engine's capped policy and ensure new orders are placed as the system believes we are overstocked.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime where weekly demand has stabilized significantly lower than the summer peak, averaging approximately 41 units over the last 4 periods (range 17-64). Total In-transit is reported as 681 units, but persistent analysis confirms that 537 of these units are 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments (P1: 69, P3: 117, P4: 142, P29: 209). This leaves an effective pipeline of 144 units (total in-transit 681 - phantom 537). Because the OR backend's capped policy [min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)] sees the full 681 units, it will refuse to order even if on-hand inventory (currently 128) is depleted. To force the OR backend to place orders when necessary, I must inflate mu_hat by the total phantom inventory (537 units). I will set mu_hat to approximately 700, which covers (L+1) periods of actual forecasted demand (~120-150 units) plus the 537 unit offset. Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1-3 periods, so I will use 'calculate' to reflect this variability.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Demand has significantly dropped in the last two periods (P43: 17, P44: 17) compared to the previous post-summer average of ~80-90. This likely reflects a low-season dip for a basic T-shirt in December. On-hand inventory is 111. Total in-transit is 681, but 537 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P29). Actual pipeline inventory is only 144 units (though effectively 0 as no recent orders are outstanding besides the lost ones). To account for the 537 units of phantom inventory the OR engine thinks we have, I must set mu_hat to include this offset. Given the current low demand, I am forecasting a baseline of 30 units per week. For 3 periods (L+1), this is 90 units. Adding the 537 phantom units and a buffer for variance, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 680 to ensure the backend recognizes a need for stock if lead times or demand volatility return.

Carry-over insight: December demand drop: Weekly demand fallen to ~17 units in mid-December, down from ~80-90 in October/November.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (late December). Recent demand has dropped significantly to approximately 17-21 units/week, down from the October/November levels of ~80 units. This aligns with a winter seasonal lull for a basic T-shirt. On-hand inventory is 90 units, which covers over 4 weeks of current demand. However, the system reports an 'In-transit' balance of 681 units, while my records indicate 537 of those are permanently lost (P1, P3, P4, and P29). The 'real' pipeline is 144 units (681 - 537). Because the OR backend uses the full 681 in its capped policy calculation, it will refuse to place new orders. To maintain a safety stock of roughly 3 weeks (current demand ~20 * 3), I need the OR engine to think demand is high enough to justify the existing (phantom) stock. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 600. This value compensates for the 537 units of ghost inventory plus a buffer for the upcoming weeks. This ensures that as current on-hand inventory depletes, the OR engine will eventually order more despite the inflated in-transit count.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 (late December), observing a significant end-of-year demand drop for the Nora T-shirt, with recent weekly demand falling to ~15-20 units compared to the post-summer average of ~90. Current on-hand inventory is 75 units, which covers approximately 4-5 weeks of current demand. However, the system reports an 'In-transit' balance of 681 units, of which 537 are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P29). Excluding these, the true pipeline is 144 units (from recent orders). Since the OR backend uses the inflated 681 units in its pipeline inventory check, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset the 537 lost units. While on-hand stock is currently sufficient for the low-demand winter period, I must maintain mu_hat at a level that accounts for the phantom stock to prevent the permanent cessation of ordering. I will set mu_hat to approximately 600 (537 offset + expected demand for L+1 periods) to ensure the system remains responsive, even though immediate replenishment is not urgent due to high current cover.

Carry-over insight: December/Year-end demand trough confirmed: weekly demand dropped to 15-21 units (approx -80% from autumn levels).
