  "rationale": "a) Product Analysis: The item is a 'Fred Shortie 3 pack' (Basics Underwear), a staple product with relatively stable year-round demand. b) Demand Analysis: Historical data (Jan-Feb 2019) shows demand ranging from 103 to 201 units, with an average of 151 units per week. The most recent week (Feb 4) was the lowest (103), while early January was higher. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 arrives P3; order placed in P2 arrives P4. d) Inventory Assessment: Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 0. This is Period 1. Since lead time is 2, arrivals from an order placed now won't be available until the start of Period 4 (Decision Phase) to satisfy Period 3 demand resolution. e) Order Logic: I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 today to reach the arrival of the next potential order. Expected demand (based on mean 151) for 3 periods = 453 units. Given the recent drop to 103, I will target a slightly more conservative buffer. I will order 500 units to establish a baseline inventory and cover the lead-time gap.",

The Period 1 order (500 units) is in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (N+L = 1+2). Current on-hand is 0.

Historical data (Jan/Feb) shows demand ranging from 103 to 201 (avg ~150/week), but recent observed demand in the game (P1-P3) has been significantly lower (21-33), suggesting a potential stock-out at the source or a shift in demand regime. b) Demand Regime: Currently averaging ~25 units/week in the game history, though historical pre-game data suggests a potential for much higher demand (~150). c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2. The order from P1 (500 units) should arrive during P3's resolution and become visible in P4's conclude. Since P4 just started, I have not seen the 'P3 conclude' message yet.

Period 4 saw demand of 56. I calculate expected demand for the lead time window (L=2, so periods 5, 6, 7) at approximately 50 units/period. Inventory Situation: On-hand = 94. Pending Arrivals: The P1 order of 500 is notably missing (ordered P1, promised L=2, should have arrived P3/P4). The P2 order of 150 arrived in P4 (lead time = 2). The P3 order of 50 is expected in P5. The 'In-transit' figure is 550, which includes the missing 500 from P1 and 50 from P3.

However, given the current on-hand (94) plus the expected P3 arrival (50) equals 144 units, which covers nearly 3 periods of current demand trends (50/period), I will place a zero order this period to mitigate the risk of extreme overstocking from the potentially delayed 500-unit shipment.",

P1 order (500) has not arrived as of P5 conclude; since P1 order was placed Feb 11 and we are now at Mar 18, it is 2 periods past promised delivery and must be treated as lost.

March demand is particularly low; the spike in P4 (56) seems to be an outlier or backlog clearance. c) Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4). The P1 order of 500 units is confirmed lost. d) Inventory: On-hand=54. In-transit=600. Breakdown of in-transit: P3(50) - significantly overdue and likely lost; P6(50) - expected P8. I also see an extra 500 units in pipeline in the status which likely refers to the lost P1 units still showing in 'in-transit' despite being lost. e) Target inventory: We need to cover (L+1) periods = 3 periods of demand. At the current regime (~30 units/week), we need roughly 90 units. On-hand(54) + Expected P8(50) = 104 units. This covers the next three periods. Given the high Holding Cost ($1) relative to Profit ($1), overstocking is as damaging as stockouts.

Net reliable inventory = 32 (on-hand) + 25 (P7) + 50 (P6, though potentially late). e) Decision: To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at ~30 units/week, we need ~90-100 units.
