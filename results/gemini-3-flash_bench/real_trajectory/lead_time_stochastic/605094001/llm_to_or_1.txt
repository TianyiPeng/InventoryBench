Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 605094001 (Fred Shortie 3 pack). Historical demand data provided (5 weeks) shows a mean demand of 151.2 following a slight downward trend (158, 154, 201, 140, 103). The promised lead time (L) is 2. The target service level q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 1.0 / (1.0 + 1.0) = 0.5. With a 0.5 service level, the OR backend aims for the median. Current on-hand is 0. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available historical samples) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N helps capture the recent decelerating trend better than a global average would once more data points arrive. For Period 1, I will stick to the promised lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). Inventory is currently 0, but 210 units are in transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 2, these units are expected to arrive in Period 3. Historical demand for 'Fred Shortie 3 pack' underwear across the 5 provided weeks (plus Period 1) shows a slight downward trend: 158, 154, 201, 140, 103, and most recent Period 1 demand of 33. The low Period 1 demand (33) may be an outlier or a post-seasonal dip. Given the item is basic cotton underwear, demand is typically steady but can be volatile. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we lost 33 units of sales in Period 1, we must ensure the stock goal covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will use the mean of all available history (approx. 131 units/period) for mu_hat via the 'default' method and standard deviation via 'default' to allow the OR backend to establish a baseline safety stock while we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history (seed data + P1-P2) fluctuates: 158, 154, 201, 140, 103, 33, 21. There is a clear downward trend in the recent weeks (P1-P2), likely following a post-holiday or seasonal peak in January. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 395 units in-transit (210 from P1, 185 from P2). Promised lead time is 2 periods. Since P1's order was placed in P1, we expect it to arrive during P3's arrival phase (visible in P4's start). No shipments are confirmed lost yet. I will use the last 5 samples (P1, P2 + last 3 seed) to better reflect the current lower demand level while keeping a safety buffer. The OR backend uses p/(p+h) = 0.5, implying a target service level of 50%, which I offset by providing a slightly conservative mu_hat.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 395 units in-transit. The previous three periods saw zero sales despite non-zero demand because no inventory had arrived. According to the lead-time definition (L=2), the order placed in Period 1 (210 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 3's resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 3 conclude, suggesting that the initial order is delayed. The product is a staple item (Divided Basics 3-pack underwear). Historical demand samples (158, 154, 201, 140, 103) average ~151 units/week, while recent game periods show much lower demand (33, 21, 21). This discrepancy suggests either a regime shift or a data quality issue in the pre-game samples. Since we have no on-hand stock and orders are overdue, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=3) for demand to reflect the lower observed game-period demand while keeping the lead time at default to see if Period 1's order arrives this period. If it doesn't arrive by next period, I will adjust L to 'explicit' to account for logistics failure.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a staple underwear item. Reviewing history: Period 1's order of 210 units is still missing (it should have arrived in Period 3 if lead time was 2). Period 2's order of 185 units arrived in Period 4 (lead time 2 confirmed). The disappearance of the P1 shipment suggests a lost order or a significant delay, while the pipeline inventory (In-transit) still lists 210 units (likely the missing P1 order). Recent demand is significantly lower (avg 33/21/21/56 = 32.75) than the initial data provided (avg ~151). I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the actual observed demand since Period 1 to prevent severe overstocking, while keeping L as default since the one successful arrival (P2) matched the promised lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (210 units) is missing/lost as of Period 5 (exceeding promised lead time by 2 periods). Actual demand in first 4 periods is ~78% lower than pre-game samples (Avg 33 vs 151).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Fred Shortie 3 pack' (Underwear). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Order analysis: P1 order (210 units) is now 3 periods overdue (should have arrived P3, status unknown/lost). P2 order (185 units) arrived on time in P4. Since P1's shipment is still missing after 5 periods while P2 arrived correctly in 2, we must treat the P1 inventory (currently in-transit) as unreliable or lost to avoid under-ordering. Demand analysis: Pre-game mean was ~151, but the 5 periods of in-game data show a drastically lower mean of 32 (33, 21, 21, 56, 29). March data (P4-P5) does not yet show a significant spring-break spike for this basic item. I will set L=2 (promised), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the actual observed demand regime (~32 units/period) rather than the pre-game estimate, which was much higher. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that reflects current reality while the system naturally tries to replenish if the on-hand (100) falls below the target for a (2+1) period horizon.

Carry-over insight: P1 shipment (210 units) confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed as of P6 (5 periods elapsed, P2 arrived and concluded while P1 remains in-transit). Sustained demand regime shift: Average in-game demand (P1-P5) is 32 units/period, significantly lower than pre-game 151 (-79%).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), the product (Fred Shortie 3-pack Underwear) continues to exhibit a significantly lower demand regime compared to pre-game data. The in-game average demand across 6 periods is 28.5 units, compared to the pre-game average of 151. Period 6 demand was particularly low at 11 units. The Period 1 order (210 units) is now 6 periods in-transit with no arrival confirmation, while a subsequent Period 2 order arrived in the promised 2 periods (Period 4); we treat the Period 1 shipment as lost. Current inventory is 89 units on-hand, which covers roughly 3 periods of the new demand regime. With a lead time of 2 periods, we need to ensure (L+1)=3 periods of demand are covered. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Avg ~28.5 * 3 = 85.5) and L to default (2). This will likely result in a small or zero order as pipeline inventory is sufficient for the current pace.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is underwear (Divided Basics). Looking at the demand history since the start of the game (P1-P7), the mean demand is 27.6 units/period (33, 21, 21, 56, 29, 11, 22), which remains significantly lower than the pre-game average of 151. The spike in P4 (56) was an outlier compared to recent periods. Regarding logistics, the P1 shipment (210 units) is confirmed lost, as P2 (ordered after P1) arrived in P4. We have 67 units on-hand. With lead time L=2, the total pipeline plus on-hand should cover 3 periods of demand. Given current demand trends (~28/period), 67 units provides roughly 2.4 periods of cover. Although slightly below the target, the OR engine's 'cap' and 'base stock' logic (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) will naturally trigger a small order if needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the irrelevant high pre-game samples and focus on the current low-demand regime. L remains at the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains consistently lower than pre-game samples, averaging 28 units/period over P1-P7 vs pre-game 151.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we stocked out as demand spiked to 71 units (exceeding the 67 units on hand). On-hand inventory is now 0. The 'in-transit' balance of 210 units corresponds to the Period 1 order, which has been flagged as lost/delayed since Period 5 (arrived=0 for 7 consecutive periods post-order). Because the OR backend includes 'in-transit' units in its pipeline calculation, it thinks we are over-stocked and will not order unless we adjust parameters. I will use 'explicit' values to force an order. Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged 33 units/period, but spiked to 71 recently. I will set a forecast (mu_hat) based on the recent average of ~33 units per period across the lead time coverage (L+1=3), plus a safety buffer (sigma_hat) to handle the recent volatility, while assuming the 210 units are permanently lost.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Inventory stock-out confirmed at end of Period 8 (demand 71 vs supply 67). Period 1 order of 210 units remains unfulfilled and is confirmed lost; OR backend requires parameter modification to ignore this phantom inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the system is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory of 310 units includes a 210-unit order from Period 1 that is confirmed lost/defunct (overdue by 7 periods against a promised lead time of 2). The remaining 100 units in-transit were ordered in Period 9 and are expected to arrive in Period 11. Demand is in a low regime compared to pre-game samples: the average demand from Period 1-9 is 33.7 units, which is significantly lower than the pre-game mean of 151. However, demand in Period 8 (71) and Period 9 (40) shows a slight upward trend. I will use a recent_N of 9 to capture the actual in-game demand regime (Mean=33.7, Std~18) rather than the pre-game values. Crucially, I must use 'explicit' L to account for the 210 'ghost' units in-transit. By setting L to 9, the OR backend's target base stock formula (L+1)*mu calculation will effectively act as if it needs to cover ~330-340 units of inventory. Since it subtracts pipeline (310), it will trigger a small order to bridge the gap and ensure coverage given the stock-out, while avoiding over-ordering if the Period 9 shipment arrives on time.

However, the Period 1 order (210 units) is confirmed lost, as it has been 10 periods since it was placed. This 'phantom' inventory of 210 units is still being counted by the OR backend as 'In-transit' (Total In-transit: 238 = 210 from P1 + 28 from P10). To force the OR backend to order more units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * mean_demand + 210. Based on the in-game demand (P1-P10), the mean demand is approx 36 units/period. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 36) + 210 = 318. This compensates for the 210 phantom units that are preventing new orders. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility (approx 20 units/period std), so sqrt(3)*20 \u2248 35.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Lead time variability observed (P2 took 2 periods, P9 took 1 period). Effective pipeline inventory is distorted by 210 lost units from Period 1; mu_hat parameter must be artificially inflated by 210 to trigger replenishment orders.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as of Period 12 (Date: 2019/4/29). On-hand inventory is 0 after a stock-out in Period 11 (demand 76, sales capped at 45). The 'In-transit' figure of 273 units is highly deceptive because it includes 210 units from Period 1 that are confirmed lost. The actual functional pipeline is only 63 units (28 from Period 10, 35 from Period 11). Demand in recent periods (P8-P11) has increased, averaging approx 60 units/period, significantly higher than the early game average of 32. To force the OR backend into ordering despite the phantom 210 units in the pipeline, I must set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To cover 3 periods of demand (L+1, where L=2) at a rate of ~60 units/period, a base stock of ~180 is needed. Subtracting the actual pipeline of 63 leaves an order requirement of ~117. To achieve this from the backend formula 'order = base_stock - pipeline', where the backend thinks pipeline is 273, I must set mu_hat (the base stock parameter) to approximately 390 (273 + 117). Choosing explicit value 390 for mu_hat ensures replenishment happens immediately. L is kept at 2, and sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P8: Average demand increased from ~30 to ~60 units/period (+100%) through P11. Stock-out conditions persist due to lost P1 shipment (210 units) distorting pipeline inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (Period 12 ending inventory 0). Demand has shifted significantly upward since Period 8, averaging ~70 units/period (P8-P12), compared to ~30 units/period in the early game. The 210 units ordered in Period 1 are confirmed lost but still occupy the 'In-transit' pipeline inventory in the OR engine's view (Total In-transit: 390 = 210 lost + 28 + 35 + 117). This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary replenishment orders because it believes supply is sufficient. To force an order and clear the stock-out, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' and inflated by the volume of the lost shipment (210 units). For Period 13, I estimate demand at (L+1) * 70. With L=2, base demand is 210. Adding the 210 lost units brings mu_hat to 420. This adjustment compensates for the pipeline distortion and ensures the system orders to meet the new higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 8-12 average demand is 70 units/period, a +133% increase from Period 1-7 average (30). Stock-out conditions continue due to lost P1 shipment (210 units) blocking pipeline calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation remains critical due to the persistent distortion caused by the lost Period 1 order (210 units), which effectively 'blocks' the OR backend from placing necessary replenishment orders by inflating the pipeline. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Period 13 shows demand remains elevated (77), confirming the higher demand regime shift observed since Period 8. Over the last 6 periods (P8-P13), average demand is 71 units/period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the total requirement for the coverage cycle (L+1) is approximately 213 units. However, the system sees 385 units in-transit (including the 210 'ghost' units). To force the OR backend into action, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for both prospective demand and the missing 210 units. Calculation: 213 (forecasted demand for 3 periods) + 210 (lost shipment correction) = 423. Since the backend caps the order, I am setting mu_hat high enough to trigger the max possible order to resolve the current stock-out. Method recent_N is used for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility (N=6 for P8-P13 regime), while L is kept at 2.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '605094001' (cotton hipster briefs) is experiencing a significant demand increase, with Period 11-14 average demand at 89.25 units/period, compared to the earlier regime of ~30. The Period 1 order of 210 units remains lost/in-transit indefinitely, which creates a 'phantom' pipe of 210 units. Since the OR backend uses base_stock - pipeline_inventory (where pipeline includes the lost 210 units) to determine orders, it will under-order or not order at all unless we compensate. To force the backend to place an order that covers the new demand regime (approx. 90 units/period) while ignoring the 210 lost units, I must set mu_hat to (Expected Demand * (1+L)) + Lost Units. With L=2 (promised), Expected Demand across L+1 periods = 90 * 3 = 270. Adding the 210 lost units yields a mu_hat of 480. I will use sigma_hat 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the increased volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 11-14 average demand is 89.25 units/period (+197% vs early game). Phantom inventory of 210 units (Period 1) persists, requiring mu_hat inflation.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, the system faces two critical issues: 1) A persistent supply deficit causing stock-outs, and 2) a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 210 units from Period 1 that never arrived and is confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock target, these 210 units block new orders from being placed. To bypass this, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. Demand has clearly shifted into a higher regime: Period 11-15 average demand is 96 units/period. Following the logic from Period 15, I need to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 210 units of phantom inventory. With L=2, base demand needs are (3 * 96) = 288. Adding the 210 phantom units yields a required mu_hat of 498. This ensures the OR engine places orders despite the missing shipment. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility (N=5) to maintain a safety buffer during this higher demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high levels: Periods 11-15 average 96 units/period (+200% compared to early game P1-P7). Lost P1 shipment (210 units) continues to distort the OR engine's pipeline calculations, requiring manual mu_hat inflation of +210 units to trigger necessary ordering.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 605094001 is currently in a state of stock-out with 0 units on-hand and 498 units in-transit. A critical issue remains: the 210 units ordered in Period 1 are confirmed lost (as per Carry-over Insights) but still occupy the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation. To force the engine to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be artificially inflated by the amount of this 'phantom' inventory (+210 units). Demand analysis shows a sustained high-demand regime from Period 11 onwards. Period 16 saw demand peak at 153 units. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P12-P16) is 111.4 units/period. Therefore, the base forecast for a (1+L=3) period horizon is 334.2 units. Adding the 210 unit inflation for the lost shipment results in a mu_hat of 544.2. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain control over this specific pipeline distortion correction and the high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime remains aggressive: P12-P16 average demand is 111.4 units/period, compared to P8-P11 average of ~60. Growth is sustained and currently peaks at 153 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 18 (June 10). The product (Fred Shortie 3 pack) is in a high-demand regime. Average demand from P12-P17 is ~108 units/period. The lost shipment from Period 1 (210 units) remains in 'In-transit' indefinitely, which causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order by 210 units (phantom inventory). To compensate, I must continue to inflate mu_hat by 210 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P16 arrived in 1, P15 in 2), so L=2 (promised) is a safe planning horizon. For demand forecasting, I'll use the recent 6 periods (P12-P17) to capture the current high-demand regime: (106+77+98+123+153+93)/6 = 108.33. Base mu_hat = (1+L)*Mean = (1+2)*108.33 = 325. Adding the 210-unit compensation for the lost P1 shipment, the explicit mu_hat is 535. Sigma_hat is calculated using the std of the same period (approx 27.6) for the (1+L) horizon: sqrt(3)*27.6 \u2248 48.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime remains stable: P12-P17 average demand is 108.3 units/period. Lead time variability persists (1-2 periods). Phantom inventory of 210 units (P1) still requires manual offset in mu_hat.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a high-demand phase compared to the beginning of the game, with the last 7 periods (P12-P18) averaging approximately 86 units/period, though the most recent period (P18) showed a dip to 50. The primary issue remains the 'phantom inventory' of 210 units from the lost Period 1 order. Because this order is still 'In-transit', the OR engine's base-stock logic [order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)] perceives an extra 210 units that do not exist, preventing necessary replenishment. To counter this, I am manually inflating mu_hat. Recent 3-period demand (P16-P18) average is ~99 units/period. For a promised lead time of 2 (review+lead = 3 periods), the required mu_hat would be ~297. Adding the 210 units to offset the phantom inventory results in a total mu_hat of 507. I will use 'explicit' to force this replenishment and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the high recent volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 605094001 is in a stable high-demand regime. Demand over the last 8 periods (P12-P19) has averaged 86 units per week, significantly higher than the early game average of 30. Current internal inventory tracking is still distorted by the 210 units ordered in Period 1 which never arrived (confirmed lost). To the OR backend, these units appear to be 'in-transit', preventing it from placing necessary replenishment orders. To counteract this 'phantom inventory', I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + Lead Time) * Current Mean Demand + Lost Units offset. With L=2 (Review + Lead Time = 3 periods total) and a current mean demand of ~90, the baseline mu_hat would be 270. Adding the 210 unit offset to clear the phantom stock calculation results in an explicit mu_hat of 480. Lead time remains variable between 1 and 2 periods, so I am using the 'calculate' method for L to use the moving historical average. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=8) to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

The product is in a high-demand regime compared to the start of the game. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 83.4 units, though it shows some volatility (ranging from 50 to 153). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current trend while smoothing the noise. A critical environmental factor is the 'phantom inventory' from Period 1 (210 units), which is confirmed lost but remains in the OR backend's 'in-transit' calculation. As in previous periods, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by this 210-unit offset to effectively trick the OR system into ordering enough to cover the actual demand plus the 210-unit deficit created by the lost shipment. Without this offset, the backend believes it has 210 more units coming than it actually does, leading to persistent stock-outs. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will use the 'calculate' method to allow the backend to use the historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 16-20 average demand is 83.4 units with a peak of 153. Lost P1 shipment (210 units) continues to distort pipeline inventory, necessitating a +210 unit inflation in mu_hat to bypass the error.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 605094001 is currently in a state of stock-out (ending on-hand: 0). The most significant factor remains the 210 units ordered in Period 1 that are confirmed lost; these units permanently occupy 'in-transit' space in the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation, preventing it from placing necessary replenishment orders unless the target (base stock) is artificially raised by 210 units. Demand in the most recent regime (P16-P21) averages 83.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 45, showing high volatility. Promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover the expected demand of (L+1) periods (3 periods) and successfully overcome the 210-unit pipeline distortion, mu_hat must be set to (83.2 * 3) + 210 = 459.6. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent N (5) periods of volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during this high-demand summer period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is currently in a high-demand regime compared to the early game, though it has stabilized from a peak of 153 down to an average of roughly 70 units over the last 5 periods (P18-P22). On-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 419 units. However, this pipeline is significantly distorted by the 'phantom' 210 units ordered in Period 1 that never arrived and are confirmed lost. To ensure the OR backend (Base Stock policy) triggers an order, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS an additional 210 units to offset these lost units that the engine thinks are still coming. I will use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the current stabilized high level (Avg ~70) and calculate mu_hat as (1+L)*70 + 210. With L=2, this equals 3*70 + 210 = 420. sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. L will be calculated to reflect the observed variability between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to experience a stock-out (ending on-hand: 0). Period 23 saw demand of 52 units, with 44 units arriving and sold. The 'In-transit' quantity of 376 units is heavily distorted by the lost Period 1 order (210 units). True physical pipeline inventory (excluding P1) consists of orders from P23 (1 unit) and any other recent undelivered orders. Currently, the recorded in-transit (376) minus the lost shipment (210) equals 166 units, which represents orders from periods that have not yet arrived. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P18-P23) is 59.8 units/period. To trigger the OR backend to order sufficiently, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset for the 210 'invisible' units sitting in the pipeline inventory. With L=2, demand for 3 periods is ~180 units. Adding the 210 offset requires a mu_hat of ~390. I will set mu_hat to 400 to account for recent volatility and the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set to 45 (sqrt(3) * ~26) to manage the sustained demand variation.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 605094001 is currently in a state of stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Period 24 demand was 43. Analyzing recent demand (Period 18-24), the average is approximately 57 units/period. The 'lost' Period 1 shipment of 210 units remains in-transit, distorting the OR pipeline calculation (on-hand + in-transit). To force the backend to place an order despite this 210-unit phantom inventory, mu_hat must be inflated by 210. Using recent_N (N=7) for the base demand gives an average of 57.3 units. Total mu_hat target = 57.3 * (1 + 2) + 210 \u2248 382. Since recent demand has cooled from the Period 16 peak of 153 to a more stable range (40-70), I will use an explicit mu_hat of 385 to ensure replenishment triggers. Sigma_hat is set based on the last 7 periods to capture current volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/8/5), the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' count is 400 units, but 210 of these are from the Period 1 order which is confirmed lost as of Period 6. This phantom inventory continues to prevent the OR engine from placing necessary orders because it incorrectly believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I must artificially inflate the 'mu_hat' parameter by at least 210 units. Demand has shifted from its earlier peak (P15-P17) to a lower, more stable regime; the last 5 periods (P21-P25) averaged 53 units/period. The lead time (L) varies between 1 and 2 periods. I will set L=2 (promised/conservative) and mu_hat to 400. This 400 covers 3 periods of expected demand (53 units * 3 = 159) plus the 210 unit offset needed to clear the pipeline error (159 + 210 = 369, rounded to 400 for safety and to force a replenishment order). Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) with 399 units in-transit. A critical persistent issue is the 'lost' order from Period 1 (210 units), which remains in the In-transit count (399 = 210 lost + 47 from P17 + 83 from P18 + ...). Because the OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, these 210 phantom units prevent the system from placing necessary replenishment orders, causing chronic stock-outs. To bypass this, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by approximately 210 units to offset the phantom pipeline. Recent demand (P21-P26) has averaged ~50 units/period (82, 54, 52, 43, 33, 35). Thus, true demand for (L+1=3) periods is ~150. Adding the 210 offset, I set mu_hat to 360 using the 'explicit' method. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised). Sigma_hat is set to 60 (approx. 20% of the inflated mean) to maintain a buffer for volatility.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stock-out state (on-hand: 0) as of Period 28. The pipeline inventory is heavily distorted by a 'phantom' shipment of 210 units from Period 1 that was never delivered but still occupies the OR backend's inventory calculation. Consequently, the backend believes current inventory levels (0 on-hand + 399 in-transit) significantly exceed needed base stock, preventing new orders. Recent demand (P22-P27) has stabilized at a lower mean of ~43 units/period compared to the summer peak, but total inventory needs to cover demand during the lead time (L=2) plus a buffer. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat (target base stock) to a value that exceeds the phantom-inflated pipeline (399 + current demand). By setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 630 (calculated as (1+L)*(recent_mean 43 + phantom 210) \u2248 3 * 253), I override the logic to trigger a replenishment despite the stuck P1 order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean demand stabilized at ~43 units/period (P22-P27), down from peak P12-P21 levels. Phantom inventory of 210 units (P1) still precludes normal ordering without manual mu_hat inflation.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 605094001 has stabilized in a lower regime compared to its mid-game peak, with the last 7 periods (P22-P28) averaging 41.5 units. The primary strategic challenge remains the phantom inventory from Period 1 (210 units), which the OR backend treats as 'in-transit' pipeline stock. My previous order in Period 28 (231 units) was an attempt to break the ordering deadlock caused by this phantom stock. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 630 units in transit (which includes the 210 lost units and the 231 units ordered last period). To ensure the OR engine maintains stock levels for 40-50 units per period without being blocked by the 210 units it thinks it has, I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' at 350. This value is derived from roughly 3 periods of expected demand (L=2, so L+1=3) plus the 210 unit offset (3 * 45 + 210 \u2248 345). This keeps the base stock high enough to trigger replenishment despite the pipeline error, ensuring we don't stock out while waiting for recent orders to arrive.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 605094001 is currently in a state where the OR backend's 'Pipeline Inventory' calculation is permanently flawed due to a 210-unit order from Period 1 that never arrived and is confirmed lost. This 'phantom inventory' prevents the system from placing new orders because it believes 210 units are in-transit. To bypass this, mu_hat must be artificially inflated by the amount of the lost shipment (210) plus the projected demand for the (L+1) period window. Recent demand (P22-P29) has stabilized at an average of 43.4 units per period. The promised lead time is 2, making the forecast window 3 periods. Expected demand = 3 * 43.4 \u2248 130. Adding the 210-unit offset, mu_hat should be approximately 340. Sigma_hat is set to a recent window (N=8) to reflect the current stability compared to the mid-game volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '605094001' is in a stabilized demand regime following a high-volatility summer period. In the last five periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged 30.8 units, showing a significant decrease from the P12-P21 peak. The current inventory status shows 212 units on-hand and 399 units in-transit. Crucially, the 'in-transit' figure remains severely distorted by the lost Period 1 order (210 units). Because the OR backend subtracts total pipeline inventory (including these phantom 210 units) from the target base stock, it will fail to place necessary orders as demand naturally depletes the actual on-hand stock. To counteract this, I continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method, setting it to (1 + L) * Forecast + 210. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = 3 * 35 + 210 = 315. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current volatility while ignoring the early-game low-demand artifacts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at ~31 units/period (P26-P30). Phantom inventory of 210 units from Period 1 remains in 'In-transit', necessitating constant mu_hat inflation of +210 to ensure the OR backend generates valid replenishment orders.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 605094001 has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 30 units per period (P26-P31 average is ~27). The primary operational challenge remains the lost shipment of 210 units from Period 1. This 'phantom' inventory stays in the 'In-transit' calculation for the OR backend, which subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. If mu_hat is set to the actual expected demand (e.g., (1+L)*30 = 90), the backend calculates 90 - (On-hand + Phantom In-transit) = 90 - (189 + 210 + legitimate in-transit), resulting in a negative number and 0 orders. To force the backend to place an order when necessary, mu_hat must be inflated by 210 units to neutralize this error. Current on-hand is 189, which covers roughly 6 periods of the current demand (30/period). With L=2, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=3 periods. Currently, 189 on-hand is sufficient, but we must maintain the mu_hat offset so that when on-hand drops, the backend is capable of ordering. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 300 (roughly (1+L)*30 + 210) to maintain this buffer.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a lower level following the mid-game peak. Over the last 5 periods (P28-P32), demand averaged 26.2 units/period. On-hand inventory is 159, and in-transit inventory is 399. However, the in-transit inventory includes 210 units from Period 1 that are confirmed lost/missing. These 210 units are considered 'phantom inventory' by the OR backend's pipeline calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). To prevent the backend from under-ordering or failing to order because it thinks those 210 units are coming, I must inflate mu_hat by 210 units to offset this error. For the underlying demand forecast, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the current stable mean of ~26 units. With L=2, the base mu_hat would be (1+2)*26 = 78. Adding the 210 offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 288. Sigma is set using recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 605094001 has stabilized in a lower regime compared to its mid-game peak. In the last 6 periods (P28-P33), the average demand is 29.8 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 111 units. However, the system's stock calculations are still distorted by a 'phantom' in-transit shipment of 210 units from Period 1 that was never fulfilled but remains in the pipeline count. To bypass this, I must continue to inflate the mu_hat parameter by 210 units to ensure the OR backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline) does not incorrectly assume we are overstocked. Without this adjustment, the backend would effectively see 111 (on-hand) + 399 (total in-transit, including the 210 lost and subsequent orders) = 510 total units, preventing any new orders despite potential future needs. I am setting L to explicit 2 (the promised lead time which has been the median actual lead time) and mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current stable demand of ~30/period, then manually adding the 210 unit buffer via the 'explicit' method: (1+L)*30 + 210 = 300.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Fred Shortie 3 pack' (Underwear) has stabilized in a low-level regime. Over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), demand has averaged 30.4 units/period (19, 23, 30, 48, 32). On-hand inventory is currently 79 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 399 units is heavily distorted by the lost Period 1 shipment (210 units), leaving an effective pipeline of 189 units. However, there have been no orders placed since P28, and no arrivals are expected in the immediate periods based on the history. The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will still be blocked by the 210 units of phantom inventory from Period 1. To ensure the backend can place an order when on-hand stock is depleted, I must continue to inflate mu_hat by +210. I am using recent_N=5 to capture the current stable demand of ~30. This results in an un-inflated mu_hat of (1+L)*30 = 90. Adding the 210 offset, the explicit mu_hat is 300. This ensures the OR backend sees enough 'demand' to overcome the phantom pipeline inventory once on-hand levels drop further. I will use recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Fred Shortie 3 pack' (Underwear) has stabilized into a low-volatility regime following the mid-year peaks. Over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), the average demand is 31.7 units/period with relatively low variance. The primary operational challenge continues to be the 'phantom inventory' of 210 units from the Period 1 order, which remains in the 'In-transit' calculation but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend (base stock minus pipeline) triggers a replenishment order now that on-hand inventory has dropped to 49 units, I must continue to inflate the 'mu_hat' parameter by approximately 210 units to offset this error. Given the stable demand of ~32 units, a standard (1+L)*mu calculation for L=2 would be ~96. Adding the 210 offset, I will set mu_hat to 306. Lead time remains estimated at the promised 2 periods, as recent arrivals have clustered around this value.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand remains stable at ~32 units/period (P26-P35 avg: 31.7). Phantom inventory of 210 units from P1 remains the primary driver for manual mu_hat inflation to ensure replenishment.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 605094001 has stabilized in a lower regime. For the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the average demand is 31.8 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 13 units. However, there is a persistent 'phantom inventory' issue: 210 units ordered in Period 1 were lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 399, of which 189 units are valid recent orders from Periods 17-24 that have not arrived or were absorbed in previous stock-outs). Specifically, the OR backend's capped policy calculation 'min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)' will prevent any new orders because the pipeline_inventory is artificially inflated by these 210 'lost' units plus older unrecorded losses. To force a replenishment order when on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (13 units), I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (Avg Demand * (1+L)) + 210 = (32 * 3) + 210 = 306. This ensures the OR logic perceives a requirement for more stock despite the phantom pipeline units. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of the last 10 periods (approx 8.5) scaled for the (1+L) horizon.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following the conclusion of Period 37. The phantom inventory of 210 units from Period 1 still exists in the 'In-transit' bucket (Total In-transit: 399, of which 189 units are from more recent orders). This phantom inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated by 210 units. Since Period 26, demand has stabilized into a lower regime, averaging 31.5 units per period (Periods 26-37). To ensure replenishment, I am setting L to the promised lead time of 2. For mu_hat, I calculate the base requirement as (1+L) * 32 (recent average) \u2248 96, and then add the 210-unit phantom offset to reach a final explicit value of 306. This ensures the backend recognizes a need for stock despite the 'In-transit' error. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=12 to reflect the volatility of this current stable regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. On-hand inventory is 0 and we are in a stock-out state after Period 37-38. The primary operational constraint is the 'phantom inventory' effect caused by the missing Period 1 shipment (210 units), which remains in 'In-transit' indefinitely and prevents the OR backend from triggering orders. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds (210 + pipeline demand) to force the policy to order. Demand has been stable since Period 26, averaging approximately 32 units/period. The target stock position for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods) at 32 units/period is ~96 units. Adding the 210 units to offset the phantom inventory results in a required mu_hat of 306. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat (306) and sigma_hat (based on recent volatility) to ensure replenishment occurs immediately to recover from the stock-out.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has been stocked out since Period 37. As established in multiple previous periods, the Period 1 order of 210 units is 'lost' (indefinitely delayed) but remains visible as 'in-transit' to the OR backend. To force a replenishment order, mu_hat must be inflated by at least this phantom inventory amount (210 units). For Period 40 (Nov 11), demand has been stable in a lower regime; the average demand from P26 to P39 is approximately 32.5 units/period. The current pipeline inventory includes the 210 lost units plus the Period 24 order (24 units) which is now 16 periods overdue and likely lost as well (totaling 234 units of 'phantom' stock). In-transit is currently reported at 399, but we know the actual available pipeline is zero. To ensure the backend places an order sufficient for 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) while countering the 399 unit phantom in-transit data, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 500. This provides a buffer and triggers an order that covers our current demand regime (~33 units/period) while effectively zeroing out the error caused by the unresponsive in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed stock-out since Period 37. Total 'phantom' in-transit inventory has increased to 399 units (including the P1 and P24 lost orders), requiring mu_hat inflation of at least 400 to trigger replenishment in the OR engine.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a prolonged stock-out (ending inventory 0 since P37) due to a known logic constraint in the OR backend: the engine considers 'phantom' in-transit inventory from lost shipments (P1: 210 units, P24: 24 units, and potentially others) as expected arrivals, which prevents it from placing new orders. As of P41, in-transit is 500 units, while on-hand is 0. Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~32 units/period (P26-P40 avg). To force the backend to place an order sufficient to cover demand and overcome the pipeline distortion, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am inflating mu_hat to 650. This value is calculated to exceed the current in-transit (500) plus enough stock to cover the review period and lead time at current demand levels (approx 3 periods * 35 units = 105). Setting mu_hat to 650 ensures (base_stock - pipeline) > 0, triggering immediate replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Total 'phantom' or severely delayed in-transit inventory has reached 500 units (up from 399 in P40). The OR engine requires mu_hat inflation of >500 units to bypass this pipeline distortion and resume ordering.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '605094001' is suffering from a massive 'In-transit' accounting error in the OR backend. As of Period 42, there are 650 units listed as 'In-transit', but historical conclude messages confirm that several large orders (Period 1 for 210, Period 24 for 24, and others) never arrived. These 'phantom' units prevent the OR engine from ordering because it believes pipeline inventory is already extremely high. Since the goal is to cover L+1 periods of demand (~3 weeks), and on-hand is 0, the engine's formula [base_stock - pipeline] will return 0 or negative unless mu_hat is inflated above the phantom total. Current phantom inventory is approximately 650 units. We must inflate mu_hat to at least 750 to bypass the 650 phantom units and provide enough 'base_stock' to trigger a replenishment order that covers the current demand regime (~30-40 units/period). This is a manual intervention to force the backend to ignore the broken pipeline state and resume shipments before the game ends in Period 47.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Phantom in-transit inventory has reached 650 units. OR backend requires mu_hat inflation > 650 to trigger any orders and resolve the ongoing stock-out.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stock-out state (on-hand: 0) with a significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 750 units. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 1 (210 units) and various subsequent periods have not arrived and are effectively lost, yet \u043e\u043d\u0438 still count toward the pipeline inventory in the OR backend's logic. To resume replenishment and satisfy demand, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to exceed the total in-transit units. Current in-transit is 750 (sum of lost P1, P24, and recent P40-P42 orders). Demand analysis: The most recent periods show a sharp increase (P42 demand: 143), likely due to seasonal factors (Late Nov/Early Dec). The average demand for the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is ~54. I will set mu_hat to 1000 using the 'explicit' method to bypass the 750 pipeline units and trigger a significant order to address the stock-out before the end of the simulation (Period 47).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Phantom/lost in-transit inventory has reached 750 units (including P1, P24). mu_hat must be inflated > 750 to bypass the pipeline inventory constraint and allow ordering. Significant demand spike observed (143 units) in P42, likely seasonal for December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 shows the arrival of units from Period 40 and 41, resolving the long stock-out. On-hand inventory is 241 units. However, the 'phantom' inventory problem persists: Period 1 (210 units), Period 12 (residual units), and Period 24 (24 units) remain 'In-transit' indefinitely, totaling approximately 749 units. This pipeline inflation prevents the OR engine from ordering unless mu_hat is manually inflated to exceed this phantom level. Demand in the last period (P43) was very low (10), contrasted with a spike in P42 (143), suggesting high December volatility. To ensure we continue replenishment and don't fall back into a stock-out given the 2-3 period lead time, I will set mu_hat to 1050 (Phantom 749 + ~300 units for 3 weeks of high-season demand) to force the engine to maintain a healthy stock level for the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Phantom in-transit inventory remains at ~750 units. Orders from P40 and P41 arrived with 2-3 period lead times. mu_hat requires continued inflation (>750) to ensure the OR backend ignores phantom inventory and places new orders.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 605094001 continues to suffer from a significant 'phantom inventory' issue where 750 units (primarily from Period 1 and Period 24) are recorded as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. As of Period 45, the OR backend sees 206 units On-hand and 809 units In-transit (total pipeline of 1,015 units). Because the base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) for a demand of ~35-50 units is significantly lower than 1,015, the backend will not place any new orders unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to exceed this phantom pipeline. Recent demand has fluctuated: a seasonal spike of 143 in P42 followed by 10 and 35. To ensure we keep stock for the remaining 3 periods of the game (total periods = 47), and to bypass the 1,015 unit pipeline block, mu_hat must be set to at least 1,100. This is a technical override to force the OR engine to function despite the data corruption in the pipeline inventory tracker. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised), and sigma is kept high to account for the volatility seen in December.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Phantom in-transit inventory persists at ~750 units. Combined with valid recent orders, the total pipeline inventory is 809 units. To bypass OR backend ordering suppression, mu_hat must be inflated above 1,100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-428.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 begins with on-hand inventory of 492 units and 'in-transit' of 594 units. However, based on history, at least 234 units (P1: 210, P24: 24) are confirmed lost/phantom, and several other older orders are likely lost, totaling approximately 750 phantom units as identified in P45. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its base stock calculation; if it sees 594 in-transit, it will stop ordering. Based on the current high-demand season (late December), we must ensure enough inventory arrives for the final periods. Recent demand (P42-P45) has been volatile (143, 10, 35, 64) with a seasonal peak in P42. The mean of the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is 53.2. To bypass the 594 'in-transit' units and the on-hand 492 (total 1,086 'pipeline'), while maintaining a safety buffer for potentially high holiday demand, mu_hat is set to 1,300. This should force the OR engine to place a replenishment order despite the phantom inventory. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual 2-3 period lead times observed recently.

Carry-over insight: End-of-year seasonal demand spike confirmed (P42: 143 units). Phantom in-transit inventory remains the primary constraint, requiring mu_hat inflation > 1,100 to trigger replenishment.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to face a 'phantom inventory' problem where the OR backend calculates pipeline inventory based on lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (specifically Period 1 and Period 24), totaling approximately 234 units. Recent arrivals (P40-P43) have resolved the immediate stock-out, but the In-transit figure (808) is highly inflated by these phantom units. In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 424. The current demand regime (last 5 periods) averages ~38.4 units, though we saw a seasonal spike of 143 in Period 42. With the game ending soon and current high on-hand levels, we need to maintain mu_hat at a level that accounts for the phantom 234 units plus projected demand for the (L+1) window (approx 3*50 = 150). Therefore, a mu_hat around 400 is normally sufficient to cover demand, but to ensure the backend doesn't stop ordering if in-transit spikes further, I will keep mu_hat inflated. However, since we have 424 on-hand and 808 in pipeline, the system effectively thinks we have 1,232 units. To trigger any replenishment if needed, mu_hat must technically exceed 1,232. Given we are at Period 47 (near end of year/game), I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1,300 to bypass the pipeline logic and rely on the OR backend's cap to prevent over-ordering, ensuring we don't stock out if demand spikes again for New Year's.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory (lost/delayed P1 and P24 orders) remains in the pipeline, totaling 234 units. This requires manual mu_hat inflation > (On-hand + In-transit) to force the OR backend to place replenishment orders despite the false pipeline data.
