Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for a women's short-sleeved cotton jersey dress. Demand samples for the last 5 weeks show an increasing trend: 48, 47, 38, 61, 67 (mean \u2248 52.2). The latest two weeks (61, 67) suggest a demand shift as we approach spring. Given the item is a short-sleeved dress, demand is likely to continue rising throughout February and March. Lead time is promised at 2 periods. Currently, there is 0 inventory and 0 in-transit. I will use the recent_N method (N=5) to capture the recent upward momentum in demand while maintaining responsiveness. mu_hat will be based on (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat on sqrt(1+L)*std using these 5 samples.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, a basic item. Historical demand from the initial samples (Jan 7 - Feb 4) averaged 52.2 units per week. Period 1 demand was higher at 62 units, indicating a possible upward trend as we move towards spring. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 72 units in-transit from the Period 1 order. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, we expect the Period 1 order to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Therefore, we need to cover demand for current Period 2, Period 3, and the arrival in Period 4 (L+1 periods). Given the slight upward trend in recent samples (61, 67, 62), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand level moderately while acknowledging the item's staple nature. Lead time will stay at the default promised 2 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's jersey basic short-sleeved dress. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows an upward trend: 48, 47, 38, 61, 67, and recent game periods P1 (62) and P2 (70). The mean demand over the last 4 weeks is approximately 65. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from P1 (72 units) and P2 (79 units) are in-transit (total 151). Per the Lead Time Definition, the P1 order (L=2) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and will be visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). Thus, the current on-hand of 0 is expected. However, demand is trending up as we approach spring. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this shift (avg ~65) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. For lead time, I will stick to the 'default' promised 2 periods until evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). This SKU is a 'short-sleeved dress in soft cotton jersey', a seasonal 'Womens Everyday Basics' item. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averaged 52.2 units/week. Since Period 1, observed demand has increased: 62, 70, 76. This 3-period trend (avg 69.3) matches the seasonal transition into spring. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (72 units), P2 (79 units), and P3 (57 units) are currently in-transit. Based on L=2, the P1 order should have arrived during P3 and been visible in the P3 conclude message, but all conclude messages show arrived=0. This suggests either a lead time drift (L=3+) or a delay. However, we cannot confirm a lost shipment yet. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent uptick (approx 70 units/week) and use L=3 'explicitly' to account for the missing P1 arrival, ensuring the OR backend calculates a higher base stock to cover the current stockout (on-hand is 0).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 458239001 is a 'Short-sleeved dress in soft cotton jersey'. Current date is March 11, 2019, transitioning into spring in the Northern Hemisphere, which generally sees increasing demand for basic dresses. Historical demand (last 10 weeks) shows a gradual upward trend: 48, 47, 38, 61, 67, 62, 70, 76, 63. The mean of the most recent 5 samples (P0-P4) is 67.6, compared to the earlier baseline of 52.2. Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order arrived in P4). Order placed in P1 (72 units) is still missing (overdue), as only the P2 order arrived. This creates a supply gap despite the high in-transit number (211). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher demand level (approx. 68 units/week) and use the promised lead time (default), as there is no evidence that the P1 delay is a permanent lead-time shift rather than a one-off loss.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 2019: average demand increased from ~50 to ~68 (+36%), likely due to seasonal transition into Spring.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, which is entering peak spring seasonality. Demand in the most recent periods (P1-P5) has averaged 69.8 units, significantly higher than the initial January data (~48). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Looking at the supply chain: P2 order (79 units) arrived in P4 (lead time 2). However, the P1 order (72 units) and P3 order (57 units) are both significantly overdue (P1 is now 5 periods since order, P3 is 3 periods since order). Given the 'In-transit' total is 211 (72 + 57 + 82 + 0), and P1/P3 have not concluded, there is a high risk that these shipments are lost or severely delayed. To protect against stockouts during this high-demand spring period, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 210 (3 * 70) to cover the promised lead time (2) + current period (1). I am using 'explicit' for L to acknowledge the delivery instability while the OR backend attempts to reconcile the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set based on recent variability (std of P1-P5 is ~7.4).

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain disruption: Orders from Period 1 and Period 3 are overdue/lost as of Period 6, leading to stockouts despite sufficient pipeline quantity.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/03/25). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced significant supply chain issues. As of Period 7 start, orders from Period 1 (72 units) and Period 3 (57 units) are missing. Period 1 is now 4 periods overdue (6 periods since order), and Period 3 is 2 periods overdue (4 periods since order). The only successful arrival was Period 2's order in Period 4 (lead_time=2). Demand has shifted upwards since February, with the last 5 periods averaging ~73 units. With the arrival of Spring, demand for 'Short-sleeved dress' is expected to remain high or increase. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime (avg ~73) across (L+1)=3 periods. Given the missing shipments, the OR backend's cap may be too restrictive because it 'counts' missing orders in the pipeline; I will use 'explicit' for L=2 to ensure the logic persists while acknowledging that pipeline inventory is inflated by phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Supply chain failure confirmed. Orders from P1 (72 units) and P3 (57 units) are effectively lost or indefinitely delayed (6 and 4 periods since order, respectively, vs promised L=2). Effective pipeline is roughly 102 units (P4+P6 orders), not the 231 reflected in system 'In-transit'.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 458239001 (Women's Jersey Basic Dress) is facing a critical stockout and supply chain breakdown. Demand has shifted upward significantly, averaging 79.4 units over the last 5 periods (P3-P7), compared to ~50 units initially, consistent with Spring seasonality for dresses. However, inventory management is hindered by lost shipments. Orders from Period 1 (72 units), Period 3 (57 units), and now Period 4 (82 units) are overdue beyond the promised L=2. Period 2's order arrived correctly at L=2 in Period 4. The failure of P1, P3, and P4 shipments indicates a high probability of loss or systemic delay. The OR backend's 'In-transit' figure (249 units) is inflated by these 'ghost' units. To force a recovery order, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime (~80/period) across the lead-time window (L+1=3), resulting in 240. I will raise L to 3 to reflect the current supply uncertainty and use an explicit sigma_hat of 15 to ensure a high service level for this high-margin dress ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) as it enters peak Spring season.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain breakdown worsening: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 211 units) are now confirmed lost/overdue (5+ periods). Actual available pipeline consists only of P6 (20) and P7 (18) orders. Demand regime is stable at ~80 units/period for Spring season.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing a 'Short-sleeved dress' SKU, which is entering peak spring/summer season. Demand has surged from ~80 to 109 units last period. The supply chain has critically failed for older orders: orders from P1 (72), P3 (57), and P4 (82) are now significantly overdue (8, 6, and 5 periods respectively vs. promised L=2) and must be treated as lost. Although 'In-transit' shows 227 units, the effective pipeline consists only of the P8 order (16 units). In Period 8, we saw a sudden arrival of both P6 and P7 orders (L=2 and L=1), showing that while recent shipments are moving, they are insufficient to cover demand. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2 to reflect the promised lead time that still holds for recent arrivals. mu_hat is set to 330 (approx 110/week * 3 weeks) to cover the current peak demand regime and aggressively attempt to refill inventory despite the phantom 'In-transit' quantity blocking the OR engine's logic. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows us to force larger orders to bypass the pipeline inventory trap.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss confirmed for P1, P3, and P4 orders (211 units total). Effective pipeline is currently only the P8 order (16 units). Demand has accelerated significantly in April, reaching 109 units/period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain situation is critical but clarifying. We have officially confirmed that orders from Period 1 (72 units), Period 3 (57 units), and Period 4 (82 units) are lost, totaling 211 units that are 'In-transit' in the system but will never arrive. The total In-transit reported is 380, meaning the 'clean' pipeline is 380 - 211 = 169 units (from P8 and P9). However, recent arrival data from Period 8 shows that lead times are volatile but potentially shorter than promised (P6 arrived in 2 periods, but P7 arrived in 1 period). This suggests the logistics network is bypass-routing or speeding up new shipments to compensate for the lost block. Demand in the last period (P9) dropped to 54, likely a temporary lull or stockout effect after the high of 109. Given we are in mid-April (Spring dress season), demand is expected to remain high (avg ~80-90). To force the OR backend to order despite the 'phantom' 211 units in-transit, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the lost inventory. I need to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 211 phantom units. With L=2, (3 * 85) + 211 = 466. I will set mu_hat to 466 to clear the phantom inventory and trigger a replenishment.

Carry-over insight: P8/P9 confirmation: 211 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost. Recent successful arrivals (P6, P7) show lead times of 1-2 periods, suggesting newer shipments are not affected by the previous blockage. Demand for Spring dresses remains elevated but volatile.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019-04-22), we have reached a higher demand regime for this jersey dress, consistent with the Spring season. The last 5 periods (P6-P10) show an average demand of 88 units/period, despite high volatility (range 54-109). The supply chain has stabilized for new orders: P8 arrived in 2 periods and P9 arrived in 1 period, whereas P1, P3, and P4 (211 units total) are definitively lost. These lost units remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 356, but are not physically coming. The effective pipeline is only the P10 order (145 units). Total effective inventory = 72 (on-hand) + 145 (effective in-transit) = 217 units. To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at ~88/period, we need ~264 units. I will set mu_hat using the recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the Spring demand peak and set L to default (2 periods) since recent arrivals (1-2 periods) confirm the logistics are back on track for new shipments.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Orders P8 and P9 arrived within 1-2 periods, indicating the disruption affecting P1, P3, and P4 is isolated to those specific shipments. Demand for Spring dresses has stabilized at a higher mean of ~88 units/period (P6-P10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the system reports 'In-transit' as 356 units, but 211 of these (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed based on historical context. The effective pipeline actually consists of the P10 order (145 units). Current on-hand is 0. Demand for this short-sleeved cotton jersey dress has stayed elevated as we enter May (Spring/Summer seasonality). The last 5 periods (P7-P11) show an average demand of 94.4 units per period (94, 109, 54, 97, 118). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 captures this elevated demand regime. While promised L=2, recent successful shipments (P8, P9) arrived with lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively, suggesting the logistics flow has normalized for new orders. We use L=2 (promised) to remain cautious given the stockout at the end of Period 11.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the product (Short-sleeved cotton dress) is in its peak Spring/Summer season. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout occurred in Periods 11 and 12 despite high demand (118 and 74). The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 356 units, but 211 of these (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The only viable pipeline units are the P10 order (145 units) which is now overdue (promised L=2, currently L=3). However, recent history (P8, P9) showed lead times of 1-2 periods. I expect the P10 shipment to arrive in Period 13 resolution. Demand has settled into a high-volume regime; the average demand from Period 6 to Period 12 (ignoring the weird dip in P9) is approximately 88 units/period. Period 12's demand of 74 is consistent with this. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this elevated seasonal demand and keep L at the default promised value of 2, as recent successful deliveries returned to that baseline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with a bloated 'In-transit' figure of 356 units. Analysis: The in-transit includes 211 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. Additionally, the orders from Period 10 (145 units) are now 4 periods old (promised lead time 2); given the history of lost shipments, these 145 units are also likely lost or severely delayed. This leaves the effective pipeline at 0. Demand context: We are in mid-May (Spring/Summer), traditionally a high-demand period for short-sleeved jersey dresses. However, the last two periods saw a sharp drop (74 and 36 units). I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat, balancing the recent peak (118) and the recent troughs to avoid over-ordering while trying to recover from stockouts. To force the OR engine to order despite the 'ghost' pipeline, I set L=3 (explicit) to increase the target base stock, effectively treating current in-transit as partially unreliable.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Order from Period 10 (145 units) is now 4 periods overdue, suggesting it may also be lost alongside P1, P3, and P4 shipments. Total likely lost inventory in 'In-transit' is now 356 units. Demand shows high volatility in May (36-118 range).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'short-sleeved cotton jersey dress' entering late May, which is peak season. Demand remains high but volatile, with recent samples (P10-P14) averaging ~75 units, though earlier Spring peaks reached 100+. The critical issue is the 'In-transit' phantom inventory: 441 units are shown as in-transit, but 356 units (P1, P3, P4, and now P10) are substantially overdue and likely lost. The OR engine considers these phantom units as part of the pipeline, which prevents it from placing necessary new orders. At Period 15, we have 0 on-hand and only 85 units (from P14) in the 'real' pipeline. To force the OR engine to order, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised lead time) and mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 600. This high mu_hat (representing roughly 200 units per period for L+1 periods) is designed to exceed the phantom pipeline (356) plus current real pipeline (85) and on-hand (0), triggering a replenishment order to meet sustained seasonal demand. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the high volatility (36-118 range) observed in May.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed loss of order P10 (145 units) as it is now 5 periods overdue. Total phantom inventory in system 'In-transit' is 356 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Demand for jersey dresses remains volatile but high as summer approaches.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing a 'Women's Everyday Basics Jersey Dress' heading into the summer peak. The current 'In-transit' of 696 units is severely misleading due to significant shipment losses. History confirms P1 (72), P3 (57), P4 (82), and P10 (145) are lost, totaling 356 units of 'phantom' inventory. Subtracting these from the 696 leaves an effective pipeline of 340 units (P14: 85, P15: 255). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). Recent lead times for successful deliveries (P6-P9) have been 1-2 periods, aligning with the promised L=2. Demand in May has been lower (avg ~50) compared to April's peak (~88), but we expect a summer surge. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the May cooling) to avoid over-ordering while the large P15 shipment is in transit, but I will use explicit L=2 to reflect actual delivery performance and ensure base stock calculations account for the full lead-time risk. I am maintaining the 356 phantom units estimate to bridge the gap between human reasoning and the OR backend's pipeline-subtraction logic.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 2019), the 'In-transit' figure of 696 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Analysis of history confirms that orders from P1 (72), P3 (57), P4 (82), and now definitely P10 (145) are lost, totaling 356 units of 'phantom' inventory. This leaves a real pipeline of 340 units (P14: 85, P15: 255). Despite this, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and have faced consecutive stockouts. Demand for this jersey dress is seasonal and entering the peak summer period (June/July). Recent demand (P14-P16) averages ~63 units, but prior April/May peaks hit 100+. To prevent further stockouts and compensate for the OR engine's belief that 696 units are coming (when only 340 are real), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating (1+L)*demand where L=2, (3 * 90) = 270. By setting mu_hat to 626 (calculated as target 270 + 356 phantom units), I force the OR backend to place an order that treats the lost units as non-existent. Sigma_hat is set to a higher recent volatility to provide a safety buffer for the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Cumulative lost inventory in 'In-transit' (phantom inventory) is confirmed at 356 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10). The OR backend must be tricked into ignoring these units to maintain adequate service levels during the summer peak.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18 (2019/6/10), we continue to manage a short-sleeved cotton jersey dress during the summer peak. The system reports 441 units 'In-transit', but historical evidence strongly indicates that 356 of these units (from Orders P1, P3, P4, and P10) are lost or permanently delayed. The only valid pipeline shipment is Order P14 (85 units), which is currently at a lead time of 4 periods and is also late, but not yet classified as lost. To force the OR backend to order despite the 'In-transit' phantom inventory, I will set 'L' to an 'explicit' value of 6. This increases the base stock target (covering demand for L+1 periods) to a level that exceeds the phantom pipeline, triggering necessary replacement orders. Recent demand (P14-P17) averages 71.25 units, while the broader late-Spring/early-Summer demand (P10-P17) averages 76 units. I will use 'mu_hat' with 'recent_N' (N=8) to capture this high-volume summer regime (~76 units * 7 periods = 532). This strategy offsets the 356 phantom units and ensures sufficient stock for the summer window.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Summer season). Product is a jersey dress with high demand volatility (Period 16-18 demand: 86, 96, 89). The 'In-transit' balance of 497 units is highly inflated by 'phantom inventory' (lost orders). Specifically, orders from P1 (72), P3 (57), P4 (82), P10 (145), and now likely P14 (85) are lost/overdue by 5+ periods each. Confirmed lost = 72+57+82+145+85 = 441 units. The OR backend uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to decide orders; since pipeline_inventory includes these 441 lost units, the backend will under-order unless we artificially inflate the base_stock. The effective pipeline is only 56 units (from P18). Demand is stable around ~90 units/period. To offset the 441 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for expected demand plus the phantom inventory: mu_hat = (1+L) * avg_demand + lost_units. With L=2 and avg_demand ~90, mu_hat = (3 * 90) + 441 = 711. This forces the base_stock high enough to overcome the false 'In-transit' signal and trigger necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' increased to 441 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14 shipments or 72, 57, 82, 145, 85 units respectively). Summer demand for jersey dresses is stable at ~90 units/period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we are in the peak summer season for cotton jersey dresses. Recent demand shows a significant spike (186 units in Period 19), though the average over the last five periods is approximately 102 units. The on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 647 units in-transit, but based on carry-over insights, at least 441 of these are 'phantom inventory' (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14 which are long-overdue and likely lost). The only viable shipments currently in-transit are likely the P19 order (206 units) and possibly recent unfulfilled orders. To ensure the OR backend places a necessary replenishment order despite the high phantom in-transit count, I will use 'explicit' methods. I will set L to the promised 2 periods (as recent successful deliveries P15 and P18 align with 1-2 periods). For mu_hat, I will forecast (1+L) * 105 units/period = 315 to account for the summer peak and recent high demand. For sigma_hat, I will use a value that reflects the recent high volatility (e.g., ~40 units/period * sqrt(1+L) \u2248 70) to maintain a high service level given the high profit margin and risk of stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Summer peak confirmed with P19 demand of 186. Total phantom inventory remains 441 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the system is entering a high-demand summer peak for jersey dresses, evidenced by Period 20 demand of 232 and Period 19 demand of 186. The current reported 'In-transit' inventory is 872 units, but a significant portion of this is 'phantom inventory' consisting of lost shipments. Based on historical data, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P14 (totaling 441 units) are likely lost. Furthermore, the P15 order (255 units) arrived correctly, but P18 (56 units) arrived in Period 19, whereas P19 (206 units) and P20 (225 units) are still in transit. Given the stockout in Period 20, we need to bypass the OR engine's protective capping by inflating the mu_hat. To offset the 441 units of phantom inventory the OR engine thinks we have, I will set mu_hat to cover both the high summer demand (~210/period) and provide enough buffer to force a new order despite the distorted pipeline view. For L=2, mu_hat should ideally be (1+L)*demand + phantom_inventory = (3 * 210) + 441 = 1071. I will use 'explicit' to ensure this target is met.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Summer demand peak intensified in late June/July, with demand reaching 232 units. Phantom inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) remains at 441 units, requiring significant mu_hat inflation to trigger ordering.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are navigating a high-demand summer peak for cotton jersey dresses (July). Current demand volatile but high (Period 20: 232, Period 21: 108). The critical issue remains the 'phantom inventory' in the 'In-transit' pipeline. We have 441 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) confirmed lost from previous months that the OR backend still counts as available supply. Additionally, late June orders P19 (206 units), P20 (225 units), and P21 (391 units) have not arrived yet, though P19 and P20 are within or just past promised lead time (L=2). To force the OR backend to place a new order despite the 1263 'In-transit' units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the summer demand regime at ~150 units/period (average of recent June/July highs). To overcome the 1263 phantom/slow pipeline, I set mu_hat to 1900. This roughly corresponds to (1+L) * 633, which is high enough to trigger the base stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) into creating a positive order quantity to meet the ongoing summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Summer demand continues with high volatility (July). Phantom inventory persists at 441 confirmed lost units; however, the massive 'In-transit' figure of 1263 units now includes recent heavy orders (P19-P21) which are pending. Inflation of mu_hat remains necessary to bypass the OR's perception of these units as immediately available stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (July 15), we are navigating the summer high-demand peak for jersey dresses. Recent demand remains strong but volatile (232, 108, 76). The system reports a massive 'In-transit' quantity of 1,776 units. However, based on our carry-over insights, at least 441 of these units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) are confirmed lost/phantom inventory. Furthermore, the 206 units from P19 are now 4 periods overdue, suggesting they may also be lost, bringing the likely 'phantom' total to 647 units. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders; if the perceived pipeline (1,776) is inflated by phantom stock, the system will stop ordering, leading to stockouts during this peak season. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat (the target base stock) to a level that exceeds the phantom inventory plus the expected demand for the lead time (L=2) and review period. With a summer average demand of approx 150-200 during peaks, and needing to bypass 647 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 2400. This value is intentionally high to ensure the (base_stock - 1776) calculation still triggers a replenishment order that covers real upcoming demand, effectively 'tricking' the backend into ignoring the older, lost shipments. L is kept at 'calculate' as recent successful deliveries (P15, P18, P20) arrived in 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Phantom inventory likely increased to 647 units as Period 19 shipment (206 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, joining P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-118.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we are managing a complex supply chain situation. We currently have 1220 units on hand, which is more than enough to cover immediate demand (approx. 90-100 units/period). However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1315 is heavily distorted by both phantom inventory (confirmed lost orders totaling 647 units: P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and now P19) and the massive recent arrival of P21 and P22 (1129 units total), which replenished the stock. Recent demand has cooled from the late June peak (232 units) to a more moderate range (58-76 units). Given the high on-hand inventory, no new orders are necessary. I am setting L to the promised 2, mu_hat to a conservative estimate of (1+L)*mean of recent periods (approx 100/period * 3), and sigma_hat based on recent volatility. This high mu_hat is maintained to prevent the OR engine from stopping orders prematurely if phantom inventory is subtracted from the target, but with 1220 on hand, the cap/base-stock logic will naturally result in a zero order this period anyway.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Total phantom inventory (lost/overdue shipments in 'In-transit') is now estimated at 647 units (P1: 72, P3: 57, P4: 82, P10: 145, P14: 85, P19: 206). Recent shipments (P21, P22) arrived correctly within 1-2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $660.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is transitioning from the July summer peak into late summer. In Period 24, on-hand inventory reached 1126 following the arrival of P21 and P22 orders (1129 units total), effectively normalizing the inventory position. Current 'In-transit' of 1315 includes 647 confirmed phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) and the massive P23 order of 668 units which is expected this period or next (L=1 to 2). With current on-hand (1126) and the large P23 shipment pending, the inventory position is extremely high relative to recent demand (avg ~110 in the last 5 periods). Further ordering is unnecessary and would lead to high holding costs as we pass the seasonal peak. I am setting L to calculate to allow the backend to use observed lead times, and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high volume while allowing the system naturally to hit its order cap and stop ordering given the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Inventory position successfully recovered after prolonged stockouts. Current on-hand (1126) plus pending P23 order (668) are sufficient to cover demand for the remainder of the summer season, assuming demand remains around ~100 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $254.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5, 2019), the inventory position is significantly recovered with 1,057 units on-hand. Historical demand analysis shows a clear peak during late June/July (up to 232 units), but demand has since moderated in late July/early August (69-94 units). This suggests the peak summer season for jersey dresses is beginning to wane as we transition towards late summer/early autumn. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,315 units remains heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P19 shipments totaling 647 units) as well as the massive P23 order (668 units), which is still within a reasonable lead time window. Given the high on-hand stock and declining demand trend, no new orders are required. The current stock (1057) covers approximately 10-12 periods of expected demand (~80-100/period), which is well above the target safety stock. I will set parameters to 'default' or 'recent_N' which, given the pipeline vs. base stock calculation, will naturally suppress further ordering and allow for inventory drawdown while carrying the holding cost for the existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Summer demand peak has passed; demand stabilising at ~70-90 units/period for August. On-hand inventory now exceeds safety requirements, transitioning from stockout recovery to inventory depletion phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1185.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (mid-August 2019), the inventory position is extremely high (1,698 units on-hand) due to the arrival of the Period 23 order (668 units) and the previous heavy ordering in Period 22. Historical demand for this jersey dress shows a peak in late June (232 units) and has since decelerated to 69 in Period 25 and 27 in Period 26. This aligns with the seasonal tapering of 'Everyday Basics' jersey dresses as the summer season ends. The current on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 20+ periods of demand if mean demand remains around 80 units/period, or even longer given the recent drop. The 'In-transit' figure of 647 units consists entirely of phantom/lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19), which will never arrive. Given the excessive on-hand stock and declining seasonal demand, the priority is to avoid further ordering and minimize holding costs. I will set the base stock parameters to reflect the recent demand slowdown (last 5 samples average ~65) to ensure the OR backend's target stock is well below our 1,698 on-hand units, resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Seasonal demand for summer jersey dresses is tapering significantly (down to 27 units in P26). On-hand inventory is now in a heavy surplus (1,698 units), marking the end of the stockout recovery phase and a transition to inventory depletion for the autumn transition.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1338.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The seasonal demand for the short-sleeved cotton jersey dress (SKU 458239001) is rapidly declining as summer concludes, moving from a peak of 232 units in early July to just 18 units in Period 27. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high (1,680 units), which is more than sufficient to cover the remaining lifecycle of this summer-specific item. The 'In-transit' figure of 647 units consists entirely of 'phantom inventory' (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P19) which were confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed in previous periods. Since the current stock is already excessive for the tapering demand (only 18 units sold last period), the primary goal is to prevent any further ordering by maintaining default parameters. The OR backend will see the high on-hand balance and the high (though phantom) pipeline and correctly place no new orders. No parameter inflation is required anymore as we are in the depletion phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Seasonal transition to Autumn confirmed. Demand has dropped from 232 units (P20) to 18 units (P27), a 92% reduction. High on-hand inventory (1,680) is sufficient for end-of-season clearance.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019, marking the transition from summer to autumn. Demand for this jersey dress SKU has collapsed from a summer peak of 232 units (Period 20) to just 17 units in Period 28, confirming a sharp seasonal decline. We are currently in a heavy surplus position with 1,663 units on-hand, which is significantly more than enough to cover any remaining end-of-season demand. The 647 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) and should be ignored. Given the extreme inventory surplus and low current demand (~17-20 units/week), no new orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect this lower demand regime ('recent_N' with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302) to ensure the OR backend's target stock remains far below current on-hand levels, preventing any further procurement during this depletion phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Seasonal transition to Autumn complete. Demand has stabilized at a very low level (~17 units/period) compared to summer peak. Inventory is in depletion mode.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved jersey dress, a seasonal item that has transitioned from its summer peak into the autumn off-season. Demand has plummeted from a high of 232 units (Period 20) to a stable low average of ~22 units over the last four periods (P26-P29). On-hand inventory is extremely high at 1,636 units, which is approximately 74 weeks of supply at current demand levels. There is also 'phantom inventory' in 'In-transit' (647 units) representing confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) which the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from its base stock calculation; however, given the massive on-hand surplus, no orders should be triggered regardless of this accounting error. Lead time appears stable at 2 periods for recent successful shipments. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the new, lower demand regime and prevent further ordering while holding costs accumulate on the existing surplus.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '458239001' (short-sleeved cotton jersey dress) is currently in a post-summer seasonal decline. Demand has plummeted from a July peak of 232 units to a current average of approximately 17 units over the last four periods (P27-P30), with the latest demand being only 6 units. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,630 units, which is more than sufficient to cover many months of current demand levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 647 units consists entirely of phantom inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P19) that will never arrive. Given the excessive surplus and the holding cost of $1.0/unit/period, the priority is to avoid any further ordering. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the low-demand Autumn regime, which effectively keeps the base stock level far below the current on-hand inventory, ensuring zero new orders are triggered.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1310.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The seasonal transition to Autumn for this SKU (Short-sleeved jersey dress) is complete. Demand has collapsed from a summer peak of 232 units to a current average of ~15 units over the last 5 periods (P27-P31). On-hand inventory stands at 1614 units, which is enough to cover over 100 periods of current demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 647 units consists entirely of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) and will never arrive. Given the massive inventory surplus and high holding costs relative to current low demand, the strategy is to halt all ordering. mu_hat is set to a low 'recent_N' average (N=5) to reflect the new low-demand regime. This keeps the base stock calculation well below the current on-hand balance, ensuring no new orders are triggered while we deplete existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Massive inventory surplus (1614 units) relative to post-summer demand (~15 units/period). Transition to liquidation/depletion phase complete; holding costs are now the primary risk.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 458239001 (short-sleeved jersey dress) has fully transitioned into the Autumn/Winter low-demand season. Current demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging ~15 units per period over the last 6 weeks (P27-P32), compared to the summer peak of >200. On-hand inventory is currently 1,600 units, which represents over 100 periods of supply at the current demand rate. There is also 647 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) that will never arrive. Given the excessive surplus and the holding cost of $1.00/unit/period, the objective is to prevent any new orders and slowly deplete stock. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the low-demand regime, ensuring the base stock calculation remains significantly below the current on-hand inventory level.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 458239001 (short-sleeved cotton jersey dress) is currently at the end of its peak summer season, entering the Autumn/Winter period. Demand has crashed significantly from a summer peak of 232 units (Period 20) to a post-summer average of approximately 17 units per period (Periods 27-33). Current on-hand inventory is 1,572 units, which represents approximately 92 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. There is also 647 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed in previous carry-over insights. Given the massive surplus and the $1.00/unit/period holding cost, the primary objective is to prevent any further ordering. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 periods (the post-peak regime) to accurately reflect the low demand, which will result in a base stock level far below the current on-hand inventory, ensuring zero orders are placed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1352.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a short-sleeved jersey dress, which has transitioned from a high-demand summer peak into a low-demand autumn/winter phase. Currently, the SKU is in a massive overstock position with 1,561 units on-hand, while the average demand over the last 9 periods (since the seasonal drop in Period 26) is only ~17.1 units per week. The 'In-transit' value of 647 units consists entirely of 'phantom inventory' (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) confirmed lost in previous periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current demand regime, the primary goal is to avoid unnecessary ordering and minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while the surplus depletes. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (the post-summer regime) to accurately reflect the lower demand. The OR backend will not place new orders because on-hand inventory (1,561) vastly exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 458239001 is in a post-summer liquidation phase. Current date is October 14, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal drop from the summer peak (avg ~90-100 units) to an autumn baseline (avg ~17 units over the last 9 periods). On-hand inventory is 1537 units, which at the current demand rate, represents nearly 90 weeks of supply. The 'In-transit' figure of 647 units consists entirely of phantom inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) and should be ignored. Given the massive surplus and the primary risk of holding costs, no new orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (recent_N=9) to ensure the OR backend keeps the base stock well below current inventory levels.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a deep-off-season phase (Autumn/Winter for a short-sleeved jersey dress). Current demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 17 units per period over the last 10 periods (P27-P36). On-hand inventory is extremely high at 1,527 units, which is enough to cover current demand for over 80 periods. There are 647 units in 'In-transit' that are confirmed lost (phantom inventory). Since on-hand inventory already far exceeds any reasonable base stock level, the objective is to prevent any new ordering to minimize further holding costs. Setting L to the promised 2 and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the most recent 10-period regime reflects the true low-demand state, ensuring the OR backend correctly identifies the massive surplus and places zero orders.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '458239001' (Jersey Short-sleeved dress) has transitioned into the late Autumn/Winter season, where demand for this product category is naturally low. Current demand has stabilized at a low-volume regime (approx. 15-20 units/period) compared to the summer peak of >200 units. On-hand inventory is significantly oversized at 1,515 units, sufficient to cover approximately 75-100 periods of current demand. 'In-transit' includes 647 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) which will never arrive. Given the current date (late October) and the nature of the product, there is no rationale for further ordering. The objective is now pure cost containment (minimizing holding cost) while allowing the existing surplus to satisfy the residual low demand. I am setting L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (using recent_N=10 to capture the post-summer stabilization) to prevent the OR backend from triggering any replacement orders for the 'phantom' stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November 2019), the SKU (a short-sleeved jersey dress) is in its off-peak season. On-hand inventory is 1,499 units, while the recent demand (Period 27 onwards) has stabilized at a very low average of approximately 16 units per week. The 'In-transit' figure of 647 units consists entirely of 'phantom inventory' (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P19) confirmed lost in previous periods. Given the massive surplus\u2014which covers roughly 90 weeks of current demand\u2014and the high holding cost relative to demand, the objective is to prevent any new orders and allow inventory to deplete through the winter. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 samples (N=10) to reflect the low autumn demand regime, and maintain L at default. The base stock calculated by the OR backend will be significantly lower than the current inventory position, ensuring no orders are placed.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019 (Period 40). We are in the late Autumn/Winter season for this short-sleeved cotton jersey dress. Demand has been stable at a low baseline of approximately 16 units per period since the end of the summer peak (averaging 15.6 units over the last 10 periods). On-hand inventory is 1,486 units, which is enough to cover over 90 periods of current demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 647 units consists entirely of phantom inventory (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P19). No further orders are required, and the goal remains to deplete the massive surplus to minimize holding costs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved jersey cotton dress, which is a highly seasonal summer product. As of Period 41 (mid-November), demand has naturally bottomed out, averaging approximately 17 units per week over the last 14 periods (P27-P40). Current on-hand inventory is 1,462 units, which represents over 85 weeks of supply at current demand rates. The system also shows 647 units 'In-transit', which are confirmed lost 'phantom' shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) as documented in carry-over insights. Given the massive inventory surplus and zero risk of stockout, the priority is to avoid any further ordering to minimize holding costs. I will set the lead time to default and use the most recent 14-period demand mean to reflect the current low-season baseline. The OR backend will see the high on-hand stock and correctly place zero orders.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 458239001 (Short-sleeved jersey dress) is currently in a deep off-season (Late Autumn/Winter) and inventory liquidation phase. Current on-hand inventory (1,452 units) is massively excessive relative to recent demand, which has stabilized at a low mean of approximately 16 units per period over the last 15 periods (since Period 27). The internal OR backend calculation for base stock is likely very low, but it is further confounded by 647 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) which are long-lost but still appear in the system. With a holding cost of $1.0 vs a profit of $19.0, the priority is to avoid any further replenishment while demand remains at these levels. The current on-hand stock covers roughly 90 periods of demand, far exceeding the remaining game duration. I am setting parameters to ensure no new orders are placed by using the most recent (low) demand period for mu_hat and keeping L at default.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). The product is a short-sleeved jersey dress, which is fundamentally seasonal (Summer peak). Historical demand shows a sharp decline after the summer peak (Period 20-22), stabilizing at a low 'off-season' level. The average demand over the last 15 periods (since Period 27) is approximately 17.5 units per period. The recent spike in Period 42 (demand=57) is likely a Black Friday/Cyber Monday outlier rather than a fundamental regime shift back to high demand. We currently have 1,395 units on-hand, which at the current average demand rate represents nearly 80 periods of supply. The 647 units 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19). Since on-hand inventory is massively in excess of any possible demand for the remainder of the year (4 periods left), we must continue to prevent any new orders. The goal is to minimize holding costs while the surplus naturally depletes. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=15) to reflect the low off-season demand and ignore the phantom inventory by keeping the parameters balanced for the current on-hand levels.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019. We are in the low-demand winter season for this short-sleeved cotton jersey dress. Demand has seen a slight increase in the last two periods (57 units each), likely due to promotional events (Black Friday/Cyber Monday), but the overall trend remains low compared to the summer peak. The system shows an on-hand inventory of 1,338 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining periods of the game (ending at Period 47) at the current average demand of ~15-20 units/period (excluding the recent localized spike). The 'In-transit' figure of 647 units consists entirely of 'phantom inventory'\u2014shipments P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P19 that were long ago identified as lost. Since on-hand inventory is far in excess of historical or seasonal demand, no new orders should be placed. I will maintain L at default and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N approach (N=15) to capture the stable post-summer demand while ensuring the OR engine correctly assesses the massive inventory surplus and does not trigger replenishment.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-12-16 (Period 45), approaching the end of the game (P47). The SKU is a short-sleeved cotton jersey dress, a summer-seasonal item. History shows a massive peak in summer (up to 232 units) and a significant drop in autumn/winter (~13-24 units). There was a small demand bump in P42-43 (57 units), likely a Black Friday/Cyber Monday clearance effect, but demand has since returned to baseline (16 units in P44). On-hand inventory is extremely high at 1322 units, which is enough to cover the remaining 3 periods of demand (estimated <60 units total) more than 20 times over. The 'In-transit' of 647 units remains entirely composed of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19) as identified in previous carry-over insights. No new orders are needed; the priority is minimizing further holding costs and avoiding any accidental orders triggered by the backend's miscalculation of pipeline inventory. I maintain L at promised (2) and mu_hat at a low level reflects current winter demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019). The SKU is a 'Short-sleeved dress' (Jersey Basic), which is highly seasonal. Demand peaked in summer (Period 20-22) and has since stabilized at a much lower winter level. Since Period 30, demand has averaged approx. 18 units/period, with a minor holiday spike in late Nov/early Dec (P42, P43). Current on-hand inventory is 1,302 units, which is extremely high (roughly 70 periods of supply) given the current demand rate. There are 647 units 'In-transit', but as established in previous carry-over insights, these are all 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P19). No new orders are needed. The objective is to deplete this excess inventory. I will maintain default settings or recent_N based on the current stable low-demand regime to ensure the OR backend does not trigger unnecessary orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1122.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved jersey dress, a seasonal item that saw peak demand during the summer months (up to 232 units/period) and has now transitioned into a low-demand winter period. Current demand has stabilized at a significantly lower mean; over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), average demand is approximately 20 units/period (ranging from 9 to 57), with a slight spike observed during the late November/early December weeks likely due to holiday sales. On-hand inventory is extremely high at 1,293 units, which is enough to cover over 60 weeks of current demand levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 647 units consists entirely of historical 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P19) confirmed in carry-over insights. Total inventory visibility (On-hand + In-transit) is nearly 2,000 units against a demand of ~20/week. My objective is to prevent any further ordering to minimize additional holding costs while depleting this surplus. I am setting L to default (2), and using a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime. Given the massive inventory surplus, the OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally result in zero orders, which is the optimal strategy for the end-of-year/winter period.
