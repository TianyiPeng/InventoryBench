Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens'. The item is a core denim staple for women. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend from early January (117 units) to early February (244 units). The mean of the provided data is approximately 183 units/week, but the most recent 3 samples (225, 235, 244) suggest a higher regime around 235 units. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. To ensure availability while this growth continues, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available data) to capture the trend while maintaining some stability. With L=2, the base stock target reflects demand over 3 periods (L+1). No shipments are yet in transit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The previous period (P1) had a demand of 270 units, which resulted in a total stockout as starting on-hand was 0. The order placed in P1 (304 units) is currently in-transit. Given the promised lead time (L) of 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start message. Historical demand samples (before P1) were 117, 85, 225, 235, 244. The P1 demand of 270 shows a continuing upward trend. This SKU (skinny high-waist ankle jeans) is a staple item, but the recent demand levels (last 4 weeks: 225, 235, 244, 270) are significantly higher than the early January values. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this higher demand regime. L is set to 'default' (2) as we have no evidence yet of lead time deviation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand has increased significantly from the historical average of ~183 (Jan/early Feb) to 270 (P1) and 334 (P2), likely due to the shift from winter to spring fashion for 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans'. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 580 units in transit (304 from P1, 276 from P2). The promised lead time is 2, so the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). However, with 0 on-hand, we have lost 604 units of demand in P1 and P2 combined. I will use recent_N=2 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (approx 302 units/period) and recent_N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. L remains default (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead time shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th, 2019. This SKU is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees consistent demand in early spring. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 181 units, but recent observed demand in Period 1-3 (270, 334, 254) shows a significant upward shift, averaging 286 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (304 units) should have arrived during Period 3 and been reported in the Period 3 conclude message. Since 'arrived=0' was reported for Period 3, the Period 1 shipment is now overdue by at least 1 period. This suggests either a lead time drift (L=3+) or a lost shipment. I will set L=3 explicitly to account for the delay and use the recent demand average of 286 to set mu_hat. With L=3, mu_hat = (1+3) * 286 = 1144. sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of recent periods to capture the volatility of the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 11 (Period 1): Average demand increased from ~181 to ~286 (+58%). Lead time delay observed: Period 1 order (L=2) failed to arrive by Period 3 conclude, suggesting L is at least 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $794.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (2019/3/11), we observe that the order placed in Period 2 (276 units) arrived in Period 4 (after the decision), making it available for Period 4's demand. This confirms a lead time (L) of 2 periods for that specific order. However, the order from Period 1 (304 units), which was expected in Period 3 conclude (if L=2), is still missing as of Period 4 conclude. This suggests either a lost shipment or a significant delay for Period 1's batch. Recent demand (P1-P4: 270, 334, 254, 214) averages 268 units/period, which is higher than the initial historical data (~183), though it shows a slight tapering. Given the missing Period 1 shipment, I will set L to 3 explicitly to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the increased uncertainty and the potential for longer lead times or lost units. mu_hat will use the recent 4 periods of demand (N=4) to capture the higher 'Skinny H.W Ankle' jeans demand trend (~804 units over L+1).

Carry-over insight: P1 order (304 units) remains missing as of P4 conclude (expected P3 if L=2), suggesting a lost shipment; lead time for P2 order confirmed at 2 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18, 2019. Historical demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' has shifted from a pre-game average of ~181 to a game average of ~256 (Periods 1-5). Period 1's order (304 units) is now 3 periods overdue (expected P3 conclude, now P6 start), confirming it is a lost shipment. Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0. However, Period 4 conclude showed the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2), indicating the supply chain is generally functional despite the P1 loss. Total in-transit is 1095 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P5), but we must effectively discount the 304 lost units from P1 when calculating pipeline inventory. Since the OR backend sees 'In-transit' as 1095, it will likely under-order unless we set a high mu_hat or adjust parameters. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (~256 units/period). I will set L to 'default' (2) as the P2 order confirmed the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed P1 order (304 units) as a lost shipment; it is 3 periods past promised delivery and has not arrived while subsequent orders (P2) have.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the SKU 636323001 is facing a severe stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The Period 1 order (304 units) is officially categorized as a lost shipment, as it is 4 periods past its promised delivery date (L=2) while the Period 2 and Period 5 orders have arrived. Recent demand has stabilized in a high-regime phase: the last 6 periods show a mean of 252.5 (270, 334, 254, 214, 209, 234), compared to the pre-game history average of 181. Lead times have been volatile (P2 was 2 periods, but P5 arrived in 1 period). I will set L=2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering given the OR backend's inventory logic. mu_hat is set using N=6 to capture the sustained higher demand regime since Period 1. sigma_hat is also set using N=6 to reflect current volatility. The 'In-transit' count of 940 units includes the lost 304 units; since the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from 'base_stock', I must use the explicit method for mu_hat to 'offset' the phantom inventory caused by the lost shipment, or allow the OR engine to order based on the current calculation. However, the backend doesn't know the units are lost. To compensate for the 304 units that will never arrive but are counted in 'In-transit', I will provide an explicit mu_hat that is approximately (1+L)*Mean + Lost Units. calculation: (3 * 253) + 304 = 1063.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: P2 took 2 periods, P5 took 1 period. Lost shipment (P1, 304 units) continues to distort pipeline inventory calculations.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. Historic demand shows a significant spike in Period 7 (548 units), likely due to a seasonal shift associated with spring fashion or an April transition. The mean demand across the last 7 periods (excluding pre-game data) is approximately 294 units, but the recent observation suggests a new high-demand regime. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 1131, which includes the lost Period 1 order (304 units) that has never arrived. Because the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate the order, it will subtract these 304 ghost units from the target base stock, leading to perpetual under-ordering. To counteract this 'inventory black hole,' I will use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a target base stock that effectively ignores the lost units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = ((L+1) * Expected Demand) + Buffer + Lost Units. With L=2, expected demand ~400 (averaging recent regimes), and keeping a buffer for volatility, a base stock of ~1600 is selected to force the system to order despite the 304 unit error in pipeline visibility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Demand spiked to 548 (+100% vs previous 3-period avg of 219), likely spring seasonality. Pipeline inventory calculation remains corrupted by 304 lost units from Period 1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8, 2019. The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees a seasonal demand increase in spring. Demand in Period 7 (548) and Period 8 (264) shows high volatility compared to the earlier baseline (avg ~230). We must account for the spring spike. Pipeline inventory (1670 units) is significantly inflated by a lost shipment of 304 units from Period 1, which the OR engine still monitors. Total in-transit according to the engine includes P1(304), P3(375), P4(261), and P8(730). Since the P1 shipment is confirmed lost, the effective pipeline is only 1366. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P5 and P7 both took 1 period). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed lead times (2, 1, 1). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current high-demand spring regime (avg ~348), and I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in the last two periods (std of 548 and 264 is approx 200).

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonality confirmed (April): Demand volatility increased significantly with an average of 406 over the last two periods (P7-P8) compared to the prior avg of 230.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15. The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which aligns with spring seasonality observed since March 25 (Period 7). Demand has been volatile: P7 saw 548, P8 saw 264, and P9 saw 90 units. The average for this 'spring' regime (P7-P9) is 300.6 units. The pipeline inventory (1670 units) is severely distorted by the lost shipment from Period 1 (304 units), which remains indefinitely in 'In-transit'. Subtracting the lost units, the true floating inventory is 1366 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current spring demand level while smoothing the recent drop. To manage the pipeline distortion caused by the lost shipment (304 units) and the risk of over-ordering while stock-out persists, I am using an 'explicit' L to slightly buffer the base stock calculation, and relying on the mu_hat forecast to reflect the spring average of ~300 per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high during spring season (avg 300 units/period for P7-P9). Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 304 lost units from Period 1.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. We are in a high-volatility spring season for denim trousers. Recent demand (P7-P10) shows 548, 264, 90, 82, averaging 246 per period. The low figures in P9 and P10 (90, 82) follow a period of stockouts, suggesting possible demand suppression or a genuine cooling after the early April spike. However, the Period 1 order (304 units) is confirmed lost, as it has not arrived 10 periods later while all subsequent orders have. The OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation includes this lost shipment (304 units) and recent orders (P11's in-transit is 940, which includes the 304 lost units and a 636-unit order). To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the base stock needed for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) at 750 units (3 * 250 avg demand). Since on-hand is 648 and effective in-transit is 636 (940 total - 304 lost), the system already has 1284 units available, which is plenty. I will set mu_hat explicitly to ensure the system recognizes the lost stock doesn't count towards the target, though no new order should trigger this period given the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment (P1, 304 units) remains in system 'In-transit' count but will never arrive; mu_hat must be adjusted to compensate for this phantom inventory until game end or stock depletion. Recent demand (P7-P10) suggests a mean of ~245, down from the peak spike of 548 in P7.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (April 29, 2019). Analyzing the history, demand for this SKU (Ankle-length skinny jeans) peaked significantly in late March (Period 7: 548 units) and has since entered a sharp decline (P9: 90, P10: 82, P11: 64). The average demand over the last 3 periods is ~79 units. The 304 units ordered in Period 1 are confirmed as a lost shipment but still reside in the system's 'In-transit' count (940 total = 304 lost + others). Because the OR engine uses both on-hand (584) and in-transit (940) to calculate the order, it perceives a pipeline of 1,524 units. With demand falling and lead times averaging between 1-2 periods, we are significantly overstocked. To prevent the OR engine from ordering more due to the 'phantom' lost inventory and to account for the seasonal downturn, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 350 (covering 3 periods of the current low demand regime) and sigma_hat to 100 to account for the recent volatility seen in the spring spike. This ensures the base stock remains lower than current total inventory, resulting in a zero order to burn off excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal decline confirmed: Demand dropped from a high of 548 (P7) to an average of 79 over P9-P11 (-85%). In-transit inventory remains inflated by the Period 1 lost shipment (304 units).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/06), we are in a post-peak seasonal phase for skinny high-waist ankle jeans. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level following the mid-March/April peak (P7-P12 avg: 188; P9-P12 avg: 79). Specifically, the last four periods show demand of 90, 82, 64, and 79. On-hand inventory is high (505 units), sufficient for over 6 periods of current demand. Crucially, 'In-transit' (940 units) includes 304 units from Period 1 that are confirmed lost. This phantom inventory causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order; however, with 505 units on hand and 636 units actually in transit (940 - 304), we are already heavily overstocked. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent low demand floor of ~79 units/period. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P8, P10) have returned to the promised 1-2 period range. No new order is expected to be triggered by the backend due to the inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed (May): Demand has floor-leveled to ~80 units/period after a high of 548 in P7.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323001' (Skinny Trousers Denim) has entered a post-peak seasonal phase (May), with demand stabilizing at a significant floor (approx. 80 units/period) after the spring peak in March/April. Current on-hand inventory is 404 units, which at the current burn rate covers about 5 periods of demand. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 940 is heavily distorted by the Period 1 lost shipment (304 units), meaning the actual pipeline is likely 636 units. Despite this phantom inventory, the current on-hand stock and actual pipeline are more than sufficient to cover the promised 2-period lead time. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders due to the 'lost' units, and to account for the clear demand regime shift from the high variance observed in April to the current stable floor, I am using N=5 forRecent demand (covering P9-P13) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current mean of ~83 units per period. I am maintaining the promised lead time L=2 as it has been the consistent mode of arrivals lately.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a low-volume post-peak regime after the April surge, with an average demand of approximately 84 units per period over the last 5 periods (P10-P14). The Period 1 order of 304 units is confirmed lost, which continues to inflate the 'In-transit' count visible to the OR backend. With 311 units on-hand and an additional 636 units (940 minus the 304 phantom units) actually in transit, the current inventory level is significantly higher than needed for the current demand rate (~84 units/period). To prevent the OR backend from undershooting due to the phantom inventory and to manage the current low-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock based on the recent average demand (84) over the (L+1) horizon (3 periods), then manually add the 304 units to the mu_hat parameter to 'trick' the backend into ignoring the lost 304 units in its subtraction (base_stock - pipeline). Target base_stock = 84 * 3 = 252. Adjusting for phantom inventory: 252 + 304 = 556. This ensures the backend doesn't over-order while we burn through existing stock, yet accounts for the persistent data error.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (Late May): Leveling at ~84 units/period (P10-P14 avg). Inventory levels are currently high relative to demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a low post-peak regime (averaging 84 units/period over the last 5 periods P11-P15). The 'In-transit' figure of 940 is heavily distorted by the Period 1 lost shipment (304 units), which remains in the system calculation. Adjusting for this, the effective pipeline inventory is 636 units (940 minus 304). However, the on-hand inventory (221) already covers over 2 periods of current demand (~84/period). With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the service level q is 0.8. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current demand floor of ~84 units/period (3 * 84 = 252 for L+1=3). Because on-hand inventory is already significant and the OR backend's pipeline calculation includes the 304 phantom units, specifying mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) will allow the system to naturally avoid over-ordering while we deplete current stocks.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Demand has stabilized into a post-peak regime (Late Spring/Early Summer) with a mean of ~88 units per period over the last 7 periods (P10-P16: 82, 64, 79, 101, 93, 90, 99). The 'In-transit' count of 940 is heavily distorted by the Period 1 lost shipment of 304 units and a massive Period 3 order of 375 units that never concluded (and is also likely lost). On-hand inventory is 122 units, which covers approximately 1.4 periods of current demand. Given a promised lead time of 2, we need about (2+1)=3 periods of demand coverage (~264 units). The backend will subtract 'In-transit' from the base stock. Since 679 units are phantom/lost (304 from P1 + 375 from P3), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to artificially raise the base stock, effectively forcing the OR backend to ignore the phantom pipeline. Target base stock = 264. Reported Pipeline = 940. To get the OR engine to order, I provide an explicit mu_hat that results in (mu_hat - 940) > 0. However, with such a massive phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 1250 to ensure the backend maintains a safety buffer despite the pipeline noise. Sigma is set low to reflect the stability in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination confirmed: A total of 679 units (304 from P1, 375 from P3) are permanently lost but remain in 'In-transit', preventing the OR backend from ordering. Future decisions must use 'explicit' mu_hat to override this.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 18 (June 10). Demand has shifted from a post-peak low (~80-90) back up to ~203 in Period 17, likely reflecting early summer demand for ankle-length jeans. The primary issue remains 'phantom inventory'. We have 1147 units 'In-transit', but 679 of these are confirmed lost (304 from P1, 375 from P3). The backend OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock; if we don't account for these 679 lost units, the backend will think we have plenty of stock coming and will never place an order. To force an order, we must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime at ~150 units/period (averaging the recent spike of 203 with the previous low base). With a promised L=2, the required total coverage for (L+1) periods is 450 units. To bypass the 679 'phantom' units and trigger a restock, I will set mu_hat to 1200. This should result in a net order that compensates for the lost units and aligns with the actual demand of ~150/period. sigma_hat is set to 50 for moderate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand uptick detected: Period 17 demand increased to 203 (+125% vs previous 5-period avg of 90). Total phantom pipeline inventory remains at 679 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17 (Mid-June). Demand in Period 17 (203) and Period 18 (235) confirms a significant summer uptick compared to the May average of ~90 units. On-hand inventory is depleted (0), and while In-transit is 1243, 679 units are confirmed lost (Period 1 and Period 3 orders), leaving 564 true units in the pipeline (from Period 4, 17, and 18 orders). The OR backend's 'cap' and order logic are blocked because it sees 1243 in-transit, which far exceeds the base stock for current demand. To force an order and maintain availability during this summer seasonal rise, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. By setting mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline (679) plus current on-hand, I trigger the backend to recognize a need for stock. I estimate a forward demand mean of 220 units/period. Over (1+L) = 3 periods, this is 660 units. However, to offset the 679 phantom units and ensure the OR engine actually places an order, I must set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat - phantom_inventory) results in a positive order quantity. I will set mu_hat to 1400 to ensure we replenish and meet the 220/period demand rate while the system works through the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Average demand has shifted from ~90 (May) to ~220 (June), reflecting mid-year seasonality for denim trousers. Phantom inventory remains 679 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Demand for this denim product has entered a summer regime with an average of ~195 units over the last three periods (P17-P19). However, the system is severely handicapped by 679 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory from lost shipments in Period 1 (304 units) and Period 3 (375 units). Since the OR backend uses the logic [order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)], these 679 non-existent units prevent the backend from triggering new orders even though on-hand is currently 0. To force orders despite this pipeline contamination, I must continue using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Specifically, I set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand (3 * 225 = 675 units) PLUS the phantom inventory (679 units), totaling 1354. This allows the backend to overcome the 'in-transit' 1408 (which includes the 679 phantom units and recent orders) and place a necessary replenishment order. I am setting L=2 (promised) as arrival volatility remains, though recent shipments took 1 period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/1. Demand for Lady's Denim Trousers has stabilized into a summer regime with an average of approximately 144 units over the last 4 periods (P17-P20). However, the system is facing a significant pipeline inventory issue: 679 units are permanently lost (304 from P1, 375 from P3) but remain in the 'In-transit' count, which currently totals 1447 units. Additionally, the P17 order (207 units) is now 3 periods past its order date and 1 period past its promised lead time (L=2). Given that P18 arrived in P19 (L=1), this P17 order is highly suspicious; if it is lost, phantom inventory rises to 886 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and high demand, we must force the OR backend to order despite the massive phantom pipeline. Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and the OR engine orders (base_stock - pipeline), we use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to override the phantom 679 units. We target a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1) at a mean of ~150 plus the 679 phantom units to neutralize them, plus a buffer for volatility: 3 * 150 + 679 + 250 = 1379.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (July 8), we are in a summer demand regime for this denim SKU. Recent demand (P17-P21) shows a mean of 163 units/period, despite high volatility. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1447 units is severely contaminated by 679 units from lost shipments (P1: 304, P3: 375). Furthermore, P17 (207 units), P19 (261 units), and P20 (39 units) are also outstanding. If we assume the promised lead time L=2, P17 and P19 should have arrived by now; their absence suggests either further losses or significant transit delays. Total 'effective' in-transit is likely near zero since P21 ending inventory was 0 and nothing arrived. Because the backend OR calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit), the 1447 units in-transit (mostly phantom) will block all automated orders. I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target base stock enough to force an order, or 'explicit' L to cover the gap. However, the most robust way to force an order when pipeline is contaminated is to set mu_hat to a value that exceeds (current_pipeline + desired_safety_stock). Calculation: Desired base stock for demand of ~160/period and L=2 is roughly 160 * 3 = 480. Since in-transit is 1447, mu_hat needs to be set to ~2000 to trigger any replenishment. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 2000 to overcome the phantom inventory and ensure we stock up for the remaining summer season.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination continues: 679 units definitely lost (P1, P3). Orders from P17 (207 units) and P19 (261 units) are now also overdue (3+ periods since order), suggesting further supply chain disruption or high lead-time volatility for summer. Total phantom/delayed inventory in system: ~1147 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) despite high demand (Period 22 demand: 147). July demand is averaging ~125-150 units. However, system \u2018In-transit\u2019 inventory is extremely inflated at 2045 units. Analysis confirms massive pipeline contamination: Period 1 (304 units) and Period 3 (375 units) are definitely lost (679 units). Additionally, orders from Period 17 (207 units), Period 19 (261 units), and Period 22 (637 units) account for 1105 units. Period 4 (261 units) is also likely lost or severely delayed. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (2045) from the base stock calculation, it will never place a new order if I use default methods. To fix this, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to a value that exceeds the current contaminated pipeline (2045) plus the desired buffer for 3 periods (L+1). With an expected demand of ~150 units/period, a base stock targeting ~2600 units (2045 + 150*3 + safety) is needed to bypass the phantom inventory block. L is kept at default (2) as recent arrivals (P22) still match this promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain breakdown confirmed: Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory now estimated at 1408 units (P1: 304, P3: 375, P4: 261, P17: 207, P19: 261) as these orders are significantly past expected arrival and have been skipped by later arrivals (P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $238.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 24 (late July). The demand for ladies' denim trousers has stabilized into a summer regime with an average of approximately 154 units over the last five periods (P19-P23: 148, 88, 141, 147, 175). The significant issue is the 'In-transit' count of 2040 units, which is heavily contaminated by lost shipments (P1: 304, P3: 375, P4: 261, P17: 207, P19: 261). These 1,408 units are definitely lost or severely overdue, which prevents the OR backend from ordering despite a high critical ratio (0.8). By using an 'explicit' mu_hat, I can artificially inflate the targets to force orders despite the phantom pipeline. However, P23 concluded with a large arrival of 637 units (from P22), resulting in 462 units on-hand. With a demand of ~150/period and a lead time of 1-2 periods, we currently have enough on-hand to cover roughly 3 periods. I will maintain a mu_hat based on the recent average demand (~154) across the (L+1) horizon (3 periods), resulting in a value of 462. Given the high on-hand, the engine will likely not order this period, which is appropriate to avoid overstocking while we work through the current inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: While P22 and P20 orders arrived within 1-2 periods, a cumulative total of 1408 units (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19) remain in perpetual transit. Summer demand (June/July) has stabilized at ~154 units/period (average of P19-P23).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-97.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the inventory state for SKU 636323001 is heavily distorted by 1,408 phantom units in 'In-transit' that are confirmed lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P17, P19). The system shows 2,040 in-transit, but the actual viable pipeline is likely only the P23 order (632 units). The on-hand inventory is 389 units. Demand has stabilized into a late-summer regime; P24 demand was 73, and the average of the last 6 periods (P19-P24) is approximately 140 units/period. Historically, demand for denim trousers tends to soften in late July before any possible back-to-school uptick. Given the high 'In-transit' inflation, the OR backend will not place orders unless the 'base_stock' exceeds current phantom levels. To ensure the backend can actually place orders if needed, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to override the pipeline contamination. I am setting mu_hat based on an expected demand of 150 units/period over (L+1) periods (L=2). This translates to 450 units. However, because the system subtracts the 2,040 in-transit units, any 'mu_hat' lower than those units will result in zero orders. I will maintain a holding strategy this period to deplete the 389 on-hand units, as they cover ~2.5 weeks of current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed (Late July): Avg demand for P19-P24 is ~140 units, indicating a slight cooling from the mid-June peak (~220). Supply chain contamination remains at 1,408 units across 5 lost orders.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), the supply chain remains heavily contaminated with 'phantom inventory'. A total of 1,408 units across Periods 1, 3, 4, 17, and 19 are definitively lost or permanently stalled, as they have been bypassed by multiple successful deliveries (P20 and P22). The current 'In-transit' figure of 2,040 units is misleading; subtracting the 1,408 phantom units leaves an actual pipeline of 632 units (the order from P23). Demand has stabilized following the June peak, with an average of approximately 140 units over the last 6 periods (P19-P24). For Period 26, the on-hand inventory is 247, which is sufficient to cover nearly two weeks of demand at the current rate. However, to prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1,408 phantom units as available stock and refusing to order in the future, I must continue using 'explicit' overrides. Forecasted demand for the review + lead period (3 periods) is set to 420 (140 * 3). Sigma is set based on recent variability. This strategy ensures we maintain stock without allowing the corrupted pipeline data to induce a stockout.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/12. We are in the late summer demand regime. Recent demand (P19-P26) has averaged approximately 140 units/period (total 1123 / 8 periods). The most recent period (P26) saw an uptick to 204 units. As previously identified, the pipeline inventory is heavily contaminated with 1408 units from five lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19) that have been skipped by later arrivals (P20, P22, P23). This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend's base-stock logic from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock to cover (L+1) periods. With an average demand of 140 and L=2, the required inventory is 420 units. However, we currently have 675 units on-hand, which is sufficient to cover nearly 5 periods of demand at current rates. Therefore, no new order is needed this period. I will set mu_hat to a very low explicit value to ensure the backend does not order while we bleed off the current overstock, while monitoring for the next seasonal shift (Autumn).

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand (August) is stable at ~140 units/period. On-hand inventory (675) is currently high relative to demand, necessitating a pause in ordering to avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), the current on-hand inventory is 484 units, which is high relative to the stabilized late summer demand (average ~140 units/period over P19-P27). The system's 'In-transit' count is severely contaminated by 1,408 units across 5 lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19) that have been skipped by more recent arrivals (P22, P23). Because this phantom inventory suppresses automated ordering, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to maintain the inventory target. Given current demand of ~140 and a target of roughly (L+1) periods of stock, we need approximately 420-500 units on hand/valid transit. Since we already have 484 on-hand, no new order is needed this period. I set mu_hat explicitly to 0 to ensure the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in 0, avoiding further accumulation of holding costs while we bleed off the current surplus.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the product (Ladies Denim Trousers) shows stable demand. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) averaged 165.8 units, which is a slight increase from the mid-summer average of 140 units. Current on-hand inventory is 265 units, which covers approximately 2 periods of demand at the current rate. The supply chain remains heavily contaminated with 1,408 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19) that will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from its target base stock, it will not place any new orders unless the base stock target exceeds on-hand + 1,408. To force necessary replenishment and prevent a stockout in ~2 periods, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a massive value that overcomes this 1,408-unit offset. My target base stock for L=2 (Review + Lead Time = 3 periods) should be approximately 3 * 166 + safety stock \u2248 650 units. Therefore, I set mu_hat (which the backend treats as the base stock target) to 2,100 (approximately 650 + 1,450) to ensure the backend calculates an order of roughly 400 units (2100 - 1408 phantom - 265 on-hand). This will maintain service levels as we head into September.

Current date is 2019/09/02 (Start of September). Demand for ladies' denim trousers has stabilized after a summer dip, showing an average of ~200 units over the last three periods (P27-P29). On-hand inventory is 78. In-transit inventory is extremely high at 1922 units; however, 1408 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19) and will never arrive. The remaining 514 units are from the P29 order, which is expected to arrive within 1-2 periods. To prevent the OR backend from failing to order due to the 1408 phantom units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to lower the base stock calculation, effectively forcing the backend to ignore the pipeline. However, since 514 units are already in legitimate transit and on-hand is 78, our total real position is 592 units. Against a demand of ~200/period and a lead time of 2, we are well-covered for the next 2.5 periods. I will setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable late-summer demand regime (avg ~200, std ~20).

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (Back-to-school): Demand has stabilized at ~200 units/period (P27-P29 avg: 199). Total phantom inventory remains 1408 units across 5 lost orders, requiring explicit parameter management to bypass pipeline inflation.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the SKU is entering the 'Back-to-School' and early autumn demand phase. Recent demand (P27-P30) has stabilized at approximately 211 units per period (Avg of 191, 219, 187, 246). On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units). A significant 'In-transit' figure of 1,922 units is reported, but as documented in carry-over insights, at least 1,408 units across periods 1, 3, 4, 17, and 19 are definitively lost. The order of 514 units from P29 is likely still in transit (given L=2). However, reliance on the backend's automatic base-stock calculation is impossible because it perceives the 1,408 lost units as available pipeline inventory, which would suppress all new orders. To circumvent this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock (covering Review + Lead Time, approx 3 periods) at 633 units (211 * 3). To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite the 1,922 'In-transit' units, I must set the explicit mu_hat to a value exceeding the current pipeline + desired stock. Setting mu_hat to 3000 effectively forces the engine beyond its 'In-transit' ceiling to replenish the 0 on-hand stock. Sigma_hat is set relatively high (150) to account for the volatility seen in the recent demand spike (246 in P30).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is mid-September (Period 32). In 'Back-to-School' season, demand for denim trousers has stabilized around ~215 units/period (average of P28-P31). On-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' count (3065 units) is heavily contaminated by lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P17, and P19 (totaling 1408 units) which will never arrive. Additionally, the order from P29 (514 units) is now at L=2 and has not yet arrived, and the large order from P31 (1143 units) is in the pipeline. Because the backend OR engine subtracts all 'In-transit' units from the base stock calculation, it will stop ordering if it perceives the 1408 lost units as incoming stock. To bypass this, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 1408 (the phantom inventory) PLUS (1+L) * expected demand (3 * 215 = 645), totaling 2053. This ensures the backend sees a requirement that offsets the phantom 'In-transit' units while still maintaining a 3-period coverage (L+1). L is set to explicit 2, as recent successful deliveries (P22, P23) took 1-3 periods, averaging ~2.

Carry-over insight: September demand (Back-to-school) confirmed stable at ~215 units/period (P28-P31 evidence). Phantom inventory remains at 1408 units across P1, P3, P4, P17, and P19, requiring explicit mu_hat inflation for the OR backend to function.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 conclude (2019/9/16), the on-hand inventory is 984 units. Current demand remains in the 'Back-to-school' regime, with an average of approximately 204 units over the last five periods (P28-P32). The 'In-transit' count of 1922 units is severely compromised by 1,408 units of known lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19) and the P29 order of 514 units which is currently overdue (concluded L=3 or higher). Subtracting the 1,408 phantom units from the 1,922 in-transit total leaves 514 units actually expected (the P29 order). Total usable assets = 984 (on-hand) + 514 (expected P29) = 1498 units. At a demand rate of ~210 units/period, this covers roughly 7 periods of supply. Therefore, no new order is needed this period. To prevent the OR backend from ordering despite the high (but phantom) pipeline, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the actual demand while keeping total assets above the calculated base stock. Given 1498 actual units versus a desired inventory level of ~630 (3 periods * 210), I will use 'explicit' to maintain control over the system's reaction to the corrupted pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Lost shipment tally remains at 1,408 units (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19). Order from P29 (514 units) is now 3 periods past ordering without arrival confirmation, potentially indicating a further lead time shift to L\u22653 or another loss.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-184.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status for Period 34 shows 824 units on-hand. Demand has stabilized into a 'Back-to-school' regime, with the last 6 periods (P28-P33) averaging 199.33 units. The 'In-transit' count of 1922 units is severely compromised by phantom inventory. This includes 1,408 units from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19) and 514 units from P29 which is now 5 periods old (L=2 promised). Since P31 arrived in 1 period, P29 is highly likely lost, bringing the total phantom pipeline to 1,922 units. Because In-transit (1922) >= Base Stock, the OR backend will not place new orders unless mu_hat is set explicitly to a very high value. I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' at 2000 to bypass this pipeline contamination while monitoring on-hand inventory. Since on-hand (824) is currently sufficient for ~4 periods of the current demand (~200/period), the backend capped policy will prevent excessive over-ordering. L is set to explicit 2 based on the most recent arrival (P31, L=1) and promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Cumulative phantom inventory in pipeline reached 1,922 units (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, and now P29). Recent demand (P28-P33) confirmed stable at ~200 units/period. Supply chain lead times remain volatile (P31 arrived in 1 period, P29 missing for 5+).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019/10/7), the environment is characterized by stable early-autumn demand and severe supply chain reporting errors. DEMAND: Over the last 7 periods (P28-P34), average demand is 185 units, showing a slight softening from the September back-to-school peak but remaining significantly higher than the May/June lows. SUPPLY CHAIN: There is a cumulative 'In-transit' phantom inventory of 1,922 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, and P29). These orders are 4+ periods overdue and have been bypassed by more recent arrivals (e.g., P31 arrived at P32), confirming they are lost. INVENTORY STRATEGY: Current on-hand inventory is 722 units. With demand at ~185/period and a promised lead time of 2 (target inventory = (2+1)*185 = 555), we are currently overstocked. However, to allow the OR backend to place any future orders, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to override the 1,922 phantom units in the pipeline. I am setting mu_hat to a value that reflects the current demand regime (~185) plus the phantom inventory (1922) to 'zero out' the error in the backend's base-stock calculation. No order will be triggered this period due to high on-hand levels, but this sets the stage for accurate ordering once on-hand levels deplete.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed cumulative phantom inventory reached 1,922 units (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, P29). Demand has transitioned to an early autumn regime averaging ~185 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the system shows 643 units on-hand and 1,922 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the in-transit units are entirely comprised of phantom inventory from 6 lost or significantly delayed orders (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, and P29). These 1,922 units will never arrive but prevent the OR backend from ordering new stock because they falsely inflate pipeline inventory. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom inventory plus desired safety stock. Demand has transitioned into a mid-autumn regime, with the last 5 periods (P31-P35) averaging ~145 units/period. Aiming for a 3-week cover (review + lead time) at this rate requires ~435 units. However, to force an order through the 1,922 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set significantly higher. Given the current on-hand inventory of 643 is sufficient for roughly 4 periods of demand, I will set mu_hat to 2000 to keep the ordering mechanism active for future adjustments while currently relying on the existing on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory is fully corrupted by 1,922 phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, P29) that will not arrive. Mid-autumn demand (Oct) has stabilized at ~145 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (Oct 21), we are in a mid-to-late autumn demand regime. Historical demand for the last three periods (P34-P36) has averaged ~93 units/period, showing a seasonal decline from the September 'back-to-school' peak of ~215 units. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is fully corrupted by 1,922 phantom units from lost or indefinitely delayed orders (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, P29). These units will likely never arrive, but because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity from the base stock target, it will stop ordering entirely if mu_hat is set to the actual expected demand. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set as 'explicit' to include the phantom volume plus the safety stock for the current period. However, current on-hand inventory is 544 units, which covers approximately 5-6 periods of demand at the current rate (~93/period). Therefore, we do not want the backend to place an order yet. I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the current demand regime but keep it below the threshold that would trigger a new order, given the on-hand stock and phantom pipeline. No new orders are needed today.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand regime (October) confirmed at ~95 units/period, down from September's ~215 (-55%). Phantom inventory remains at 1,922 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Entering Period 38 (late October), the product (Ladies Skinny Denim) is in a late autumn seasonal decline. Demand over the last three periods (P35-P37) has leveled at an average of 96 units/period, consistent with the shift identified in Period 37. On-hand inventory is currently 434 units, which covers approximately 4.5 periods of current demand. The pipeline inventory remains permanently corrupted by 1,922 phantom units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, P29). Because the pipeline count (1,922) far exceeds any reasonable base stock level, the OR backend would normally never place an order. However, since on-hand inventory (434) is sufficient to cover the remaining 10 periods of the game at the current demand rate (~100 units/period), no new orders are required. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime and high stability, allowing the existing stock to deplete.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4), the demand for ladies' denim trousers has entered a stable late autumn regime. Recent demand (P34-P38) averages approximately 103 units per period (102, 79, 99, 110, 124). This is a significant decrease from the September 'back-to-school' peak of ~215. The current on-hand inventory is 310 units, which covers roughly 3 periods of the current demand. The pipeline remains heavily contaminated with 1,922 phantom units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, P29). These units inflate the system's stock position, preventing the OR engine from placing any new orders even as on-hand inventory depletes. To counteract this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that encompasses both the expected demand for the lead-time window and the phantom inventory. Target base stock = (1+L) * forecasted_demand + phantom_inventory. Using L=2 (promised), calculation: (1+2)*105 + 1922 = 2237. I will set mu_hat to 2237 to signal to the OR backend that it should maintain a stock level sufficient to cover actual demand despite the pipeline error. Sigma is set based on recent volatility in this regime (approx 20 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand (Late Oct/Nov) confirmed stable at ~105 units/period. Explicit mu_hat adjustment (adding 1,922 units) is required to bypass phantom pipeline inventory until stock depletion necessitates new orders.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation as of Period 40 (Nov 11) confirms the late autumn demand regime for skinny jeans, with demand stable at approximately 105 units/period (P37-P39 mean: 112, P34-P39 mean: 103). The 'In-transit' count of 1957 units remains heavily corrupted by 1922 units from known lost or severely overdue shipments (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, P29). With Period 39 ordering 35 units, the actual useful pipeline is only that 35 units plus the current on-hand of 208. To ensure the backend continues to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to override the phantom pipeline inventory. This is calculated as: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Phantom_Units. With L=2 and Forecast=105, the base mu_hat (3 * 105 = 315) is increased by 1922 to 2237. This ensures the backend recognizes a deficit when on-hand stock falls, rather than assuming it has 1922 units arriving soon. Sigma_hat is calculated for a slightly higher volatility (40) to maintain service levels during this shift.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18), we are in a late autumn/early winter demand regime. Recent demand (P34-P40) has stabilized at an average of 100 units/period (values: 102, 79, 99, 110, 124, 102, 90). The pipeline inventory is officially 2,088 units, but 1,922 of these are confirmed phantom units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, P29). These phantom units will never arrive, causing the OR backend to believe inventory levels are much higher than they are, thus preventing new orders. To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target base stock by exactly 1,922 units. This allows the backend to 'see' through the phantom inventory and place orders based on real on-hand stock and recent arrivals (P39, P40). I estimate mu_hat (demand for L+1 periods) for a lead time of 2 as 3 * 100 = 300, and then I add 1,922 to get 2,222. Sigma_hat is set to 35 based on the standard deviation of recent stable demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Maintained phantom pipeline inventory at 1,922 units. Late autumn demand regime is stable at ~100 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), the demand for skinny ankle jeans is in a stable late-autumn/pre-holiday regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 108.8 units, which aligns with the observed steady state of ~100-110 units identified in recent carry-over insights. Total in-transit inventory is currently 2099 units, but 1922 of these are confirmed phantom/lost units (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, P29). Subtracting this phantom inventory leaves a real pipeline of 177 units (P40: 131 units, P41: 46 units). Current on-hand inventory is 35 units. The actual lead time has stabilized to the promised 2 periods (as seen with the P39 order arriving in P41). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the 1922 phantom units in its 'In-transit' count, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. At ~110 units/period, the base stock requirement is ~330 units. To bypass the 1922 phantom units, I set mu_hat (which is treated as the base stock target + pipeline offset in this specific controller logic) to 2250 (calculated as approximately target base stock 330 + phantom 1922). This will signal the backend to maintain a healthy real inventory level as we approach the end of the game (47 periods total).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2), we are entering the December holiday season. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 221, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average of ~105, which confirms a seasonal uptick. The total 'In-transit' count is 2235, but 1922 units from Periods 1, 3, 4, 17, 19, and 29 are confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments). The 'true' pipeline consists of orders from P40 (131), P41 (46), and P42 (136), totaling 313 units. Since we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and actual demand is rising (forecasted ~200/period for December), the target base stock must cover (L+1) periods of demand. Using L=2, base stock needs to be ~600 units. To force the OR backend (which sees 2235 in transit) to order, I must set mu_hat explicitly to (forecasted demand * 3) + phantom_units (200*3 + 1922 = 2522) to ensure the system recognizes a deficit. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: December seasonal uptick confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 221 (+110% vs autumn average). Phantom inventory remains at 1922 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9). In Period 43, orders from P40 and P41 arrived, while the order from P42 (136 units) remains in-transit (expected in P44 or P45). The current on-hand inventory is 88. Demand in P42 was 221 (early Dec peak), but P43 was 89, suggesting high late-year volatility. The system 'In-transit' count is 2413, heavily corrupted by 1,922 legacy phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, P29). Recent actual in-transit units are 136 (P42) and 355 (P43), totaling 491 valid units. To bypass the 1,922 phantom units and maintain coverage for a lead time of 2-3 periods, I set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate a December mean demand of ~150 units/period (blending the 221 spike with the 89 follow-up). For a base stock covering (L+1) = 3 periods, we need ~450 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the (1,922 + 491) in-transit from base stock, I must set mu_hat to approximately (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) / (L+1) = (450 + 1922) / 3 \u2248 791 to trigger necessary ordering for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: December demand volatility recognized: P42 spike (221) followed by P43 drop (89). Phantom inventory remains constant at 1,922 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (Dec 16), on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (9 units). Total In-transit is 2,413 units, but 1,922 of these are confirmed 'phantom' units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, and P29) that are significantly overdue and skipped by later successful arrivals. This leaves a real pipeline of 491 units (P42: 136, P43: 355). Recent demand (P42-44) shows high volatility (221, 89, 79), likely reflecting the December holiday period. To bypass the 1,922 phantom units that prevent the OR engine from ordering, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. Following the logic of the base-stock formula (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline), I set mu_hat (the (1+L) period service level target) to 2,413 + buffer. Given the game is ending in 3 periods (P45, 46, 47), and we want to cover demand through P47 (L=2 promised), I aim for a base stock that ensures availability for the final stretch while accounting for the inflated pipeline inventory. I will set mu_hat to 2,600 to trigger a small order that covers the final predicted demand (~150-200/period) without creating massive surplus as the game concludes.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 46 (Dec 23). The historical demand for this late December period (Christmas week) is likely to be lower than the early December peak, as reflected in Period 43-45 demand (~83 units avg). On-hand inventory is 420 units, which covers over 5 periods of current demand. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 2186 is heavily corrupted by 1,922 phantom units (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, and P29). Since the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock to determine orders, it will never order again unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to offset these phantom units. For Period 46, mu_hat is set to the phantom total (1922) plus a conservative forecast for the next 3 periods (3 * 85 = 255), totaling 2177. This ensures the backend sees a realistic pipeline relative to on-hand stock and avoids ordering until the surplus is depleted.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 47 (Dec 30), we are at the end of the calendar year. Demand for denim trousers has stabilized post-holiday at a lower regime, with an average of ~82 units over the last three periods (P44-P46). Inventory on-hand is currently 341 units, which covers over 4 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 2186 is heavily corrupted by 1,922 phantom units (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, and P29) and the actual order from P45 (264 units). Since on-hand inventory is sufficient to last through the next 3 weeks (accounting for lead time), and we want to avoid holding costs for excessive stock as we enter January, no new order is required. We maintain the explicit mu_hat strategy to offset the 1,922 phantom units, ensuring the OR backend correctly calculates the pipeline adjustment.

Carry-over insight: End of year demand regime (late Dec): Demand has floor-leveled to ~80 units/period (P44-P46 avg: 79.3). Total phantom inventory remains 1,922 units.
