Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Noa skinny trouser'. Historical demand samples show a downward trend: 256, 241, 112, 112, 81. The average demand across these 5 samples is 160.4. However, the most recent three periods (112, 112, 81) suggest a significant drop compared to the initial two weeks of January. This may reflect the post-holiday/early winter clearance period or a stabilization of demand for this SKU. Given the downward trend, using a recent_N approach for demand estimation is appropriate to avoid over-ordering based on the high demand in early January. I will use N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this more recent, lower demand regime. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods; without any arrival history yet, I will use the default promised lead time. The goal is to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand to prevent stockouts while reflecting the current lower sales velocity.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's tailored trouser. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 256, 241, 112, 112, 81. There is a clear downward trend from high January levels towards a lower baseline in February. Period 1 demand was 82, matching the most recent historical sample. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 132 units in-transit (ordered in Period 1). With a promised lead time of 2, these units are expected in Period 3. Since we start with 0 on-hand and missed sales in Period 1 (sold 0 for demand of 82), we need to ensure the order covers the upcoming demand for (L+1)=3 periods. Using the recent demand regime (last 3 samples: 112, 112, 81) gives a mean of ~102. Setting mu_hat to cover 3 periods based on this recent average (~306) will help restore inventory levels once the lead time elapses.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). This SKU (Womens Tailoring Trousers) has experienced consistent stockouts since Period 1 due to 0 starting inventory and a promised lead time of 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (132 units) and P2 (121 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time, we expect the P1 order to arrive during P3 and be visible in the P4 start message. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb: 256, 241, 112, 112, 81) and recent observed demand (P1: 82, P2: 102) show a significant drop from the January peak, indicating a post-holiday/seasonal transition. The average demand over the last 5 samples is approx 98. With L=2, the backend will target covering 3 periods of demand (L+1). To stabilize and avoid over-ordering as we await the first arrival, I will use recent_N mapping to the current demand regime.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product (Womens Tailoring Trousers) has no on-hand inventory, and we have experienced lost sales in the first three periods due to the lead time. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Order 1 (P1) should have arrived in Period 3's arrival phase, but based on the Period 3 conclude message, arrived=0. This suggests lead time is at least 3 periods or there is a delay. Historical demand samples (last 5: 256, 241, 112, 112, 81) show a high initial volume followed by a lower, stable regime. However, recent demand observations in-game (P1: 82, P2: 102, P3: 89) confirm a current demand regime around 90-100 units/week. Since we have 0 on-hand and 338 in-transit (Orders from P1, P2, P3: 132+121+85 = 338), we are heavily reliant on these arrivals. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delayed P1 arrival, and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the actual in-game demand levels (avg ~91) rather than the much higher pre-game historical samples.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/11. The product is a women's tailored trouser. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~160, but recent demand (Periods 1-4) has significantly settled to an average of 84.75 units/period. Period 4 conclude shows an arrival from Period 2 (lead_time=2), confirming the promised lead time holds. However, the order from Period 1 (132 units) is notably missing (it should have arrived in Period 3 or 4). In-transit is currently 277 (from orders in P1, P3, P4). Since the P1 order (132 units) appears lost or significantly delayed, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the lower current demand regime (~85 units/period) rather than the high January numbers. I will use explicit L=2 to match observed lead time and ensure the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) window effectively. The OR backend needs to account for the lower consumption rate to avoid excessive holding costs as inventory finally starts arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Period 1-4 average is ~85 units, down from Jan average of ~160. Period 1 order (132 units) is likely lost/delayed (missing at P4 conclude).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18. Demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to January; the average for the last 5 periods (P1-P5) is 78.2 units. Looking at the arrival history, the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) at Period 4. The Period 1 order (132 units) is still missing (it should have arrived at Period 3 conclude if L=2), and the Period 3 order (85 units) should have arrived at Period 5 conclude but did not. This suggests either a lead time shift or lost/delayed shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (3 units) due to these missing arrivals, though we have 277 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4 orders). To ensure availability given the uncertainty, I will use an explicit L of 3 to account for the observed delays, and use recent_N (N=5) for the demand forecast to reflect the current regime (~78 units/period). This results in mu_hat = (1+3)*78.2 = 312.8.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability: P1 and P3 orders are overdue; P2 order arrived on time (L=2). Evidence suggests actual lead time may be 3+ or shipments are being lost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 375 units in-transit. Historical performance shows a distinct demand decrease from January levels (~160) to the Feb/March average (~73 units/period). More concerning is the supply chain: while the Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2), the Period 1 (ordered P1), Period 3 (ordered P3), and Period 4 (ordered P4) orders are missing or overdue. Specifically, the P3 order (85 units) should have arrived in Period 6's conclude message if L=2. Since it is missing, I am treating the actual lead time as at least 3 periods or signals of lost shipments. I will adjust L to 3 (explicit) to force the OR engine to cover a longer protection interval. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the recent regime (Period 1-6) where demand averaged 73 units. sigma_hat will be based on the same recent period to reflect current volatility. Note: The large in-transit balance (375) includes the likely lost P1 order (132 units); increasing mu_hat/L helps trigger a replenishment order despite this high in-transit phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are overdue as of P7 START, suggesting L >= 3 or high shipment loss rate. Demand remains stable in the 'low' regime (~73 units/period) since Feb 11th.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), the system is facing a severe stockout due to supply chain instability. Reviewing the history: The Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2) at Period 4, but orders from P1, P3, P4, and P6 have not arrived. Specifically, the P1 order is now 5 periods overdue, and P3/P4 are 1-2 periods overdue. This suggests a high loss rate or a significant lead time extension to at least 4 periods. Since the backend OR engine relies on 'promised lead time' (L=2), I will explicitly set L=4 to increase the base stock level and force the OR to account for longer cycles. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Feb 11th; the last 7 weeks (P1-P7) show an average demand of ~75 units (82, 102, 89, 66, 52, 48, 83). I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime, while the L=4 setting will raise the target inventory to buffer against the observed delays and prevent future stockouts once supply resumes.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Orders from P1, P3, P4, and P6 are severely delayed or lost. Actual lead time for arriving shipments is currently unknown but exceeds 4 periods for undelivered stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing 'Noa skinny trouser'. Recent history shows a stable demand regime starting Feb 11th with an average of approximately 76 units per period (sample: 82, 102, 89, 66, 52, 48, 83, 90). The lead time is highly unreliable; while the P6 order arrived on time (L=2) at the end of Period 8, orders from P1, P3, P4, and P5 are largely missing or late. The P6 arrival (98 units) allowed us to satisfy demand in P8, ending with 8 units on-hand. We currently have 349 units in-transit. To prevent stockouts given the high probability of lost shipments, I am maintaining a lead time estimate of 3 to increase the base stock level. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the post-January demand regime (~76 units/period). This aggressive mu_hat calculation (1+L)*mean_demand ensures we order enough to buffer against the demonstrated supply chain instability.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain disruption confirmed: Orders from P1, P3, P4, and P5 are functionally lost or severely delayed (missing for 4-8 periods). Only the P2 and P6 orders arrived with the promised L=2.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). Demand for 'Noa skinny trouser' has been consistently in a lower regime since early February, averaging approximately 74 units over the last 9 periods (recent N=9). The supply chain is highly unstable. Orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 are all currently overdue or lost (missing for 3 to 9 periods). Only the orders from Period 2 and Period 6 arrived on time with the promised L=2. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing significant shipment losses, I must assume a high level of risk. However, per carry-over insights and historical arrival patterns, when orders do arrive, they follow L=2. The OR backend needs to account for the fact that a large portion of the 'In-transit' stock (362 units) likely consists of lost shipments that will never arrive. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite the high (but likely ghost) pipeline inventory, I will slightly extend the lead time to L=3 and set mu_hat based on the recent stable demand of ~74 units/period (3*74 = 222). sigma_hat is set using recent volatility to avoid over-ordering given the low inventory efficiency.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain reliability remains poor: P1, P3, P4, P5, and P7 orders are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed as of P10. Arriving shipments (P2, P6) strictly followed L=2. Demand is stable at ~74 units/week since mid-February.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the demand for the 'Noa skinny trouser' has stabilized into a lower regime following the initial January peak. The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 70.4 units, significantly lower than the pre-history average of ~160. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 are missing and effectively lost. Only shipments from Periods 2, 6, 8, and 9 successfully arrived. Notably, the P9 order arrived with L=1 and the others with L=2, suggesting that while lead time is nominally 2, the system is prone to high stochastic loss. Current on-hand inventory is 56, and under the lower demand regime (~70/week), we estimate \u03bc\u0302 across the (L+1) window (3 weeks) to be approximately 210 units. With 217 units in transit (excluding lost shipments from P1,3,4,5,7), the pipeline minus on-hand is roughly sufficient. I am setting L explicitly to 2, mu_hat to a recent 10-period average to capture the stabilized lower demand, and sigma_hat using recent variance to account for the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in the lower regime (avg ~70 units) compared to Jan (~160). Shipment loss rate is extremely high (approximately 50% of orders failed to arrive). Arrival lead times for successful shipments are 1-2 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). The product is a women's skinny trouser. Historical demand analysis shows a significant drop from January levels (~160) to a stable lower regime starting mid-February. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged ~39 units (60, 29, 28), significantly lower than the previous sub-regime of ~74 units. This likely reflects a seasonal decline or late-spring demand drop for this specific style. Regarding supply chain, we have a catastrophic failure rate: orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10 have not arrived and are likely lost. However, successful arrivals (P2, P6, P8, P9) show an actual lead time of 1-2 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 28 units, with 277 units theoretically in-transit (though most are lost). I will set L to 2 to match the promised lead time as the backend doesn't account for lost shipments. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value based on the most recent 3-week average (~40 units/week) to avoid over-ordering during this apparent seasonal slowdown, multiplied by (1+L). Sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: weekly average dropped from ~74 to ~39 (-47%). Persistent high shipment loss rate confirmed; approximately 60% of historic orders never arrived.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the 'Noa skinny trouser' is in a low-demand regime. Since Period 10, demand has averaged 31 units per week (29, 28, 36), compared to the mid-February to early-April average of ~74. Inventory is currently 0 with 277 units in transit. However, history confirms a catastrophic supply chain failure: orders from P1, P3, P4, P5, and P7 are missing (approximately 60% loss rate). Recent successful arrivals (P8, P9) followed lead times of 2 and 1 periods, respectively. While the OR engine's pipeline tracking will see 277 units, many of these are likely lost. To force the backend to place replacement orders despite the ghost pipeline, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for potential delays and inflating sigma_hat to increase the base stock level (safety buffer) to mitigate stockouts caused by high shipment loss rates. Mu_hat is set using recent_N=3 to reflect the most recent demand drop.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 10: weekly average stabilized at ~31 units, down from previous regime of ~74. Shipment loss rate remains extremely high (approx 60%), with orders from P1, P3, P4, P5, and P7 never concluding.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Noa skinny trouser' (655784001) is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) as of Period 14 (May 13th). Demand has shifted significantly downward starting around Period 10 (mid-April), stabilizing at a weekly average of approximately 29 units (P10-P13: 29, 28, 36, 23). The previous regime (P1-P9) averaged ~74 units. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, and 12 have not arrived, suggesting a loss rate of over 60%. However, successful deliveries (P2, P6, P8, P9) arrived with lead times of 1 or 2 periods. Since there are 277 units in-transit (far exceeding the current demand regime's requirements), the priority is to stop further ordering and wait for arrival reconciliation. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=4) to reflect the lower demand regime and use the 'calculate' method for L to account for the actual delivery history of 1-2 periods while acknowledging the high risk of loss in the pipeline inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Noa skinny trouser' has stabilized in a lower regime starting around Period 10 (April 15). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is approximately 28.8 units per week (29, 28, 36, 23, 28), which is a significant drop from the ~74 unit average seen in the previous regime. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: approximately 60% of orders placed to date (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7) have never arrived and are considered lost. However, successful deliveries (P2, P6, P8) have consistently arrived with a lead time (L) of 2, while P9 arrived in L=1. Given the high loss rate, the 'In-transit' figure of 277 is misleading as it likely includes these lost units. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the recent demand drop and use 'explicit' for L and sigma_hat. By setting L to 2 (promised) and using an explicit sigma_hat, I aim to maintain enough stock to cover the current demand regime despite the unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at ~29 units/week from Period 10 onwards. Pipeline inventory (277 units) is highly inflated by historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for 'Noa skinny trousers' has stabilized at a low regime since Period 10 (April 15), averaging approximately 29 units per week. This is a significant drop from the March average of ~74 units and the January average of ~160 units. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable; only orders from P2, P6, P8, and P9 have ever arrived, while all other orders (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7) are considered lost. This has created a false 'In-transit' figure of 277 units (sum of these lost orders). Because the OR engine uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders, it will never place a new order as long as it believes those 277 units are coming. To force the engine to order and break the stockout (current on-hand is 0), I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom pipeline. Based on current demand (~29/week) and a lead time of 2, a normal base stock (L+1) would be ~87. To overcome the 277 units of lost stock and target a fresh arrival for 3 periods of demand, I set mu_hat = 277 (to offset pipeline) + 87 (target stock) = 364.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 655784001 (Women's skinny trousers) is in a low-demand regime that stabilized around late April/early May. Since Period 10 (2019-04-15), demand has averaged ~27.5 units per week (ranging 19-36), a significant decrease from the early season peak. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: approximately 60% of historical orders (Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, 7) have never arrived and are now categorized as lost. These phantom units inflate the OR backend's 'Pipeline' calculation, preventing new orders from being placed. Even with the P16 order of 99 units, the 'In-transit' figure of 376 is vastly over-reported. To force the system to order despite this phantom inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I've set mu_hat to 400 (roughly 14.5x the current weekly demand) to overcome the 376 units of 'in-transit' stock and trigger a new replenishment order. L is set to 'calculate' to use the confirmed 1-2 period lead time from successful shipments. Sigma_hat is set to 15 using 'explicit' to reflect the moderate variance (std ~5.5) observed in the current stable regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '655784001' (Womens Trousers) has settled into a low-demand regime starting around Period 10 (mid-April), coinciding with the transition into warmer summer months. Average demand since Period 10 is approximately 28 units per period, a significant drop from the spring peak (~70-80 units). The supply chain remains highly unreliable; historical analysis shows that orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 never arrived and are functionally lost. These phantom units (totaling 277) still occupy the 'In-transit' figure (326 total), which would normally prevent the OR backend from ordering. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an 'explicit' method that reflects the current demand regime (mean ~28, L=2, so mu_hat approx 84) but with a much higher value to compensate for the fact that the backend subtracts the inflated pipeline inventory. However, the immediate priority is managing current on-hand inventory (73), which covers ~2.5 periods of current demand. P16 and P17 orders totaled 148 units, with 99 already arrived in P17 (L=1). The remaining 49 from P17 are expected soon. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to focus on the post-Period 10 stability (N=8) and 'calculate' for lead time as recent arrivals (P16: L=1) show some improvement over the earlier chaos, though reliability is not guaranteed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: post-April (P10) demand is consistently ~28 units/week. Supply chain cleanup: In-transit inventory of 326 units contains approximately 277 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7) that will likely never arrive, artificially suppressing new orders.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand has consistently stabilized in a low-volume regime since Period 10 (mid-April), averaging approximately 27-29 units per week. The supply chain has shown significant reliability issues, with orders from P1, P3, P4, P5, and P7 (totaling 277 units) confirmed lost. These units currently haunt the 'In-transit' pipeline (Total 326), effectively blocking the OR backend's automated ordering because it believes they will arrive. Subtracting the lost 277 units from the 326 reported in-transit reveals a 'true' pipeline of 49 units (the P17 order). With 46 units on-hand and 49 actually in-transit, the system has sufficient stock for the next ~3 weeks given a mean demand of ~28. To counter the phantom inventory effect, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods: 3 * 28 units = 84 units. Since the backend subtracts the inflated pipeline (326) from the base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an appropriate order or maintain zero if existing stock is enough. However, the goal is to stabilize inventory. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 9-period mean (since the drop) and use 'calculate' for L as recent arrivals (P16) suggest lead times are returning to 1-2 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '655784001' (Womens Trousers) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 10 (approx. April), with an average demand of ~29 units per week. The supply chain remains highly unreliable: historical data shows that approximately 277 units in the 'In-transit' total (326 units) are lost shipments from early periods (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7) that will never arrive. The OR backend's 'cap' and 'pipeline' calculations are likely being distorted by this phantom inventory, causing it to under-order. To compensate and ensure there is enough stock to meet the current stable demand of ~29 units/week, I will use 'explicit' parameters. I will set L to the promised 2 periods (as recent successful deliveries normalized to 1-2 periods), mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand (3 * 29 = 87), and sigma_hat to reflect the low volatility observed in the current regime (std for P10-P19 is ~4.5, so sqrt(3)*4.5 \u2248 8). This bypasses the negative impact of the ghost pipeline inventory.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Demand has been stable in a low regime since Period 10 (mid-April), averaging approximately 28 units per week (the last 5 weeks: 26, 27, 31, 8, and the Period 21 observation will follow). On-hand inventory is low (7 units). The pipe-line inventory (326 units) is heavily distorted by lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7) totaling 277 units. Actual lead times for successful deliveries (P16) have been short (1 period). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 'phantom' in-transit inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Since the target base stock is (L+1) * demand_avg, and the backend subtracts pipeline (326) from this, I must set mu_hat to cover both the desired stock for 3 periods (~90 units) plus the 277 units of 'stuck' inventory. 90 + 277 = 367. This 'explicit' value for mu_hat overrides the pipeline inflation. I set L to 2 (promised) and sigma_hat using recent data to reflect the current steady demand variance.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand has remained in a low-stability regime since Period 10 (mid-April), with an average of approximately 25 units per week. The last 3 weeks show a slight softening (avg 17 units). The supply chain is highly unreliable: orders from P1, P3, P4, P5, and P7 (totaling 277 units) are confirmed lost, as they are now 14-20 periods overdue against a promised lead time of 2. These 277 units are permanently stuck in the 'In-transit' figure (currently 382), which tricks the OR backend into under-ordering. To compensate, I set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for current demand (avg ~25) across the review+lead window (3 periods = 75 units) PLUS the ghost inventory (277 units). This results in 352 units. By targeting a 'base stock' that covers both demand and the lost units, the OR engine (calculating Base Stock - Pipeline) will finally trigger new orders to meet actual floor demand. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=12) to reflect the low-volatility period since April.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory includes 277 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7) which will never arrive. Compensation via explicit mu_hat is required to bypass the policy's pipeline-inventory deduction.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '655784001' is in a stable low-demand regime since Period 10 (April 15), with an average demand of ~25 units per period. The primary challenge is a massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 277 units from lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, 7) that are indefinitely delayed. Currently, the system shows 382 units in-transit. Subtracting the 277 lost units and the 56 units ordered in P21 (which should arrive around P22-P23), we have significant 'live' orders. However, the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend (382) far exceeds the necessary base stock, preventing a new order. To force an order and maintain stock for the upcoming weeks, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock level that covers 3 periods (L+1) of demand plus safety stock. With mean=25 and L=2, base stock = (2+1)*25 + Z*sigma. Given the ghost inventory of 277 units, I set mu_hat to 390 to overcome the pipeline deduction (390 - 382 = 8 units ordered). This is a bridge to maintain service levels despite the supply chain data noise.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain cleanup: As of Period 23, 277 units in-transit are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7). Current demand average is ~25 units/period (down from Jan/Feb levels).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24 (July 22, 2019), demand remains stable at approximately 24-25 units/week (last 5 periods mean: 24.8, last 10 periods mean: 23.3). The 'low' regime identified at Period 10 persists. The primary operational challenge is the phantom 'In-transit' inventory. According to history and carry-over insights, 277 units from early orders (Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, 7) are lost and will never arrive, but they persist in the backend's calculation of pipeline inventory. Total In-transit is 356. Subtracting the 277 lost units and the 30-unit order from P23 leaves a current true pipeline of 49 units (from P17) and 30 units (from P23). However, because the backend deducts the full 356 units from the base_stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this. To target a stock level for L+1 (3 periods) at ~25 units/period plus a safety buffer, I would normally want about 100-110 units total. To trigger an order when the backend sees 356 units in-transit, I set mu_hat to 400. This compensates for the 277 lost units while maintaining a lean safety stock for the actual current demand (~25 units). Sigma_hat is set to a standard volatility for the recent regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Noa skinny trouser' has significantly cooled from the initial Jan/Feb levels (~160 to ~80) and settled into a lower regime since Period 10 (mid-April), averaging approximately 24 units/week over the last 15 periods (approx. 21 units/week over the last 5). The primary challenge remains the supply chain: Period 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 orders (totaling 277 units) are confirmed lost, but still reside in the OR backend's pipeline calculation (Total In-transit: 382). If we use standard methods, the OR engine will subtract these 277 'phantom' units from the base stock, resulting in zero new orders and eventual stockouts. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Current demand is low (~21-24), so a safe (1+L) base demand would be 3 * 25 = 75. However, to force an order despite the 277-unit pipeline bloat, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the capped ordering logic or simply cover the deficit. Total inventory targets (Safety Stock + Cycle Stock) should realistically be around 80-100 units. To bypass the 277 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to 380. This ensures the base_stock (roughly mu_hat + safety) exceeds the pipeline, prompting the backend to order. Sigma_hat is set to 15 to reflect the low but present variability in this regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26 (August 5), the demand for the woman's trouser SKU remains in a low-seasonal regime. Since Period 10, demand has averaged ~22 units/period, with the last 5 periods (P21-P25) averaging ~14.4 units/period, showing a slight further decline as summer progresses. The primary challenge remains the supply chain: out of 382 units 'In-transit', 277 units (from P1, P3, P4, P5, and P7) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. These phantom units prevent the OR backend from ordering because 'pipeline inventory' appears sufficient to cover demand. To force necessary replenishment, I use 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand for (L+1) periods = 3 periods * 15 units/period = 45 units. I add the 277 lost units to this target to offset the backend's subtraction of the total in-transit quantity. Target mu_hat = 45 + 277 = 322. Sigma is set based on the recent volatility of the low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand further softening in late summer, averaging ~14 units over the last 5 periods. Supply chain blockage persists due to 277 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory from Feb-March, requiring mu_hat inflation to trigger orders.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are in a stable demand regime for 'Noa skinny trousers' which has averaged 15.2 units/week over the last 5 periods (Period 22-26). The supply chain remains highly unreliable; specifically, 277 units from orders in Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 are 'phantom' in-transit inventory that have not arrived in over 20 periods and are considered lost. This phantom inventory (277 out of 352 total in-transit) blocks the OR engine from ordering because it believes the pipeline is full relative to a base stock of ~45-50 units. To clear this blockage, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To calculate the value: I want a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand, plus an offset to neutralize the 277 phantom units. Demand (avg 15) * (L+1=3) = 45. 45 + 277 = 322. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 322. Using L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P23, P26) show L=2-3. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current low volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent phantom in-transit inventory of 277 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P5, P7) still requires mu_hat inflation of +277 to trigger any replenishment ordering. Late summer demand stabilized at ~15 units/week.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/19 (Period 28). The demand for Period 27 spiked to 69 units, likely a seasonal or back-to-school flash demand for 'women's tailoring' (trousers), significantly higher than the previous 5-period average of ~15. Stock-out occurred in P27. The primary hurdle remains the 277 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory from early periods (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7) that have not arrived and are considered lost. These units artificially block the backend OR policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) because pipeline_inventory currently sits at 352 (277 lost + 75 recent). To trigger a replenishment order that covers both the recent demand spike and the need for fresh stock, I will set mu_hat to a value that offsets the phantom stock plus anticipated demand. I'll use L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P23, P21) are fluctuating around 2-3. mu_hat will be set to 350 (277 offset + 3 * ~25 expected demand) to force the order logic to recognize a need for at least some inventory, despite the phantom blockage. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 30 to account for higher volatility seen in the P27 spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand spike in P27 (69 units) suggests potential seasonal shift from the ~15 units/week summer average. Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 277 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 655784001 (Noa skinny trouser) is experiencing a massive demand surge coinciding with late August. Period 27 demand was 69 units and Period 28 demand spiked to 167 units. This follows a long summer period where demand averaged ~15 units. We are now in a late-summer/pre-autumn peak. The current pipeline inventory is 400 units, which includes 277 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, 7) and 123 units of actual replenishments (from P24 and P28). To trigger an order that covers the new demand regime (approx 160 units/week) and overcomes the 277-unit pipeline blockage, mu_hat must be set to cover the projected demand plus the lost inventory. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 160 + 277. With L=2, this is 3 * 160 + 277 = 757. I am using recent_N for sigma to capture the increased volatility of this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Major seasonal demand surge confirmed starting late August (P27/P28). Demand grew from ~15 units/week to 167 units/week. Supply chain blockage from 277 units of lost inventory (P1-P7) persists and requires constant inflation of the base stock via mu_hat.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a high-demand seasonal peak (Sept/Oct). Recent demand samples (P27-29: 69, 167, 189) show a dramatic regime shift from the summer average of ~15 to a new average of ~140+. To satisfy this, mu_hat must be set to cover the next three periods (L+1) at this new rate. However, the OR backend logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. Currently, In-transit inventory includes 277 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7) that are confirmed lost/phantom and 107 units from P17/P24/P26/P28 that are likely delayed or lost, as they haven't arrived within 2nd-3rd periods. Only the P29 order (375 units) is fresh. To force the engine to place a replenishment order despite the 775 'In-transit' units, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. I will set mu_hat to (3 periods * 180 units/period) + 775 units (offset) = 1315. sigma_hat is set significantly higher to account for extreme volatility during this growth phase. L remains at 2 (promised).

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Fall seasonal peak confirmed (Sept demand ~180/week). Total phantom/lost in-transit inventory estimated at 384 units (277 original from Spring + ~107 from summer delays).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Noa skinny trouser' has undergone a major seasonal upward shift starting in late August (Period 27/28), coinciding with the transition to the fall retail season. Demand in the last three periods (P28-P30) has averaged 177 units/week (167, 189, 176), a massive increase from the summer average of ~15 units. We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand) due to this surge. The supply chain remains severely compromised: I have identified a total of 384 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (277 units from P1-P7 and approximately 107 units from P24/P26 delays) that have not arrived and likely never will. To bypass the OR engine's logic\u2014which subtracts all in-transit inventory from the target base stock\u2014I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My target base stock for a 2-period lead time (covering 3 periods of demand) at ~180 units/week is 540 units. Adding the 384 units of lost inventory to this target results in a mu_hat of 924. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for both the high demand and the technical blockage caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed fall seasonal peak at ~180 units/week. Cumulative phantom in-transit inventory (lost shipments) has reached 384 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7 and likely P24/P26). Parameter mu_hat requires conscious inflation by +384 to offset this pipeline deadweight.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The fall seasonal peak is fully active, with demand averaging approximately 168 units over the last four periods (P28-P31). The main supply chain challenge is the cumulative 'phantom' in-transit inventory consisting of lost or severely delayed shipments from Spring (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7) and likely late Summer (P24, P26), totaling 384 units. Since the OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target level by +384 units to ensure real orders are triggered. For the forecast, I am using the recent demand mean of ~168 units per period. With a lead time (L) of 2, the core base stock requirement is (1+L)*168 = 504 units. Adding the 384 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 888. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility during this high-demand regime to ensure a sufficient safety buffer.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The fall seasonal peak is firmly established, with demand over the last 6 periods averaging 150 units/week (Sept specifically averaging ~165). Pipeline inventory is currently 727 units. However, this pipeline includes a substantial 'phantom' component: 384 units are identified as lost or indefinitely delayed (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7, P24, P26). At the start of Period 33, we have 418 units on-hand. With demand at ~150-180 units, we need to ensure the system places orders by offsetting the 384 units of defunct pipeline stock. The OR engine calculates base stock as (1+L) * mu_hat. To ensure the backend doesn't conclude we are overstocked due to the 384 lost units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. Forecast: (1+L) * 165 units = 495 units. To offset the deadweight 384 units, I set mu_hat to 879 (495 + 384). This will trigger a replenishment order of ~150 units to maintain the flow for the 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Inventory blockage update. Total phantom/lost in-transit inventory remains at 384 units (Spring losses P1-P7 plus Summer losses P24, P26). Average demand for the current Fall peak regime is 165 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4262.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand fall seasonal peak, with demand over the last 7 periods (P27-P33) averaging 162.7 units/week. Most recently, Period 33 saw a significant spike to 234 units. Supply chain data indicates a consistent lead time of 2 periods for successful shipments (P28 arrived in P30, P30 arrived in P32). However, the system is severely handicapped by 'phantom' in-transit inventory totaling 384 units from historically lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7 and likely P24, P26, P29). These 384 units remain in the 'In-transit' count but will not arrive, causing the OR backend to under-order or skip orders entirely. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The target base stock must cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand plus the phantom inventory balance. Using a conservative forecast of 180 units/period (reflecting the Sept average), the base requirement is 540 units. Adding the 384 phantom units results in a mu_hat of 924. This forces the OR backend to see a requirement that accounts for the unusable pipeline inventory and maintains stock for the seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand remains in high-seasonal regime (Sept avg ~180). Phantom inventory total updated: P29 (375 units) is now 5 periods old with no arrival, making it highly probable those units are also lost. However, to remain cautious and avoid over-ordering, I am maintaining the phantom offset at 384 units while monitoring P29.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Noa skinny trouser' is currently in a high-demand fall seasonal regime, with average demand over the last 8 periods (since late August) at 169.5 units/week. Recent periods show high-magnitude demand (117-234 units). Inventory management is complicated by a significant amount of 'phantom' in-transit inventory\u2014units that were ordered but likely lost in transit, which the OR backend continues to subtract from the order logic. Currently, the in-transit total is 884 units. Based on historical data: P1(132), P3(85), P4(60), P5(0), P7(0) are old losses. P24(26) and P26(0) are likely losses. Most critically, P29(375) has not arrived after 5 periods (placed in P29, should have arrived by P31/32). This brings the estimated total of phantom/lost units to 132+85+60+375 = 652 units (excluding small or zero-order periods). To ensure the OR engine places a replenishment order, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 652 phantom units plus cover the actual projected demand for the review+lead period (1+2 = 3 periods). Projected demand for 3 periods at ~170 units/period is 510 units. Combined with the 652 phantom offset, mu_hat needs to be approximately 1162. I will use 1100 to remain slightly conservative given the current on-hand inventory of 67. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 40 units per period (std of recent high-demand regime) scaled by sqrt(1+L), resulting in a value around 70.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Updated phantom/lost in-transit inventory to 652 units. This includes P1, P3, P4 (277 units) and P29 (375 units), which is now 5 periods overdue. Mu_hat must be inflated by at least +652 to bypass the OR policy's pipeline inventory deduction and allow for new orders.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36 (Oct 14th), demand has recently softened from the September peak (~180 units/week) to a three-week average of ~109 units (163, 117, 76). The product is a 'Womens Tailoring' trouser, which often peaks in late summer/early autumn for office/back-to-school wardrobes. The high in-transit inventory of 1149 units is severely distorted by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. Cumulative lost/phantom units are estimated at 652 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7 totals 277, and P29 at 375 is now 6 periods overdue). The OR backend automatically deducts the full 1149 in-transit units from the base stock. To ensure an order is actually placed to cover the current demand regime (mu_hat for L=2 is approx 110 * 3 = 330), I must inflate the explicit mu_hat by the phantom count. Using an explicit mu_hat of 982 (330 expected demand across L+1 plus 652 phantom offset) will bypass the pipeline deduction. Sigma is set to 40 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total phantom/lost in-transit inventory remains at 652 units (Spring losses P1-P7 of 277 units plus P29 of 375 units). Oct demand softening confirmed, averaging ~110 units/week over last 3 periods, down from ~180 peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (Oct 21), demand is cooling down from the September fall peak (avg ~180). October demand for the last three periods (P34-P36) has averaged 85 units (117, 76, 62), indicating a clear shift to a lower post-peak regime. Revenue/profit remains high relative to holding costs ($19 vs $1), so maintaining a safe stock level is preferred, but we must account for the inventory blockage. Total 'phantom' in-transit inventory (lost shipments) is estimated at 652 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7 totalling 277 units and P29 totalling 375 units). P15 through P36 history shows these units haven't arrived. Since the OR policy subtracts the full pipeline inventory (884 units) from the base stock calculating the order, I must inflate mu_hat to bypass this. My target base stock is approximately (L+1)*85 = 255 units. With 203 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 232 (884 - 652), the system would naturally order 0. To ensure replenishment against the actual lead time of 1-2 periods, I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand plus the phantom inventory offset.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed demand regime shift to post-fall cooling, averaging ~85 units/week. Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 652 units (P1-P7 and P29). Demand tracking: P34-P36 [117, 76, 62].

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Noa skinny trouser' has transitioned from a high-seasonal fall peak (averaging ~180 units/week) to a post-peak cooling phase. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has been [117, 76, 62, 76], resulting in a recent average of approximately 83 units/week. This aligns with late October seasonality. Regarding the supply chain, there is a significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory issue. Orders from P1, P3, P4, P5, P7 (277 units), P24, P26 (56 units), and P29 (375 units) have not arrived despite substantial time elapsed (P29 is now 9 periods old), totaling 708 units of likely lost shipments. The backend 'In-transit' count is 907, meaning only 199 units (P34: 157, P37: 23, plus minor residuals) are actually expected. To trigger correct ordering, mu_hat must be inflated to offset the 708 units of deadweight. Using mu_hat = (1+L) * avg_demand + offset = (1+2) * 85 + 708 \u2248 963. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent volatility of the cooling phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total phantom/lost in-transit inventory updated to 708 units (Spring losses 277 + Summer losses 56 + P29 loss of 375). Late October demand stabilized in a cooling regime averaging ~83 units/week.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4), the demand is in a post-peak cooling regime. Reviewing the last 5 periods (P34-P38: 117, 76, 62, 76, 102), the average demand is approximately 87 units/week. The phantom in-transit inventory remains a major issue. Currently, 'In-transit' is 1015 units. This is composed of: Period 38 order (131 units, likely valid), Period 34 order (157 units, now 5 periods old, likely lost), Period 29 order (375 units, 10 periods old, confirmed lost), and the initial Spring/Summer losses (P1-P7, P24, P26 etc., totaling ~352 units). Total confirmed phantom inventory is ~727 units (277 + 75 + 375). If P34 (157 units) is also lost, the phantom count reaches 884. To allow the OR backend to place an order, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed (On-hand + Valid Pipeline). On-hand is 48. Valid Pipeline is likely just the P38 order (131). Target base stock for a lead time of 2 should be (1+2)*87 = 261. However, since the backend subtracts the total pipeline (1015) from the base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the ~884 units of deadweight. Setting explicit mu_hat to 1100 to ensure a small replenishment order is triggered, as current stock (48) is low relative to recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative phantom in-transit inventory updated to 884 units (Spring losses 277, Summer losses 75, P29 loss 375, and now P34 loss 157). P34 is 5 periods overdue with no arrival. Current demand regime stabilized at ~87 units/week. mu_hat requires heavy inflation to bypass the 1015 units of technically 'in-transit' but physically lost stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has stabilized in a 'post-fall cooling' regime, with a recent three-period average of approximately 74 units (P37: 76, P38: 102, P39: 43). The cumulative phantom in-transit inventory (units that are technically in the pipeline but physically lost) is now estimated at 1041 units. This total comprises the historical Spring losses (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7: 277 units), Summer losses (P24, P26: 56 units), and significant recent losses: P29 (375 units, 11 periods overdue), P34 (157 units, 6 periods overdue), and P35 (ordered 265, but P36 conclude shows arrived=265, so P35 is resolved; however P29 and P34 are clearly lost). The in-transit total of 1116 includes these 277+56+375+157=865 units, plus more recent orders. Specifically, the 'in-transit' figure is likely dominated by these 865+ dead units. To trigger a new order and maintain stock for the current ~74 units/week demand, I must inflate mu_hat to exceed this pipeline deadweight. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 1250 (calculated as (1+L)*74 + ~1000 phantom units) to ensure the OR engine places an order despite the massive 'in-transit' balance.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Cumulative phantom in-transit inventory updated to 865 units (Spring losses 277, Summer losses 56, P29 loss 375, P34 loss 157). Demand regime remains stable at ~74 units/week. mu_hat must be heavily inflated to bypass the ~865 units of technically 'in-transit' but physically lost stock.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Noa skinny trouser' has stabilized in a post-peak cooling regime. Over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), demand has averaged 65 units/week. We are currently in mid-November, approaching the holiday season, but recent data suggests a consistent downward trend from the September peak. The most critical issue remains the massive volume of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (units that were ordered but will likely never arrive). Currently, the In-transit total is 1307 units. Based on historical data, the likely lost shipments reside in: P1, P3, P4, P5, P7 (277 units), P24, P26 (56 units), P29 (375 units), and P34 (157 units), totaling 865 lost units. This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat (the target base stock) to a value that exceeds the phantom inventory plus needed operating stock. Calculating required stock: (1+L) periods of demand = 3 * 65 \u2248 195. Total mu_hat needed = 865 (phantom offset) + 195 (operating stock) = 1060. I will use 'explicit' to ensure this threshold is met. Lead time is set to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P35, P37) have been efficient.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Consolidated phantom/lost inventory estimate is 865 units (P1-P7, P24, P26, P29, P34). Post-peak demand stabilized at ~65 units/week since P36. mu_hat requires a minimum floor of ~1060 units to overcome pipeline blockage and maintain safety stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25. History shows a major 'phantom inventory' issue: while In-transit is 1206 units, a significant portion (estimated 865 units from P1-P7, P24, P26, P29, P34) is effectively lost and will not arrive. This 'deadweight' prevents the backend from ordering. To maintain stock for the current demand regime (~65 units/week), mu_hat must be inflated to bypass this inventory. With L=2, the required base stock is (1+2)*65 = 195 units + safety stock. Given the 1206 units in-transit (where ~865 are lost), the effective pipeline is ~341 units. To force an order and maintain a buffer, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1100. This should overcome the 1206 in-transit minus the 42 on-hand to trigger necessary replenishment as demand late in the year (approaching December) typically sees a slight uplift or stabilization before year-end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $798.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Noa skinny trouser' has entered a late-fall surge, likely driven by Black Friday and upcoming December seasonality, as seen in the Period 42 spike (182 units). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The central challenge remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 865 units (from periods P1-P7, P24, P26, P29, and P34) which haven't arrived and are likely lost. The OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock. Therefore, to ensure a new order is triggered, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than the current in-transit (1206) plus the required safety stock for the current demand regime. I estimate the current demand regime around 100-120 units/week given the recent spike. Setting mu_hat to 1400 (Explicit) creates a buffer that overcomes the 1206 'in-transit' blockage and reflects the seasonal demand increase. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 150 to account for high volatility seen in the recent 182-unit spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed holiday/Black Friday demand spike in P42 (182 units). Persistent phantom in-transit inventory remains at 865 units (P1-P7, P24, P26, P29, P34), requiring continued heavy inflation of mu_hat to ensure replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1769.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand includes a confirmed holiday spike (182 units) during Black Friday/Cyber Monday week (P42), followed by a moderate cooling (98 units) in P43. Given the current date (Dec 9th), we are still in the peak holiday season. The demand regime from P36-P43 (ignoring the P42 outlier) averages ~75 units. However, we must account for the substantial 'phantom' in-transit inventory that has accumulated due to historical supply chain failures. Based on carry-over insights, orders P1, P3, P4, P5, P7, P24, P26, P29, and P34 are functionally lost. Summing these lost orders: P1-7 (277 units) + P24/26 (approx 56) + P29 (375) + P34 (157) = 865 units. Current In-transit is 1456, but only about 591 units (1456 - 865) are likely to arrive. The OR policy subtracts the full 1456 from the base stock. To maintain a safety stock that covers the holiday mean (~110 units/week including spikes) across L+1=3 weeks, the base stock objective is roughly 330 units. To trigger this order despite 865 units of pipeline deadweight, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1195. I will use 1200 to ensure replenishment occurs.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Confirmed Black Friday spike in P42 (182 units) and subsequent holiday demand baseline of ~98 units. Cumulative phantom in-transit inventory persists at approximately 865 units (P1-P7, P24, P26, P29, P34), requiring base stock inflation to offset pipeline blockage.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019 (Period 45). Demand is currently in the holiday peak, with the last 3 periods showing 182, 98, and 154 units respectively (average ~145). The supply chain remains deeply problematic with a significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory. As of P45, there are 1456 units technically in-transit. Based on historical data, this includes 865 units from clearly lost shipments (P1-P7, P24, P26, P29, P34). Additionally, the P43 order of 441 units is not yet arrived (promised L=2, should arrive during P45 and be visible in P46). The on-hand inventory is 0. To ensure replenishment for the remaining holiday demand and bypass the OR engine's pipeline inventory deduction (which subtracts the 1456 units), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order. The target base stock should cover approximately 2-3 periods of holiday demand (~450 units) plus the 1456 units of pipeline deadweight. I will set mu_hat to 1950 to ensure the policy attempts to order roughly 500 units to reach a functional safety stock level.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Holiday demand peak confirmed with late-Nov/early-Dec average of ~145 units/week. Cumulative phantom in-transit inventory (lost shipments) estimated at 865 units. Supply chain remains unreliable with sporadic 1-3 period lead times and high loss rates.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23, leading into the final week of the year. Demand reflects a holiday seasonal peak, with recent samples (P42-P45) of 182, 98, 154, and 133 units. The 4-week average is ~142 units. Supply chain blockage remains a critical issue: the in-transit inventory of 1681 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom' stock. Based on carry-over history, estimated lost shipments include: P1, P3, P4, P5, P7 (277 units), P24, P26 (56 units), P29 (375 units), and P34 (157 units). Total estimated phantom inventory is 865 units. However, looking at P46's in-transit of 1681, subtracting the recent P45 order (666) leaves 1015 units. This suggests P43 (441 arrived) and P44 (0 ordered) are accounted for, but 1015 units are effectively stuck/lost. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order for the end-of-year/January transition, mu_hat must be inflated to offset this 1015-unit pipeline deadweight. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L)*142 + 1015 \u2248 1441 units. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P41, P43, P45) show lead times of 2, 3, and 2 periods respectively, averaging near the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Pipeline blockage confirmed at 1015 units (calculated as current In-transit 1681 minus last period's order 666). This stock is comprised of long-term losses from Spring, Summer, and early Fall (P1-P34). mu_hat requires inflation of +1015 units to bypass this pipeline deadweight.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are in the post-holiday sales period. Recent demand (P44-P46) shows a peak followed by a decline [154, 133, 75]. The 'Noa skinny trouser' likely experiences a drop after the holiday season. The 'In-transit' inventory is 1681 units. Removing the last order from P45 (666 units), we have 1015 units that have been in-transit for many periods and are functionally lost (phantom inventory). To ensure the OR engine places a replenishment order for the current demand regime despite the 1015-unit pipeline blockage, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + 1015). Given current demand averaging ~110 units/week over the last 3 periods and the likely January slowdown, a target base stock of ~330 (3 weeks of supply) is appropriate. Therefore, mu_hat = 330 + 1015 = 1345. Maintaining sigma_hat at recent 5-period volatility to account for the holiday-to-post-holiday transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Static phantom inventory (lost shipments) confirmed at 1015 units (P1-P40 range). Post-holiday demand regime shift detected: demand dropped from 133 (P45) to 75 (P46), indicating the end of the seasonal peak. mu_hat requires a +1015 offset to bypass pipeline blockage.
