  "rationale": "(a) Product: Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics). Date: Feb 11, 2019. This is a basic apparel item. Historically, demand started at 0 in early Jan and climbed significantly to 38 by Feb 4. This reflects early spring stocking/shopping as winter ends. (b) Demand Analysis: Historical samples (0, 0, 11, 17, 38) show a sharp upward trend. The most recent observation (Feb 4) was 38. Given it's mid-February, I expect demand to sustain or continue increasing slightly as we approach spring. (c) Lead Time: Promised L=2. Since this is Period 1, no arrivals have been observed yet. I must plan for demand in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 coverage). (d) Inventory: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. (e) Order Logic: Based on the upward trend (average of non-zero weeks is ~22, but the most recent is 38), I'll forecast demand around 35-40 per period. To cover Periods 1, 2, and 3, I need approximately 110-120 units. Ordering 115 ensures I start meeting demand as soon as the lead time allows.",

However, actual simulation demand in P1 (54) and P2 (100) indicates a significant upward regime shift, likely due to the approach of spring/summer seasons where demand for basic tees increases. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2. The P1 order of 115 is expected to arrive during P3 (visible in P4 start), and the P2 order of 100 in P4 (visible in P5 start). Using a conservative move towards the new demand level (averaging ~80-100), I need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Current pipeline (215) covers roughly 2-2.5 weeks at the recent 100-unit demand rate.

However, starting Period 1 (Feb 11), there has been a significant surge: P1=54, P2=100, P3=113. This indicates a transition into the spring season where demand for short-sleeved basic t-shirts typically climbs. Historically, promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed: P1=115 (expected arrival P3/P4), P2=100 (expected P4/P5), P3=120 (expected P5/P6). As of P4 start, P1's order has NOT appeared in the P3 conclude message. Based on 'Lead Time Definition', an order placed in P1 arrives during P3 and its arrival is only visible at the start of P5 (P4 conclude). Therefore, we have zero on-hand and 335 in-transit. Since demand is currently averaging ~100-115 and trending up, and the replenishment cycle (L+1) is 3 periods, I need to cover approximately 350-400 units. I have 335 in pipeline.

Looking at the lead time, the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2), consistent with the promise.

Given we are in mid-March, demand for basic t-shirts is likely to remain steady or slightly increase as spring progresses. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Looking at history: P2 order (100 units) arrived in P4 conclude (lead_time=2). The P1 order (115 units) has NOT arrived as of P5 conclude; it should have arrived in P3. This indicates the P1 order is likely lost. The P3 order (120 units) was due in P5 but did not arrive (arrived=0 in P5 conclude), though it might just be delayed. Inventory status: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 455 units (comprised of P1: 115 [likely lost], P3: 120 [overdue/delayed], P4: 120, P5: 100). If we assume P1 is lost and P3 is delayed, my effective pipeline is ~220-340 units. Current demand average is roughly 80 units/period. Over a 3-period window (L+1), I need ~240 units. Since I have 0 on-hand and significant uncertainty regarding the arrival of the 455 units in-transit, I will place a moderate order to bridge the gap while waiting for the pipeline to clear, assuming at least one of the large in-transit orders arrives this period (P6).",

Lead times for recently successful orders (P30, P32, P33) have confirmed a shift from the promised 2 periods to an actual 3 periods. The 'In-transit' balance of 1325 units is largely composed of confirmed dead inventory (1295 units from historical losses: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P26, P29). Valid pipeline inventory includes the 30 units ordered in Period 34, which, given the 3-period lead time, is expected to arrive in the current Period 39 (visible in P40). Current on-hand inventory is 38 units. With three periods of coverage needed (L+1=4 periods) and a demand floor of ~20 units/period, the total requirement is approximately 80 units. On-hand (38) + expected arrival (30) = 68 units. Although there is a small gap (12 units), the demand is trending downward and the holding cost ($1) equals the profit margin ($1), making overstocking more risky than minor stockouts as the game nears its end (P47). Therefore, I will not place an order this period.",

Excluding these, the effective pipeline is zero. However, current on-hand inventory is 18 units, which covers approximately 1.5 periods of the current 10-12 unit demand regime.
