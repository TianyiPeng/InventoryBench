This is a staple product with relatively stable demand, though it may see slight increases as spring approaches in the Northern Hemisphere. b) Demand Analysis: Historical data from Jan/Feb 2019 shows a mean demand of 59.2 units/week (61, 71, 61, 52, 51). There is a slight downward trend in the last two weeks, settling around 50-52 units. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed now (P1) are expected to arrive in P3. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current inventory is 0 and there are no orders in transit. e) Order Logic: To avoid stockouts while accounting for the lead time (L=2), I need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 periods). Total coverage needed = 3 periods * ~60 units/period = 180 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will order 180 units to establish the pipeline and meet immediate and near-term demand.",

The 180 units ordered in Period 1 are expected to arrive in Period 3 (2-period lead: P1+2=P3). d) Inventory Assessment: Current On-hand is 0. Demand for Period 1 was unfilled due to 0 stock.

Pipeline (In-transit) is 180, which covers nearly 2 weeks of demand once it arrives in P3. e) Final Order Logic: I am currently stocked out and will remain stocked out for Period 2.

Current inventory is 0, and I have 300 units in transit (180 ordered P1, 120 ordered P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods.

I currently have 300 units in the pipeline. However, given that I am currently out of stock and have missed sales for two periods, and to account for potential demand variability as spring approaches, I will place a small order of 50 units. This ensures that even if Period 5 demand increases or the P1 shipment is delayed/lost, I have a buffer.

However, following the sequence logic: an order placed in Period 1 with lead_time=2 arrives during Period 3 and is reported in Period 3 conclude. Since Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, the Period 1 order (scheduled for Period 3) is either delayed or the lead time is longer than 2. If it arrives in Period 4, lead time is 3. Current In-transit is 350 (180 from P1, 120 from P2, 50 from P3). I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods.

Ordering to satisfy the remaining 8 periods is risky due to holding costs ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($19/unit). I will place a small order of 50 units to cover the immediate 3-period horizon (L+1) plus safety stock, acknowledging that the season for this item has effectively ended.",

Estimated total demand for the remainder of the game (Periods 41-47) at the current rate of 16/period is approximately 112 units. We have 50 units in the pipeline for Period 42 (P40 order). To cover the remaining requirement (112 - 50 = 62 units) and ensure a small buffer, I will order 70 units today.
