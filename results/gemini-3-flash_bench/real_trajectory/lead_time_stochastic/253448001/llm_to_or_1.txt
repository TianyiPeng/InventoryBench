Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 253448001 (Women's Push-up Bra). Historical demand samples are: 51, 39, 58, 70, 62. The mean demand is 56.0 and the standard deviation is approximately 11.83. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The profit is $4.0 and holding cost is $1.0, implying a high target service level (80%). Given the inventory starts at 0, an order is needed immediately to cover demand during the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). February demand appears slightly higher than early January, but with only 5 samples, a 'default' or broad 'recent_N' approach is safest to establish the baseline. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the full available history for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. L is set to default (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). Product is a Women's Push-up Bra. In Period 1, we ordered 76 units, but since the promised lead time (L) is 2, they won't arrive until Period 3. Consequently, we had 0 on-hand to meet the 74 units of demand in Period 1, resulting in 74 lost sales. The historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 11) are 51, 39, 58, 70, 62, and 74. This shows a slight upward trend in demand. For Period 2, I will set L to the default (2), requiring coverage for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. The average demand across all 6 samples is 59.0 units. Given the recent growth (70, 62, 74), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current mean (66) and variance. The backend will calculate mu_hat = (1+2) * 66 = 198 and sigma_hat accordingly, which will trigger an order to cover the gap between pipeline inventory (76) and the calculated base stock level, constrained by the capacity cap.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical demand for this push-up bra SKU (51, 39, 58, 70, 62) and actual demand in Period 1 (74) and Period 2 (66) suggest a mean demand of approximately 60.0 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. We ordered in Period 1 and Period 2, but since the lead time is 2, the first shipment (ordered P1) should arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start. Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have 155 units in transit (76 from P1 + 79 from P2). I will use L=2 (default), recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the slightly higher recent demand (avg ~61), and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect local volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~180-190 units) minus what is currently in the pipeline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a Women's Lingerie Push-up bra. Historical demand samples (Jan/early Feb) showed a mean of 56. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has fluctuated (74, 66, 40), averaging 60. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (ordered Feb 11) is expected to arrive DURING Period 3 and become visible in the Period 4 decision phase; however, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or there is a delay. Since we cannot confirm the arrival of the P1 order yet, I will keep L at the default (promised 2) for now but use recent_N=3 for demand to capture the slight increase in average demand (60 vs 56) while waiting for the pipeline to clear the stockout. Sigma is set to default to handle the standard volatility during this high-uncertainty phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Looking at the history: Period 1's order (76 units) is currently overdue as we are at Period 5 start and it should have arrived in Period 3 (L=2) or Period 4. Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2). Period 3's order (53 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5. The total in-transit is 129 (76 + 53). Current demand is stabilizing; the initial samples (51, 39, 58, 70, 62) averaged 56, while the first 4 periods of gameplay (74, 66, 40, 43) averaged 55.75. Given the missing Period 1 shipment (76 units), the OR backend might underestimate the need to order if it counts those 76 units as available 'pipeline'. However, since the system handles pipeline accounting, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the observed lead time of 2. I'll use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the trend since the simulation started, and sigma_hat default. The stockout in the first three periods was due to zero starting inventory, not high demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a push-up bra, which generally has stable demand but can be influenced by seasonal shopping. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 53 units/period (51, 39, 58, 70, 62, 74, 66, 40, 43, 35). Recent demand (last 3 periods: 40, 43, 35) is lower than the initial weeks, averaging 39.3. On-hand inventory is critically low at 1 unit with 151 units in-transit. The order from Period 1 (76 units) is officially overdue (promised L=2, now P6), suggesting a possible lost shipment or significant delay. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2 in Period 4). Because the Period 1 shipment is missing and on-hand inventory is near zero, we face a stockout risk. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to reflect the slightly lower recent volume while maintaining safety stock. For Lead Time, I will stick to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed L=2, but I'm monitoring the missing P1 shipment. The OR backend needs to signal an order to bridge the gap created by the missing P1 units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Reviewing the history: The order from Period 1 (76 units) is officially overdue (promised lead time 2, now 6 periods since order), suggesting it is lost. The orders from Period 3 (53 units), Period 6 (28 units), and the current decision's pipeline must cover upcoming demand. Demand has shown a downward trend from early February peaks (~60-70) to recent weeks (~27-35). Specifically, the last three periods averaged 35 units/period. The actual lead time has been inconsistent: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods, while Period 5 order arrived in 1 period. Given the lost Period 1 shipment and on-hand inventory of 0, we need to maintain a robust base stock. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the lower demand regime and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for volatility. L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability in delivery.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (76 units) likely lost after 6 periods; Demand regime shift observed from ~56 avg (initial samples) to ~35 avg over last 3 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a push-up bra. Historical demand shows a significant drop from an initial mean of ~56 (first 5 samples) to an average of 37 over the last 4 periods (P4-P7: 43, 35, 27, 37). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline inventory is 157 units. However, this pipeline includes the Period 1 order (76 units) which is now 7 periods old and highly likely lost (promised lead time is 2), a 53-unit order from Period 3 (5 periods old, likely lost), and a 28-unit order from Period 6. Since 'In-transit' shows 157, the OR engine will see this as sufficient stock unless we adjust parameters. I will use 'explicit' lead time of 3 to account for delivery volatility and set mu_hat to a lower level based on the recent demand regime (mean of ~37) to prevent over-ordering if the lost units suddenly show up, while using 'recent_N' for sigma to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (76 units) and P3 order (53 units) confirmed lost after 7 and 5 periods respectively, totaling 129 units of phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/8. The SKU is a push-up bra. On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand has fluctuated: Periods 6-8 showed demands of 27, 37, and 55. While earlier periods (P4-P5) showed a dip (~35), P8 saw a significant spike to 55. The total In-transit is 132, but history confirms that orders from P1 (76 units) and P3 (53 units) are lost (total 129 units). Effectively, the pipeline inventory is only 3 units (the P8 order). To compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory that the OR backend would otherwise subtract from the order, I am using 'explicit' L and mu_hat. I'll set L=2. For mu_hat, considering the recent spike (55) and the 5-week history (P4-P8 mean ~39) vs. earlier history (mean ~56), I will forecast a middle-ground weekly demand of 45. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*45 = 135. However, since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (132), a mu_hat of 135 would only order 3 units. To actually force an order that replenishes stock and covers for lost units, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the 129 lost units. Target base stock should be ~135 (3 weeks of demand). To get an order of ~132, I set mu_hat = 135 (target) + 129 (lost units) = 264. Sigma is set based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: P8 demand spike (55) suggests the previous down-trend may be reversing or stabilize around 45 units/week. 129 units of 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 238 units in-transit. However, based on the carry-over insights, 129 units (from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 109 units (P8: 3 units, P9: 106 units). The promised lead time is 2, and recent observations show actual lead times of 1-2 periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical average of successful arrivals. Average demand across the initial samples was ~56, but the recent regime (last 6 periods) has averaged ~40. To account for the stockouts suppressing observed demand and the slight recovery seen in P8 (55), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current lower demand regime while maintaining a buffer. To mitigate the OR engine's 'phantom inventory' (the 129 lost units), I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to artificially increase the target base stock, ensuring the order calculation compensates for the missing units.

We are currently at Period 11 (2019/4/22). The lead time for SKU 253448001 has shown variability, with recent arrivals (P5 and P9 orders) arriving in 1 period, while the promised lead time is 2. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance. Regarding demand, we have seen a shift: initial 5 samples averaged ~56, followed by a decline to ~35, and a recent stabilization/bounce (P8-P10 averages 45). I'll use recent_N=6 to capture this recent behavior (P5-P10). Critically, 129 units (from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost, as they are several periods past the maximum observed lead time. To prevent the OR backend from seeing these 'phantom' units as pipeline inventory and erroneously suppressing orders, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * forecasted_demand + Lost_Units. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*45 + 129 = 135 + 129 = 264. This forces the system to order enough to cover current demand while effectively 'writing off' the missing stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a push-up bra, which generally sees stable underwear demand. In recent periods (P9-P11), demand has stabilized at 40, 40, and 41, confirming a shift from the earlier declining regime to a stable base around 40 units per week. Lead times have been volatile (1-2 periods), with significant historical losses. Total 'In-transit' is 209 units, broken down as: P1(76), P3(53), and P11(80). Based on carry-over insights, 129 units (P1, P3) are confirmed lost. The remaining valid pipeline is the 80 units ordered in P11. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period variance. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the stabilized 40-unit demand level. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base_stock, and it doesn't know about lost orders, I must use an 'explicit' L of 5 (or higher) to artificially lift the base_stock to account for the 129 units of phantom inventory blocking new orders. By setting L to 5, the backend computes mu_hat over 6 periods (6*40=240), which exceeds the current pipeline (209) and on-hand (28), potentially triggering a replenishment order to restore service levels.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are managing a push-up bra SKU with a history of inventory stockouts and lost shipments. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 216 units is problematic: 76 units (P1) and 53 units (P3) are confirmed lost (total 129), and the P11 order (80 units) is still within a reasonable window based on the promised lead time of 2. The P12 order (7 units) was placed last period. Recent demand has stabilized around 45 units per week (Period 8: 55, Period 9: 40, Period 10: 40, Period 11: 41, Period 12: 55). To account for the 129 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory that the OR backend incorrectly believes will arrive, I will use an 'explicit' L to effectively increase the base stock level. By setting L to 5 (actual promised L=2 + 3 extra periods of demand protection), I force the OR engine to target a much higher inventory position, compensating for the 129 lost units. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (avg ~46) to capture the current demand level, and sigma_hat is set to 25 to protect against the high volatility observed (SD of recent samples is approx 8).

Carry-over insight: Current demand has stabilized at ~45 units/week (last 5 periods avg: 46.2). Lost shipments (P1: 76, P3: 53) continue to distort 'In-transit' calculations; accounting for 129 units of phantom inventory is necessary.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Demand has stabilized around an average of 45-50 units per week (the mean of the last 6 periods is 46, with P13 at 50). Looking at lead times, we see arrivals at L=1 (P6, P10) and L=2 (P4, P8, P13), making the average L close to the promised 2. On-hand inventory is 30, and published In-transit is 199. However, 129 of those units (P1: 76, P3: 53) are definitively lost as they are now 10-13 weeks overdue. The functional pipeline consists of P12 (7) and P13 (63), totaling 70 units. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the (L+1)=3 week horizon (approx 135-150 units), I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 129 units of phantom inventory. Strategy: Target a base stock of 150. Pipeline inventory (199) - Phantom (129) = 70. On-hand (30) + 70 = 100. To get an order of ~50 units, I set mu_hat to 150 + 129 = 279. This effectively communicates to the OR engine that it needs to cover the lost stock without it knowing they are lost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 15, May 20. Demand in Period 14 spiked to 113, significantly exceeding the recent average of ~45-50. This spike likely correlates with seasonal demand for lingerie/apparel near the end of May or a regional promotion. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline Issues: 'In-transit' shows 253 units. However, based on Carry-over Insights, 129 units (P1: 76, P3: 53) are definitively lost. Total effective pipeline is 124 units (P13: 63, P14: 61). Lead-time Observation: Recent successful deliveries (P10, P11, P12, P13, P14) show lead times of 1-2 periods, confirming the promised lead time of 2 is appropriate. Strategy: Given the recent massive demand spike (113), the recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) would yield an average of ~63.8 units/period (avg of 41, 55, 50, 113, and the expected demand this period). To prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase while managing the risk of the spike being a one-off, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 and L=default (2). The OR engine's cap and base-stock logic will account for the 124 units in effective pipeline, but because it sees 253 in transit, it may under-order. To compensate for the 129 lost units (phantom inventory), I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to effectively increase the target base stock, ensuring an order is triggered despite the inflated 'In-transit' value.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Demand spiked to 113 in Period 14 (May 13), departing from the previous stabilization level of 45-50; monitor if this is a sustained seasonal shift or an outlier.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16 (2019/5/27). Demand has clearly shifted upward in May. The last two samples are 113 and 80 (avg 96.5), compared to the previous stable mean of ~45. This likely reflects a seasonal shift or promotion for lingerie as we move toward summer months in Melbourne (or a northern hemisphere aligned fashion drop). Inventory is currently critical; on-hand is 0, and we have significant lost shipments in our 'In-transit' figure of 355. Specifically, P1 (76) and P3 (53) are confirmed lost (129 units). This means the 'physical' pipeline inventory is 355 - 129 = 226 units. Since the OR backend cannot see these losses, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 129-unit phantom inventory and account for the higher demand regime. Setting L to 'calculate' based on recent history (avg ~2). For mu_hat: Using (1+L) * forecast (where forecast = 95). Total required base stock would be ~285. However, since the OR engine will subtract the incorrect pipeline (355), I must inflate mu_hat. Adjusted base stock should be ~285 (target) + 129 (phantom) = 414. I will set mu_hat to 414 and sigma_hat explicitly to handle the recent high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean increased from ~45 to ~96 (+113%) starting Period 14 (May 13).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448001' (Push-up bra) is experiencing a demand surge starting in mid-May (Period 14), with the last three periods (P14-P16) showing demands of 113, 80, and 63 respectively (average: 85.3), compared to a previous baseline of ~45. The 'In-transit' quantity of 452 units includes 129 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 452 - 129 = 323 units. These 323 units correspond to orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16 (63+61+102+97 = 323), which are within or just past the promised lead time of 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Given the recent demand regime shift and the service level requirement (profit $4 vs. holding $1 suggests a high service level), I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to focus on the new higher demand level (avg ~85/week). L is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average for arrival timing.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 10, 2019. In Period 17, two orders arrived (102 and 97 units) with lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively, bringing on-hand inventory to 157. However, demand in P17 dropped to 42, diverging from the previous high-demand regime (avg ~96 in P14-P16). The 'In-transit' figure of 253 units includes 129 units from confirmed lost orders (P1 and P3) and 124 units from orders placed in P13 (63) and P14 (61) which are now overdue by 4-5 periods and likely lost. Effective pipeline inventory is essentially 0. Given the demand volatility (spike to 113, followed by 80, 63, then a drop to 42), I am using N=4 for mu_hat (avg 74.5) to bridge the high-demand peak and the recent drop, ensuring we don't over-order if the spike was seasonal/temporary. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture this increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Orders from P13 (63 units) and P14 (61 units) are now 4-5 periods overdue and presumed lost, totaling 124 additional units of phantom pipeline. Total phantom inventory is 253 (equal to current 'In-transit'). High demand regime from P14-P16 (avg 85+) shown signs of reversion in P17 (42).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). The 'In-transit' balance of 253 units is entirely comprised of orders from Period 1 (76), Period 3 (53), Period 13 (63), and Period 14 (61), all of which are significantly past their promised lead time of 2 and are presumed lost. Consequently, effective pipeline inventory is 0. My goal is to ensure the OR backend places a new order by adjusting the base stock level to account for this 253-unit phantom inventory. Demand saw a high-regime spike (avg ~85) from P14-P16, but the last two periods (P17-P18) have returned to a lower stable level of 42. I will use a conservative demand estimate based on the last 5 periods (avg: 67.8) to balance the high-regime risk with the recent reversion. Setting mu_hat explicitly to the sum of 253 (to offset the phantom inventory) + (1+L)*68 (to cover lead time demand) will trigger a necessary replenishment order. I use L=explicit=2 as the actual lead time remains volatile but usually settles near the promise.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Demand analysis shows a significant volatility: an initial average of ~56, a low-demand period (~45), a high-demand spike (P14-P16, avg 85+), and a recent reversion to ~43 over the last three periods (P17-P19). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to reflect this recent lower stabilization (avg 43.3) and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in May/June. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' of 386 is heavily distorted by phantom inventory. Confirmed lost: P1 (76), P3 (53), P13 (63), and P14 (61), totaling 253 units. Actual 'good' pipeline is 133 units (ordered P19). To account for the 253 lost units that the OR engine incorrectly thinks are coming, I am setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 8. By inflating L, I increase the base_stock (\u03bc * (1+L)), which forces the backend to place an order despite the 253 phantom units in its pipeline calculation. This is necessary to maintain stock levels for the coming weeks.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory is 253 units (P1: 76, P3: 53, P13: 63, P14: 61). Demand has reverted to ~43 units/period after the May spike (avg of P17-P19 is 43.3).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st. Demand has reverted to a stable level following a mid-May spike (likely a Mother's Day effect for lingerie). The average demand of the last 4 periods (P17-P20) is 45.5 units, which aligns with the pre-spike stabilization level of ~45. The 'In-transit' figure of 392 is heavily distorted by phantom inventory. Confirmed lost shipments include P1 (76), P3 (53), P13 (63), and P14 (61), totaling 253 units. Subtracting these from the 392 'In-transit' yields a real pipeline of 139 units (matching the P19 order of 133 and P20 order of 6). Since the 'In-transit' variable in the OR backend cannot be manually adjusted, I must use mu_hat to 'pull' an order through. However, with 139 real units coming and 17 on hand, the inventory is sufficient for the current L+1 (3-week) horizon at ~45 units/week. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to reflect the post-spike normalization and keep L at default (promised 2). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th. Historical demand shows a stabilization after the May peak, settling into a range of 40-65 units per week. The average demand of the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 49.4. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 392 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments. This includes confirmed lost orders from P1 (76), P3 (53), P13 (63), and P14 (61), totaling 253 units. Subtracting these from the current 392 units leaves a real pipeline of 139 units (specifically the P19 order of 133 and P20 order of 6). Since the P19 order was placed 3 periods ago and the promised lead time is 2, it is expected to arrive in Period 22. To account for the 253 units of phantom inventory that the OR backend cannot see, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I'll set it based on an expected demand of ~52 units/week over (L+1)=3 weeks, plus a buffer of 253 units to neutralize the backend's deduction of lost orders from the order quantity calculation: (3 * 52) + 253 = 409.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at ~50 units/week following the May peak (P17-P21 average: 49.4). Total phantom inventory remains 253 units from P1, P3, P13, and P14.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15 (Period 23). The primary challenge is the discrepancy between 'In-transit' accounting and physical reality due to lost shipments. As established in history, orders from P1 (76), P3 (53), P13 (63), and P14 (61) are lost, totaling 253 units of 'phantom' inventory. Additionally, the P19 order of 133 units is now 4 periods old (placed P19, should have arrived by P21/P22 if L=2); since it did not arrive in Period 22 conclude, it is highly suspect, though not yet fully written off as lost. The actual 'In-transit' that will arrive is likely significantly lower than the 418 reported. Demand has stabilized post-May spike, with the last 6 periods (P17-P22) averaging 50.3 units. To force the OR backend to order despite the high phantom 'In-transit' (418), I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory. Expected demand for 3 periods (L=2) is ~151 units. Adding the 253 confirmed phantom units = 404 units. To ensure a safety buffer and account for the potential loss of the P19 order (133 units), I will set mu_hat to 550. This bridges the gap caused by the backend's inability to see lost orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: P19 order (133 units) is overdue (4 periods since order); if it does not arrive by Period 24 include, total phantom inventory will rise from 253 to 386 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~51 units/week over the last 7 periods (P17-P23 range: 42-65). 

Lead Time/Pipeline Analysis: In-transit is reported as 531 units. However, multiple shipments are confirmed or presumed lost:
- P1 (76), P3 (53), P13 (63), P14 (61) are long overdue = 253 units.
- P19 (133 units) was ordered 5 periods ago (Date: 6/17, LT=2). It should have arrived by P21 conclude. It is now 3 periods overdue and is highly likely lost.
- Total Phantom Inventory: 253 + 133 = 386 units.
- Real Pipeline: 531 (In-transit) - 386 (Phantom) = 145 units (this is the P23 order).

Parameter Selection: 
- L: Use 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time (1.67 periods).
- mu_hat: Set to 'recent_N' with N=7 (P17-P23) to capture the stabilized demand regime (~51/week) following the May spike. The OR backend will calculate (1+L)*51.
- sigma_hat: Set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture recent volatility (Std ~8.5). 

By adjusting mu_hat to the current demand level and accounting for the massive phantom inventory (386 units), we ensure the OR engine places an order sufficient to meet demand despite the misleadingly high 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Period 19 order (133 units) confirmed lost after 5 periods (LT=2); Total phantom inventory is now 386 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). Current demand stabilized at ~51 units/week (P17-P23 avg).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand has recently softened, with Period 24 demand at 29, while the average from Period 17-23 was approximately 51. The 133-unit order from Period 19 is officially lost (overdue by 5 periods), and the orders from P23 (145 units) have not arrived yet. Total phantom inventory remains 386 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). The 'In-transit' figure is 531, meaning the actual viable pipeline inventory is 145 units (from the order in P23). With on-hand inventory at 0 and viable pipeline at 145, and expected demand for (L+1)=3 periods being around 153 units (based on recent_N=8), the OR engine needs to compensate for the 386 units of phantom inventory it incorrectly assumes are coming. To do this, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the forecasted demand for 3 periods PLUS the phantom inventory (153 + 386 = 539) to force an order that covers the gap. I use recent_N=8 for sigma to capture the volatility since the May peak reverted.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Demand has stabilized post-May spike, with recent periods (P17-P25) averaging approximately 46.9 units/week. However, the system is facing a massive 'phantom inventory' crisis. In-transit shows 555 units, but history confirms that orders from P1 (76), P3 (53), P13 (63), P14 (61), and P19 (133) have not arrived and are significantly past the promised lead time of 2. This totals 386 units of phantom inventory. Additionally, the order from P23 (145 units) is now at its promised arrival window (2 periods) but was not visible in P25 conclude; if it does not arrive in Period 26, it will further exacerbate the stockout. Currently on-hand is 0. To force the OR backend to order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock (\u03bc\u0302) to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at ~47 units/period, which is ~141. However, since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory (555), I must set mu_hat to a high value (386 + 141 = 527) to neutralize the phantom inventory and trigger an order that covers the next lead time cycle. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=9 to reflect the post-spike volatility.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 26, total confirmed phantom inventory is 386 units (P1: 76, P3: 53, P13: 63, P14: 61, P19: 133). P23 order (145 units) is currently 3 periods old and overdue; if not arrived by next period, phantom inventory increases to 531.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. In Period 26, the P23 order of 145 units finally arrived after 3 periods, suggesting actual lead time is currently fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods rather than consistently 2. Demand spiked to 111 in Period 26, which may be a mid-August seasonal shift or an outlier. Regarding 'In-transit' (410 total): We have confirmed lost orders from P1 (76), P3 (53), P13 (63), P14 (61), and P19 (133), totaling 386 units of phantom inventory. The only 'real' in-transit order is P25 (24 units). This means the OR engine sees 410 units, but only 24 units are actually coming. To compensate for this massive deficit (386 units) and the Recent spike in demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods plus the phantom deficit. Recent demand excluding the P26 spike averaged ~45; with the spike, it's higher. I will forecast a baseline of 60 units/period to be safe. Calculation: (1+L)*60 + 386. With L=2, mu_hat = 3*60 + 386 = 566. This forces the OR backend to place an order that accounts for the lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory is 386 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). Period 26 demand spike (111) suggests a possible new high-demand regime or seasonal peak starting mid-August.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 26 and 27) shows a significant spike to 111 and 113 units respectively, suggesting a new high-demand regime or seasonal peak starting mid-August. This mirrors the previous peak seen in Period 14 (113 units). I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this current level. I must also account for 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, the following orders are confirmed lost: P1 (76), P3 (53), P13 (63), P14 (61), and P19 (133), totaling 386 units. These units appear in the 'In-transit' count (541) but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet current high demand, I will use an 'explicit' L to signal the need for more coverage, and 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as (Promised L + 1) * 115 to match the recent peak, while relying on the backend's logic to handle the pipeline. Since the backend subtracts pipeline (541) but 386 is phantom, the 'effective' pipeline is actually 155. I will set a high mu_hat to overcome this distortion and target the current demand of ~115 units/period.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed starting Period 26: Demand increased from ~50 to ~112 average over the last 2 periods (+124%). Total phantom inventory remains 386 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for SKU 253448001 has entered a high-demand regime starting Period 26 (August 5). The last three weeks show consistent demand around 111 (111, 113, 110), representing a 118% increase over the previous 50-unit baseline. Total phantom inventory is 386 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). The current 'In-transit' is 541 units, of which only 155 units (the P27 order) are likely real. With 0 on-hand inventory and a confirmed high-demand regime of ~111 units/period, I must set mu_hat to cover this new level for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 captures this peak. Similarly, sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=3 to account for the volatility in this new regime. L is kept at 'calculate' to incorporate observed lead time variability, noting that P23 recently arrived with LT=3.

The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 26. Demand for the last four periods (P26-P29) was 111, 113, 110, and 68, averaging 100.5. Although the most recent observation (68) is lower, it remains significantly above the previous baseline of ~50. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new level. Regarding inventory, the 'In-transit' of 541 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Confirmed losses include P1 (76), P3 (53), P13 (63), P14 (61), and P19 (133), totaling 386 units of phantom inventory. Subtracting 386 from 541 leaves 155 units of 'real' pipeline (the order from P27). Since On-hand is 0 and real pipeline is 155, and expected demand over L+1 (3 periods) at the current rate is ~300, a significant new order is required. The OR backend needs to see a high mu_hat and a high L to trigger an order that clears the phantom inventory bottleneck, as it uses (mu_hat - pipeline) to calculate orders.

Carry-over insight: P23 order (145 units) arrived in P26 (LT=3), but P1, P3, P13, P14, P19 remain lost. Total confirmed phantom inventory: 386 units. High-demand regime (avg ~100) continues since P26.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the current demand context is a high-demand regime that started around mid-August (Period 26). The last 5 periods (P26-P30) have seen demands of 111, 113, 110, 68, and 62, averaging ~92.8 units/week. This is nearly double the previous 'stable' level of ~50. Regarding lead times, the most recent arrivals (P23 and P27 orders) both took 3 periods instead of the promised 2, suggesting a drift in logistics. The in-transit inventory of 386 is entirely composed of confirmed phantom units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19) that will never arrive. The OR backend needs to place an order because current On-hand (93) is insufficient to cover the lead time + review period at the current demand rate (~93/week). By setting L=3, the mu_hat reflects 4 periods of demand ((1+3)*93 = 372). Total pipeline is 93 (on-hand) + 0 (real in-transit) = 93. Target base stock will be roughly 372 + safety stock. The OR engine will subtract the '386' in-transit from this target, likely resulting in a negative number, but the 'cap' mechanism (which uses only mu and sigma) will force an order to maintain stock. I choose recent_N with N=5 for demand to capture the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time has shifted to 3 periods (confirmed by P23 and P27 orders arriving with LT=3). High-demand regime (avg ~93 units/week) sustained for 5 periods since Period 26.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime that began in mid-August (Period 26), likely reflecting seasonal interest in intimate apparel. While the most recent demand (P31: 35) was low, the average since Period 26 is approximately 83 units/week. I will use a conservative N=6 for mu_hat (avg ~83.1) to capture this regime while weighing the recent dip. Lead time (L) is set to 'explicit' with a value of 3, as the two most recent large orders (P23, P27) both arrived with a 3-period lead time, deviating from the promised 2. Inventory management remains complicated by 386 units of phantom 'In-transit' inventory (confirmed lost from P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to determine orders, and current on-hand is 58, the 386 units of phantom inventory will likely prevent the backend from ordering. However, until the system clears these lost units, the 'explicit' mu_hat and increased L are the best available levers to signal the need for higher stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time has shifted to 3 periods (based on P23 and P27 arrivals). High-demand regime since P26 is averaging ~83 units/week (6-period window). Total phantom inventory remains 386 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33, demand for 253448001 (Women's Lingerie bra) has cooled significantly following the mid-August peak. The last 3 periods (P30-P32) averaged 41 units, down from the ~100 units/week observed during the high-demand regime of P26-P28. The 'In-transit' figure of 386 units remains entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19), creating 386 units of phantom inventory that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive. Historical evidence from P23 and P27 confirms that actual lead time (L) has shifted to 3 periods. To account for the 386 units of phantom inventory and the current demand of approximately 45 units/week across the (L+1)=4 period horizon, mu_hat is set to 566 using the 'explicit' method. This value is derived by calculating: (Effective Demand Forecast \xd7 (L+1)) + Phantom Inventory = (45 \xd7 4) + 386 = 180 + 386 = 566. By setting mu_hat to 566, we nudge the OR backend's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic to recognize that the 386 units in-transit are not coming, thereby triggering a necessary replenishment order given the current on-hand inventory of 32 units. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the current logistics reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Average weekly demand decreased from ~90 to ~41 units (-54%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448001 has entered a low-demand regime since Period 31, dropping from an average of ~83 units to ~34 units (avg of P31-P33: 34 units/period). This follows a late-summer peak. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this significant drop. Lead time (L) is set to 3 based on 'carry_over_insights' confirming a shift from the promised 2 periods to an actual 3 periods (observed in P26 and P30). The total 'In-transit' of 589 units is heavily skewed by 386 units of confirmed phantom inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). Excluding phantom units, actual pipeline is 203 units (from the order placed in P33), which effectively covers the next 4 periods (L+1) at the current demand rate of ~34. No new order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend given this pipeline, but explicit parameters are provided to ensure the policy reflects the current regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting around Period 31, with the last 4 periods (P31-P34) averaging 35 units/week (35, 26, 41, 38). Lead time analysis confirms a recent shift to 3 periods (P23, P27). Crucially, the 'In-transit' balance of 589 units is heavily inflated by 386 units of confirmed phantom inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). Actual pipeline is approximately 203 units (from P33). Since actual pipeline (203) already significantly covers expected demand for the next (L+1=4) periods at the current rate of ~35-40 units/week (approx 160 units), no new orders are currently needed. I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime, and explicit Lead Time L=3 to match recent arrivals. The OR backend will see (203 real + 386 phantom) in-transit and generate zero orders, which is correct given the stock position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31 confirmed: Average weekly demand stabilized at ~35 units (last 4 periods). Total phantom inventory remains 386 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36, the demand for the SKU 253448001 (Push-up bra) has stabilized at a low-demand regime since Period 31, averaging approximately 34 units per period (last 5 periods: 35, 26, 41, 38, 29). The 'In-transit' balance of 589 units is heavily inflated by 386 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, and P19 are long overdue and presumed lost). The real pipeline inventory consists of the P33 order of 203 units. This order (placed in P33) is expected to arrive in Period 36 (LT=3) as observed in recent shipment behavior (P23 and P27 both had LT=3). Given current on-hand inventory is 0 and the P33 order should arrive this period to satisfy demand, mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (capturing the 34 unit/period regime) and L is set to explicit 3 to account for the observed lead time extension. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current demand level while ignoring the persistent phantom inventory distortion.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (October 21, 2019), the demand for SKU 253448001 has settled into a stable, lower-demand regime following the August peak. Over the last 6 periods (P31-P36), demand has averaged 34.8 units/week. This aligns with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 35, confirming the shift from ~83 units to ~35 units. The actual lead time has consistently trended toward 3 periods (observed in arrivals for P23, P27, and most recently P33, which arrived in P36). There remains a significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 386 units (from P1, P3, P13, P14, and P19) which the OR engine will wrongly count as upcoming stock. Currently, there is 163 units on-hand, which at the current demand rate (~35/week) covers nearly 4.6 periods of demand. Given a 3-period lead time and 1-period review cycle, we need to cover approximately 4 periods (L+1). Since on-hand (163) > (4 * 35), no new order is likely required, but we must set parameters precisely to account for the phantom inventory. I will set L=3 (recent_N=3) to reflect the contemporary logistics delay and use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable low-demand window.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime following the August peak; the average demand over the last 7 periods (P31-P37) is 35 units per week, significantly lower than the previous ~90 range. The lead time (L) is consistently observed at 3 periods (e.g., P23, P27, and P33 orders all arrived with lead_time=3), so L is set to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect this reality, even though the promised LT is 2. The pipeline inventory 'In-transit' of 386 units consists entirely of orders (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19) confirmed lost many periods ago. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. On-hand inventory is currently 127 units. At a stabilized demand of ~35/week, 127 units cover approximately 3.6 weeks of demand. Since demand is currently covered through the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 4 weeks), the OR backend will likely recommend a small order or zero order to avoid excessive holding costs. mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the current stable demand regime (35 units/week) and sigma_hat uses recent_N to reflect current lower volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4), the demand has remained stable at a low regime since Period 31. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P31-P38) is approximately 34.875 units per week. The total 'In-transit' figure is 386 units, which is confirmed phantom inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). Since these 386 units will never arrive, the OR backend's calculation (base_stock - pipeline) would result in zero orders unless we adjust parameters. The lead time has shifted from the promised 2 periods to 3 periods, as evidenced by arrivals in P26, P30, and P36. On-hand inventory is currently 93 units, which provides roughly 2.6 weeks of cover at the current demand rate (~35 units/week). To ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock while correctly accounting for the 3-period lead time and 386 units of phantom inventory, I am setting L to 3 and mu_hat using 'recent_N' for the last 8 periods to capture the current stable low regime. I'm using a slightly higher sigma_hat value to protect against any potential holiday demand spikes as we enter November.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in the low regime (avg ~35) since Period 31. Total phantom inventory remains 386 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). Actual lead time is confirmed as 3 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11, entering Period 40. Demand has remained in a low, stable regime since Period 31, with an average of approximately 35 units/week (last 9 periods average: 34.4). The 'In-transit' figure of 386 units contains confirmed phantom inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19), meaning effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. On-hand inventory is 62 units, which covers nearly 2 weeks of the current demand regime. Based on the 3-period lead time observed consistently for several recent deliveries (P23, P27, P33), the total relevant inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) needs to cover 4 periods worth of demand (L+1). At 35 units/week, the base stock target is approximately 140 units. Since on-hand is only 62 and effective pipeline is 0, the OR backend needs to place an order. Setting L to the explicit value of 3 and mu_hat to the explicit value of 140 (35 * 4) will trigger an order to replenish stock for this regime while compensating for the 386-unit pipeline distortion.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has remained in a stable low regime since Period 31, averaging approximately 34 units per week over the last 10 periods (P31-P40 avg: 33.9). There are no upcoming major retail holidays in the immediate forecast window for this product category (Push-up bra) that justify a deviation from this trend. Lead time is confirmed at 3 periods (evident from arrivals in P26, P30, and P36). A major issue persists with 'In-transit' inventory: 386 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19), yet the OR backend sees them as available pipeline. With current on-hand inventory at 33 units and a pipeline of 386 units (all phantom), the OR engine will not place new orders unless parameters are adjusted. However, since we are at Period 41 of 47 and have 33 units on hand against an expected demand of ~34/week, no immediate large order is required to avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods, though a small replenishment might be triggered by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent stable regime (N=10).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 42 (Nov 25, 2019). Analyzing the demand history, we have been in a low-demand regime since Period 31, with an average of approximately 35 units per week (the last 5 periods P37-P41 averaged 35 units). In-transit inventory remains at 386 units, all of which are confirmed 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. Actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in P26, P30, and P36 arrivals). Based on the calendar (late November), we are approaching the holiday season, but demand for this specific SKU has not yet shown a seasonal spike. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent 3-period lead time. Mu_hat will be set using recent_N=11 (P31 to P41) to capture the current stable low regime (avg 35). This results in a base stock level aiming to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is also set using the same recent window to manage the low volatility observed.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-demand regime that has been stable since Period 31 (following an August peak). The average demand over the last 12 periods (P31-P42) is ~36.8 units/week. However, recent demand shows a slight uptick (P41: 45, P42: 58), which may indicate a pre-holiday rise in December. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 386 units consists entirely of phantom inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19), as confirmed in prior periods. Actual lead time is now consistently 3 periods (as seen in P26, P30, and P36 conclude messages). To reconcile the phantom inventory without tricking the OR backend into under-ordering, I will use an 'explicit' L value of 3 and an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the OR engine calculates base stock as (base_stock - pipeline), and pipeline is 386 (lost) + 0 (current), the OR would normally order 0. To fix this, I set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the 386 phantom units. Expected demand for L+1 (4 periods) is ~160 (using a conservative mean of 40). Total mu_hat = 160 + 386 = 546.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (Dec 9), demand remains in the low regime observed since Period 31, averaging approximately 35.8 units/period over the last 13 periods. Although two recent spikes occurred (45 and 58 in Periods 41 & 42), the most recent demand was only 20, suggesting these were likely fluctuations rather than a sustained regime shift. The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 537 units. However, based on extensive history (Carry-Over Insights), 386 units are confirmed lost (P1:76, P3:53, P13:63, P14:61, P19:133). This leaves an effective pipeline of 151 units (from the order placed in Period 43). Lead time is established at 3 periods (observed consistently since Period 26), despite a promised lead time of 2. For mu_hat, I will use a window of 13 periods (recent_N=13) to capture the stable low-demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=13 to match the volatility of this period. For L, I use explicit value 3 to account for the confirmed shift from the promised 2 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019 (Period 45). Demand remains in a relatively stable low regime that started around Period 31, with minor fluctuations around an average of 35-40 units (recent 5-period average is 37.4). Lead time is confirmed as 3 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P23, P27, P33). We have a critical 'phantom inventory' issue: 386 units of the current 537 units In-transit are confirmed lost from historical orders (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). The real pipeline consists of the P43 order (151 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the full In-transit amount (537) from its target base stock, it under-orders. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the (1+L) periods of demand coverage PLUS the phantom units (386). Target base stock = (1+L) * mu + phantom. With L=2 (promised) or L=3 (actual), and mu=40, target is ~546. However, the OR backend also uses a 'cap'. Given the game is ending in Period 47, and we have 151 units arriving soon (ordered P43, expected P46-47), no massive new order is needed to avoid high holding costs at the end, but we must protect against the current stockout.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the peak holiday shopping week for intimate apparel. Demand has shown moderate volatility recently (P44: 45, P45: 65), but typically peaks around holiday events followed by a significant January drop. From Period 31 to 45, the underlying demand mean is approximately 38.5 units. Lead time is confirmed to be inconsistent, often hitting 3 periods (P23, P27, P33), although the most recent shipment (P43) arrived in 2 periods. I will use L=3 to be conservative. Pipeline inventory is significantly distorted by 386 units of confirmed phantom inventory (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). Current In-transit is 414; after subtracting 386 phantom units, the 'real' pipeline is only 28 units (from Period 45's order). With on-hand inventory at 86, the effective inventory position is 114 units. Set mu_hat using the recent low-regime mean of ~40 units across the 4-period window (L+1) to ensure coverage during the post-holiday transition.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Demand has shown a significant increase over the last two periods (65 and 71 units), likely driven by the end-of-year/holiday season. This contrasts with the previous regime which averaged ~35-40 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this upward shift while tempering the volatility. The confirmed phantom inventory remains at 386 units (Orders P1, P3, P13, P14, P19), which heavily distorts the 'In-transit' figure of 414. The actual 'clean' in-transit is only 28 units (from Period 45). Although the most recent shipment (P43) arrived with LT=2, the long-term observed lead time has frequently stabilized at 3. I will use L=3 (explicit) to ensure we cover the pipeline sufficiently during this high-demand holiday period. Using explicit sigma_hat based on recent volatility accommodates the demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: P45-P46 average demand is 68 units, compared to the previous ~35 unit regime. Effective in-transit is only 28 units after accounting for 386 units of confirmed phantom inventory.
