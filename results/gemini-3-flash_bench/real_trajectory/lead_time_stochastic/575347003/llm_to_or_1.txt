Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 575347003 (Basic Sneaker Socks). Historical demand across the last 5 weeks (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows an average demand of 33.8 units/week. The product is a basic staple item, and the calendar shows we are in early February, moving towards Spring/Summer where sneaker socks typically see stable or slightly increasing demand. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure we cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 weeks), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent stable consumption pattern (avg ~34 units). This results in a base stock calculation that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 7-pack of basic sneaker socks, a high-volume staple item. Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows an average of ~34 units per week. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 39 units, but zero sales occurred because we started with 0 on-hand inventory. An order of 45 units was placed in Period 1 but has not arrived yet, which is consistent with the promised lead time of 2 periods (L=2 means an order placed in P1 arrives in P3). To ensure we cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods), we need to set our parameters carefully. I will use the last 6 samples (5 historical + P1) to calculate demand. The mean is (29+28+41+40+31+39)/6 = 34.67. mu_hat should target (1+L) * 34.67 = 104. Since we have zero on-hand and 45 in-transit, the OR engine will likely place another order to reach the base stock level.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand inventory is 0 due to the 2-period promised lead time; the first order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3. Historically, demand has been: 29, 28, 41, 40, 31 (samples) and 39, 51 (observed in P1, P2). There is a slight upward trend in recent weeks compared to the early January samples. The mean of all 7 observations is ~37, but the last two periods averaged 45. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent lift (~40.4/week) and 'default' for sigma_hat. For lead time, I'll stick with 'default' as we haven't yet observed a completed delivery cycle to suggest a deviation from the promised 2 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demand (Jan-Feb) was in the 30-40 range, but recent weeks show a significant upward trend: P1=39, P2=51, P3=62. This suggests a seasonal shift as we move into spring for basic sneaker socks. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (45 units) should arrive during P3's resolution and be visible in P3's conclusion; however, the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This implies the P1 order is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. With 0 on-hand and 134 in-transit (P1:45, P2:45, P3:44), we are currently experiencing stockouts. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the accelerating demand trend (average ~51/week), which the OR backend will scale by (1+L).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is at least 3 periods (Order P1 not arrived by P3 conclude). Demand is trending upwards: P1-P3 avg 51 vs pre-game avg 34 (+50%).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/11. Analysis of 'Period 4 conclude' shows that the order from Period 2 arrived after 2 periods, fulfilling the promised lead time (L=2). This allows us to re-evaluate the 'lost/delayed' assumption from previous insights. Demand remains significantly higher than the pre-game samples (which averaged 34). The current demand mean (P1-P4) is approx 51.25, and P3 saw a peak of 62. Since current on-hand is 0 and 114 units (P1, P3, P4) are in-transit, we need robust base-stock levels to recover from stockouts. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this higher regime and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility noted in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4). Demand regime shift confirmed: P1-P4 avg 51.25 vs pre-game 33.8 (+51%).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a 7pk basic sneaker sock, a staple item. Current on-hand inventory is 0. History shows a clear demand regime shift: the pre-game average was 33.8, but the average demand since Period 1 is 49.8 (39, 51, 62, 53, 44), representing a ~47% increase. We are facing a stockout situation because demand consistently exceeds the initial inventory estimates and arrivals. Specifically, in Period 4, the Period 2 order (45 units) arrived but was immediately exhausted by demand (53 units). The Period 1 order (45 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived; according to the rules, this likely signals a lost shipment since the promised lead time is 2. The Period 3 order (44 units) was placed with L=2 and should have arrived in Period 5 resolution (visible now in P5 conclude), but it is also missing. If P1 and P3 are lost, our pipeline is thinner than the 'In-transit' number suggests. To correct for the sustained demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the ~50 avg demand per week. Given the lead time is nominally 2, but we have missing shipments, I will maintain L=2 for the calculation (L+1=3 periods of coverage) but set an explicit sigma_hat of 15 to handle the high volatility observed (std of last 5 is ~8.5, but stockout risk is high).

Carry-over insight: Suspected lost shipments for Period 1 order (45 units) and Period 3 order (44 units) as they are well past the 2-period promised lead time without arrival or conclusion.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand and 159 units in-transit. A review of history confirms that the Period 1 order (45 units) and Period 3 order (44 units) are almost certainly lost, as they are significantly past the promised (2) and observed (1-2) lead times with no conclude message. The Period 4 order (70 units) is now one period past its promised delivery date (L=2) but is likely delayed rather than lost. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime: the average demand for Periods 1-6 is 51.0, compared to the pre-game average of 33.8. Current date is March 25, moving into early spring, where basic sneaker socks typically see steady demand. To compensate for the lost stock and ensure the next order covers the gap despite the OR backend's natural bias to trust pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly based on the new demand regime (51 units/period) for the (L+1) horizon. I will use L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals show L=2 and L=1, but will monitor the P4 order closely.

Carry-over insight: Shipment Loss Confirmed: Orders from Period 1 (45 units) and Period 3 (44 units) are definitively lost. Demand regime remains stable at ~51 units/period (+50% vs baseline).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift: the average demand since the game started (Periods 1-7) is 53.1 units, compared to the pre-game average of 33.8 (+57%). Recent demand in Period 7 spiked to 66 units. Regarding logistics, shipments from Period 1 (45 units) and Period 3 (44 units) are confirmed lost, leaving a significant inventory gap. However, orders from Period 4 (70 units), Period 6 (0 units), and Period 7 (7 units) are still in the pipeline (In-transit: 166 which includes older lost units). Correcting for losses, actual in-transit units are likely 77 (70 + 7). Promised lead time is 2, and observed lead times have been 2 (P2) and 1 (P5). Given on-hand is 0 and we are missing critical stock due to lost shipments, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 55 = 165 to account for the sustained higher demand (~53-55 units/week) and ensure the OR backend orders enough to restore the service level. L is set to 'default' (2) as the physical arrival process is volatile but centered around the promise.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/04/08). History shows a significant demand surge: while P1-P4 averaged 51 units, the last two periods (P7-P8) saw demand spike to 66 and 95 (avg 80.5). This aligns with a seasonal transition into spring for '7pk basic R sneaker socks'. On-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts and previous lost shipments (P1 and P3 orders). Lead times have been unstable (observed 2, 1, 1). To rebuild stock and cover the high demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent spike (averaging approx 73 units/period). I will use L=2 (promised) as a safe buffer despite recent 1-period arrivals, as 'explicit' value for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility (std dev has increased significantly). Pipeline inventory of 172 units covers roughly 2.3 periods of this new demand level, but we must protect against further losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 7: Average increased to 80.5 from 51 (+58%) likely due to spring seasonality for sneaker socks. Lead time variability confirmed (1-2 periods).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/15. The product is '7pk basic R sneaker socks', which is entering peak spring season. Historical demand has shifted significantly: from an initial baseline of ~34 (pre-game), to ~51 (Periods 1-6), and now to ~80.5 (Periods 7-9). Last period's demand was 73. Given the product type and seasonality, I expect demand to remain in this high regime (~80). On-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline is 248 units (which includes a large order of 152 from Period 9, and 76 from the current period's calculation). Although the promised lead time is 2, arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (Period 5 arrived in 1, Period 2 in 2, Period 7 in 1). I will set L to 2 to be safe. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (approx. 80 * 3 = 240) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high for spring seasonality: Periods 7-9 avg 78 units/period (+130% vs baseline). Lead time variability persists (ranges 1-2 periods).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/04/22). The product is '7pk basic sneaker socks', which is entering peak spring seasonality. Demand history shows a clear regime shift: the average demand for Periods 7-10 is 78.75 units/period, compared to the Period 1-6 average of 51 units. Given the seasonality and the product type, I expect demand to remain at this higher level. On-hand inventory is low (8 units), but pipeline inventory is healthy at 168 (including 70 units from P4 still in transit but likely lost, and 9 units from P10). However, looking at the history, orders from P1, P3, and P4 have effectively vanished. The Period 4 order (70 units) should have arrived by Period 7 (L=2) or Period 8 (allowing for delays); since it's now Period 11 and it hasn't appeared in a 'conclude' message, I must assume it is lost. To ensure availability during the seasonal peak, I will set L to 1 (recent arrivals show lead times of 1-2 periods) and mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current high demand regime (~79 * (1+1) = 158). Sigma_hat will also be adjusted using recent_N to reflect the higher volatility in the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Period 4 order (70 units) confirmed lost. Current demand regime (sneaker socks spring peak) sustained at ~79 units/period (Periods 7-10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 29, 2019. The product is '7pk basic sneaker socks', which is currently in its spring/early summer peak season. Demand in Period 11 spiked significantly to 145 units, following a period of relative stability around 80 units (Periods 7-10). This indicates a potential further upward shift or a seasonal peak pulse. Current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory consists of 168 units: Period 10 order (9 units) and a large Period 11 order. Given the recent demand history (P7-P11: 66, 95, 73, 81, 145), the moving average is accelerating. Using N=5 for the demand forecast captures the recent spring surge (mean ~92/period). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P8 took 2, P9 took 1), so using a calculated average for L is appropriate. The goal is to set parameters that replenish the stock quickly to cover the current peak demand while accounting for the high lead-time volatility seen in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak detected: Period 11 demand spiked to 145 units, significantly above the previous spring average of ~80 units. P7-P11 average is now 92 units (+170% vs baseline).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 7pk of basic sneaker socks, currently in its peak spring/early summer demand window (May 6th). Demand has spiked significantly in the last two periods (145 and 130 units), confirming a high-demand regime compared to the earlier spring average of ~80 units. The Period 11 and 12 average demand is 137.5 units. Current On-hand is 0, and while In-transit is high (312), 144 units were just ordered last period and are not yet due (promised L=2). However, historical data shows frequent shipment losses (P1, P3, P4 orders were all lost) and fluctuating lead times (1-2 periods). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this seasonal peak while accounting for the recent demand jump, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture the ~137.5 units/period level. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to reflect the high volatility seen in this category during seasonal transitions. L is set to calculate to let the backend use observed arrival data, though I must remain cautious of the high pipeline inventory provided by the OR engine's logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak confirmed for early May: P11-P12 average demand is 137.5 units, a 47% increase over the P7-P10 average of 93.5 units. Supply chain reliability remains low with ~30% of historically placed orders lost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The SKU is '7pk basic sneaker socks', which is in its peak spring/early summer season. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly: P11 (145), P12 (130), and P13 (88). The drop in P13 (88) follows two triple-digit weeks, but the overall May average remains high. Given the volatility and the 1-2 period lead time variability, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P11-P13) which averages ~121 units/period. On-hand is 0 and in-transit is 442. Historical shipments from P1, P3, and P4 were lost, and orders from P10 (9 units), P12 (144 units), and P13 (130 units) are currently in-transit. The OR backend needs to account for the (L+1) demand window. I will use L=2 (promised) as recent actual lead times have been 1-2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the high variance observed in this peak regime (std of last 3 samples is ~30, scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2248 1.73, resulting in ~52).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in May: P11-P13 range [88, 145]. Average demand for peak spring/summer (P11-P13) is ~121 units/period, significantly higher than the April average of ~80.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20, 2019. The product (sneaker socks) is in its peak seasonal regime (April-May). Demand has shifted upwards significantly: the average demand of the last 4 periods (P11-P14) is 114.5 units, compared to the early spring average of ~80. The most recent demand (P14) was 95 units, following a peak of 145/130 earlier in May. Inventory reconciliation: 144 units arrived in P14 (from P12), leaving 49 on-hand. Lead times are stable at 2 periods (P12 order arrived in P14). I will set L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to 345 (based on the recent demand average of ~115 * 3 periods), and sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility observed in May (range 88-145). The in-transit of 298 units (which includes P13's order of 130 and any others) should cover upcoming periods, but the OR engine will determine if an additional order is needed to reach the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Late spring peak demand (May) confirmed: P11-P14 demand averaged 114.5 units/period, a significant increase from the April average of ~80 units. High volatility remains (Std Dev approx 27 in this regime).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '575347003' represents sneaker socks, currently in their peak seasonal window (late May). Analysis of the recent regime (Periods 11-15) show demand has shifted to a much higher level, averaging 117.8 units per period (145, 130, 88, 95, 131) compared to the April average of ~80. The Standard Deviation in this regime is approximately 25.4. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 335 units in-transit (Orders from P13: 130, P15: 37, and likely the P10: 9 order which is overdue). The actual lead time has stabilized between 1-2 periods. I am setting mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods, where L=2, using the recent demand mean of 117.8 shifted for the peak. This results in a mu_hat of approx 353.4. Sigma_hat is calculated manually to reflect the volatility of this high-demand period specifically.

Carry-over insight: May/June season peak for sneaker socks confirmed: Demand avg 117.8 (P11-P15) with high volatility (Std Dev ~25). Supply reliability remains a concern with multiple historical losses, though recent arrivals (P14) match the 2-period promised lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 575347003 (sneaker socks) is in its early June seasonal peak. Demand in the most recent period (P16) hit 153, the highest yet. The current regime (P11-P16) average demand is 123.7 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is high (391 units), including orders from P13 (130 units), P15 (37 units), and P16 (56 units). The P13 order (130 units) is now at its promised lead time (2 periods) and should have arrived in P15 or P16; its absence at the start of P17 suggests it might be delayed or potentially lost, similar to previous losses in P1, P3, and P4. Given's the product's high seasonality and recent stockouts, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the May/June peak average of ~124 units. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the increasing frequency of delayed or lost shipments, ensuring the OR backend targets enough pipeline inventory to cover this instability.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak for sneaker socks intensified in late May: Period 16 demand reached 153 units. The current regime (P11-P16) average is 123.7 units (+265% vs baseline). Period 13 order (130 units) is overdue, reinforcing supply chain instability concerns.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10, entering the peak summer season for sneaker socks. Historical demand for the last seven periods (P11-P17) shows a significant regime shift, averaging 121 units/period compared to the previous spring average of 80 and the baseline of 34. The most recent demand (P17) was 105, following a peak of 153. Supply chain reliability is a major concern: orders from P1, P3, P4, and potentially P13 are lost/overdue. The P13 order (130 units) is now at L=5, well past the promised 2, confirming it is likely lost. I am setting L=2 (actual lead time for recent successful arrivals), mu_hat to 363 (121 demand * (2+1) periods) based on the last 7 weeks (N=7), and sigma_hat explicitly at 50 to account for high demand volatility (std dev ~28 in this regime) and the impact of frequent stockouts on pipeline reconciliation.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand regime for summer peak (P11-P17) stabilized at ~121 units/period. Supply chain instability confirmed: Period 13 order (130 units) is likely lost (L=5 with no arrival), following verified losses from P1, P3, and P4. Pipeline reliability is approximately 65-70%.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June), which is the peak season for '7pk basic R sneaker socks'. Demand analysis shows a high-volume summer regime starting around Period 11. Over the last 8 periods (P11-P18), demand has averaged 104.25 units with a high standard deviation (approx 26.6). Most recently, in Period 18, demand was 87 units, and in Period 17, it was 105. The stocking strategy must account for both high seasonal demand and significant supply chain instability. The order from Period 13 (130 units) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost, consistent with previous losses in P1, P3, and P4. The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 447 units in transit (including recent large orders from P17). I will set L=3 to reflect the effective lead time given frequent shipment losses and mu_hat based on the recent 8-period peak regime average (approx 104 units/period). Setting sigma_hat to explicit covers the observed volatility to maintain a high service level during this profitable peak period.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P11-P18) established with average 104.25 units/period and high volatility (Std Dev ~27). Supply reliability remains low (~65%) with Period 13 order now confirmed lost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season for sneaker socks (late June). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the current summer regime (Periods 11-19) has averaged 109.1 units/period with significant volatility (Std Dev \u2248 26). The Period 13 order (130 units) is confirmed lost, and the Period 17 order (149 units) is overdue for its promised lead time of 2 (it should have arrived in Period 19), contributing to the current stockout. Total in-transit is 513 units (comprised of Period 17: 149, Period 19: 66, and historically placed orders that are likely lost). To restore inventory and manage the high-demand summer season, I will set mu_hat based on the last 9 samples (Period 11-19) which cover the high-demand regime, and increase sigma_hat to account for both demand spikes and supply chain unreliability. Lead time is set to 2 to align with the promised value, though systemic losses remain a factor.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand (P11-P19) reflects a mean of 109.1 units/period. Supply chain reliability persists at ~60-70%; Period 17 order (placed June 3) is now overdue/missing as of Period 19 conclude.

LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the demand for sneaker socks has entered a hyper-peak phase, likely driven by summer weather. Period 20 demand spiked to 198 units, and the average for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 138.2 units, significantly higher than the May average of ~114. The 'In-transit' quantity of 513 units is extremely high, but historical reliability suggests a 40% loss rate (P1, P3, P4, P13, and now P17 are all likely lost, as P17 was ordered on Period 17 and hasn't arrived by P20 conclude). Specifically, the Period 17 order (149 units) is overdue, leaving the current pipeline inventory effectively overstated. I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for a mean of 150 units per period (1+L=3 periods), reflecting the July peak and adjusting for the high likelihood of pipeline attrition. Sigma_hat is set to 40 per period (explicit total 69.3) to cover the high volatility observed in June.

Carry-over insight: July Hyper-Peak: Demand average for P16-P20 is 138.2 (+11% vs June). Period 17 order (149 units) is confirmed lost/overdue. Systematic pipeline shrinkage continues at ~40%.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a summer hyper-peak for sneaker socks (July 1st date context, consistent high demand). Period 21 demand was 158 units, following a peak of 198 in Period 20. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 139.2 units, significantly higher than the early summer average (~109-114). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 513 is deceptive because several large orders are overdue and likely lost (P13: 130 units, P17: 149 units, plus potentially P19: 66 units). Historical supply reliability is approximately 60%. To compensate for systematic pipeline shrinkage (lost shipments) and high seasonal demand, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to force the OR engine to account for a longer replacement cycle, and 'explicit' mu_hat based on the current hyper-peak average (139 units) projected over (L+1) periods (3+1=4). This ensures the base stock level is high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom in-transit units. Sigma is set high to account for the volatility seen in P11-P21 (Std Dev \u2248 35).

Carry-over insight: Period 22: July hyper-peak confirmed with avg demand 139.2 (P17-P21). Supply chain reliability remains a critical failure point; Period 13 (130 units) and Period 17 (149 units) are now confirmed lost, and Period 19 (66 units) is overdue.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019, representing the peak summer season for sneaker socks. Current demand analysis (P16-P22) shows a mean of 138.8 units/period, with high volatility. We are facing severe supply chain reliability issues: orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 17, and 19 are currently missing or confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 615 reflects these lost units + the P22 order (102 units). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (Total In-Transit) to calculate the order size (order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the phantom inventory from lost shipments is preventing the system from placing new orders, resulting in stockouts (on-hand is 0). To bypass this and force the OR engine to place an order, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat that significantly exceeds the true pipeline to 'overpower' the phantom inventory. I am targeting a base stock that covers the current demand regime (~139) plus a buffer for the lost 615 units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock (approx 850) = (1+L) * mu_hat. With L=2, mu_hat = 850/3 \u2248 283. This will trigger an order of approximately 100-200 units to replenish stock despite the 615 'in-transit' units.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Systematic supply chain failure confirmed. Approximately 80% of pipeline inventory (494 out of 615 units from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 17, 19) is lost/phantom. Demand remains in July hyper-peak at ~139 units/period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Context: We are in late July (2019/7/22), the peak season for sneaker socks. Demand remains extremely high, averaging 137.2 units over the last 5 periods (P19-P23: 148, 198, 158, 123, 126). 

Lead Time & Supply Reliability: The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times for successful deliveries range between 1 and 2 periods (P22 order arrived in P23 with L=1). However, the primary issue is catastrophic shipment loss. 

Pipeline Reconciliation (as of Period 24 Start):
- Total In-transit = 513 units.
- Breakdowns: P1 (45), P3 (44), P4 (70), P13 (130), P17 (149), P19 (66), P20 (0), P21 (0), P22 (0 - delivered), P23 (0).
- Confirmed/Likely Losses: P1+P3+P4+P13+P17+P19 = 504 units. These are all 4+ periods old. 
- Valid Pipeline: 513 (Total) - 504 (Stale/Lost) = 9 units currently 'live' in the pipeline (rounding difference or leftover from older small orders).

Strategy: Because the OR engine assumes all 'In-transit' units will arrive, it will consistently under-order if the pipeline is clogged with 'phantom' inventory. To force an order, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the 'phantom' pipeline plus current demand coverage. With 504 lost units and a desired coverage of ~140 units/period for (L+1)=3 periods (total 420), a mu_hat around 920-950 is required to trigger replenishment. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to account for these massive losses and sustain service during the July/August hyper-peak.

Carry-over insight: Supply Chain Failure Update (P24): Stale pipeline (unfulfilled orders >3 periods old) has reached 504 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19), representing 98% of reported 'In-transit'. Demand hyper-peak confirmed through July at ~137 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (Late July), demand for sneaker socks remains in its hyper-peak regime. The demand average for the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 144 units, and the standard deviation has stabilized around 33. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: 'In-transit' accounts for 877 units, but a reconciliation of history shows that 504 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19) are effectively lost or permanently delayed. The OR engine's pipeline calculation is inflated by these phantom units, which would normally lead it to zero out orders. To force an order that covers the (L+1) demand window (approx 432 units) despite the imaginary 877 units in transit, I am setting mu_hat to 1350 using the 'explicit' method. This value acts as an offset to bypass the backend's (base_stock - pipeline) logic, ensuring a safety buffer is maintained during this high-demand summer period while accounting for a roughly 60% loss rate on incoming shipments. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P22) have arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Phantom inventory persists at 504 units (57% of total in-transit). Demand hyper-peak for July/August confirmed with mean ~144 units/period (P20-P24).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is sneaker socks, which are currently in a high-demand summer seasonal peak. As of August 5 (Period 26), demand has slightly cooled from the July hyper-peak (mean ~139) to a more moderate but still high level (Period 25 demand was 79). Supply chain instability is a critical factor: orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 17, and 19 (totaling 504 units) are definitively lost or 'phantom' as they are multiple weeks past any reasonable lead time. These units must be ignored when calculating pipeline stock. The backend OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). To compensate for the 504 units of phantom inventory that will never arrive but are included in the 'In-transit' figure of 1384, mu_hat must be adjusted upward. Current real pipeline: 1384 (reported) - 504 (lost) = 880 active units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) demand coverage PLUS the phantom units. Target demand for P20-P25 has averaged ~134 units. Base stock target for L=2 (3 periods of demand) \u2248 400. To offset 504 units of phantom stock, the mu_hat parameter needs to be roughly 900-1000 to ensure the backend places the necessary orders.

Carry-over insight: Phanton inventory (lost shipments) confirmed at 504 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19). Demand trending slightly lower from July peak but remains elevated; August baseline expected ~120 units/period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are exiting the July/August hyper-peak for sneaker socks (P20-P25 mean: ~145). Recent demand (P25: 79, P26: 106) suggests a deceleration as summer ends. I am adjusting mu_hat to a post-peak mean of ~115 (P11-P26 average is approx 114) to avoid over-ordering during the seasonal fade. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: In-transit is reported at 1384 units, but historically, 504 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19) are confirmed lost/phantom inventory. The OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders. To force the backend to place necessary orders despite this phantom 'in-transit' padding, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, significantly inflating it to offset the 504 missing units. Target Base Stock = (L+1)*Demand + Z*Sigma + Phantom_Units. With L=2, Demand~115, Sigma~30, and Phantom=504, the target is ~850-900. Setting mu_hat to 850 (explicit) ensures the backend 'sees' a requirement that accounts for the fact that 504 units in the pipeline will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand transition: Demand decreasing from July hyper-peak (~145) towards late-August baseline (~105-115). Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 504 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '575347003' (Socks) is currently transitioning from a July/August hyper-peak (avg ~144 units) to a late-August baseline. In Period 27, we observed demand of 81 units, confirming the downward trend noted in previous insights. The current average demand for the last 5 periods (P23-P27) is 101.8, and the most recent 3 periods (P25-P27) average 88.7. To avoid overstocking during this seasonal decline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent average of ~102 units/period, adjusted by (1+L). A significant issue remains: phantom inventory. Out of the 877 units reported as 'In-transit', 504 units are from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 17, and 19. These are significantly overdue (5+ periods) and definitively lost. Additionally, the order from Period 24 (364 units) is now 4 periods old (placed 2019/7/22, expected by 2019/8/5) and is likely lost. This brings total phantom inventory to 868 units (504 + 364), meaning the 'true' pipeline is effectively 9 units (Period 10 remainder or recent small adjustments). With 426 units on-hand and a confirmed delivery from P25 (507 units) having just arrived, the inventory level is currently sufficient for the immediate lead time, but the OR engine needs to ignore the nearly 100% phantom pipeline. I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to provide a stable planning horizon despite the high shipment loss rate.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Phantom inventory increased to 868 units; the Period 24 order (364 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost. Demand transition to late-summer/autumn baseline confirmed (~80-100 units/period).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29 (late August), the 'sneaker socks' demand has transitioned from its July hyper-peak (~144 units/period) to a lower late-summer/autumn baseline. Demand in the last two periods (67 and 81) indicates a stabilizing regime around 70-80 units. The Period 25 order of 507 units arrived in Period 27, leaving a healthy on-hand inventory of 359 units. However, supply chain reliability remains a massive issue: Period 1, 3, 4, 13, 17, 19, and 24 orders (totaling 868 units) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue, creating 'phantom' in-transit inventory that the OR backend incorrectly counts. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I must set the 'L' parameter using an 'explicit' value to reflect the current supply risk and set 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' to account for both the lower demand regime and the high inventory currently held. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the post-peak drop (avg ~83) and sigma_hat to reflect lower volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Demand for sneaker socks is tapering off from the summer peak (July/August average ~120-140) toward a lower late-summer/early-autumn baseline. Recent demand over the last three periods (P27-P29) has been 81, 67, and 59, showing a clear downward trend (avg ~69). On-hand inventory is 300 units, which covers over 4 periods of recent demand. Regarding 'In-transit' (877 units), the carry-over insights confirm that at least 868 units are 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, and now P24 which is 6 periods overdue). These units will likely never arrive. I will set L to 'default' (2) as recent successful deliveries (P25) have adhered to the promised lead time. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4, including P26-P29) to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~78) while accounting for the downward trend. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to match the current volatility. No new order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend because on-hand (300) far exceeds the base stock level for the current demand regime, which is appropriate to avoid excess holding costs as seasonality wanes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to autumn baseline: P27-P29 average demand dropped to 69 units/period (-50% vs July peak). Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) is estimated at 868 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '7pk basic R sneaker socks' has transitioned from its summer hyper-peak (which saw demand up to 198 units) into an autumn baseline. The last four periods (P27-P30) show a clear downward trend: 81, 67, 59, 52. The current average demand for this new regime is approximately 65 units per period. Regarding supply chain health: we have a massive amount of 'phantom inventory' in-transit. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, and P24 are all significantly past the 2-period lead time and are almost certainly lost. This amounts to 868 units (45+44+70+130+149+66+364) that the OR backend incorrectly counts as 'in-transit'. Currently, on-hand inventory is 248 units. At a projected demand of ~65 units/period, this covers roughly 3.8 periods. Given the lead time is 2 periods, the system should not place new orders yet. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the phantom inventory and incorrectly withholding orders, I have to manage parameters carefully. However, with 248 on-hand, we are still safe. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the autumn cooldown (avg ~65) and set L to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: P27-P30 demand averages 64.75 units/period, reflecting a significant drop from the summer peak. Total phantom inventory (confirmed lost shipments) remains 868 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '7pk basic R sneaker socks' has transitioned from a summer hyper-peak (~140-150 units/period) to an autumn baseline. The last four periods (P28-P31) show a consistent decline: 67, 59, 52, 42. The average for this new autumn regime is ~55 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 206 units, and the pipeline shows 877 units. However, based on history, 868 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 17, 19, and 24). The only 'live' in-transit inventory is 9 units (not tracked being negligible). Given the current on-hand of 206 units and a demand forecast of ~55/period, we have approximately 3.7 periods of stock available. With a lead time of 2 periods, we are currently overstocked for the current demand regime. No new order is needed yet. Parameters are set to reflect the current autumn mean demand (~55) and observed volatility to allow the system to wind down inventory naturally.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: P28-P31 demand shows a clear downward trend (67, 59, 52, 42) averaging ~55 units/period. Supply chain health remains poor with 868 units of confirmed phantom inventory in the pipeline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a stable autumn regime. For the last five periods (P28-P32), demand has been 67, 59, 52, 42, and 51, averaging 54.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 9.3. On-hand inventory is currently 155 units, which covers nearly 3 periods of the current demand regime. The pipeline shows 877 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms 868 of these are 'phantom' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, P24). Consequently, the true usable pipeline is only 9 units (likely from P25 or most recent activity). Due to the high on-hand stock relative to the new lower demand regime and the need to avoid further holding costs, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this lower autumn demand level.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, transitioning into autumn. The product (sneaker socks) has moved past its summer peak and settled into a lower autumn baseline. Demand over the last 6 periods (P28-P33) has averaged 57.5 units/period, significantly lower than the July/August hyper-peak. On-hand inventory is currently 81 units, which covers approximately 1.5 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' value of 877 units is highly misleading; as documented in Carry-over Insights, at least 868 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, and P24). Consequently, the OR backend sees a massive pipeline that doesn't exist, which would normally result in an order of 0. To ensure the backend places an order to maintain stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock level that covers (L+1) periods of demand at the current average (57.5 * 3 = 172.5), but I must also 'offset' the phantom inventory. However, since I cannot directly subtract from the pipeline in the backend, I will set mu_hat to a value that forces the order logic (base_stock - pipeline) to trigger. Given the pipeline is ~877 and I want an actual on-hand + true pipeline of ~175, I set mu_hat significantly higher to bypass the phantom inventory cap and ensure a maintenance order is placed. I will set L to 2 as recent successful arrivals (P25, P22) have adhered to the 1-2 period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: P28-P33 average demand is 57.5 units/period. Total phantom inventory remains 868 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for sneaker socks has entered an autumn baseline period. The average demand from Period 28 to Period 34 is 55.7 units/period, showing significant decline from the summer hyper-peak. Supply chain reliability remains a major issue. Total 'In-transit' is reported as 1036. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed lost ('phantom inventory'): P1 (45), P3 (44), P4 (70), P13 (130), P17 (149), P19 (66), and P24 (364). Summing these equals 868 units of phantom inventory. The 'true' pipeline consists only of the Period 34 order (159 units) and potentially some residual logic. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 868 phantom units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat. I've set mu_hat = (1+L) * 58 = 174 (based on recent mean) and increased sigma_hat to account for both demand volatility and the high risk of shipment loss. I use L=2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P25) adhered to this.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline demand confirmed: P28-P34 average is 55.7 units/period. Total phantom inventory remains 868 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, P24). Pipeline reliability is effectively 50-60% based on historical losses.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the demand for sneaker socks has stabilized into an autumn baseline regime. The last 8 periods (P28-P35) display a mean demand of 56.6 units, reflecting the seasonal downturn after the summer peak. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 1036 units is highly deceptive due to massive historical losses: orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, and P24 (totaling 868 units) are considered 'phantom inventory' and will not arrive. The active pipeline consists of the P34 order (159 units), which is expected to arrive by P37 (L=2). To ensure service levels for the upcoming period without over-ordering relative to the actual functional pipeline, I am setting mu_hat based on the recent 8-period autumn regime (N=8) and maintaining the lead time at the promised 2 periods to cover the current review + lead time window.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline regime confirmed (P28-P35): Mean demand 56.6 units/period. Functional pipeline check: 868 units of the 1036 in-transit are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, P24).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized into an autumn baseline. Over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the mean demand is 60.6 units, but the most recent 6 periods (P31-P36) show a lower average of 51.2 units per period. I will use recent_N=6 to reflect this current stabilized lower demand. Supply chain reliability remains extremely poor: 868 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are confirmed lost (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, and P24). Subtracting these 868 units from the total 1036 in-transit leaves only 168 units as 'functional' pipeline (primarily the P34 order of 159). To compensate for the OR backend's lack of awareness of these lost units, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I set mu_hat = (1+L) * mean + 868, where L=2 and mean=51.2, resulting in ~1022. This forces the engine to recognize that the 868 'phantom' units are not available to meet demand. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=6 to capture recent autumn volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '575347003' (sneaker socks) is in an autumn demand regime. Demand for the last 10 periods (P28-P37) has averaged approximately 54.0 units/period (540 total / 10 periods), showing a clear decline from the summer hyper-peak. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with 868 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, and P24) which are over 4 periods past their promised lead time. The actual in-transit inventory that can be expected to arrive consists of P34 (159 units) and P37 (9 units). Total effective pipeline is only 168 units. With on-hand at 0 and expected arrivals from P34 overdue (L=4 vs promised L=2), I will use 'explicit' for L to account for recent delays and set mu_hat to cover the immediate 3-period window (L+1) using the recent autumn average of 54 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter baseline for sneaker socks confirmed: P28-P37 average demand is 54.0 units/period. Supply chain reliability for P34 (159 units) is being monitored as it is now 4 periods old (overdue).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of early November, the demand for sneaker socks has stabilized into an autumn/winter baseline. For the period range P28-P38, the mean demand is 53.45 units/period. The current pipeline shows 1036 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms a high rate of lost shipments: orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, and P24 (totaling 868 units) are considered 'phantom inventory'. Additionally, the P34 order (159 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived, making it highly likely to be lost as well. This leaves the functional pipeline effectively at 0. Given the consistent loss of large shipments (>100 units) compared to the successful arrival of smaller ones (e.g., P37 order of 9 units arrived in 1 period), I will maintain a conservative base stock target. mu_hat is set using N=11 (P28-P38) to capture the current regime average of ~53.5 units per period, scaled by (1+L). sigma_hat is also set using this recent regime to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: P34 order (159 units) confirmed lost (5 periods overdue). Total phantom inventory is now 1027 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, P24, P34), meaning nearly 100% of reported in-transit is non-existent.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. The product is sneaker socks, which are now in a low-demand late autumn/winter regime. Analysis of the demand from Period 28 to 39 shows a stable mean of approximately 52 units per period (Avg: 51.6). I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this stabilized regime. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' of 1036 is almost entirely comprised of 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 17, 19, 24, and now P34 is confirmed lost at 5+ periods overdue). Only the Period 37 order arrived recently. The effective pipeline inventory is currently 0. Lead time remains volatile between 1-2 periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect historical actuals, but the OR backend's inventory balancing will be heavily skewed by the 1036 phantom units. By maintaining mu_hat and sigma_hat at the current regime levels, I aim to keep the base stock target appropriate for current demand, despite the likely under-ordering caused by the backend seeing a large (but fake) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed total phantom inventory (lost shipments) is 1027 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, P24, P34). Current demand regime (P28-P39) is stable at ~52 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 18, 2019. We are in the late autumn/winter baseline demand regime for sneaker socks. Demand from Period 28 to Period 40 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 52 units per period and relatively low volatility compared to the summer peak. The supply chain remains highly unreliable; the 'In-transit' quantity of 1036 units is almost entirely 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (specifically Orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, P24, and P34). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory from the base stock to calculate the order, these 1027 lost units prevent the system from placing any new orders. To fix this and resume replenishment, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised lead time) and 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the phantom inventory. I calculate the target base stock for the current regime as (1+L)*mean_demand = 3 * 52 = 156. Adding the 1027 phantom units (which the backend will subtract), the required 'mu_hat' value is approximately 1183. This will force the OR engine to place an order that covers current demand needs despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 25, 2019. We are in an autumn/winter baseline demand regime for sneaker socks, which has remained stable since Period 28. Demand for the last 14 periods (P28-P41) averages 51.3 units, with the most recent 4 periods averaging 41.5 units. Total In-transit inventory is 1202 units, but historical analysis shows that 1027 units are definitively lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, P24, P34). The only valid pipeline inventory is the 166 units ordered in Period 41. The OR backend uses the 'In-transit' figure to calculate orders, but because it contains 1027 phantom units, it will severely under-order or not order at all. To correct for this, I must set mu_hat explicitly high to force the OR engine to place an order despite the bloated 'In-transit' column, essentially adding the phantom inventory value (1027) back into the requirement. Since Profit ($4) vs Holding Cost ($1) suggests a high service level (~80% quantile), and current demand is ~51/period with L=2, the base stock should normally be around 200 units. Adding the 1027 phantom units, I will set mu_hat to 1230 to bypass the pipeline inventory constraint. I will use L=recent_5 to reflect recent lead time variability (range 1-2 periods).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the product (sneaker socks) is in the winter baseline demand regime, but with a recent spike to 101 units in Period 42, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions. The stable autumn average (P28-P41) was ~52 units/period. Total In-transit is reported as 1249 units, but historical analysis shows 1027 units are definitively lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, P24, P34). The functional pipeline consists only of orders from P41 (166 units) and P42 (47 units), totaling 213 units. Since on-hand is 0 and the current lead time variability suggests 1-2 periods, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (including the recent spike) to ensure sufficient stock for potential holiday demand transitions. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 1027 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, P24, P34). Effective pipeline as of P43 is 213 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 occurs in early December. The demand regime for sneaker socks has stabilized at a late-autumn/winter baseline. Over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), demand has averaged 52.4 units, consistent with the long-term autumn average of ~54 units. Volatility remains moderate. Supply chain analysis: On-hand inventory is 125 units following the P41 arrival. Reported In-transit is 1083 units, but 1027 units are confirmed 'phantom' (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, P24, P34). The only valid in-transit order is from P42 (47 units), making the effective pipeline 47 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing a massive (but fake) pipeline and refusing to order, I use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I set mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at the current average (53 * 3 = 159). I set sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline)', providing an explicit mu_hat that is lower than the (fake) pipeline would result in zero orders. However, with true on-hand(125) + true pipeline(47) = 172, and an expected\u9700\u6c42 of ~159, we are currently sufficiently stocked for the immediate lead time.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019 (Period 45). The Autumn/Winter demand regime for sneaker socks remains stable, with recent demand (P39-P44) averaging 44.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 80 units. In-transit inventory stands at 1083 units, but my previous analysis confirms that 1027 units are likely lost (phantom inventory from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, P24, P34). The only valid order in the pipeline is the one from Period 42 (47 units), which is expected to arrive this period (P45) or the next. Since the effective pipeline (47) plus on-hand (80) equals 127 units, and the expected demand over the lead time (L=2, so 3 periods) is approximately 133 units (3 * 44.5), we are slightly short. However, reaching Period 45 of 47 means we are in the endgame. I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods to capture the current stable winter baseline and use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the 1-2 period historical average.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Autumn/Winter baseline confirmed stable at ~45 units/period (P39-P44 avg). Effective pipeline confirmed with only Period 42 order (47 units) remaining valid; total phantom inventory remains 1027 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). We are in the winter baseline regime for sneaker socks, where demand is stable and relatively low. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P39-P45) is 52.8 units/period. On-hand inventory is 63 units, which safely covers one period of winter-level demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 1036 is almost entirely comprised of 'phantom' inventory from lost historical orders (Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 17, 19, 24, 34 totaling 1027 units). Excluding these lost orders, there is no active pipeline inventory. Lead times are averaging 2.0 periods based on recent successful deliveries (P41 arrived in 2, P42 arrived in 3). With the Christmas holiday period potentially impacting demand slightly, I will set mu_hat based on the recent winter regime (approx 53 units/period) and L at the promised lead time of 2, resulting in a total look-ahead of 3 periods (159 units cumulative demand). The current 63 on-hand units require additional replenishment to meet the target base stock and account for supply chain instability.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Supply reliability appears to have stabilized marginally but remains fragile; P41 and P42 arrived successfully (L=2 and L=3 respectively). Total confirmed phantom inventory from lost orders remains 1027 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019, entering the final stages of the winter season for sneaker socks. Demand has remained stable in the late-year baseline regime; the average demand from Period 40 to 46 is approximately 61 units, though the longer-term autumn/winter average (P28-P46) is roughly 54 units. We are currently at Period 47. On-hand inventory is low (8 units). Looking at the pipeline, 'In-transit' shows 1036 units, but carry-over insights confirm that 1027 units are 'phantom' inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, P24, P34). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 9 units (1036 - 1027). Since the game is at its final period (Period 47), no new order placed now will arrive before the simulation ends (lead time is 1-3 periods). Decisions are focused on setting parameters that reflect the current stable demand regime and recognizing the reality of the supply chain losses to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering in a hypothetical next period. I will use a recent_N of 19 for mu_hat to capture the post-summer baseline (P28-P46).
