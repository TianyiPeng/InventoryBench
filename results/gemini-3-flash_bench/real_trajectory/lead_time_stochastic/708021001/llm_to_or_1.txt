Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'PINKY Loose Fitted Tank'. Historical demand samples available are: 115, 48, 41, 6, 64. The mean is 54.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 40.2. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. The OR backend uses L+1 (3 periods) of demand to calculate the base stock. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture all available historical context. This item is a fitness/sport vest, and demand might pick up as we approach the spring season (mid-February current date). Given this is the first period with on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, setting these parameters will initiate the first order to cover expected demand over the lead time plus review period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a sports vest top. The historical demand for January and early February shows volatility (ranging from 6 to 115) with an average of approximately 55 over the last 5 samples. However, Period 1 demand was high (99), possibly indicating an upward trend as we move towards warmer weeks or increased fitness activity. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we lost sales in Period 1 (sold 0 out of 99 demand), we must ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the lead time. The promised lead time is 2, meaning orders placed today (P2) arrive at the end of P4. Total protection needed is for (L+1) = 3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent mean (~63 including P1) and variability, providing a reactive but grounded forecast.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. This product (PINKY Loose Fitted Tank) has seen initial demand of 99 and 45 units in the first two periods, but we have sold 0 units because no stock has arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (121 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's Arrival Resolution phase and should be visible in the Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start message. Total in-transit is 229 (121 + 108). Historical demand data suggests a mean around 55. Evaluation of the 7 samples (including Game History) shows: [115, 48, 41, 6, 64, 99, 45]. The mean of these 7 samples is 59.7. Given the variance and the stockout situation, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher recent demand (avg 53.5) while ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for the 2-period lead time. Parameters are set to ensure the pipeline covers expected demand until the next replenishment arrives.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a sports vest top (seasonal item). Since Period 1, we have observed significant stockouts as no inventory has arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (L=2) should have arrived during Period 3's resolution and thus should be reflected in the 'Period 3 conclude' message seen now at the start of Period 4. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the actual lead time is likely longer than 2, or the first shipment is delayed. Historically, demand has been dropping (99 -> 45 -> 11), likely due to the stockout visibility/effect or natural fluctuation. However, early February samples were higher (115, 64). With an on-hand of 0 and 271 units in transit, we need to ensure we don't over-order if the lead time is simply shifting. I will set L to 3 (explicitly accounting for the delay) and use recent history (N=5 including pre-game samples) to normalize the demand forecast despite the recent low numbers, as the 11 units in P3 might be biased by the lack of stock.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (March 11). The product is a Ladies H&M Sport Vest top. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 4 (127 units), likely due to the start of the spring fitness/activewear season in March. However, on-hand inventory has been 0 for most periods, leading to lost sales. Specifically, in Period 4, we sold all 108 units that arrived, but demand was 127. The order from Period 1 (121 units) is currently missing (it should have arrived in Period 3 if L=2), while the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time in Period 4. The Period 1 order might be lost or significantly delayed. Pipeline inventory is currently 199 (Orders from P1=121, P3=42, P4=36; but P1 is likely lost, so effectively 78 units). To compensate for the seasonal demand increase and the inventory stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the recent peak and keep lead time at default (2) while monitoring the missing P1 shipment. The OR backend will use the higher demand mean from the recent spike to increase the base stock.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a sports vest top ('PINKY Loose Fitted Tank'). Historical demand shows a mix of low and high weeks: [115, 48, 41, 6, 64] before P1, and [99, 45, 11, 127, 117] during game history. Recent demand (P4-P5) has spiked significantly (127, 117), likely due to seasonal spring/fitness trends as we head into late March. Regarding lead time: Promised is 2. P2 order arrived in P4 (LT=2). P1 order is MISSING (ordered P1, not arrived by P5 conclude). Since P3 and P4 orders are in-transit and not yet due (P3 due P5 conclude, P4 due P6 conclude), the P1 shipment (121 units) appears lost. Current on-hand is 0. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 2 periods (avg ~122) to capture this higher demand regime. I will set L to 2 (promised), as one confirmed arrival matches it, but I will watch for more missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: P1 shipment (121 units) potentially lost; demand regime shift confirmed starting P4 (avg 122 vs previous avg ~50).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a sports tank top, and we are entering spring/early summer, which typically sees rising demand for sportswear. Looking at the history, a significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 4. The initial average was approx 50, but the last three periods (P4-P6) show an average demand of 101.3 (127, 117, 60). Although P6 dropped to 60, the overall trend since P4 remains high. Regarding lead times, the promised L is 2. P2 arrived in P4 (L=2). P5 arrived in P6 (L=1). P1 (ordered in Period 1, expected in P3) is definitively lost as it has not arrived by P6/P7. P3 (ordered in P3, expected in P5) and P4 (ordered in P4, expected in P6) are also currently missing, which suggests potential lead-time instability or further losses. Despite the P1 loss, L=1 for P5 suggests that when they do arrive, they can be fast. I will use L=2 (default) for safety. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher demand regime started in P4 while acknowledging the recent volume. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent high volatility (ranging from 60 to 127).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of P1 order (121 units); possible instability in logistics with P3 (42 units) and P4 (36 units) currently overdue by 1-2 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (April 1). The product is a sports vest top, likely entering its peak season (spring/summer). Current demand history shows a shift: early samples (Feb) averaged ~50, while March samples (excluding P4 spike) averaged ~74. However, Period 4 demand was 127 and Period 5 was 117, suggesting high latent demand when stock is available. Regarding lead times: the promised L=2 is unreliable. P1 (ordered P1) should have arrived by P3/P4 but is lost. P2 arrived in 2 periods. P3 and P4 orders are now 2-3 periods overdue, suggesting they are either lost or heavily delayed. P5 arrived in 1 period, which is faster than promised. P6 (ordered P6) hasn't arrived yet. Given the high 'In-transit' (370 units) which includes several potentially lost shipments (P1, P3, P4), on-hand inventory is low (32). I will use explicit L=2 to align with the promised time but will set mu_hat conservatively using the recent demand regime (last 4 periods avg ~87). I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the March demand shift while smoothing the volatility. Sigma is set using recent_N to account for the high variance seen in March.

Carry-over insight: P3 (42 units) and P4 (36 units) are now critically overdue (3+ periods) and highly likely lost; actual average demand for March stabilized at ~87 units/period.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a sports vest top (yoga/fitness related), which typically sees stable to increasing demand as spring progresses. Analysis of arrivals: P1 order (121 units) is definitively lost. P3 (42 units) and P4 (36 units) are now 5+ periods overdue and also considered lost. P6 (171 units) arrived in P8 (LT=2). P5 (138 units) arrived in P6 (LT=1). Average lead time for successful deliveries is 1.67 periods, but the high loss rate (3 out of 6 placed orders) suggests extreme supply chain instability. Demand analysis: P1-P5 (Feb-early March) mean was ~80, but P8 saw a jump to 114. For the parameters, I'll set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual arrival speeds observed (1 and 2 periods). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher late-March/early-April demand stabilization (Avg ~87), while sigma_hat will use the same N=5 to capture recent volatility. My goal is to ensure the pipeline inventory is robust enough to handle the 50% loss rate observed so far.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability confirmed: 50% order loss rate (P1, P3, P4 lost). Delivered orders show LT of 1-2 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019-04-15). The item is a 'PINKY Loose Fitted Tank' (sports vest), which is going into the peak spring/summer season. On-hand inventory is 0 after Period 9 demand (103) exceeded starting inventory (89). There are 295 units in-transit (orders from Period 9 and some historical leftovers that are highly likely lost). Specifically, shipments from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. The recent demand regime (last 6 periods since the shift in P4) has an average of approximately 77.8 units/period, but individual periods show volatility (60 to 127). I will set L to 2 (promised) as observed actual lead times for successful arrivals (P2, P5, P6) averaged 1.67 periods. To compensate for the high stockout risk and potential for lost shipments, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting (1+L) periods of demand based on the more robust spring average (~85 units/period * 3 = 255) and a higher sigma to ensure the OR backend orders enough to buffer against the 0 on-hand state and the unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain variability remains high with a 50% historical loss rate; early spring demand (April) has stabilized near ~85 units/week.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 11, the current context shows a transition into late April. The product is a sports vest top, which typically sees steady demand as warmer weather approaches. History shows significant demand shifts: an early peak in March (avg ~122) followed by a slightly lower but consistent April level (avg ~85). The last period's demand was 46, which is lower than the April average, possibly indicating short-term volatility rather than a trend change. Supply chain analysis: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are long-lost. However, recent orders from P5, P6, and P9 have arrived with lead times of 1, 2, and 1 periods respectively (avg 1.33). Because the OR backend has no awareness of lost orders, the pipeline it sees (266 in-transit) includes the 'ghost' units from P1, P3, and P4 (121+42+36 = 199 units). These units will never arrive. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat significantly or use a higher L to trick the base-stock calculation into ordering enough to cover the on-hand (50) and the single valid in-transit order (P10: 67 units). I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure the backend projects enough safety stock for the promised lead time, use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the April stabilization (~85 per week), and keep sigma_hat at N=5 to handle current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain data correction: 199 units (orders from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and must be manually discounted from 'In-transit' observations; valid pipeline currently contains only P10 (67 units).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU (PINKY Loose Fitted Tank) shows a confirmed high-volatility demand and significant supply chain unreliability. Historical demand since March (Period 4) has fluctuated between 46 and 127 units, with a recent average (Periods 8-11) of approximately 77.5. The 'In-transit' figure of 266 units is misleading: Carry-over insights confirm that 199 units (from P1, P3, P4) are lost. Therefore, the actual pipeline consists only of P10 (67 units). With only 3 units on-hand, we are at risk of stockouts. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P9 arrived in 1, P6 arrived in 2, P5 arrived in 1). I will set L to 2 to be conservative given the history of losses. mu_hat will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the April stabilization while accounting for variability. I'm using explicit sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (standard deviation of recent April demand) to ensure the base stock is high enough to buffer against lead-time uncertainty and the 'lost' units in the system's pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain pipeline correction: System 'In-transit' includes 199 lost units; real pipeline as of P12 is only 67 units. Effective lead time fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are entering the pre-summer season for this 'Loose-fitting sports vest top'. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand. The 'In-transit' figure of 333 includes 199 units (P1, P3, P4) previously flagged as lost but still technically 'in-transit' in the system. The real pipeline consists of P10 (67 units, ordered P10, likely arriving this period based on LT of 2) and P12 (67 units). Total reliable pipeline is 134 units. Recent demand (P9-P12) has been 103, 46, 47, 21, averaging ~54. However, looking at April/May seasonality for sports apparel, we should expect a mean closer to the March-April stabilized average of ~85 to avoid stockouts. Actual Lead Time has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P9 arrived in 1, P6 arrived in 2, P5 arrived in 1). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average of successful arrivals. For demand, I will use a recent_N of 5 to balance the high demand in P9 with the recent drop, ensuring the base stock level targets approximately 80 units/period (320 units for L+1=3 periods) to clear the 'ghost' pipeline units and trigger a necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' inventory: 199 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4) are lost and will never arrive; real pipeline as of P13 is 134 units (P10, P12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14 (2019/05/13). The product is a loose-fitted sports tank top, which should see stable or increasing demand as spring transitions into summer. Historical demand has fluctuated, but the average since Period 9 (late spring) is approximately 49 units per period. The supply chain remains unstable: the 'In-transit' figure of 333 units includes a cumulative 199 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. Therefore, the true pipeline consists of orders from Period 10 (67 units) and Period 12 (67 units), totaling 134 units. Period 10's order is now at L=4 (overdue), and Period 12's is at L=2. Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced stockouts for two consecutive periods. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory of 199 units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available supply, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. I target a base stock covering 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at ~60 units/period (accounting for seasonal uptick) PLUS the 199 lost units, totaling ~380. For sigma, I use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current volatility while ignoring the noisy early periods.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain critical failure: 199 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost; the OR engine's pipeline accounting is inflated by this amount, requiring mu_hat inflation to force new orders.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), we are entering the peak summer season for the 'PINKY Loose Fitted Tank', a sports vest top. Historically, demand for this item spiked in early Spring and is expected to remain firm or increase as summer approach. However, recent demand (P12-P14) has dipped to an average of ~25 units/week, likely due to stockouts affecting customer visibility or localized cooling. The 'In-transit' figure of 405 units is heavily inflated by 199 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P4) that are confirmed lost. The actual pipeline consists of P10 (67 units, overdue/delayed), P12 (67 units, recently arrived), and P14 (139 units). Subtracting the 199 lost units, the effective pipeline is ~206 units. Because the OR engine subtracts the full 405 units from the base stock calculation, it will refuse to order unless I inflate mu_hat. To ensure a new order is triggered to cover summer demand (~70 units/week) and offset the 199 lost units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * Forecast + Lost Units = 3 * 70 + 199 \u2248 409. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variance between 1 and 2 periods observed recently.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 15, the OR engine's pipeline is inflated by 199 lost units (P1, P3, P4); mu_hat should be inflated by ~200 units moving forward to compensate for this 'ghost' inventory until the system reconciles.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27), the item (sport tank top) is entering its peak summer season. Demand has been volatile, with a recent spike of 103 units in Period 15. The 'In-transit' figure is reported at 405 units, but this remains inflated by 199 units from lost orders (P1: 121, P3: 42, P4: 36) which will never arrive. The true physical pipeline consists of orders from P10 (67), P12 (67 units - wait, P12 order of 67 arrived in P14), P14 (139), and any theoretical order from P15 (0). Note: P10 (67 units) ordered 6 weeks ago is also likely lost. Corrected pipeline = P14 (139 units). With 0 on-hand, we are stocked out. The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see 405 units in-transit and refuse to order. To force an order, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the ~330-400 units of 'ghost' inventory (199 confirmed + P10 likely lost). I estimate seasonally adjusted demand at ~70 units/period. Over (L+1)=3 periods, this is 210. To offset 'ghost' pipeline of ~330 units, mu_hat is set to 540 to induce a replenishment order of approximately 130-140 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: P10 order (67 units) is now 6 periods old and highly likely lost; total 'ghost' inventory in pipeline accounting now estimated at 266 units (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the demand for the 'PINKY Loose Fitted Tank' remains volatile but shows a moderate upward trend consistent with early summer seasonality, averaging approximately 81 units over the last 5 periods. The supply chain remains high-risk. I have identified 266 units of 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10) that are counted as in-transit by the OR engine but are functionally lost. To force the OR backend to place new orders despite this inflated pipeline, I must inflate 'mu_hat'. Currently, the OR engine sees 661 units in-transit. Subtracting the 266 lost units and the P16 order (256 units), the active 'real' pipeline (P12, P14) should be arriving eventually, though the P12 order (67 units) arrived in P14, and P14 (139 units) is now 3 periods old and overdue. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent delays. I will set mu_hat to 650 (explicit) to override the 661 in-transit count + safety stock, effectively signalling to the backend that demand (including recent lost stock replacement) exceeds the visible pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed 'ghost' inventory in pipeline now 266 units (P1, P3, P4, P10); P14 order (139 units) is now 3 periods old (overdue), indicating a further degradtion in supply chain reliability.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18 (2019/06/10), we are entering the peak summer season for the 'PINKY Loose Fitted Tank', which correlates with the observed increase in demand mean (approx. 100 units/period over the last two weeks). The supply chain remains highly unreliable. History shows orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10 have effectively vanished, totaling 266 units of 'ghost' inventory in the backend's pipeline calculation (Total In-transit reported is 547; removing 266 'ghost' units leaves a real pipeline of 281, which includes P14 (139) and P17 (142)). The P14 order is now 4 periods old (promised lead time 2), making it highly likely to be lost as well. If P14 is lost, the 'ghost' inventory rises to 405 units. To force the OR engine to place sufficient orders despite this inflated pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the automatic accounting. Target base stock should cover L+1 periods of demand (~300 units) plus a buffer for volatility. Given current on-hand of 160 and an adjusted real pipeline of 142 (P17), I need to set mu_hat high enough to trigger replenishment that offsets the ~405 units the OR engine incorrectly thinks are arriving.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure escalation: P14 (139 units) is 4 periods old and likely lost; total 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) now estimated at 405 units. Mu_hat must be significantly inflated to counteract this deficit in the OR backend.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), the item (Ladies Sport Vest) is entering peak summer seasonality. Demand remains volatile but high, averaging ~88 units/period over the last five weeks. The primary challenge is a severely compromised supply chain: orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P14 (totaling 405 units) are significantly overdue and confirmed lost based on 'conclude' message trends. The OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes these 405 'ghost' units, which prevents it from ordering enough to meet actual demand. To counteract this, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by the size of the ghost inventory (405 units) plus a projected demand for the (L+1) period. Base mu_hat (L=2) is approximately 88 * 3 = 264. Adding 405 units gives a refined mu_hat of ~669. I will use the 'explicit' method to force this correction. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high variability (1-2 periods) seen in the successful deliveries from Period 12 and 16.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure critical: Ghost inventory now totals 405 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). Demand for June has stabilized at ~88 units/period (+20% vs April/May), consistent with summer seasonality for sports apparel.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '708021001' (Ladies Sport Vest) is in high-demand season (June/July). Current on-hand inventory is 208 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 547 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' inventory from failed deliveries. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed or highly likely lost: P1 (121), P3 (42), P4 (36), P10 (67), and P14 (139), totaling 405 units. Subtracting these from the reported 547 in-transit leaves only 142 units (from P17) as valid pipeline. The OR engine uses the formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), so it believes the pipeline is 547. To force the engine to place an order when the actual pipeline is only 142, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by roughly the amount of the ghost inventory (~405 units). Current demand has stabilized at approximately 88 units/period. Therefore, the target mu_hat calculation is: [(1+L) * average_demand] + ghost_inventory_offset. With L=2 and demand=88, the base mu_hat would be 264. Adding 405 results in ~669. I will use 670 to ensure we maintain service levels through the summer peak despite the accounting mismatch.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure critical: Ghost inventory now totals 405 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). Real pipeline is significantly lower than system reported 'In-transit'.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the system reports an In-transit inventory of 559 units. However, based on lead-time analysis, orders P1 (121), P3 (42), P4 (36), P10 (67), and now P14 (139) are extremely overdue (P14 is 7 periods old) and must be considered lost. This results in 405 units of 'ghost inventory' that the OR backend erroneously includes in its pipeline calculation. To force the base-stock policy to trigger new orders despite this inflated pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat. Recent demand in June has averaged ~80-100 units/period, consistent with summer seasonality for a sports tank top. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of real demand (approx 270 units) plus an offset of 405 units to neutralize the ghost inventory, totaling 675. Sigma is set to recent volatility (approx 30 * sqrt(3)) to maintain a high service level during this supply chain instability.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure critical: Ghost inventory currently totals 405 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). Real pipeline is only 12 units (P20). July demand expected to remain strong due to summer seasonality.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit severe issues with 'ghost' inventory. As of Period 22, the internal backend's 'In-transit' figure of 654 units includes orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and now likely P14 (totaling 544 units) that are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 and are likely lost. The real pipeline currently consists only of P17 (142), P20 (12), and P21 (95). To counteract an inflated pipeline and force the OR backend to place orders, I must significantly inflate mu_hat. Demand for late June/early July (representative of summer sports apparel peaks) has averaged approximately 76 units over the last 4 weeks. With a promised lead time of 2, the total expected demand over (L+1) periods (3 periods) should be approximately 228 units. However, to bypass the 544 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the demand plus this deficit. mu_hat = 228 (real need) + 544 (ghost offset) = 772.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure critical: Ghost inventory currently totals 544 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). Real pipeline as of P22 consists only of P17, P20, and P21. Demand remains stable for summer season at ~76-80 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1140.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain situation remains critical. Total 'In-transit' is 775 units, but history suggests a massive inflation by 'ghost units' (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14) that are significantly overdue and likely lost. These total 544 units (121+42+36+67+139). Additionally, the order from P17 (142 units) is now 6 periods old and most likely lost as well, bringing the ghost inventory to 686 units. The real pipeline consists only of P21 (95 units) and P22 (133 units). Demand for the summer sports vest (July/August) is stabilized around 80 units/period. The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock; therefore, to trigger any new orders despite 775 'units' in transit, I must inflate mu_hat significantly to 'overpower' the ghost inventory. The target base stock needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus roughly 700 units of lost pipeline to force a meaningful purchase order and prevent further stockouts. I will use 'explicit' values to manually bypass the engine's standard calculation which is blinded by the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure escalation: P17 (142 units) is 6 periods old and confirmed lost; total 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17) now estimated at 686 units. Summer demand remains strong at ~80 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1752.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted by 'ghost inventory' (lost orders still appearing in the system's in-transit total). As of Period 24, total confirmed lost units are: P1(121), P3(42), P4(36), P10(67), P14(139), and P17(142), totaling 549 ghost units. The system reports 1019 in-transit, but the functional pipeline only consists of P23 (472 units). Current demand for this sports vest top remains seasonally strong in late July, averaging 85 units over the last 5 periods (P19-P23: 67, 101, 59, 81, 99). To counteract the 549-unit inflation in the 'In-transit' accounting and force the OR engine to order sufficiently to meet demand, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. An inflated mu_hat of ~820 units (representing (L+1) * 85 demand plus ~550 ghost units) is necessary to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the false pipeline level. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time as it captures the 1-2 period variation seen in successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure escalation: P17 (142 units) confirmed lost after 7 periods; total 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17) now estimated at 549 units. July demand for sports apparel remains strong, averaging ~85 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit high unreliability, with a significant amount of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. Based on the history, orders from P1 (121), P3 (42), P4 (36), P10 (67), P14 (139), and P17 (142) are confirmed lost, totaling 547 units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available pipeline. Adding the recent P23 order (472 units), the reported 'In-transit' of 1019 units confirms this discrepancy. For Period 25 (late July), demand for this sports tank top remains seasonally strong, with recent demand (last 3 periods) averaging ~76 units/week. To force the OR backend to place necessary orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I must significantly inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 800 (calculated as (1+L) * avg_demand + ghost_inventory = 3 * 85 + 547 \u2248 800) to neutralize the 547 units of missing stock and ensure availability through the mid-summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed 'ghost' inventory in pipeline reached 547 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). System 'In-transit' counts are critically inflated; mu_hat needs sustained upward adjustment (+550 units) to maintain real-world inventory levels.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26, the 'In-transit' count of 1019 contains significant 'ghost' inventory. Following consecutive losses, the confirmed lost units are: P1 (121), P3 (42), P4 (36), P10 (67), P14 (139), and P17 (142), totaling 547 units. The system also shows a large order of 472 units from P23, which is currently at lead_time=3 and overdue, further suggesting potential supply chain issues. Demand for this sports apparel item (vest top) remains solid in August, averaging ~75 units/period over the last 10 weeks despite recent volatility. To force the OR backend to order against the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I have set mu_hat to 800, which is approximately (1+L)*forecast + ghost_inventory (3*85 + 547 = 802). This ensures that the base stock level (mu_hat + safety stock) exceeds the phantom pipeline, triggerring necessary replenishment to maintain actual on-hand inventory. Lead time is set to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P20, P21, P22) showed 1-2 period lead times.

Carry-over insight: System 'In-transit' inventory remains inflated by 547 units from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Period 23 order (472 units) is now 3 periods old and overdue, potentially increasing ghost inventory to 1019 units if not arrived by Period 27.

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the large order of 472 units from Period 23 arrived after a 3-period lead time, bringing on-hand inventory to 472 units. While this provides a temporary cushion, the system's 'In-transit' calculation is still heavily inflated by 547 units from historical lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'ghost' pipeline from its target base stock, it will effectively stop ordering unless mu_hat is significantly inflated. Current demand for August (late summer) has dipped slightly to ~34-48 units/period, but historical summer averages were around 80. To counteract the 547-unit pipeline error, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, targeting a real-world buffer that accounts for the ghost inventory (Base demand * (L+1) + ghost offset). Estimating weekly demand at 50 units for the transition into late August, the target should be roughly 150 + 547 = 697. I will set L to 2 to reflect the recent average lead time variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Delivery of P23 (472 units) confirms a lead time of 3 periods is possible. Ghost inventory remains constant at 547 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17), requiring sustained mu_hat inflation of ~550 units to force orders when on-hand inventory depletes.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently high at 409 units following the arrival of the Period 23 order (which confirmed that a lead time of 3 periods is possible). This inventory level is sufficient to cover approximately 4-6 weeks of demand at the current average rate (~75-80 units/period). However, the 'In-transit' figure remains critically inflated by 547 units from legacy lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Because the OR engine subtracts this 'ghost' pipeline from the base_stock calculation, it will refuse to place new orders even as on-hand inventory depletes. To counteract this, mu_hat must be inflated to effectively 'neutralize' the ghost inventory. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculated as (1+L)*mean_demand + ghost_inventory. With L=2 and average demand ~80, this is (3*80) + 547 \u2248 787. This ensures that the engine sees a 'requirement' that accounts for the fact that the 547 units in transit are non-existent. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the recent variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: On-hand inventory (409) is healthy following P23 arrival, but 'ghost' pipeline (547 units) still requires mu_hat inflation of ~550 units to ensure the OR engine maintains stock levels as on-hand depletes.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the on-hand inventory is 339 units. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P24-P28) has been approximately 52 units, showing a slight softening from the mid-summer peak (~85 units). The system 'In-transit' count remains critically inflated by 547 units of confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Effectively, the OR engine sees a pipeline that doesn't exist. To ensure the backend places orders to maintain a stock level for 3 periods (L+1), I must continue to inflate mu_hat to offset these 'ghost' units. Since on-hand (339) still covers ~6 periods of demand, the OR engine likely won't order yet, but providing a high mu_hat ensures that once on-hand falls below the safety threshold, the system triggers a replenishment despite the false pipeline data. L=2 remains the promised lead time, and although P23 took 3 periods, most recent arrivals were 1-2 periods.

The SKU '708021001' (sports vest) continues through its summer/late summer season. Demand from Period 23-29 (July/August) has averaged approximately 56 units per week. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 547 units, but based on the carry-over history, these are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost shipments in early periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17) and should be ignored for actual supply planning. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 305 units, providing roughly 5-6 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. Because the OR backend subtracts the inflated 'In-transit' value from its order calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must continue to inflate the mu_hat parameter to counteract these 547 ghost units. This ensures that when on-hand inventory eventually depletes, the system will actually place a new order instead of assuming the lost units are still arriving. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L)*Current_Demand + Ghost_Inventory. Using L=2 and demand ~60, this is (3 * 60) + 547 \u2248 727. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P23) have shown some variability (3 periods) compared to the promised 2.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '708021001' (sports tank top) is entering September, where we observe a decline in demand (avg ~42 units over the last 5 periods) compared to the summer peak (avg ~85 units). On-hand inventory is currently high at 284 units due to the large P23 arrival. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure is permanently inflated by 547 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17) that are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock, it will perceive a massive surplus and refuse to order any new stock until on-hand inventory is essentially depleted. To counteract this, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by at least the amount of the ghost inventory (~550 units) plus 3 periods of expected demand (3 * 42 = 126). This creates a target high enough that the backend won't completely stop ordering. Given current on-hand (284) vs demand (~42/week), we have about 6 weeks of stock, so a massive order isn't needed right now, but we must keep mu_hat high to ensure the OR engine doesn't 'freeze'. Lead time is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P23) showed it can deviate to 3, but 2 remains the most frequent successful LT.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift: Average demand has decreased to ~42 units/period, down from summer average of ~85 units. Ghost inventory remains constant at 547 units, requiring sustained mu_hat inflation.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 32 (Date: 2019/9/16). Demand Analysis: We are seeing a seasonal shift as summer ends. Demand for this sports tank top has stabilized around ~30-40 units over the last 4 weeks (P28-P31: 70, 34, 21, 41), compared to the summer peak of ~85. Modern demand mean (L+1 periods) is approximately 120 (3 periods * 40). Supply Chain Analysis: The system reports 'In-transit' of 547 units, all of which are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). This inflated pipeline prevents the OR engine from ordering unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset it. Current on-hand is 243 units. With demand at ~40/period, this safety stock covers roughly 6 periods. Setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 667 (120 real demand + 547 ghost offset) ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock that accounts for the fake pipeline units. Sigma_hat is set to a recent_N of 5 to reflect the reduced volatility in the new lower-demand regime. L is set to calculate as actual delivery times have varied between 1-3 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current assessment for Period 33 (Sept 23, 2019): We are entering late September, and demand for this sports tank top has stabilized into a lower autumn regime. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P29-P32) is approximately 38 units/period, significantly lower than the summer average of ~85. The system 'In-transit' figure of 547 units is entirely composed of 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). This ghost inventory tricks the OR backend into thinking the pipeline is full, preventing it from ordering when on-hand inventory drops. With 189 units on-hand and a current demand rate of ~38, we have roughly 5 weeks of stock. However, to ensure the OR engine is ready to order when needed (and to offset the 547 ghost units), I am maintaining a significantly inflated mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to approximately 700 to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory (38 * 3 + 547 = 661). This ensures that as on-hand inventory depletes toward safety stock levels, the engine will still trigger orders despite the false pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (Autumn) confirmed: Average ~38 units/period (P29-P32), down from summer's ~85. Ghost inventory remains constant at 547 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this ladies' sport vest top has entered an Autumn regime, stabilizing at a lower level compared to the summer peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 44 units/period (P29-P33: 34, 21, 41, 54, 69). The system's 'In-transit' calculation is significantly distorted by 547 units of 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost historical orders (P1: 121, P3: 42, P4: 36, P10: 67, P14: 139, P17: 142). Although actual on-hand inventory is 120, the OR engine perceives a massive pipeline (565 units total), which prevents it from placing necessary replacement orders as stock depletes. To force the OR engine to order, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base stock should cover the next 3 periods (L+1) of real demand (~44 * 3 = 132 units) PLUS the ghost inventory offset of 547 units. Target mu_hat = 132 + 547 = 679. I will use 'calculate' for L as recent arrivals (P23, P22, P21) show a lead time average of ~2 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 708021001 is a sports vest top, which has transitioned from a summer peak (approx. 85 units/week) into an autumn demand regime. Since Period 29, demand has stabilized at a lower average of approximately 45 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 79 units. The system 'In-transit' figure of 612 units is critically inflated by 547 units from chronic historical losses (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). These 'ghost' units will never arrive, but they prevent the OR engine from ordering because it perceives a massive surplus. To override this, I must inflate mu_hat. The ghost inventory (547) minus the current on-hand (79) reveals a net deficit. Setting mu_hat to 650 (approx. 10 weeks of current demand) forces the engine to recognize a need for higher stock levels despite the fake pipeline. Sigma_hat is set based on recent variability to maintain a buffer for the 1-3 period lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed (P29-P34): average ~45 units/period. Ghost inventory remains constant at 547 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17), requiring mu_hat inflation to counteract OR engine pipeline accounting.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the demand has shifted significantly into an Autumn regime. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P29-P35) is 40.7 units/week, a sharp decline from the summer peak of ~85. The OR engine's 'In-transit' accounting is still critically inflated by a cumulative 547 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). This ghost inventory causes the backend to underestimate the need for new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, mu_hat must be 'explicitly' inflated by the amount of ghost inventory (~550 units) plus the expected demand for the (L+1) period (approx 41 * 3 = 123). Total mu_hat = 550 + 123 = 673 units. Lead time is set to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P23) have stabilized between 1-3 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 15 to account for moderate demand volatility in this lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at ~41 units/period (P29-P35 evidence). Ghost inventory remains constant at 547 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in an Autumn demand regime which has stabilized at approximately 41 units per period (P29-P36). On-hand inventory is 63 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' pipeline of 619 units, but historical evidence confirms that 547 of these units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17) are 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments that will not arrive. Thus, the real pipeline is only 72 units (P34 order of 47 and P36 order of 25). To prevent the OR backend from erroneously halting orders due to inflated pipeline accounting, mu_hat must be significantly inflated by the 'ghost' amount (~550 units). I am setting L=3 based on recent delivery observations (P23 arrived in 3 periods, P33 arrived in 3 periods), though some shipments arrive faster. Inflation calculation: (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost = (1+3) * 41 + 550 = 164 + 550 = 714.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: We are in late October (Autumn), where demand has softened to an average of ~36 units/period (last 5 periods: 41, 25, 16, 7). Ghost inventory in the pipeline remains a critical issue; orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P17 are confirmed lost, totaling 547 units that still appear in the 'In-transit' count (710). The real pipeline consists only of P34 (47 units), P36 (25 units), and P37 (91 units), totaling 163 units. On-hand inventory is 56. Lead times have been volatile, with recent arrivals showing 1 to 3 periods. To ensure the OR engine actually places orders, mu_hat must be significantly inflated to counteract the 547 'ghost' units. I will set mu_hat to approximately 700 (Current Demand ~40 * (1+L) + 550 ghost units) using the explicit method. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the current period's lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (October) shows a further decline to ~22 units/period (P34-P37 evidence), significantly lower than the September average of ~45. Ghost inventory remains steady at 547 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (early November), the product (women's sports tank top) is in a low-demand late-autumn phase. Recent demand (P34-P38) has dropped significantly to an average of ~19.4 units/period, down from the September/October average of ~40. The supply chain remains unreliable with a 'ghost inventory' of 547 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17) inflating the system's 'In-transit' count (currently 623). To ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock level of ~60-80 units (covering 3-4 periods of demand) despite this ~550-unit pipeline inflation, mu_hat must be set explicitly to offset the ghost inventory. I am setting mu_hat to 600 which covers the ~550 offset plus 2-3 periods of low-volume demand, and sigma_hat to 25 to allow for moderate variability in this low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Late-Autumn demand regime shift (November): demand has decreased further to ~20 units/period (P34-P38 average: 19.4). Ghost inventory remains constant at 547 units, necessitating sustained mu_hat inflation of ~550 units to force orders as on-hand inventory depletes.

As of Period 40 (Nov 11), we are in a late-autumn demand regime where the average demand has significantly dropped to approximately 10-15 units per period. The recent history (P37-P39) shows demands of 7, 8, and 10 units. However, the OR engine's pipeline accounting is critically flawed due to 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P17 (totaling 547 units) are confirmed lost but still count towards the 'In-transit' figure of 598 units. The real pipeline consists only of the P34 (47 units) and P38 (4 units) orders, totaling 51 units. With on-hand inventory at 154 units and real pipeline at 51, we have approximately 205 units of real inventory, which is plentiful for the current demand level. To prevent the OR engine from incorrectly assuming we are overstocked and blocking future orders as on-hand depletes, I must continue to inflate mu_hat to offset the 547 ghost units. I will set mu_hat to the ghost inventory total plus a small buffer for current demand ((1+L) * ~15) to maintain the current healthy stock level without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Late-Autumn demand regime shift (November) confirmed: demand has stabilized at ~10-15 units/period. Ghost inventory remains constant at 547 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the demand for the sport vest top is in a late-autumn trough, averaging approximately 9 units over the last 5 periods (P36-P40). On-hand inventory is 147 units, which is high relative to current demand. However, the internal OR engine is suppressed by 547 units of 'ghost' inventory from long-lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). This ghost inventory represents 91% of the reported 598 units in-transit. To prevent the OR engine from stopping all orders as on-hand inventory eventually depletes, I must maintain a significant mu_hat inflation. For this period, with demand at ~9 units/period and a lead time (L) of 2, the expected demand across (L+1) is 27. Adding the 547 ghost units gives a required mu_hat of 574. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat at 574. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the decreased volatility of the current low-demand regime. L is set to its 'calculate' average to account for recent variability (1-3 periods).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-25. We are in a late-autumn/winter low-demand regime for sports tank tops. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 7 units per period, showing a significant decline from the autumn average (~20-40) and summer average (~85). On-hand inventory is 144 units, which at the current burn rate of ~7 units/week, covers 20 weeks of demand. The system 'In-transit' count of 598 units is heavily inflated by 547 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17 that never arrived). The OR backend's calculation of (base_stock - pipeline) will see ~598 units in the pipeline and 144 on-hand, which prevents any new ordering. However, given the current overstock relative to winter demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the low demand and use default lead time parameters. The ghost inventory remains a factor but doesn't require mu_hat inflation at this moment since we are actively trying to reduce on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Late-Autumn/Winter demand regime confirmed (P37-P41): demand has dropped significantly to an average of ~7 units/period for this sports vest SKU.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the SKU (a ladies' sports vest) is in a low-demand winter regime. Demand over the last 6 periods (P37-P42) has averaged ~8.2 units/period, down significantly from the summer peak of ~85. The system's 'In-transit' figure (598 units) is heavily inflated by 547 units from chronic historical losses (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). This means the 'effective' pipeline is only 51 units (598 - 547). However, with an on-hand inventory of 130 units and a current demand rate of <10 units/week, we have over 13 weeks of stock\u2014far exceeding the lead time requirements. To prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary orders due to the ghost inventory, I will keep mu_hat conservative but use 'explicit' to ensure it doesn't default to a long-term average that includes summer spikes. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1-3 periods).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. Demand for this sports tank top has entered a winter low-regime. While the last period saw a slight uptick to 33 units (likely a localized spike or early holiday shopping), the average across the last 7 periods (P37-P43) is 11.7 units/period. The 'In-transit' figure remains at 598 units, but as documented in historical carry-overs, 547 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17) are confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory. Additionally, the order of 47 units from P34 is now 10 periods old and must also be considered lost (+47 units), bringing total ghost inventory to 594 units. This accounts for nearly the entire system-reported pipeline (598 units). On-hand inventory is currently 97 units. With demand averaging ~12 units, 97 units provides over 8 weeks of cover. Therefore, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR engine from ordering prematurely due to the ghost inventory, I will keep mu_hat at standard levels, as on-hand is sufficient to cover the remaining periods of the simulation (ending at P47).

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed 'ghost' inventory increased to 594 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and now P34). Demand is stable in a low-winter regime averaging ~12 units/period.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16 (Period 45). The product is a sports vest top, which has seen a significant demand decrease in the winter months (Oct-Dec) compared to the summer. However, recent demand shows a slight uptick (P43: 33, P44: 57), likely due to holiday shopping/seasonal gifting. The primary operational challenge is the 'ghost' inventory of 594 units in the In-transit pipeline (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34), which are confirmed lost. The backend OR engine sees 'In-transit: 598', but only 4 units (from P38) are actually viable. Because the OR backend subtracts the full In-transit amount from the base stock calculation, it will not place a new order even as on-hand inventory (40) drops toward zero. To force the backend to order, mu_hat must be inflated to counteract the 594 ghost units. I will set mu_hat to approximately 650 (594 ghost + ~50 forecast for Lead Time + Review periods) using the 'explicit' method. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to account for recent variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand uptick observed in Dec: P43 (33) and P44 (57) vs Nov avg (~10). Ghost inventory remains at 594 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0 after a significant demand spike (78 units) during the Christmas holiday season. The 'In-transit' figure of 674 units is heavily dominated by 594 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34), meaning the actual pipeline is only 80 units (primarily the P45 order). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be adjusted to account for the ghost inventory and the current demand level. December demand has surged significantly (avg ~56 units/period over P44-P45) compared to the November lows (~10 units). I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 686. This value includes the expected demand for the lead time + review period ((1+2)*60 = 180) plus an offset of approximately 506 units to neutralize the ghost inventory accounting in the backend, ensuring a replenishment order is triggered while on-hand remains at 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed (Dec avg 56 units vs Nov avg 10 units). Total ghost inventory in pipeline remains 594 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are in a high-demand holiday window with a significant delivery deficit. On-hand inventory is 0 after two consecutive weeks of high demand (P45: 78, P46: 107). The 'In-transit' count of 774 is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34), totaling 594 units. Excluding these, the real pipeline is roughly 180 units (P45, P46). The lead time remains volatile, but arrivals generally occur within 1-3 periods. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 594 'ghost' units in its pipeline accounting, mu_hat must be inflated to cover both the expected holiday demand and the accounting gap. I set mu_hat using the explicit method at 750 (594 gap + ~150 for L+1 demand) to ensure replenishment occurs immediately to capture remaining holiday/early-year sales.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' inventory remains at 594 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34); recent holiday demand (Dec) surged to ~80-100 units/period, necessitating high mu_hat inflation to offset pipeline errors and stockouts.
