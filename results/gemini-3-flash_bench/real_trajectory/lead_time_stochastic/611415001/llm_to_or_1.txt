Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'Charlotte Brazilian Aza.Low 2p', a women's lingerie item. Based on the 5 weeks of historical demand (114, 133, 148, 86, 129), the mean demand is approx 122 units/week with a standard deviation of approx 24. Since we have no on-hand inventory or in-transit shipments, we need to establish a baseline order immediately. February is generally stable for this category, so I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent average of 122 and'recent_N' for sigma to capture recent volatility. The promised lead time is 2, so the backend will calculate base stock for (2+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 2 (2019/2/18). In Period 1, we placed an order for 161 units with a promised lead time of 2 periods. As expected per the 'Arrival Resolution' sequence, no units arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0). On-hand inventory is 0, resulting in 85 units of lost sales (demand=85). The product is 'Brazilian briefs' (womens lingerie), which usually has stable demand but can fluctuate with seasonal retail cycles. The provided historical data shows demand samples: 114, 133, 148, 86, 129. The Period 1 demand was 85. Average demand across these 6 samples is 115.8. Since L=2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. mu_hat target \u2248 115.8 * 3 = 347.4. sigma_hat will be based on recent volatility. We will use the 'default' lead time of 2 until evidence suggests otherwise, and 'recent_N' for demand to weight the recent samples, including the lower Period 1 demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/02/25). The SKU is women's lace Brazilian briefs. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show a mean of ~122 units per week (114, 133, 148, 86, 129). In the first two game periods, demand was 85 and 113. Total observed demand mean is approximately 115. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 320 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from P1 (161 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of P3 and will be visible in the P3 conclude message (ready for P4 decision). Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, there's no evidence to deviate from the promised lead time of 2. I will use the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use a recent_N of 5 to capture the most relevant demand levels from the pre-game and game history (avg ~122). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the observed volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is Women's Lingerie (Brazilian briefs). Historical demand (5 samples) shows a mean of ~122. Demand in Periods 1-3 was 85, 113, and 98 respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (161 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible now (Period 4 start). However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This signifies the lead time is likely longer than 2 periods or the shipment is delayed. Since 'arrived=0' is recorded for all completed periods, we have no confirmed actual lead time yet. We must maintain a robust pipeline. Total in-transit is 337 (Orders from P1, P2, P3). I will use 'explicit' for L to account for the observed delay (at least 3 periods) and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the slightly lower recent volume compared to pre-start samples.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is womens lingerie (Brazilian briefs). Historical data from Jan-Feb 2019 shows a mean demand of approximately 122 units/week. Game history shows demand for Periods 1-4 was 85, 113, 98, and 90. The average demand across these 9 weeks (5 historical + 4 game) is 112.2. A shipment ordered in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2), confirming the promised lead time holds. Period 1's order of 161 units is still in transit (it should have arrived in Period 3 if L=2, or Period 4 if we account for the observation delay). It has now been 4 periods since it was ordered. While it might be lost, I will assume it's slightly delayed for one more period before considering it fully lost. Current On-hand is 69. In-transit is 236 (P1: 161, P3: 17, P4: 58). I will use recent_N for mu_hat based on the 4 game periods to adapt to the slightly lower recent demand (avg ~96), and default for sigma and lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (2019/3/18). The SKU 611415001 is a Charlotte Brazilian lace underwear item. Historical demand samples (Jan/Feb) and game history (Feb/March) show a stable mean around 100-110 units per period. In Period 4, we saw an arrival from Period 2 (lead_time=2). However, the order from Period 1 (161 units) has not yet concluded and is likely lost or significantly delayed, as it is now 5 periods since it was placed (promised L=2). The order from Period 3 (17 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5's resolution (visible next period). Currently, on-hand is low (5) and in-transit is 236 (including the likely lost 161 units). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, the 161 'lost' units are inflating the pipeline, preventing new orders. To fix this, I will set mu_hat explicitly high for one period to force an order that compensates for the missing 161 units. Forecast demand (L=2) is approx 330 units. Adding 161 to 'bridge' the lost stock leads to mu_hat = 491. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU 611415001 (Womens Lingerie) has an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit pipeline of 430 units. Looking at the history, an order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (Lead Time = 2). However, the order from Period 1 (161 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since ordering, promised 2). This indicates a lost shipment for Period 1. Orders from Period 3 (17 units), Period 4 (58 units), and Period 6 (194 units) are still within or slightly beyond the typical lead time window. Demand has been relatively stable but slightly declining in recent weeks (85, 113, 98, 90, 64, 61). Due to the lost shipment, we have 0 on-hand stock and have suffered lost sales. The pipeline (430) is currently high relative to demand. I will set the Lead Time to 'calculate' to use historical averages. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent slightly lower demand trend (avg ~85) to avoid over-ordering given the high pipeline and potential for the overdue Period 3/4 orders to arrive suddenly.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (161 units) confirmed lost; no arrival by Period 7.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The SKU is a Women's Lingerie item. Historical demand (pre-game + game history) shows a mean around 98 units per week (min 48, max 148). Recent demand in the last 4 periods (P4-P7) has been lower, averaging 65.75 units/week. Lead time analysis: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2). Period 1 order is confirmed lost. Period 3 order (17 units) is now 5 periods past its order date and has likely been lost as well. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit consists of P4 (58 units) and P6 (194 units), totaling 252 active units (discounting the 178 units likely lost from P1/P3). Given L=2, the P4 order should have arrived in P6 (it didn't; it is now 2 periods late) and P6 should arrive P8. Because of the missing and late shipments, I am explicitly setting L to 3 to increase the base stock calculation, and using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to reflect the lower demand regime seen in the last month while maintaining high enough stocks to recover from zero on-hand inventory as soon as shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: P3 order (17 units) confirmed lost; no arrival by P8 (expected P5). Supply chain volatility remains high with significant late/lost shipment risk.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is lace Brazilian briefs, a stable lingerie item. Historical demand shows a downward trend: early samples were ~120, but the last four periods (P5-P8) have averaged ~55 units (64, 61, 48, 48). I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use the most recent 4 samples (N=4) to account for this lower demand regime. Regarding lead time, promised L=2. P1 and P3 orders (totaling 178 units) are confirmed lost, while P2 and P6 arrived exactly after 2 periods. The pipeline currently contains 236 units (58 from P4 and some portion from other un-concluded orders, though note P4 is now overdue as it was ordered 5 periods ago). Given the high loss rate, I will maintain L=2 for the OR engine but focus on the reduced demand mean to avoid excessive holding costs on a low-profit item ($1 profit vs $1 holding).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: average weekly demand decreased from approx 100 units (P1-P4) to 55 units (P5-P8). Order from Period 4 (58 units) is likely lost (now 5 periods late).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the current context shows a confirmed downward shift in demand. Following an initial average of approx. 100 units/period (P1-P4), demand has dropped to an average of 50.6 units over the last five periods (P5-P9). The product is lace Brazilian briefs, and as we move deeper into spring, the volatility seems to be settling at a lower mean. Inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 114) relative to this new demand regime. Regarding the supply chain, orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed or highly likely lost. The order from P6 arrived correctly with a 2-period lead time. However, because of the historical losses, the 'In-transit' figure (236) is misleading\u2014it includes ~236 units that will likely never arrive. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the new lower demand regime (~50 units/wk * 3 periods = 150). I use 'explicit' for L to maintain the promised lead time of 2, ignoring the 'lost' shipments that would skew a 'calculate' method. This approach signals the OR backend to account for lower required base stock while acknowledging the high on-hand inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (2019/4/22). History shows a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 5. Demand for P1-P4 averaged ~96 units, whereas demand for P5-P10 has dropped significantly to an average of ~44 units (64, 61, 48, 48, 32, 29). The most recent three periods (P8-P10) show an even lower average of ~36 units, suggesting a potential further decline as we move further into Spring. Regarding the supply chain, orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost. However, the order from P6 arrived on time (L=2) at P8. Currently, we have 85 units on hand and 236 units in transit (likely the order from Period 6 and any subsequent systematic orders not explicitly listed in logic history, though the 'In-transit' figure 236 minus the 194 that arrived at P8 suggests some residuals or hidden backend state). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%. Since on-hand inventory (85) already covers roughly 2-3 periods of current demand (~44/week), and we have a large pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the recent lower demand regime (N=6, average ~44) to prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs. L is kept at default (2) as the last successful delivery followed this.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean weekly demand for P5-P10 is 43.6 units, down from ~100 units in P1-P4 (-56% decrease). Post-holiday/seasonal decline in lingerie demand observed.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 12 (late April). Demand remains in the lower regime established after Period 4. The average weekly demand for the last seven periods (P5-P11) is 44.4 units, with the most recent three periods (P9-P11) averaging 30 units, suggesting a potential further softening as we move away from early spring peaks. On-hand inventory is 56 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 236 units includes orders from P1 (161 units), P3 (17 units), and P4 (58 units). Per the carry-over insights, these orders are structurally lost (6+ periods since ordering for a 2-period lead time). Consequently, effective in-transit inventory is 0. With L=2, the base stock (covering 3 periods of demand) should be approximately 90-130 units based on the recent regime (44.4 * 3 = 133 or 30 * 3 = 90). The OR engine will subtract the 'In-transit' figure (236) from the base stock. Because 236 is far higher than any reasonable base stock, the OR backend would normally order 0. To counteract this 'ghost' inventory and trigger a replenishment, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the lost units. I want to arrive at an order of approximately 50-70 units (about 1.5 weeks of supply) to buffer against demand and lead time volatility. Target base stock = 56 (on-hand) + 0 (real in-transit) + 60 (desired order) = 116. To make the backend order ~60 despite it thinking there are 236 in-transit, I set mu_hat = 116 + 236 = 352.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019/05/06). The product is a women's lingerie item. Historical demand analysis confirms a regime shift that occurred around Period 5. Demand in Period 1-4 averaged ~96 units, whereas demand in Periods 5-11 averaged ~44 units per week. In Period 12, demand was slightly higher at 49 units, but still consistent with the lower regime. Regarding lead times: P2 arrived in 2 periods; P6 arrived in 2 periods. However, orders from P1, P3, and P4 are long overdue and confirmed lost in Carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory is 296, but this includes P1 (161), P3 (17), and P4 (58) which are lost. Excluding lost units, the active 'In-transit' is 60 (ordered P12). On-hand is low at 7 units. Given the lost shipments, I will set L=3 via 'explicit' to provide a safety buffer against supply chain volatility, even though successful deliveries took 2 periods. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (P5-P12). Note: The backend OR engine sees the inflated 'In-transit' of 296; by increasing L and keeping mu_hat grounded in the recent mean (~44), the policy should still trigger an order to cover the (L+1) horizon because on-hand(7) + actual-in-transit(60) = 67, while (L+1)*44 = 176.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 46 units in Period 13. The demand regime shift noted since Period 5 continues to hold, with demand averaging approximately 43 units over the last 9 periods (P5-P13). The 'In-transit' stock of 296 units is composed of orders from Period 4 (58 units, now 10 periods late and likely lost), Period 6 (0 units pending, 194 arrived in P8), Period 12 (60 units, expected arrival Period 14), and a large unexplained balance (236 units if P4 is excluded). However, looking at the history, orders from P1 (161), P3 (17), and P4 (58) are all long past their lead time and likely lost. The current pipeline inventory reported as 296 units likely includes these lost units, which misleads the OR backend into under-ordering. To ensure availability given the current stockout, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the observed demand of ~43 units over the L+1 window (3 periods), requiring 129 units. I will set the Lead Time method to 'calculate' to use the observed 2-period performance for successful shipments, and reduce sigma_hat to reflect the lower volatility in the new demand regime (recent_N=5).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical data and the carry-over insights indicate a significant demand regime shift starting around Period 5. The mean weekly demand for P1-P4 was ~96 units, whereas for P5-P13 it averaged ~45 units. However, Period 14 saw a sharp spike to 96 units, similar to the pre-shift levels. This could indicate a late-spring seasonal increase in demand for 'Brazilian briefs'. The product is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Multiple early orders (P1, P3, P4) were lost, but recent orders from P6 and P12 arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 2 periods. Currently, 236 units are in-transit (orders placed in periods between 1 and 14 that haven't concluded - though P1, P3, P4 are confirmed lost). Given the stockout and the recent demand spike, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P12-P14) to capture the recent surge (avg ~64 units/week), while using a recent window for sigma_hat to account for this increased volatility. I will stick to the 'calculate' method for lead time as the system is now consistently hitting the 2-period mark for arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge observed in Period 14 (96 units) may indicate a seasonal recovery from the post-holiday slump, breaking the low-demand regime seen in P5-P13.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-27. Demand has increased significantly over the last two periods (96 and 122 units), confirming a shift away from the low-demand regime seen in April. This aligns with late-spring/early-summer seasonality for lingerie. On-hand inventory is 0, and all recent demand has resulted in lost sales. There is a total of 236 units in-transit, but based on history, orders from Period 1 (161), Period 3 (17), and Period 4 (58) are confirmed lost (lead times exceed 10+ periods). Excluding these lost units, the effective in-transit inventory is 0. Observed lead times for successful deliveries (P2, P6, P12) have consistently been 2 periods. To capture the recent demand surge and restore service levels, I will use an explicit forecast of 110 units per period. Since mu_hat requires a forecast for (1+L) periods (where L=2), the value is set to 330. Sigma_hat is set using a recent_N of 3 to reflect the high volatility (std ~15-20) associated with the current demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P14-P15 average demand is 109 units, a significant increase from the P5-P13 average of ~45. High risk of stockouts continues due to lost legacy shipments (P1, P3, P4).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand surge that began in Period 14 (likely late spring/early summer seasonality for lingerie). The average demand for the last 3 periods (P14-P16) is 95.7 units, a significant jump from the previous 45-unit average. I am using the recent demand of 3 periods (N=3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this surge. Regarding the supply chain, orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost. Recent successful arrivals (P2 arrived in P4, P6 arrived in P8, P12 arrived in P14) all show a consistent actual lead time of 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Therefore, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. The pipeline inventory (330 units) reflects the order placed in P16 plus earlier missing ones; however, the OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent over-ordering if it senses the pipeline is too high relative to the forecast. Setting mu_hat to reflect the new 95+ unit demand regime is necessary to recover from stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P14-P16 average demand is 95.7 units (vs ~45 in P5-P13), likely reflecting summer seasonality for under- and nightwear.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '611415001' (Womens Lingerie) is currently experiencing a sustained demand recovery following a post-holiday slump. The recent period (P17) demand of 60 units, combined with P14-P16 (96, 122, 69), establishes a new regime. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P14-P17) is approximately 86.75 units. I am setting N=4 to capture this 'summer seasonality' regime. Lead time analysis shows the most recent order (P16) arrived in Period 17, indicating an actual lead time of 1 period, which is faster than the promised 2 periods. However, given the history of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4), I will use 'calculate' to balance the recent performance with historical volatility. With on-hand inventory at 34 and no reliable in-transit shipments (legacy orders are likely lost), the OR backend needs to secure stock for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 1 period for P16 order (arrived P17). Recent demand regime (P14-P17) stabilized at an average of ~87 units/week, confirming seasonal recovery.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 611415001 is currently in a seasonal recovery phase (summer demand for lingerie). Recent demand (P14-P18: 96, 122, 69, 60, 85) averages approximately 86.4 units per week, significantly higher than the spring slump. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) with 236 units in-transit. These in-transit units likely include the lost legacy shipments (P1, P3, P4 totaling 236 units), which haven't arrived in over 14 periods and should be considered permanently lost. Since the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from the calculated base stock, the presence of these 'phantom' in-transit units will prevent the system from ordering. I will use 'explicit' values for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to force the OR engine to account for the current demand regime (~86 units/week) and the promised lead time (2 periods). I am setting mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 3 * 86.4 = 259.2 and sigma_hat = sqrt(3)*std(P14-P18) \u2248 1.732 * 24.5 = 42.4. This ensures the base stock target is high enough to trigger a new order despite the 236 units 'in-transit'.

Carry-over insight: P1, P3, and P4 orders (total 236 units) are confirmed lost (exceeding predicted lead time by 10+ periods). Demand for P14-P18 has stabilized at a higher seasonal mean of 86.4 units/week compared to the P5-P13 period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are in a seasonal recovery phase for lingerie (Brazilian briefs), with demand significantly higher than the spring slump. Weekly demand desde Period 14 has averaged approximately 84 units (Period 14-19: 96, 122, 69, 60, 85, 54). The most recent demand (P19) was 54, but historical averages suggest a mean around 80. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 260 units, but this includes 236 units from orders placed in P1 (161), P3 (17), and P4 (58) which are confirmed lost. The only reliable in-transit units are from P19 (24 units). Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline is only 24 units. To avoid a massive under-order by the OR backend (which counts the lost 236 units as incoming), I must set mu_hat explicitly to provide a target base stock that ignores the phantom inventory. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=2 and mean=80, we need approx 240 units + safety. However, since the OR engine will subtract the 260 units in-transit from whatever base_stock I set, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 and an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated to force an order that covers the 0 on-hand and the lost pipeline. I estimate demand at 80/week for the next 3 weeks (240 units). I'll use explicit methods to stabilize the forecast against the noise caused by stockouts and lost shipments.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. In the previous period (P20), demand dropped to 43 units, following a drop to 54 in P19. This suggests the high-demand summer peak (P14-P18 average ~86) may be tapering off or fluctuating. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit inventory of 260 units includes the likely lost orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 236 units). Only the 24 units ordered in P19 are expected to arrive (likely in P21 or P22). To avoid the OR backend under-ordering by counting these lost units as 'pipeline inventory', I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, and an expected average demand of ~60 units (blending recent peak and the most recent two-week drop), I set mu_hat = 180 (3 periods * 60). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher volatility seen since the P14 surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late June (P19-P20), with weekly demand dropping to ~48 vs the P14-P18 average of 86. Significant pipeline distortion exists: 236 units in-transit are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (July 2019), we are dealing with extreme stockouts and pipeline distortion. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit of 260 units is highly misleading: 236 units from P1, P3, and P4 have been confirmed lost for many periods (15+ periods overdue). Only the order from P19 (24 units) is genuinely in transit. Demand is volatile but recovering; while P19/P20 saw a dip (~48 units), P21 jumped to 110 units. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P14-P21) is approximately 80 units/week. Because the OR backend subtracts the phantom 'in-transit' units (260) from the base stock, it will likely calculate a negative order quantity and fail to replenish. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the 236 lost units. Base stock formula: mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat to roughly 240 (3 weeks * 80) + 236 (lost gap) = 476, I force the system to acknowledge the lost units and place a correction order. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P2, P6, P12, P16) generally follow the 1-2 period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Significant physical stockout in P19-P21 due to exhaustion of supply and phantom in-transit inventory. Current pipeline (260 units) contains 236 units of 'zombie' stock from P1, P3, and P4 that will never arrive. Demand remains seasonally strong for lingerie, averaging ~80 units despite mid-summer volatility.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15. We are in a peak summer demand period for women's lingerie (Brazil briefs). Recent demand (P21-P22) has spiked to 110 and 129 units, confirming a seasonal surge higher than the previous P14-P18 average of ~86 units. The inventory situation is critical: we have 0 on-hand inventory and a major pipeline distortion. The 'In-transit' count of 465 includes 236 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are definitively lost. Additionally, orders from P19 (24 units) and P22 (205 units) are pending. Subtracting the 236 lost units leaves a real pipeline of 229 units. To compensate for the 'phantom' stock and high demand, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to cover 3 periods (L+1=3) at a forecasted mean of 120 units (360). sigma_hat is set to 60 to allow for high volatility during this surge. I will use 'calculate' for lead time as the backend will handle the average of observed valid deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge accelerated in P21-P22: average demand is now ~120 units/week (+40% vs late Spring). Phantom pipeline inventory (lost P1, P3, P4 orders) remains at 236 units, causing persistent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-31.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 611415001 is currently experiencing a demand surge (P21-P23 avg = 108.6), likely driven by summer seasonality for lingerie. Most recent data shows P22 demand at 129 and P23 at 87. A critical inventory issue persists: the 'In-transit' count of 260 includes 236 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost (phantom inventory). The OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, so it will continue to under-order unless we compensate. To fix this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the (L+1) demand plus the 236 units of phantom inventory. Calculated target: Current demand mean (approx 100) * (L+1=3) + 236 units offset = 536. Lead time has recently shown efficiency (1 period for P16 and P22 orders), but I will stick to the promised L=2 for safety in the model. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility seen in recent weeks (P21-P23).

Carry-over insight: Lead time efficiency improved: P16 and P22 orders both arrived with lead_time=1. Phantom pipeline inventory (lost P1, P3, P4 orders) has reached 23+ weeks of delay; mu_hat must be adjusted explicitly to bypass this 236-unit 'zombie' stock in the OR logic.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/07/29), we face a critical planning challenge: 236 units in the pipeline (from Period 1, 3, and 4) are 'zombie' units that will never arrive, but they occupy the OR backend's 'Pipeline Inventory' slot. To force an order, we must artificially inflate mu_hat. Current demand has stabilized in a high-summer regime; P21-P24 demand averaged 99.5 units. Given the recent lead time of 1 period for P16 and P22 orders, we assume L=1. We must cover (1+L)=2 periods of demand (approx 200 units) PLUS neutralize the 236 units of lost 'in-transit' stock. Total base stock required is approx 436 units + safety stock. By setting mu_hat to 650, we ensure the backend (base_stock - 422 pipeline) results in a positive order to replenish the 46 units currently on hand before the next peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 26 (2019/8/05). Demand continues to be seasonally strong but volatile, with Period 25 seeing 138 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is approx 107 units. The most critical issue is the 'zombie' pipeline inventory: 236 units from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost but are still counted in the OR backend's pipeline calculations (Total In-transit: 604; Zombie: 236; Active: 368). The 604 units in-transit includes 236 lost, P19 (24 units - possibly lost/delayed), P22 (arrived), P24 (162 units - expected arriving now), and P25 (182 units - expected next week). To force the backend to place necessary orders and ignore the 236 lost units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Desired base stock to cover L+1 periods (using L=2 for safety, although 1 is common) at ~110 units/week is (2+1)*110 = 330 units. However, I need to 'offset' the 236 zombie units. The backend logic is: Order = base_stock - (On-hand + Pipeline). We want: Order = 330 - (0 + (604 - 236)). Therefore, effectively: Order = (330 + 236) - (0 + 604). I will set mu_hat to 566 to account for the lost stock and maintain service levels during this high-demand summer period.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed that P19 order (24 units) is now 7 periods late and likely lost, bringing total 'zombie' pipeline inventory to 260 units (P1, P3, P4, P19).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019/8/12), we are in a high-demand summer regime for women's lingerie (Specifically Brazilian lace briefs), with recent demand (P21-P26) averaging approximately 108 units/week. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The major challenge remains the 'zombie' pipeline: out of the 604 units listed as 'In-transit', 260 units (from P1, P3, P4, and now P19) are confirmed lost/overdue by 7-23 weeks and will not arrive. This phantom inventory prevents the OR engine from ordering sufficient stock to meet the current demand of ~108 units. To force the OR backend to place an order, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that accounts for both the genuine lead-time demand (3 periods at ~108 units) PLUS the 260 units of zombie stock that need to be offset in the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation. Forecasted demand for (L+1) periods = 3 * 108 = 324. Required mu_hat to bypass zombie stock = 324 + 260 = 584 units. This ensures the engine sees a deficit and triggers a replenishment of ~324 units despite the inaccurate in-transit figure.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 611415001 is currently in Period 28 (late August). Significant 'zombie' inventory exists in the pipeline from lost shipments: P1 (161), P3 (17), P4 (58), and P19 (24), totaling 260 units. These units will not arrive but the OR backend counts them toward the base stock, causing persistent stockouts. As of P28 START, on-hand is 100 units. The pipeline reported as 422 units includes these 260 zombie units, meaning the 'active' pipeline is only 162 units (the order from P24). Demand has stabilized into a high-season regime; the average demand for the last 5 samples (P23-P27) is 114.4 units. Since the OR engine uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to offset the 260 units of phantom inventory. Calculation: Target base stock for (L+1=3) periods is 3 * 114.4 = 343.2. To make the OR backend order the correct amount, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Zombie Inventory) = 343.2 + 260 = 603.2. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to account for the units that will never arrive. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P22, P25) have varied between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Total 'zombie' pipeline inventory confirmed at 260 units (P1, P3, P4, P19) as of P28. Current demand regime (P23-P27) average is 114.4 units/week.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for this lingerie SKU remains in a high-demand seasonal regime. Looking at the last 6 periods (P23-P28), the mean demand is 114.4 units/week. However, the last 3 periods have shown more stability around 93 units (113, 82, 86). I will use a conservative average for mu_hat based on the last 6 samples to ensure adequate stock for this high-demand period while acknowledging recent slight cooling. A critical issue is the 'zombie' pipeline inventory. The In-transit total is 504 units, but significant history confirms that orders from P1 (161), P3 (17), P4 (58), and P19 (24) are lost, totaling 260 units of phantom inventory. The OR backend subtracts the entire in-transit amount from the base stock calculation; to prevent under-ordering, I must set mu_hat explicitly to 'bypass' this 260-unit error. Effectively, I am adding the 260 units of lost pipeline back into the target stock level. Lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods recently; I will use 'calculate' to reflect the average actual performance. Sigma_hat is set to default to cover general volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: P23-P28 average demand is 114.4 units/week. P28 confirms total 'zombie' pipeline inventory remains at 260 units (P1, P3, P4, P19), which will never arrive and must be accounted for in replenishment logic.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Demand remains high (P23-P29 average is 114.7 units/week). Total 'In-transit' inventory is 590 units. However, based on extensive history, 260 of these units are 'zombie' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P19) that are confirmed lost and will never arrive. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The calculation is: Target Inventory = (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand. With L=2 (promised) and current demand averaging ~115, a standard target would be 345 units. I must add the 260 zombie units to this target to offset the backend's subtraction of total pipeline inventory. Explicit mu_hat = 345 (operating target) + 260 (offset) = 605. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will stick to 'calculate' for L. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7, covering the high-demand regime) to capture current volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits significant pipeline distortion due to lost legacy orders. Total 'zombie' stock is 260 units (P1: 161, P3: 17, P4: 58, P19: 24), which effectively counts against the base stock in the OR engine but will never arrive. The current demand regime (P23-P30) shows a mean of 115.8 units/week. To force the OR backend to place orders despite the phantom 260-unit pipeline, mu_hat must be set to 'exhaust' this ghost inventory while covering the actual (L+1) demand. Current lead time (L) is stable at 2 periods. Target Stock = (L+1) * \u03bc + Ghost Inventory. Expected (L+1) demand is 3 * 115.8 = 347.4 units. Total adjusted mu_hat = 347.4 + 260 = 607.4. Sigma_hat is calculated using the std of the current high-demand regime (approx 24.3 over P23-P30), scaled by sqrt(L+1), which is approximately 42.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand regime (P23-P30) mean is 115.8 units/week. Zombie inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P19) confirmed at 260 units. These must be manually offset in mu_hat 'explicit' values to ensure replenishment happens.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand has entered a higher-volume regime since Period 23, with an average demand of approximately 110 units per week. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 608 units is heavily distorted by 260 'zombie' units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, and P19) that will never arrive. The OR backend uses the formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), so to force replenishment, mu_hat must be set to explicitly cover both the desired target inventory and the phantom 260-unit pipeline. Recent lead times have been 2 periods. To calculate mu_hat: I'm targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods (L+1) of demand at ~110 units/period (~330 units) PLUS the 260 phantom units to offset the pipeline calculation, totaling 590. Setting L=2 (promised) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (P27-P31) to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33, the SKU 611415001 (Womens Brazilian briefs) shows a continuing pattern of 'zombie' pipeline inventory. Total in-transit is 508 units, but 260 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P19 orders). The effective pipeline is actually 248 units (508 - 260). The OR backend logic calculates orders as (base_stock - pipeline), so 'zombie' stock causes persistent under-ordering. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. In the most recent regime (P23-P32), mean demand is 114.5 units/week. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 343.5 units. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 260 phantom units, I add the 260 units to the target: 343.5 + 260 = 603.5. I will round this to 604 for mu_hat. This 'explicit' value compensates for the lost inventory that will never arrive. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (late September), the demand for this SKU (lingerie briefs) remains high with a notable spike in Period 33 (163 units). The inventory situation is critical due to a total of 260 'zombie' units in the pipeline (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P19) that are confirmed lost and will never arrive. These phantom units mislead the OR backend's order calculation, as it believes the pipeline is fuller than it physically is. Total In-transit is currently 566; after subtracting the 260 'zombie' units, the 'real' pipeline is 306 units. Current demand from P23-P33 has averaged approx 104 units/week, but recent data shows increasing volatility and high-end spikes. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the zombie stock. Calculation: (Target Stock for L+1 periods) + (Zombie Pipeline Adjustment). With L=2 (promised), target stock for 3 periods at 115 units/week = 345 units. Adding 260 units to offset the zombie stock leads to an explicit mu_hat of 605. This forces the backend to place an order despite the 566 'in-transit' figure. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (recent volatility) multiplied by sqrt(3).

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Sustained demand regime (P23-P33) confirmed at approx 105 units/week. Significant 'zombie' pipeline inventory remains at 260 units (P1, P3, P4, P19), necessitating manual inflation of mu_hat by 260 units to trigger replenishment.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 611415001 is currently in a state of physical stockout (On-hand: 0) as of Period 35. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 605 units is heavily distorted by 260 units of 'zombie' stock (orders P1, P3, P4, P19) that are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders; therefore, the 260 phantom units are preventing the system from placing necessary replenishment orders. To counteract this, I must explicitly inflate the 'mu_hat' parameter by 260 units. Current demand (P23-P34) remains stable around 105 units/week. Using the promised lead time (L=2), the base mu_req = (1+L) * mean_demand = 3 * 105 = 315. Adding the 260-unit offset, the explicit mu_hat is set to 575. Sigma_hat is calculated using a recent window (N=12) to capture current volatility while ignoring the early-year regime, resulting in a value consistent with the sqrt(1+L) * std formula for this period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained demand regime (P23-P35) with a mean demand of approximately 104 units per week. However, the system is facing a significant 'zombie inventory' issue. There are 260 units in-transit from orders placed in Period 1, 3, 4, and 19 that are confirmed lost and will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts all in-transit inventory from the base stock to calculate the order quantity, it believes there is a massive surplus, leading to persistent stockouts (on-hand is 0, sold 0 for the last two periods). To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, inflating it by the 260 units of zombie stock. Specifically: Estimated Demand over (L+1) periods is 104 * 3 = 312. Adding the 260 units to offset the phantom pipeline gives an explicit mu_hat of 572. I will use a default L (2) to align with promised expectations, and sigma_hat will be set using recent_N (N=13, covering the current regime) to capture current volatility accurately.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are managing a persistent stockout situation. Demand for lingerie (Brazilian briefs) remains robust, averaging 102.8 units/week over the last 5 weeks. Despite this demand, on-hand inventory is 0. The current 'In-transit' figure of 547 units is heavily distorted by 'zombie' inventory: P1 (161), P3 (17), P4 (58), and P19 (24) are confirmed lost, totaling 260 units. Additionally, recent orders from P34 (39 units) are still within a reasonable window, but the system is blind to the fact that nearly half the pipeline will never arrive. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 547 units in-transit, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target base stock. I calculate desired base stock as (L+1) * mean_demand + 260 (zombie offset). With L=2 and mean_demand ~103, base stock should be ~309 + 260 = 569. I will set mu_hat to 570 to ensure the backend sees a need for replenishment beyond the perceived in-transit surplus. sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a safety buffer for the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed total 'zombie' pipeline inventory remains at 260 units (P1, P3, P4, P19). Recent 5-period demand average (P32-P36) is 95 units, though long-term regime (P23-P36) is higher (~104). Supply chain remains unstable with lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory is reported as 570 units, but 260 of these (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 19) are 'zombie' units that are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is actually 310 units (570 - 260). The OR backend naturally subtracts the full 570 units from its base stock calculation. To force the system to replenish correctly based on the effective pipeline, I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory offset. With L=2, (L+1)=3. Current demand (P23-P37) averages 105 units/week. Target base stock = (3 * 105) + 260 = 575. Setting mu_hat to 575 ensures the order = max(0, 575 - 570) = 5 units (minimum), but more importantly, it prevents the back-end from under-ordering in future periods due to the phantom inventory. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P33 took 3 weeks); I will stick with the promised L=2 for stability while monitoring P34 and P37 arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing a inventory crisis due to 260 units of 'zombie' pipeline inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P19) that are permanently lost but still registered by the OR backend as 'in-transit'. This causes the backend to under-order, leading to the current on-hand inventory of 0 and frequent stockouts. Recent demand (P33-P38) is highly volatile but averages approximately 116 units/week, with a significant spike of 151 in P38. Lead times are inconsistent, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 260 'zombie' units, I must explicitly set mu_hat. The target base stock should cover L+1 periods of demand (~3 periods * 115 units = 345 units) PLUS the 260 ghost units to neutralize them in the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation. Total target mu_hat = 345 + 260 = 605. I will use L=2 (promised/recent average) and set sigma_hat explicitly to account for high demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand volatility remains high; P37-P38 average demand reached 143.5 units. Total 'zombie' pipeline inventory (lost P1, P3, P4, P19) remains at 260 units. Recent arrivals (P37 order) confirmed lead time of 1, but P33 took 3 periods, indicating continued supply chain instability.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the mid-November period (P40), which typically sees a significant demand increase ahead of the holidays. Recent demand (P37-P39) shows high volatility with a recent average of ~114 units/week, though P39 dropped to 55. A critical constraint is the 260 units of 'zombie' pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P4, P19) which the OR engine incorrectly counts as available. To trigger replenishment, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level, effectively neutralizing these lost units. My target base stock needs to cover upcoming holiday demand (estimated at ~120-130/week) plus the 260-unit dead stock. With lead time L=2, base stock = (1+L)*demand + zombie_offset. (1+2)*125 + 260 = 635. I will set mu_hat to 635. sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for high volatility (std of recent samples is ~50, scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2248 1.73).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand ramp-up expected: P37-P38 showed mean demand of 143.5. Total 'zombie' pipeline inventory remains 260 units, requiring manual mu_hat inflation of +260 units to bypass OR logic calculation lags.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system is entering the mid-November peak demand season for lingerie. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with a high mean of 143.5 in P37-P38 followed by a drop to 35-55 in P39-P40, likely due to local stockouts or pre-Black Friday lulls. However, seasonality suggests an imminent ramp-up. The pipeline inventory (635 units) is heavily distorted by 260 units of 'zombie' stock (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P19) that will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend triggers replenishment despite this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock by estimating demand for the review and lead period (3 periods total: L=2 + 1) at approximately 120 units per week (to account for upcoming holiday volume), totaling 360 units, and then adding the 260-unit zombie stock offset. This results in a mu_hat of 620. This allows the logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) to correctly identify a need for fresh stock. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Maintained mu_hat inflation of +260 units to compensate for persistent 'zombie' pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P4, P19).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '611415001' is entering late November, which is a critical period for lingerie demand (approaching Black Friday and the holiday season). Although demand in P39-P41 was seasonally low (avg 37.6), the system must prepare for the imminent holiday surge, which historical context and previous carry-overs (P14-P15 recovery) suggest will be significant. The 'zombie' pipeline inventory remains a major technical hurdle. As of P42, there are 582 units in-transit, but 260 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P19). The OR backend sees the full 582 units and will therefore severely under-order, believing the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method, adding an offset of 260 units to the projected demand. I am forecasting a base weekly demand of 115 units (returning to the P23-P30 regime levels) and applying the (1+L) multiplier with L=2, resulting in a base mu_hat of 345. Adding the 260-unit zombie offset results in a final mu_hat of 605. This ensures the OR logic accounts for the physical shortfall. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture recent volatility during this transition period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the SKU is in a post-Black Friday but early-December holiday demand phase. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (P38-P42) has been volatile (151, 55, 35, 23, 46), averaging 62 units. However, we anticipate a December demand increase for lingerie. The 'In-transit' quantity of 582 units still includes 'zombie' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P19) totaling 260 units that have never arrived and are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire in-transit pipeline (582) from the base stock calculation, it underestimates the need to order by 260 units. To force the OR backend to place an order, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (1 + L) periods of expected demand plus the 260-unit zombie offset. Assuming an expected demand of ~80 units/week and a lead time of 2, the required coverage is ~240 units. Adding the 260-unit offset results in a mu_hat of 500. Sigma_hat is set using recent demand volatility (N=5) to maintain responsiveness to current trends.

Carry-over insight: Zombie pipeline inventory persists at 260 units (P1, P3, P4, P19). Demand regime in late Nov/early Dec (P39-P42) dropped significantly compared to Oct levels, but seasonal holiday demand is anticipated for Dec.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 occurs during the peak holiday shopping season in early December for lingerie. Current on-hand inventory is critically low (7 units) and demand has stabilized after a late-November dip. However, a significant 'zombie' pipeline inventory of 260 units (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P19) is confirmed lost and will never arrive. Because the backend OR logic subtracts this pipeline from the target base stock, it will fail to order enough physical stock unless manually offset. To trigger a replenishment that covers the upcoming holiday weeks, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target mu_hat by taking a baseline demand for (1+L) periods (~3 periods) plus the 260-unit zombie offset. With recent demand averaging ~110 units/week during peaks and current arrivals taking up to 3 periods, I anticipate a need for ~120 units per week. Target mu_hat = (120 * 3) + 260 = 620. This ensures the backend places an order despite the phantom 260 units. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile 1-3 period actual delivery range.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak anticipated for Dec 10-25. Zombie pipeline inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P19) remains constant at 260 units, necessitating manual mu_hat inflation for the remainder of the game.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (Dec 16), entering the week of peak holiday demand for lingerie. Demand in the immediate post-Black Friday period (P41-P44) has been lower (average ~33 units), but we anticipate a sharp spike as the Dec 25 holiday approaches. The inventory situation remains critical: 'On-hand' is 0, and the 'In-transit' figure of 613 units contains 260 units of 'zombie' inventory (orders P1, P3, P4, P19) that are permanently lost. To force the OR backend to place orders despite this phantom pipeline, I must continue to manually inflate the mu_hat parameter. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for expected holiday demand (~120 units/week) across (1+L) periods, plus a 260-unit offset to neutralize the zombie inventory. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility while ignoring the early-game spikes. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the recent instability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Total 'zombie' pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 260 units (P1, P3, P4, P19). These are confirmed lost and will never arrive, requiring a perpetual 260-unit offset in the mu_hat parameter to ensure replenishment functions correctly.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the holiday shopping season for lingerie. Period 45 showed a significant jump in demand to 117 units, confirming the anticipated holiday spike. Pipeline inventory is currently 620 units, but 260 of these (from P1, P3, P4, P19) are 'zombie' units confirmed lost over many months and will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (620) from the target base stock. To compensate for this 260-unit phantom inventory and trigger necessary replenishment, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the base weekly demand at 110 units (reflecting the recent P45 spike and holiday timing). Following the base stock logic of (1+L) * mu, with L=2, the calculated mu_hat should be 3 * 110 = 330. I then add the 260-unit zombie offset to this, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 590. This ensures the OR logic accounts for the missing stock. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (standard deviation across recent volatile periods) scaled by sqrt(3), resulting in an explicit value of 86.6.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak confirmed: Period 45 demand reached 117 units. Total 'zombie' pipeline inventory remains at 260 units (P1, P3, P4, P19).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the transition from the high-demand December holiday peak (demand was 117 and 135 in the last two periods) into the January post-holiday regime. Historical data from P1-P4 (Feb) suggests demand settles around 85-110 units. The current pipeline shows 620 units, but 260 units are 'zombie' inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P19) that will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this phantom stock, mu_hat must be manually inflated. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it at 600. This represents a 3-week demand forecast (~340 units for L=2) plus the 260-unit zombie offset. This pushes the base stock high enough to trigger replenishment as we exit the peak season and ensure on-hand inventory is rebuilt for early 2019 demand. Periodic lead times have been volatile (1 to 3 periods), so I'll use the 'calculate' method for L to reflect this uncertainty.
