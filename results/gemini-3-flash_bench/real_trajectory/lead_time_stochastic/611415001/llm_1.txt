  "rationale": "The product is 'Womens Lingerie' (Brazilian briefs), which is highly relevant to the upcoming Valentine's Day (Feb 14, 2019). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 122 units, though it reached a peak of 148 in late January. Since the current period starts on Feb 11, we are in the peak demand week for this category. However, with a promised lead time of 2 periods, an order placed now (Period 1) will not arrive until the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 3. This means we will inevitably stock out in Period 1 and Period 2 as we currently have 0 on-hand inventory. The order placed now must cover demand starting from Period 3. Given the high holding cost relative to profit (Ratio = 1:1, Critical Ratio = 0.5), I will target the historical median/mean demand (122 units) without aggressive safety stock. To account for the pipeline and ensure we have stock for Period 3 and onwards, I will order enough to cover three periods (P3, P4, P5), assuming we will continue to order weekly. I'll place an initial order of 366 units to establish a pipeline that accounts for the (L+1) window, targeting 122 per period.",

Historical data shows a clear shift: initial weeks (Feb) had demand ~100-110, which decreased to ~60 (March), then settled into a low-volume regime of ~30-50 (April/May). The last three weeks have seen demand of 29, 49, and 46. Moving averages suggest a forecast of approximately 45 units per week for the upcoming period. Current on-hand is 18. There is a massive in-transit volume of 426 units. These in-transit units represent: the lost P1 order (366 units, which we must assume will not arrive as it is 13 weeks overdue), and the P13 order (60 units). The P13 order is expected to arrive during P15 (lead time = 2). Current inventory strategy: We have 18 on-hand. P14 expected demand is ~45, leading to a likely stockout of ~27 units this period. However, since the P13 order of 60 is expected next period (P15) and we are carrying heavy holding costs relative to profit ($1:$1), we must avoid over-ordering given the low demand regime.

After a high-inventory arrival in P26 and P27, our on-hand inventory is now 59 units.

Wait, the in-transit field says 981 units, but historical orders for P24, P26, and P27 only total 350. The discrepancy suggests a large unaccounted-for shipment or logic error in the system's 'In-transit' sum. However, based on recent lead times (1-3 periods), the P24 order (150 units) is overdue (ordered P24, current P29) and may be lost, but P26 and P27 (100 each) are due immediately. Given the current 59 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~100, I face a stockout risk if nothing arrives this period. However, placing another order when there's a massive (though possibly ghost) 'In-transit' quantity and 200 units (P26, P27) expected to land in P29-P30 is risky for holding costs.

  "rationale": "The SKU is a Charlotte Brazilian lace underwear set. Demand analysis shows a significant holiday regime shift starting Period 37, with demand peaking at ~136-151 before a dip to 55 in Period 39 (likely a localized fluctuation or mid-month lull). Historically, early-year demand was ~120 units/week. Given we are in mid-November (2019/11/11), we anticipate high volatility and potential Black Friday/Holiday spikes. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods). Most importantly, the supply chain is plagued by a ~40% attrition rate. In-transit shows 1581 units, but 1251 units are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights (Orders P1, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). The current 'valid' pipeline consists of P38 (150 units), P39 (300 units), and the order placed this period. Current on-hand is 65. With expected weekly demand between 100-150 units, and potential delivery failure risks, I need to ensure at least 3-4 weeks of demand coverage in the reliable pipeline (approx 450-600 units). I have 450 units 'reliably' in transit plus 65 on hand. To account for a 40% loss probability and upcoming holiday peaks, I will place a substantial order to bolster the safety stock.",

Historically, P37-38 saw a significant holiday spike (~145 units/week), but P39-40 demand dropped sharply to 55 and 35 units. This volatility is common before Black Friday/Cyber Monday peaks in late November. The 'In-transit' figure of 1831 is highly misleading due to 1251 confirmed lost or non-arriving units (P1, 13, 14, 17, 19, 24, 26, 29, 34). The actual reliable pipeline consist of: P38 (150 units - now L+3 overdue), P39 (300 units - L+2), and P40 (250 units - L+1). Given that the P38 order (150 units) is now overdue (L+3) and the high historical attrition rate (~40%), I must treat it as potentially lost. On-hand is low (30). To prepare for the imminent late-November holiday surge while accounting for the high probability of delivery failure, I will place a substantial order. The goal is to ensure coverage for a 3-period lead-time horizon (L+1) assuming demand reverts to the 110-140 range for peak season.",

Historically, demand for these items spikes around specific events like Valentine's Day (early Feb) and the Christmas/New Year holiday season.

Reviewing recent demand, there was a spike in late October (P37-38 at 136-151 units), followed by a sharp drop-off (P39-41 at 55, 35, 23 units), suggesting a pre-Black Friday/Christmas lull. I anticipate demand will surge again in the coming 2-4 periods for the holiday peak. Regarding the supply chain, the attrition rate remains high (~40% lost). The 'In-transit' figure of 1781 is highly misleading; identifiable lost/undelivered orders include: P1(366), P13(60), P14(60), P17(100), P19(45), P24(150), P26(100), P29(100), P34(150), and P38(150), totaling 1481 units.

Looking at historical demand for this 'Brazilian briefs' SKU, we saw a massive spike in late October (reaching 151 units) followed by a November lull (averaging ~35 units/week). Based on retail patterns, a second, larger spike is expected in early-to-mid December. The 'In-transit' figure (1931) is heavily skewed by a documented 40% attrition rate; specifically, 1481 units are confirmed or likely lost (Orders from P1, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34, P38). The functional pipeline consists only of P40 (250 units), P41 (250 units), and P42 (150 units). On-hand inventory is currently 261 units. Given the lead time is highly volatile (1-3 periods) and the potential for holiday-driven stockouts, I need to maintain a robust buffer.

Looking at In-transit inventory, the system reports 1581 units, but based on the Carry-over Insights (P43), 1481 units are confirmed or likely lost (Orders P1 through P38 excluding successful arrivals). This leaves only P42 (150 units) and P43 (150 units) as reliable future arrivals. Current On-hand is 738 units. The November demand was low (23 units in P43), but with the holiday season approaching, I expect a regime shift upward toward 120-150 units/week. My current inventory (738) plus reliable pipeline (300) equals 1038 units. This is sufficient to cover approximately 7-8 weeks of demand even at peak holiday rates.

As we approach late December (Christmas/Boxing Day), a potential secondary seasonal peak exists for lingerie, but the current on-hand inventory (699 units) is extremely high relative to recent demand (39 units last period).

The functional pipeline consists of orders from P42 (150 units) and P43 (150 units). With 699 units on-hand and 300 reliable units in-transit, total availability is ~999 units. Even if demand returns to the October peak of ~150/week, I have nearly 7 weeks of cover.
