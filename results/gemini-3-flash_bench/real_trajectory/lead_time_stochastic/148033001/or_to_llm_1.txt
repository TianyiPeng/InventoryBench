The OR recommendation is 65 units based on a promised lead time of 2 periods. Given that the promised lead time is 2, an order placed now (P1) will arrive in P3. Therefore, our current inventory and this order must cover demand for P1, P2, and P3. Total expected demand for 3 periods is approximately 150 units. Currently, on-hand and in-transit are both 0. While the OR recommendation is capped at 65, this appears too conservative for an initial stocking phase where we have zero safety stock and zero pipeline.

Given the stockout in P1 and the consistent demand near the high end of historical samples (58-60), I want to ensure we don't stock out again once the pipeline clears. The OR cap is designed to smooth, but since we are starting from a deficit (0 inventory), following the OR recommendation to build the pipeline is prudent.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (58, 42, 40, 50, 60) average 50 units/week. Recent actual demand in Period 1 (58) and Period 2 (70) shows a slight upward trend (64 avg). The product is '20 denier stay-ups', which is a stable staple item, but February/March in many markets sees a transition in hosiery needs. 4. OR Analysis: The OR agent recommends only 8 units because its pipeline inventory (170) nearly covers its calculated base stock for a 3-period window (L+1 = 3). 5. Strategy: We need to cover demand for Periods 3, 4, and 5 (L+1 periods). Estimated demand for these 3 periods is ~180-195 units (based on the recent avg of 65). Total pipeline is 170.

The order from Period 1 (100 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the actual lead time is likely 3 periods (order P1 arriving in P4) or shipments are delayed. Since lead time = 2 means P1 arrives in P3 resolution, and it didn't, we are facing at least a 3-period lead time. Pipeline math: We have 190 units in transit vs. a total demand expectation of ~150-180 units over the next 3 periods (average demand ~53). The OR recommendation is 0 because the pipeline inventory (190) already exceeds the calculated base stock level for a 2-period lead time. However, given the potential lead time drift to 3 periods and the fact that we have had 0 sales due to 0 inventory (stockouts in P1, P2, P3), we need to ensure we don't under-order if the pipeline is actually stalled. But at this moment, 190 units is sufficient to cover 3.5 periods of demand once they start arriving.

Period 2 order (70 units) arrived in Period 4 exactly on time (L=2).

If P1 is lost and P3 arrives today, I will have 46 units to meet demand for P5 (avg ~50), putting me at high risk of stockout. \n4. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation (24 units) assumes the pipeline (120 units) is valid. Because the 100 units from Period 1 are highly likely lost, the OR quantity is dangerously low. \n5. **Adjustment**: I need to replace the missing 100 units.

The OR recommendation is 0, based on an uncapped pipeline inventory of 195 units. However, my 'Carry-over Insights' track two lost shipments: Period 1 (100 units) and Period 3 (20 units), totaling 120 units that will never arrive. Adjusting the functional pipeline: 195 (total in-transit) - 120 (lost) = 75 units (which corresponds to the order placed in Period 8). Lead times are erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods. Currently, we have 93 units on hand to cover Period 9 demand (~60-70 units). The 75 units in transit from Period 8 are expected to arrive in Period 9 or 10. To safeguard against the demonstrated unreliability of the supplier and the sustained demand regime of ~65 units/period, I will place an order of 65 units.

Historically, P1 (100) and P3 (20) are confirmed lost. P2 arrived at L=2. P5 arrived at L=1. P6 arrived at L=2. P7 arrived at L=1. Reliability has stabilized for recent orders, but two shipments are permanently lost. 3. Pipeline: In-Transit is 260. Subtracting the 120 units from P1 and P3 (lost), the functional pipeline is 140 units (P8: 75, P9: 65). These are expected to arrive in P10 and P11. 4. Stock Position: On-hand (63) + Functional In-transit (140) = 203 units. 5. OR Baseline: The OR agent recommends 0 units, likely because the current total stock (including the 'lost' units in its calc) appears high relative to historical mean demand. 6. Decision: With demand averaging ~60-70 and total functional stock at 203, we have roughly 3 periods of coverage. Ordering now would arrive in P12.

Functional pipeline is likely only 30 units. 2. Demand Analysis: Demand has dropped significantly over the last two weeks (30 units in P9, 22 units in P10) compared to the 'regime shift' average of ~70.

The average demand over the last four periods is approximately 36 units. We are entering early May, where demand for semi-shiny stay-ups might remain steady or slightly decrease as weather warms. 3. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 90 units. Assuming the in-transit units are largely lost (P1/3/10), our effective stock is 90. If demand remains around 45-50 (conservative upper end of recent trend), the current stock covers nearly 2 periods. 4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0, but it likely considers the 150 'In-transit' as valid stock. Adjusted pipeline logic: P1 (100) and P3 (20) are lost. P10 (30) is likely lost/late.

The functional pipeline is therefore only 140 units (P13: 40, P14: 50, P15: 50). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods.

Historically, demand has averaged ~48 units/period over the last 5 weeks, despite some high-volatility spikes (e.g., P15 demand was 54). The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the inflated 290-unit pipeline and the L+1 period demand coverage (which OR calculates as roughly 140-150 units).\n\n3. **Strategy**: Since the functional pipeline (140) just barely covers 3 periods of demand at the current average (approx. 46-50 per week), and we are currently at 0 on-hand, we are at high risk of stockouts if shipments are delayed or demand spikes.

With 0 on-hand, we are entirely dependent on arrivals. \n3. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units because it counts all 340 units in the pipeline. However, 150 of those are ghost units. \n4.

The functional pipeline consists of P13 (overdue, 5 periods since order), P14 (overdue, 4 periods since order), and P17 (1 period ago).

The product (20 denier stay-ups) is a year-round staple but demand fluctuates. 3. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand is 45.

However, my analysis of carry-over insights and shipment history confirms that the vast majority of these units (370 units) are likely lost due to persistent supplier unreliability. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, and P19 have not arrived and are well past the maximum observed lead time of 2 periods. The functional pipeline currently consists only of the Period 23 order (60 units) and the Period 24 order (40 units). On-hand inventory is 85 units. Estimating demand for the upcoming periods (L+1) at approximately 20-25 units per period (reflecting the recent decrease since early June), the total functional inventory (85 on-hand + 100 functional in-transit) equals 185 units. This covers roughly 7-8 periods of demand. Given the high supplier unreliability (roughly 40-50% success rate), maintaining a higher safety stock is necessary to avoid the frequent stockouts seen in previous months. I will place an order of 40 units to maintain a steady flow into the pipeline, anticipating that roughly half of these orders may never arrive.",

This coincides with the end of September, likely representing a seasonal shift for tights/socks as weather cools.\n\nStrategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is rejected because it interprets the 570 'In-transit' units as real inventory.

Demand for the last 4 periods (P37-P40) has averaged approximately 94 units/period (102, 107, 97, 70). To cover demand over the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) and maintain safety stock against a ~50% supplier arrival failure rate, we need to order aggressively. Even though P40 demand dipped to 70, the overall November trend for tights/leggings is strong.
