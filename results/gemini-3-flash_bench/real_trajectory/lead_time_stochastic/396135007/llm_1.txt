The historical demand from early January to early February (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows a stable average of approximately 48.6 units per week (min 45, max 54). Current date is Feb 11, moving towards spring in the Northern Hemisphere; demand for shorts typically increases as weather warms. Since promised lead time is 2 periods, an order placed today (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 (available for Period 4 demand). To maintain service levels, I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 plus buffer. Total periods to cover (L+1) = 3. Expected demand: ~50 units/period. Target inventory position: 150-170 units. Starting from 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order 170 units to establish the pipeline and account for potential seasonal uptick.",

Historically, demand from Jan 7 through Feb 11 has been stable between 45-54 units/week (average ~48.6). We are currently in mid-February. As a summer/leisure item, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly increase as spring approaches, though no immediate calendar spikes are expected for Feb 18. In Period 1, I ordered 170 units. Since 'arrived=0' in Period 1 conclude, we must wait for Period 2 and Period 3 to confirm the promised lead time of 2. Based on a lead time (L) of 2, the pipeline needs to cover Period 2 (current), Period 3, and Period 4 (L+1 periods). Estimated demand for these 3 periods is ~150 units (50/week). Current pipeline is 170 units (in-transit). However, because the ending on-hand in P1 was 0 (stockout), demand of 49 units was lost. To ensure availability once the initial shipment arrives and to build a small safety buffer against the stockout situation, I will place a supplemental order. Total needed for next 3 periods is ~150. Current in-transit (170) covers this, but to account for the lead time delay and potential upward seasonal trend, I will order an additional 50 units to maintain a steady flow for Period 5.",

Since lead time is 2, I must cover demand for P3, P4, and P5. Estimating demand at ~65 units/period due to the seasonal uptick, I need ~195 units for the pipeline. I have 220 units coming in (170 in P3, 50 in P4).

Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averaged ~49 units/week, but the most recent periods (P1-P3) show a steady upward trend: 49 -> 67 -> 76. This confirms a seasonal demand ramp-up as warmer weather approaches. Regarding lead time, the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in P1 (170 units) has not yet arrived by the end of P3 (visible at the start of P4). Following the 'Critical Timing Example', a lead time of 2 means an order placed in P1 arrives during P3 and is first visible at the start of P4. Since P3 conclude shows arrived=0, the P1 order is delayed/late. However, if it arrives during P4's arrival phase, it will be available for P4 demand resolution. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 250 in-transit (170 from P1, 50 from P2, 30 from P3). I expect demand to continue climbing towards 80-90 units/week. To cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) while accounting for the delay, I need a pipeline of roughly 250-270 units.

I expect demand to rebound to the 110-140 range. Lead time is inconsistently 1 or 2 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 700 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 240 units). The valid pipeline consists of the following orders: P10 (150 units - now 3 periods overdue, potentially lost but remaining in transit for now), P12 (150 units - expected P14/P15), and P13 (160 units - expected P15/P16). Since on-hand inventory is 72 and P12 (150) is due this period, that should satisfy immediate demand. However, given the high loss rate (40%) and the fact that P10 is likely lost, I must maintain an aggressive order flow to prevent stockouts during the summer peak.

Looking at the demand history, there was a significant peak in June/July (up to 163 units), but the recent three-period average has softened significantly to approximately 104 units (136, 107, and the current forecast trend). The on-hand inventory is 237 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately two periods of demand at the current rate. Given the high probability of further seasonal decline throughout August and the persistent supply chain risk where orders either arrive within 1-2 periods or are lost (as seen with historical loss of 1,100 units), placing an order now would likely lead to excess stock at the end of the product's primary seasonal window, incurring holding costs. The total 'In-transit' of 950 is comprised entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is zero, but current on-hand stock is adequate for the immediate term.",

The current inventory of 101 units covers approximately 1.5 to 2 weeks of current demand (mean ~70). To avoid excessive holding costs on a seasonal item entering clearance, and because any new order would arrive too late to capture peak demand, I will rely on existing inventory.

In late November (Period 42), demand is in a deep off-season trough, currently averaging ~14 units over the last four periods. On-hand inventory is 209 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 15 periods of current demand levels. The game ends in Period 47 (5 periods from now). Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period) without increasing sales, as current inventory far exceeds the total expected demand for the remainder of the game (~70 units). The in-transit figure of 950 units represents historical lost shipments and is excluded from planning.",

Historical demand for this off-season period is very low, ranging from 9 to 27 units over the last month (Nov avg ~17). The current on-hand inventory is 182 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 10 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 950 units represents historical losses from earlier in the year (as documented in Carry-Over Insights) and should be disregarded. Given the ample on-hand stock and low seasonal demand, no additional order is required. We will allow the current inventory to deplete naturally as we approach the end of the game (Period 47).",

On-hand inventory is 168 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods of the game (44, 45, 46, 47) at the current demand rate without any additional orders. The 'In-transit' balance of 950 units remains composed of historical orders from the first half of the year that are confirmed lost.

Demand has collapsed significantly to low single digits (4 units in Period 44) and is expected to stay low until the spring cycle begins. Current on-hand inventory is 164 units, which is extremely high given the current demand regime of ~4-15 units per period. This provides more than enough coverage for the remaining 3 periods of the simulation (Periods 45, 46, and 47). The total 'In-transit' of 950 units remains attributed to historical lost shipments from early-to-mid 2019 and should be entirely disregarded for pipeline planning.

On-hand inventory is 158 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for several months at the current rate (~10-15 periods of coverage).

  "rationale": "The product is 'Shorts' (Everyday Basics), which is strongly seasonal. We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30, 2019), entering the heart of winter. Historical data and world knowledge indicate that demand for sweatshirt shorts is at its absolute floor during this period (observed demand in Dec/late Nov: 4, 6, 9, 14, 27, 16). The mean demand over the last four periods is approximately 6 units. On-hand inventory is currently 149 units, which covers approximately 24 periods of demand at the current rate (149 / 6). Therefore, there is no need to order more stock. The 950 units shown as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from the high-activity summer season and should continue to be excluded from logistics planning. Holding costs are $1/unit, so maintaining excessive inventory is the primary risk during this off-season phase.",
