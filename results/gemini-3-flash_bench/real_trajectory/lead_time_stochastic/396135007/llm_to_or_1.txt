Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 396135007 (Women's Jersey Basic Short Shorts). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks is stable, averaging 49 units/week (range 45-54). Product description (shorts) suggests a potential seasonal upswing as we enter spring, though February is still early. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the OR backend needs parameters to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. With current on-hand and in-transit at 0, a prompt order is necessary. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent pre-spring baseline. Lead time is set to 'default' as we have no observed arrivals yet to adjust the promised 2-period lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Women's Everyday Basics Short shorts', which is seasonal/transitional as we move toward spring/summer. Historical demand (5 samples: 45, 52, 45, 54, 47) and Period 1 demand (49) show a stable mean around 48.6 units/week. In Period 1, we ordered 56 units with a promised lead time (L) of 2. This order is in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, and we missed 49 units of demand in Period 1 due to stockout. Since the demand is stable and we are in the early stages of the game, I will use a baseline forecast (recent_N=5) to capture the current demand level. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover demand for (L+1)=3 periods, which at ~49 units/period is ~147 units. Subtracting the 56 in-transit units, the backend should place an order for approximately 91 units to reach the target service level.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). This SKU '396135007' is 'Women's Everyday Basics Jersey Basic Shorts', a seasonal product appropriate for spring/summer. The historical demand data (Jan-Feb) shows an average of ~49 units. However, recent periods (P1: 49, P2: 67) suggest a slight upward trend. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals from orders placed in P1 and P2 have not yet been observed. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the P1 order (56 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P3) and will be visible in the P3 conclude message at the start of P4. The pipeline inventory is 112 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (covering the 5 historical samples + 2 game periods) to capture the trend while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7. Lead time remains at the default (2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jersey Basic Short shorts', a seasonal item for spring/summer. The current date is March 4, 2019. Historical demand from early Feb (49, 67, 76) shows a clear upward trend as the weather warms. Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced 100% stockouts for three periods because the initial orders (placed P1, P2, P3) are still in transit. With a promised lead time of 2, the P1 order (56 units) should arrive during P3 and be visible now, but it is not yet confirmed 'concluded'. However, since it's only been 2 periods since the P1 order and the 'conclude' message for P3 is the last one read, the P1 arrival is technically happening *during* P3 and should be visible in the P4 inventory. My In-transit total of 176 (56+56+64) matches the orders. I expect the P1 order to arrive this period. I will use recent demand (N=3) to capture the seasonal ramp-up. mu_hat needs to account for (1+L) periods, so with L=2, it covers 3 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1064.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Short shorts in sweatshirt fabric', a classic spring/summer item. We are currently in mid-March (2019-03-11), entering the peak season for this category. Historical demand samples from Jan/Feb (avg ~49) have already shifted upward to an average of 72.6 over the last three periods (P2: 67, P3: 76, P4: 75). We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand 0, sold 56/75 in P4), indicating high demand and insufficient inventory. The actual lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order arrived in P4). To capture the recent demand surge and prepare for the spring ramp-up, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which focuses on the current demand level (~73 per period) rather than the lower January baseline. This results in a higher base stock to improve the service level for this profitable item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-18: mean demand increased from ~49 to ~73 (+49%), coinciding with seasonal transition to spring for 'Short shorts'.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Short shorts', which is experiencing a seasonal demand surge as we enter spring. Historical demand for the first 5 samples averaged 50.4, but the last 4 periods (P2-P5) show a sustained shift to a higher mean of 72.75. Current inventory is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts. Lead time from P4 conclude shows P2's order arrived in 2 periods (as promised). The order from P1 (56 units) is now 3 periods overdue (should have arrived in P3), suggesting it is lost. The order from P3 (64 units) is expected to arrive during P6 (this period) and be visible in P7. To normalize stock against the new demand level (73 units/period) and account for the (L+1)=3 periods of demand required to cover the pipeline (current period + 2 lead periods), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect 3 * 73 = 219. sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value (40) to build a safety buffer given the stockout history and the lost P1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed P1 shipment (56 units) is lost (overdue by 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1083.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Short shorts' is experiencing a seasonal spring surge, with the demand mean rising from ~49 to ~74 over the last five weeks (recent samples: 67, 76, 75, 73, 87). Period 6 saw a demand peak of 87. Lead times are volatile: P1's order is lost, P2 arrived in 2 periods, and P5 arrived in only 1 period. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 116 units in-transit (P3: 64, P6: 52). Since P3 is now overdue (3 periods passed, promised is 2), I must assume it might be lost or significantly delayed. To ensure availability during the seasonal peak, I'm setting L to an explicit 3 to account for potential delays/losses and using the recent 5 samples (N=5) to calculate a more aggressive mu_hat of ~296 (4 periods * 74/week) to capture the current demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (5) to capture the increased volatility in the spring season.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: P2 (L=2), P5 (L=1), while P1 and likely P3 are lost/delayed beyond promised lead time. Demand remains in the higher regime (avg ~74) compared to pre-Feb data (avg ~49).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 1st, 2019. The product 'Short shorts' is entering peak spring/summer season. Demand has significantly accelerated: the last three periods show demands of 73, 87, and 109, with the most recent Period 7 (109) signaling a possible new step-up in demand as temperatures rise. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (109) exceeded the 0 available stock. The pipeline (316 units) includes orders from Period 3 (likely lost/delayed), Period 4 (never specifically arrived), Period 6 (52 units), and Period 7 (88 units). We have persistent availability issues (stockouts in 6 of 7 periods). While the promised lead time (L) is 2, historical data reveals instability (P2: L=2, P5: L=1, P1/P3: overdue/lost). I will use L=2 (promised) as the calculation base but will use 'explicit' mu_hat to forecast higher seasonal demand (avg 100/period) across the 3-period window (P8 + L=2). This targets a base stock of ~300 to capture the uptrend and mitigate stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand moved from ~74 (Feb/Mar) to >100 (April forward), reflecting early summer seasonality for shorts. Supply chain reliability remains low with stockouts in 6/7 periods and suspected loss of P3 order.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of jersey 'Short shorts', entering peak seasonality as we approach mid-April. Historical demand shows clear regime shifts: ~49 (Jan/Feb), ~74 (late Feb/March), and now >100 in April. Period 7 and 8 saw demands of 109 and 125 respectively. Supply reliability is poor: P1 (56 units) and P3 (64 units) are definitively lost (P3 is now 5 periods overdue), and P4 (ordered in Period 4) is 4 periods overdue and likely lost. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P5 and P7 took 1, P2 and P6 took 2). Currently, on-hand is low (15) and only one order is in-transit (P8, 59 units). Given the high demand trend and lost shipments, I will set mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (~117 avg of last 2 samples \xd7 (1+2)) and sigma_hat to handle the increasing volatility. L is set to calculate to reflect the 1.5 average observed lead time (2, 1, 2, 1).

Carry-over insight: P4 (ordered Period 4, 56 units) is now 4 periods overdue; classified as a lost shipment alongside P1 and P3.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/04/15). The product 'Short shorts' is entering peak summer seasonality. Demand has significantly accelerated: pre-Feb avg ~49, Feb/Mar avg ~74, and recent April demand (Periods 7-9) has averaged ~107. Lead times are volatile (observed: 2, 1, 2, 1) and shipments (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, totaling 176 potential units that will never arrive. The current 'In-transit' of 361 units includes these lost units (P1:56, P3:64, P4:56), meaning 'actual' pipeline inventory is only 185 (P8:59, P9:126). Since the OR backend cannot see lost shipments, I must use 'explicit' methods to ensure the calculated order covers the needed safety stock for the summer peak. I will set L=2 (promised), but use explicit mu_hat based on an anticipated demand of 115/period for the (L+1)=3 horizon to aggressively restock given the current 5-period stockout streak and upcoming seasonal peak.

Historical demand since Period 7 has averaged ~115 units/week (109, 125, 87, 137), showing a significant upward shift from earlier spring levels. Supply chain reliability has been problematic with orders from P1, P3, and P4 lost. However, recent shipments (P8, P9) arrived with lead times of 1-2 periods. On-hand inventory is 48. In-transit is 219 (P10 ordered 43, plus potentially unidentified units from previous periods or the OR engine's recent calculations). Given the summer seasonality and high stockout risk, I am forecasting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (~115/unit) and using a lead time of 2. I set mu_hat to 345 (115 * (1+L)) and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high volatility seen in April demand samples (std approx 22, so sqrt(3)*22 \u2248 38).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Avg demand increased to ~115 since Period 7 (April). Supply chain remains volatile with lead times alternating between 1 and 2 periods, while historical losses (P1, P3, P4) remain unrecovered.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (Apr 29), we are in the peak summer season for 'Short shorts'. Demand remains high and volatile, with the last observed demand reaching 152 units. Supply chain reliability continues to be an issue; orders from Periods 10 and 11 (43 and 140 units respectively) are in transit. Period 10's order is expected now (L=2). Historically, we have observed multiple lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) and alternating lead times of 1 and 2 periods for successful arrivals. To ensure we meet high seasonal demand while accounting for potential lead time variance and stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (April data) to capture the current high-demand regime (~122 units/period). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to reflect recent volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of documented arrival times (1.5 periods), which helps the OR engine estimate the necessary pipeline to cover the lead time + review period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed: April demand average is ~122 units/period, compared to March average of ~78 units. Peak observed demand reached 152 units in Period 11.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Short shorts' is in its peak summer season (May 6). Demand has stabilized at a high regime since early April, with an average demand of approximately 126 units over the last 5 periods (P8-P12: 125, 87, 137, 152, 133). While demand is high, the on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have significant pipeline inventory (438 units) from orders in P10 (43), P11 (140), and P12 (79), plus historical orders P1, P3, and P4 which are now confirmed lost. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P8: L=2 & L=1, P10: L=2 & L=1). I will set L to 2 to be conservative given the history of delays and losses. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand summer regime (~126 units/period), resulting in a mu_hat calculation for 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~378). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the peak seasonality while acknowledging the large amount of stock currently in-transit.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019-05-13), we are in the peak summer demand regime for 'Short shorts'. Demand in April/May has averaged approximately 120 units per period (137, 152, 133, 78). The drop to 78 in the most recent period (Period 13) appears to be a stochastic fluctuation rather than a regime shift, as the product remains seasonally relevant. Lead times and reliability remain the primary concerns; shipments from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost. Recent successful arrivals (P11 arriving in P13) show a lead time of 2 periods. The OR backend needs to cover 3 periods of demand (Lead time 2 + Review period 1). mu_hat is set to 360 (120 * 3) to reflect the recent high-demand regime, and sigma_hat is maintained at a high level to account for both demand volatility and the high risk of supply chain disruptions observed in previous periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand remains in the peak summer regime (avg ~120/period) despite a one-period dip to 78 in P13. Supply chain remains risky with 3 historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) and variable 1-2 period lead times.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20th), the product (Short shorts) is in its peak summer season. Demand from April-May (Periods 8-14) has averaged ~114 units, despite a recent two-week dip (78, 77). This dip is likely transitory before early June peaks. On-hand inventory is 64, with 318 in-transit (P10=43, P13=12, P14=87, plus historical lost shipments P1, P3, P4 which total 176). The OR logic will treat all 318 as pipeline inventory unless shipments are confirmed lost. However, P1, P3, and P4 are long overdue and effectively lost. To compensate for the pipeline being artificially inflated by lost units and ensuring the OR engine orders enough to meet peak demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly based on the recent high-demand regime (~120 units/period) and L=2. Total needed coverage for L+1 (3 periods) at 120/period is 360 units. Pipeline (excluding lost) = 43+12+87=142. On-hand=64. Effective supply=206. Lead time remains volatile (1-2 periods), so I use default L and explicit mu_hat to ensure robust stock levels.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late May (Period 16), which should still be within the peak summer demand regime for women's short shorts. Demand has been volatile: after a sustained peak of ~120/period in April, it dipped to 77 and then 53 in the last two periods. This could be weather-related volatility or a cooling of the early-season rush, but for shorts, June remains a core selling period. The supply chain has stabilized to a 2-period lead time (observed in P13, P14). I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture this recent cooling while acknowledging the earlier peaks. Pipeline inventory is high (385 units), which significantly exceeds the current demand trend (approx 3 periods of coverage if demand stays around 100). The OR backend's cap mechanism will naturally modulate the order size given the high pipeline (P10: 43, P11: 140, P12: 79, P13: 12, P14: 87, P15: 67). Lead time is set to default (2).

Carry-over insight: May demand (P13-P15) shows a cooling trend (avg 69) compared to April's peak (avg 122). Supply chain has stabilized to the promised 2-period lead time over the last three arrivals.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the 'Short shorts' demand is transitioning out of its peak April/May regime. Historical demand shows a significant cooling: May demand averaged approximately 74 units (P13-P16), a sharp decline from the April average of 122 units. The last period (P16) demand was 89. Given this trend, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (P13-P16) to capture this downward shift and avoid overstocking as summer matures. The supply chain has stabilized to a 2-period lead time over the last several arrivals (P11-P14 orders), so I will use 'calculate' to reflect this return to promised lead time while accounting for the recent stability. On-hand inventory is 0, and pipeline inventory is 405 (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15, P16). However, P12 arrived in P14, and P13 order was only 12 units. The large pipeline is mostly due to P14 (87), P15 (67), and P11 (140, arrived P13). I anticipate P15 and P16 arriving in the next 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: May average demand dropped to ~74 (P13-P16), down from April peak of ~122 (-39%). Supply chain lead time has stabilized at the promised 2 periods for the last 4 successful deliveries.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019-06-10), we are in the mid-summer demand phase for 'Short shorts'. Following the peak in April (avg ~122), demand has settled into a significant but lower regime. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17) is 77 units, which is consistent with the post-peak cooling trend noted in the carry-over insights. Supply chain performance has stabilized; the last two arrivals (from P15 and P16 orders) showed lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively, confirming the promethean lead time is generally reliable now despite historical losses. In-transit inventory is currently high (318 units), which stems from orders placed in P13, P14, and P17 (following the logic that P1, P3, and P4 are lost). Given the on-hand stock is 0 and demand is steady around 75-80, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach to capture this post-peak demand mean of ~77 and its associated volatility. This aims to maintain a base stock level that covers ~230-240 units (3 periods * ~77) which is balanced against the large pipeline inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 17, 2019 (Period 19). The product is 'Short shorts', a seasonal summer item. Distribution analysis reveals three distinct demand regimes: 1) Late winter (P1-P3: ~64/unit), 2) Spring/Peak Summer Transition (P4-P12: ~110/unit), and 3) Post-peak cooling (P13-P18: ~74/unit). The last 6 periods (P13-P18) show a sustained drop in demand (78, 77, 53, 89, 88, 60), averaging 74.2 units per period, representing a 39% decrease from the April peak. Supply chain lead times have stabilized at the promised 2 periods for the last 5 successful arrivals (P11, P12, P15 arriving on-time; P16 arriving early in 1 period). Since we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 318 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, P17 are likely outstanding or lost, but the system shows 318 total pipeline), and the demand has entered a lower, stable regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this post-peak behavior (N=6 covers P13-P18). L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed lead times including recent stability at 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to match the current demand regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: June demand (P17-P18) follows the lowered May trend (~74 units/period), consistent with the end of the shorts peak season.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '396135007' (Short shorts) is currently in a post-peak seasonal phase. After a high-demand period in April (avg ~122), demand slowed in May/June (avg ~75), though Period 19 saw a significant outlier spike of 135 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The supply chain has stabilized to the promised 2-period lead time over the last several successful deliveries (P15 order arrived P17, P16 order arrived P17). Historical shipments from P1, P3, and P4 remain lost. With the in-transit pipeline at 318 units and no orders placed in the last 3 periods, the inventory position needs to be recalibrated for the current lower demand regime. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (P13-P19) to capture the current mean demand of approx 82 units per period (including the recent spike), while maintaining the default lead time of 2 periods and standard deviation calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 19 confirms high demand volatility in the post-peak season: while May/June average is ~82, a spike to 135 occurred in P19 after a period of 60.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), demand for this SKU ('Short shorts') is exhibiting a significant late-summer resurgence. Demand in Period 20 reached 163 units, significantly higher than the May/June average (~82 units). This spike likely represents a mid-summer peak. Average demand over the last 3 periods (P18-P20) is 119.3 units. The supply chain has settled back to its promised lead time of 2 periods (as seen in successful deliveries P15 and P16). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 342 units in-transit. However, many units in-transit (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost shipments. Recent orders (P13 and P14 were very small) and no orders were placed in P17-P19 leading to the current stockout. To capture the remaining summer demand and replenish stock after the recent high demand spikes, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the recent surge (~119 units), while maintaining the default lead time (L=2) and using recent volatility (N=3) for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge detected: Average demand increased to ~119 units/period in late June (P18-P20) following a low-average period in May/early June. Supply chain appears to have returned to L=2, but the pipeline is heavily skewed by historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Short shorts' is currently in a high-demand summer period (early July), with demand recently peaking at 163 units in Period 20 and averaging 119 over the last 3 periods. The supply chain has significant noise due to historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) which inflate the 'in-transit' count. Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 510. However, 176 of those units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and will not arrive. The active pipeline is 510 - 176 = 334 units. Recent lead times have toggled between 1 and 2 periods, so I will maintain L at the promised 2 periods. For mu_hat, the 'mid-summer surge' (avg 119) requires capturing recent peaks. I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the volatility from P18-P21 (averaging ~111 per period) to ensure the base stock calculation covers (1+L) demand (approx 333 units). This mirrors the active pipeline, which should minimize new orders while inventory in transit arrives to meet current demand.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand volatility remains high: July demand (P20-P21) showed a peak of 163 followed by 85. Average demand for the last 4 periods (P18-P21) is ~111 units/period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15), we are in mid-summer. Demand for 'short shorts' remains volatile but significant. The last four periods (P19-P22) have shown demand spikes up to 163 and a lull of 51, with an average of approximately 108 units/period. The pipeline inventory (486 units) is heavily distorted by historically lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (56 + 64 + 56 = 176 units). Adjusting the pipeline by treating these as permanent losses, the effective in-transit is closer to 310 units. Recent arrivals (P22) confirm a lead time of 2 periods. To ensure we cover demand during the leads-time plus the current period (L+1=3 periods) during this high-volatility summer phase, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent average of ~110 units per period (explicit value 330 for 3 periods). Sigma_hat is set explicitly to handle the high volatility observed in June/July (stdev of {135, 163, 85, 51} is approx 51; sqrt(3)*51 \u2248 88).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand (July) remains volatile with an average of ~108 units (P19-P22). Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 176 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 24 (late July). The product, 'Short shorts', is in its peak but volatile summer season. Demand in the most recent five periods (P19-P23: 135, 163, 85, 51, 69) shows significant variance with an average of ~100.6, trending slightly downwards from the early July peak. However, we must account for the high volatility (sigma) to maintain service levels. The supply chain has settled into the promised lead time of L=2 for the last two deliveries (P22 and P23). The major challenge is the 'In-transit' figure of 318 units, which includes 176 units from historically lost shipments (P1: 56, P3: 64, P4: 56). The OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation includes these undelivered units, which would normally lead it to under-order. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a base stock that overrides the phantom pipeline. I set L=2 (promised). For mu_hat, I use a value based on (1+L) * 105 (projected mean) = 315. For sigma_hat, I use an explicit value reflecting the high volatility observed in P19-P21, setting it to 100 to ensure the safety stock is robust against spikes like the 163 units seen in P20.

Carry-over insight: July demand (P20-P23) shows high volatility with a cooling trend, moving from an average of ~119 to ~100. Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 176 units from unrecovered lost shipments (P1, P3, P4).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-29. The product is 'Short shorts', which is moving past its peak summer season (April/May). Recent demand (P21-P24) averages approximately 85 units per period (85, 51, 69, 136), though it remains highly volatile. The historical average for the last 5 periods is approximately 81 units. The supply chain has stabilized to the promised Lead Time (L=2) for the last three successful arrivals (P20, P21 arriving on time). However, the in-transit inventory (381 units) is heavily inflated by 176 units from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) mentioned in carry-over insights. Total reliable pipeline is actually 205 units (381 - 176). To account for this in the OR backend (which doesn't realize shipments are lost), I set the Lead Time (L) to 'explicit' at 2 to reflect recent stability, use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand cooling/volatility (avg ~81), and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the high variance (std ~34). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current demand while attempting to mitigate the over-counting of lost units in the pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/8/5), we are entering the late summer/pre-autumn transition for 'Short shorts'. Demand remains volatile but high, with the recent 4-period average (P22-P25) at approximately 91 units. The supply chain has stabilized to the promised lead time of 2 periods (as seen in arrivals for P22 and P23). Stockouts occurred in the last two periods (P24, P25) because no inventory arrived. A critical factor remains the 176 'ghost' units in-transit from lost shipments (P1: 56, P3: 64, P4: 56), which the OR backend incorrectly counts towards pipeline inventory. To compensate for this and prevent under-ordering during this volatile phase, I am using an 'explicit' L of 2 and 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * forecasted_demand + lost_units. With a forecast of 95 units/period and 176 lost units, mu_hat = (3 * 95) + 176 = 461. This ensures the backend places an order despite the phantom pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the high recent variability (ranging from 51 to 136).

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand (August) remains volatile with an average of ~91 units (P22-P25). Systematic inventory underestimation occurs due to 176 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) remaining in the 'In-transit' calculation.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-08-12. Demand for 'Short shorts' remains volatile as the summer season begins to wind down. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 87.2 units, a decrease from the peak July levels. A significant operational challenge remains: the 'In-transit' figure of 556 units includes 176 units from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) which will never arrive. The OR backend uses (pipeline - base_stock) to calculate orders; since it doesn't know these units are lost, it will under-order unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate for this 'ghost' inventory. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: Target base stock for (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 88 = 264) + the 176 lost units = 440. This ensures the OR logic (440 - (in_transit_real + 176)) results in an order that covers actual expected demand. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as recent deliveries have consistently arrived with a 2-period lead time. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the current high volatility in late-summer demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/19. The product 'Short shorts' is entering the late summer/early autumn period. Historically, August demand (P24-P27) has averaged approximately 95 units per period (136, 107, 73, 63). We are transitioning out of the mid-summer peak. Supply chain reconciliation is critical: the 'In-transit' count of 500 units is heavily inflated by historically lost shipments (P1=56, P3=64, P4=56, P7=88, P13=12, P14=87 = 363 units likely lost). Only P24 (63 units) and P26 (119 units) are genuinely in transit and expected. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I set an 'explicit' L of 5 to account for the gap created by missing stock, and an 'explicit' mu_hat of 380 (based on a mean demand of ~95 over 4 periods: L+1). Sigma_hat is set to 125 (recent_N=5) to handle the significant volatility observed in late summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation confirmed: 363 units (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14) are classified as lost/unrecovered, leading to systematic under-ordering if pipeline inventory is ignored. Late summer demand regime (August) shows an average of ~95 units, significantly lower than the July peak (~110).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter late August, demand for 'Short shorts' has clearly entered a seasonal decline. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P25-P28) is approximately 73.5 units/period, down from the July/early-August averages (>100). The supply chain remains highly problematic: 'In-transit' inventory stands at 506 units, but 363 units from periods P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, and P14 are definitively lost. Additionally, the order from P24 (63 units) is now 4 periods old (promised L=2) and likely lost or significantly delayed, and the order from P26 (119 units) is also overdue. To prevent the OR backend from severely under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I am setting L and mu_hat to 'explicit' values. I will set mu_hat to 210, which reflects a projected demand of ~70 units across the review + lead time (3 periods), but significantly inflated to force an order that compensates for the ~426 units of likely lost 'in-transit' stock being subtracted by the backend. This will help maintain service levels despite the broken pipeline reporting.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation reached 426 units as of Period 29: Orders from P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, and P24 are now classified as lost/unrecovered. Late August demand confirms a cooling trend with the most recent 4-period average at 73.5 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019-09-02), demand for 'Short shorts' has stabilized in a post-summer cooling phase. The most recent 4-period average demand (P26-P29) is 61.5 units, down from July's peak levels. The primary operational challenge is extreme pipeline inflation. Historically lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 7, 13, 14, and now P24 (ordered P24, currently P30, 6 periods overdue) total 489 units (506 total in-transit minus the 119 from P26 and 6 from P28). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+L) * 65 units (anticipating slightly higher than recent 61.5 to buffer for volatility) and an 'explicit' L of 2. For sigma_hat, I'm using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current volatility of this cooling regime while ignoring the extreme July spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Pipeline inflation has reached 489 units due to lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24). Demand for 'Short shorts' remains in a late-season cooling phase with a 4-period average of ~62 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Short shorts' is entering the autumn season (September 9), where demand is expected to continue its cooling trend from the summer peak. The last four periods (P27-P30) show a mean demand of 53.5 units. A significant operational challenge exists with the pipeline inventory: 489 units are currently 'In-transit' but are classified as lost/unrecovered (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24). Consequently, the actual pipeline is effectively zero, but the OR backend will subtract these ghost units from any order it calculates. To circumvent this, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that compensates for the ghost pipeline by adding the lost 489 units to the forecasted demand across the (L+1) horizon. For the forecast itself, I use N=5 (P26-P30) which captures the late-August/early-September cooling (avg ~57). Target mu_hat = (Forecast * (L+1)) + Ghost Pipeline = (57 * 3) + 489 = 660. Sigma_hat is calculated for the same period (std ~13) over the horizon: 13 * sqrt(3) \u2248 22.5. Lead time L is set to 'default' as recent deliveries (P25, P28) arrived in the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Pipeline inflation verified at 489 units (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24). Demand continues late-season decline with P26-P30 average at 57.4 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. This product ('Short shorts') is now in a clear late-season decline as cooler weather approaches. The demand in Period 31 dropped significantly to 11 units. The 5-period average (P27-P31) is 45 units, but the most recent two periods (P30-P31) average only 26 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend while maintaining some safety against the extreme low of P31. The supply chain remains highly problematic: the cumulative 'In-transit' figure of 698 units is severely inflated by unrecovered lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P26, and likely P25 (now 7 periods overdue) are lost. These total 553 units (56+64+56+88+12+87+63+56+71). Subtracting these from the 698 'In-transit' leaves ~145 units of genuinely expected inventory (principally the 198 units ordered in P31 which should arrive in P33). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 698 in-transit from the base stock, it will not order anything unless the base stock exceeds 698. With demand falling, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the cooling market, accepting that no new orders will likely be triggered due to the pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Pipeline inflation has reached 553 units; shipments from P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, and P26 are now classified as lost/unrecovered. Demand for 'Short shorts' has entered a sharp end-of-season decline, with Period 31 demand at 11 units and a 5-period average of ~45 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '396135007' (Short shorts) has clearly entered its end-of-season phase as of late September. Demand in the last two periods (P31: 11, P32: 14) has dropped significantly from the early September/late August levels (~40-60). The current on-hand inventory is 184 units, which is already more than 10x the most recent demand observation. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 500) remains heavily inflated by 553 units of historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, P26) which are unlikely to ever arrive. However, even excluding these 'ghost' units, the 184 units on hand are excessive for the current demand regime. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs during this terminal phase, mu_hat is set to reflect the current low-demand regime (avg of last 3 periods is ~22 units) and L is kept at default. No new orders are desired.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand collapse confirmed: Period 31-32 demand average is 12.5 units, a 78% drop from the late August average (~57). Inventory is now in surplus relative to forecasted terminal demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Short shorts' has entered the final phase of its seasonal lifecycle. Demand has collapsed from a late-summer average of ~60 units to an end-of-season average of ~16 units over the last three periods (P31-P33). Current on-hand inventory is 160 units, which is approximately 10 times the current weekly demand. This creates a significant risk of high holding costs for the remainder of the game (47 periods total). Furthermore, the 'In-transit' figure of 500 units is heavily inflated by historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, P26 - approximately 553 units total are likely lost). Given the high on-hand surplus and the collapsed demand, the priority is to stop all ordering and minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat to an explicit low value to prevent the capped policy from triggering any new orders, as the current 160 units easily covers the rest of the season's likely demand.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season terminal demand phase confirmed: Period 31-33 average demand is 16.3 units, down from ~60 in early September. Terminal inventory surplus of 160 units detected.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Short shorts' has entered its terminal seasonal phase (October), with demand collapsing from summer peaks (>120) to a current 4st-period average of 18.75 units (Periods 31-34: 11, 14, 24, 26). The inventory position is currently in deep surplus with 134 units on-hand, which is sufficient to cover more than 7 periods of current demand. Additionally, while the 'In-transit' figure is 500 units, the carry-over insights identify a cumulative 553 units as lost/unrecovered shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, P26). Because on-hand inventory (134) significantly exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (L=2) and review period (total ~56 units at the current rate), no further orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect this terminal low-demand regime to prevent any automated replenishment by the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Terminal inventory surplus of 134 units is sufficient for the remainder of the season. 553 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed as lost/unrecovered shipments and should be excluded from active supply planning.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Short shorts', which is heavily seasonal. Current date is October 14th, well past the summer peak. Demand has collapsed from >100 units/period to an average of ~20 units over the last 5 periods (P31-P35). Current on-hand inventory is 108 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of current demand levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 500 units is dominated by historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, P26) which total 553 units; however, the system shows 500 in transit, suggesting some reconciliation or that my tracking of 'lost' units exceeds the system's pipeline. Regardless, active stock is in surplus. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=5 (P31-P35) to capture this end-of-season terminal demand phase (~20 units/period). Given the inventory surplus (108 units) relative to the (1+L) period demand (3*20=60), no new orders are expected from the OR backend. L is set to default as recent deliveries (P28, P31) have returned to the promised 1-2 period range.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Short shorts' is in its final seasonal decline phase as of October 21st (Period 37). Recent demand from Period 31 to 36 has averaged 18.7 units per period (11, 14, 24, 26, 26, 21), confirming the end-of-season collapse described in previous insights. Current on-hand inventory is 87 units, which is significantly higher than the projected demand for the remaining 2+ periods of the season (roughly 37-40 units total). The 'In-transit' figure of 500 units remains dominated by historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, P26) which never arrived and are now excluded from planning. Because current on-hand inventory is more than double the expected demand for the rest of the game, no new orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect this terminal low-demand regime using a recent 6-period average to ensure the OR engine recognizes the surplus.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed terminal demand regime (Oct); 6-period average demand is 18.7 units. On-hand inventory of 87 units is sufficient to cover remaining game periods without new orders.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019 (Period 38/47). We are firmly in the terminal demand phase for 'Short shorts'. Demand for the last 7 periods (P31-P37) has been consistently low: 11, 14, 24, 26, 26, 21, 15 (average ~19.6 units). On-hand inventory is 72 units, which covers approximately 3.7 periods of demand at the current average rate. There are 10 periods remaining in the game. With 'In-transit' at 500 units (all of which are confirmed lost/unrecovered shipments from P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, and P26), and a holding cost of $1/unit/period, avoiding unnecessary replenishment is critical. Projected demand for the remaining 10 periods at the current rate is ~196 units. While 72 units on-hand does not cover the entire remaining duration, the high holding cost and the risk of over-stocking at the end of a seasonal cycle suggest a conservative approach. I will maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 7-period terminal regime to ensure the OR backend doesn't trigger large orders against the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Short shorts', which has entered its terminal demand phase as of early November. Demand has stabilized at a low level, with the most recent 5-period average (P34-P38) being 20.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 58 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately three periods of demand at the current average. Given the game is at Period 39 of 47, we have 8 periods remaining. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 500 units is comprised entirely of historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, P26) that have not arrived for many months. Due to the high holding cost relative to the very low terminal demand and the existing inventory surplus, no further orders are required. The OR backend needs to be set to a low base-stock level to avoid triggering orders against the ghost 'pipeline inventory' which technically already exceeds any reasonable base stock (though it's lost). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to reflect the current terminal demand regime (~20 units/period).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Short shorts', which is currently in a terminal end-of-season phase (mid-November). Recent demand (P35-P39) has been very low, averaging approximately 17 units per period and trending downwards (most recent demand was 9). Current on-hand inventory is 49 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 3 periods of demand at current rates. Given there are only 7 periods remaining in the game (P40-P47) and demand is expected to remain minimal or continue declining until the end of the simulation, the current inventory is likely adequate to meet needs without incurring additional holding costs. The 'In-transit' figure of 500 units remains heavily inflated by historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, P26) which never arrived. To prevent the OR backend from triggering orders based on this false pipeline, and to match the current low-demand environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N approach (N=5) to reflect the terminal demand regime. L is kept at default. No new orders are expected or needed.

We are in Period 41 (mid-November), approaching the game's end at Period 47. The product is 'Short shorts', which has clearly entered its terminal demand phase for the winter season. Demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) has averaged approximately 18 units, and the most recent demand was 16. With 33 units currently on-hand and 6 periods remaining, the existing stock is nearly sufficient to cover the expected total remaining demand (estimated at ~90-110 units). Given the high holding cost compared to the low probability of stockout in this low-demand regime, and the presence of 500 units in 'In-transit' that are historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, P26), no further orders are required to maximize total reward. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current terminal demand levels using the most recent 10 samples to ensure the OR backend does not trigger an order based on high-demand summer history.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Terminal winter demand confirmed for 'Short shorts'; demand average (P31-P40) is 18.1 units. On-hand inventory plus minimal remaining demand suggests no further orders are needed for the duration of the game.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 42 with only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (ending Period 47). The product 'Short shorts' is in its terminal winter demand phase. Current on-hand inventory is 17 units. Demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P41) has averaged ~18 units per period, but more recently (P37-P41) has dropped to an average of ~14 units. Given there are only 5 periods left, the total expected remaining demand is roughly 70-80 units. While the current on-hand inventory of 17 is slightly below this, ordering more is risky due to the 2-period lead time and the high probability of holding costs exceeding profit at the game's end. Furthermore, the 'In-transit' figure of 500 units is entirely composed of historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, P26, P30, etc.), which the OR backend would incorrectly subtract from its order calculation. To avoid unnecessary ordering or forced zero-orders that don't reflect the true stock status, and because we are close to the end with low demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect the current low-demand winter regime (~16 units/period). This will likely result in a recommendation of zero units by the backend, which is appropriate for the liquidation phase.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The game is in Period 43 of 47, specifically in early December. The product is 'Short shorts', which has reached the end of its seasonal demand cycle. Historically, demand from October through November has averaged approximately 18 units per period, but Period 42 showed a slight late-season variation with 27 units demanded. On-hand inventory reached 0 after Period 42. Since there are only 4 periods remaining in the game (P43, P44, P45, P46) and the lead time is 2 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 45 resolution, leaving only 2 periods of sales. Given the high pipeline inflation (500 units 'in-transit' that are confirmed lost shipments from earlier in the season) and the minimal remaining terminal demand, the risk of accumulating holding costs on excess inventory outweighs the profit potential from new orders. I will set parameters to ensure no further orders are triggered, as the OR backend's capped policy becomes sensitive to the 'in-transit' noise and the terminal phase of the product lifecycle.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 of 47, which is the clear terminal winter phase for 'Short shorts'. Demand in the last 10 periods (P34-P43) has averaged approximately 18 units per period, while demand in the last 3 periods specifically (P41-P43) has averaged 19 units. The SKU currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 500 units in 'In-transit'. However, as noted in previous carry-over insights, at least 553 units in the pipeline are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, P26). With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P44, P45, P46, P47) and a promised lead time of 2 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 46, leaving only one full period of sales. The total expected demand for the remaining 4 periods is approximately 72-80 units. While on-hand is zero, the cost of ordering and potentially incurring holding costs on a seasonal item at the end of its life cycle, combined with the extreme unreliability of the supply chain (which has lost numerous shipments), makes further ordering risky and likely unprofitable. I will set parameters to prevent new orders, allowing the game to conclude.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 47, specifically the winter terminal demand phase for 'Short shorts'. Demand in the last two periods (P43-P44) has been 14 and 4 units respectively, confirming the seasonal transition to near-zero demand. While on-hand inventory is currently 0, the 'In-transit' figure of 500 units consists entirely of historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, P26) which should be excluded from active planning. Historically, the pipeline inventory mechanic would subtract these 500 units from any computed base stock, resulting in an order of 0. Given the game is ending in 3 periods and demand is negligible, no further ordering is required to maximize profit and avoid ending inventory holding costs. Parameters are set to reflect this terminal phase.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-23 (Period 46), which is the penultimate period of the simulation. The product 'Short shorts' is in a terminal winter demand regime where demand is minimal (recent samples: 14, 4, 6). History shows that numerous shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, P26) were lost, creating a misleading 'In-transit' figure of 500 units. However, given that there is only one period remaining (P47) and current demand is extremely low, any new order would not arrive in time to be sold, nor is it necessary. I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are placed to avoid final period holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The game is in its final period (P47, 2019/12/30). The product 'Short shorts' is in a terminal winter demand regime with very low demand (average <10 units in December). There is no incentive to place an order in the final period as it will not arrive before the game ends (lead time is 1-2 periods). The remaining pipeline inventory (500 units) consists entirely of historically lost/unrecovered shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P24, P25, P26) and should be ignored for planning. I am setting parameters to ensure no new order is generated by the OR backend.
