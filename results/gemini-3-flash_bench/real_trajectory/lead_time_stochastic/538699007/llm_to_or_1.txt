Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 538699007 (Women's Jersey V-neck strap top). Historical demand shows a significant spike in the most recent sample (2019-02-04: 76) compared to the prior four-week average (approx. 47). This likely signals a seasonal shift as 'Womens Everyday Basics' and 'Jersey Basics' start trending upward for the spring season. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To set base stock levels correctly for the next (L+1=3) periods, I will prioritize these recent samples. I'll use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent upward trend (averaging the last 3 samples: 43, 44, 76 = 54.33 per period) and the corresponding volatility. L is set to default (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period (P1), we had a high demand of 135 units, which resulted in a stockout (sold=0) because we started with 0 on-hand inventory. The product is a staple item ('Womens Everyday Basics') and historical demand samples (46, 56, 43, 44, 76) suggest an average demand of ~53 units per week. However, P1 demand (135) and the most recent sample (76) show a significant upward shift, likely signaling the start of the spring season for 'Vest tops'. Lead time is promised at 2 periods. The order of 86 placed in P1 is in-transit and expected to arrive in P3. To prevent further stockouts and cover the (L+1)=3 periods of demand, I will use a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the recent trend. Given the high demand in P1, I will use recent_N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 to bridge the historical average and the recent surge. I will use the default calculation for lead time (L=2) and \u03c3\u0302.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is a women's V-neck strap top, a basic Jersey garment. Comparing historical demand (Jan-Early Feb: 43-76) to recent observed demand (Period 1: 135, Period 2: 149), there is a significant demand regime shift starting mid-February. This likely corresponds to the start of the spring season for a basics/layering item. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has exceeded supply and the initial orders have not yet arrived. Orders from P1 (86 units) and P2 (144 units) are in-transit, totaling 230 units. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution (visible in P4 start). To address the new demand level (approx. 142 units/period), I will use the recent 2 samples specifically from the new regime. L remains at the default promised 2 periods for now as no deliveries have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: mean demand increased from ~53 to ~142 (+168%) likely due to seasonal spring shift for basic jersey tops.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product (V-neck strap top) experienced a significant demand increase starting in February, likely due to spring seasonality. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 389 units in-transit. Based on the history, we ordered units in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (86, 144, and 159). Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 3's conclude message. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0 (and it should have arrived). The order was placed in P1, so P3 conclude would show arrival if lead time was 2. This suggests a lead time delay or a lost shipment. However, it's safer to assume a delay to L=3 for now. Demand mean since the shift (Periods 1-3) is 130.6 (135, 149, 108). My parameters target the new regime (N=3) and adjust L to 3 to account for the observed delay and calculation buffer.

Carry-over insight: Lead time delay observed: Period 1 order (86 units) did not appear in Period 3 conclude, suggesting actual lead time is at least 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (2019-03-11), we see the inventory situation stabilize slightly with the first arrival, but there is a clear lead-time anomaly. The order from Period 1 (86 units) is still missing (it should have arrived in Period 3 or 4 based on promised L=2), while the Period 2 order (144 units) arrived in Period 4 (L=2). This suggests the Period 1 shipment is likely lost. Demand from Period 1 to 4 (135, 149, 108, 91) shows a clear regime shift compared to the pre-game samples (avg ~53), with the current regime average around 120. As this is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' V-neck strap top, demand usually rises in spring. I will set L to 3 to account for the potential for longer lead times or lost shipments to prevent stockouts. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~120), adjusted for (1+L). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Potential lost shipment confirmed for Period 1 order (86 units) as it has not arrived by Period 4 conclude while the Period 2 order has already arrived. Current demand regime (Period 1-4) stabilized at avg ~120.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019-03-18), we are managing a 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck strap top'. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal shift starting in mid-February (avg demand ~111 over the last 5 periods). Current inventory is critical: On-hand is 0, and we have 430 units in-transit. The Period 1 order (86 units) is officially confirmed as a lost shipment because the Period 2 order (144 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2) while the Period 1 order never appeared. To compensate for the lost stock and maintain the current demand regime, I am setting parameters based on recent performance. L = 2 (promised) as recent evidence supports this for the orders that actually arrive. mu_hat is set to the avg of the last 5 periods (111) multiplied by (1+L) = 333. sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of the last 5 periods (~32.4) multiplied by sqrt(1+L) \u2248 56. The pipeline inventory (430) is currently higher than mu_hat, which will result in the OR backend applying the 'cap' to prevent over-ordering while waiting for shipments to replenish on-hand stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7 (2019-03-25), the product (Women's Jersey V-neck strap top) is in a high-demand seasonal phase. Since Period 1, we've transitioned from a mean of ~52 to a higher regime. The last 6 periods of game play show demand values of 135, 149, 108, 91, 72, and 124, averaging 113.16. The Period 1 order (86 units) is officially considered lost as orders from Period 2 and Period 5 have already arrived. Lead times have been volatile: Period 2 arrived in 2 periods (promised), while Period 5 arrived in just 1 period. To stabilize, I will use L=2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering, but I'll base mu_hat on the recent demand regime (last 6 periods). mu_hat calculation: (1+L) * 113.16 = 339.48. Current in-transit is 379, and on-hand is 0. Since pipeline exceeds my base stock target, the OR engine will likely order 0 or very little, which is appropriate given the high amount already in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: Period 2 took 2 periods, while Period 5 arrived in 1 period. Period 1 shipment (86 units) is confirmed lost. Demand regime for March settled at an average of ~113.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/1. The product is a women's basic jersey top, which usually sees stable demand with potential modest growth in spring. Historical demand since the regime shift in Period 1 (2019-02-11) has been: 135, 149, 108, 91, 72, 124, 169. The mean of this high-demand regime (last 7 periods) is approximately 121. Despite an 'In-transit' figure of 379, the history shows that the Period 1 order (86 units) is lost, and the orders from Period 3 (159 units) and Period 4 (134 units) haven't arrived yet (86+159+134 = 379). This confirms the 'In-transit' count includes the lost Period 1 shipment. Stockouts have been persistent (on-hand is 0). Lead times have been unstable (2 periods for P2, 1 period for P5, and P3/P4 are at L=5 and L=4 respectively without arriving), suggesting potential supply chain delays. I will use the promised lead time of 2 for L but explicitly set mu_hat based on the high-demand regime mean (121 * (1+2) = 363) and set a high sigma_hat to account for both demand volatility and supply uncertainty to trigger an aggressive order to recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Lead time instability continues; orders from Period 3 and 4 (totaling 293 units) are significantly delayed (4-5 periods), whereas Period 5 arrived in 1 period. Demand regime since mid-February remains high, averaging ~121 units/week.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck strap top) is experiencing a severe stockout due to massive demand spikes (227 units last period) and highly unreliable logistics. We are currently in April (Spring), and the 'Womens Everyday Basics' category is clearly peaking. The demand has shifted from an average of ~113 in March to a recent average of ~198 (Periods 7-8). The logic for L is problematic: Period 1 (86 units) is lost; Period 2 arrived in 2; Period 5 arrived in 1; but Periods 3 (159 units) and 4 (134 units) are now 5-6 periods overdue and still 'In-transit'. This suggests a high probability of further lost shipments or massive delays. Since holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0), the backend's critical ratio is 0.5, which is naturally conservative. To combat the stockouts and account for the high likelihood that the 379 units in-transit include lost stock, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to increase the base stock level. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the escalating seasonal surge, and a high explicit sigma_hat to account for both demand volatility and the 'noise' of unreliable arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 7: Demand spiked from ~115 to ~198 (+72%) driven by April seasonality for basic jersey tops. Logistics remain highly unreliable: orders from Period 3 and 4 are now 5+ periods late, increasing the likelihood of lost shipments beyond the already confirmed Period 1 loss.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck strap top) is currently in a high-demand seasonal regime for April, with the last three periods (P7-P9) averaging 186.3 units/week (169, 227, 163). The lead time environment is extremely unstable: the P1 order (86 units) is confirmed lost, and orders from P3 (159 units) and P4 (134 units) are now 6 and 7 periods overdue respectively, making them highly likely to be lost as well. Only the P2 and P5 orders arrived successfully. To account for this, I am treating the pipeline as only containing the P9 order (213 units) and the new order from this period, effectively ignoring the likely lost P3/P4 units to force the OR backend to re-order. I will set mu_hat to 560 (approx 186.6 * 3) using 'explicit' to cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) of the current peak demand while using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in the last 3 samples. L is kept at 'default' (2) to target the promised lead time, as actual lead times alternate between 1-2 periods and indefinite loss.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 3 (159 units) and Period 4 (134 units) are now 6+ periods overdue and considered lost. High-demand April regime confirmed with average demand of 186 units/week (P7-P9).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019-04-22), we are managing a 'V-neck strap top', a seasonal basic jersey top. Current demand reflects an April spike, with recent periods (P7-P10) averaging 173.75 units/week. Logistics are highly unstable: orders from P1, P3, and P4 (representing 379 units) are considered lost as they are 6-9 periods overdue, while P5 and P9 arrived with a 1-period lead time. On-hand inventory is 77, and despite 'in-transit' showing 379, these are the lost units mentioned. We must replenish to meet the current high-demand regime (~174 units/week). I will set L=1 based on the most recent successful deliveries (P5 and P9), although the promised lead time remains 2. mu_hat will be set to (1+L)*174 = 348 to reflect the April demand level. sigma_hat is set to roughly 20% of the mean to account for high volatility in both demand and delivery reliability.

Carry-over insight: April high-demand regime confirmed for Women's Basics: Period 7-10 average demand is ~174 units/week. Logistic reliability remains bimodal: orders arrive either in 1-2 periods or are lost entirely (Periods 1, 3, and 4 confirmed/suspected lost).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-29. We are in a high-demand regime for this 'Women's Everyday Basics' jersey top, driven by April/May seasonality. The average demand from Period 7 to 11 is approximately 166 units/week. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand. Crucially, orders from Period 1 (86 units), Period 3 (159 units), and Period 4 (134 units) are significantly overdue (7-11 periods) and are confirmed lost. These 379 units in-transit according to the system are 'phantom' inventory. To correct for this, I must set mu_hat explicitly high to force the OR backend's base-stock calculation to trigger a new order, effectively ignoring the lost units in the pipeline. I will use the recent mean demand (~166) over the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) which equals ~498. Lead time is set to the promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P5, P9) arrived in 1 period, suggesting that when orders aren't lost, they arrive quickly.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 12, logistic reliability is confirmed as bimodal: orders arrive in 1-2 periods or are lost entirely. Total lost inventory (Periods 1, 3, 4) equals 379 units. Current demand regime (Late March - April) averages 166 units/week.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), we are managing a Women's Jersey V-neck top, which is in its high-demand spring/summer season. The demand regime shifted significantly in April (Period 7), and based on the last 4 periods (P9-P12), the average demand is 141.5 units/week. Logistics reliability remains a major issue: orders from P1, P3, and P4 (86, 159, and 134 units) are definitively lost. Currently, inventory is 0 on-hand with 498 in-transit (orders from P12 and P13). However, the 'in-transit' total likely includes the aforementioned lost shipments totaling 379 units, meaning actual healthy pipeline inventory is only 119 units (from P12). To prevent stockouts during this high-demand period while accounting for bimodal/unreliable lead times, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover (1+L) periods (~3 weeks) of the current demand regime (approx 145 units/week), totaling 435 units. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high demand volatility and shipment risk. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period successful delivery window.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 13, successful shipments arrived in 1-2 periods (P2, P5, P9), while 379 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost. High-demand season continues with average demand of ~142 units since Period 9.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/13. The product is a Women's V-neck jersey top, part of 'Basic' wear. Demand remains seasonally elevated, though slightly softening from the April highs; average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is approximately 132 units/week. Logistic reliability is highly problematic: shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 379 units) are significantly beyond the promised 2-period lead time and are treated as lost. Consequently, while the 'In-transit' figure is technically 498, the 'real' available pipeline consists of P12 (ordered 119) and any subsequent orders. On-hand inventory is 0. To protect against the high stockout risk and the bimodal lead-time behavior (orders arrive in 1-2 periods or are lost), I am setting mu_hat to capture the current 132 units/week average (recent_N=5) and using calculate for lead time to reflect the observed volatility. Sigma_hat is calculated and slightly increased to account for high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-April peak: Period 9-13 average demand is 132 units/week. Total confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) remain at 379 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck vest top) is currently in its peak season (late Spring/Summer). Demand has stabilized after the April peak, with the last 5 periods (P10-P14) showing an average of 122.6 units. Logistics are highly unreliable: shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (379 units total) are definitively lost as they are 10+ periods overdue, despite more recent orders (P5, P9, P12) arriving within 1-2 periods. Current pipeline inventory (379 units) consists entirely of these lost orders, meaning the effective pipeline is 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the post-April localized average (~123 units) which covers (1+L) periods. Since the OR engine's 'in-transit' count is bloated by lost items, keeping L at the promised 2 periods ensures we maintain a sufficient base stock to trigger an order today to replenish the near-empty on-hand inventory (6 units).

Carry-over insight: Post-April demand regime (Period 10-14) averages 123 units/week, down from the 186 units/week peak in early April.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a Women's V-neck jersey strap top (Basics), which experienced a demand peak in April (averaging ~186 units/week) and has since stabilized in a post-peak regime. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has averaged 122.8 units/week. Lead time remains bimodal: successful orders (P2, P5, P9, P12) arrive in 1-2 periods, while others (P1, P3, P4) have been lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the 379 units 'In-transit' are recorded as lost shipments (over 12 periods late). Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to manually account for the fact that the 'In-transit' units will never arrive. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (123 * 3 = 369) plus a buffer (offsetting the phantom 379 in-transit units) to trigger a new order that replenishes the stock. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual 1-2 period delivery performance for valid shipments.

Carry-over insight: Post-April demand regime (Period 11-15) confirmed stable at ~123 units/week. Total confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) remain at 379 units and must be manually bypassed in order calculations.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is a V-neck strap top (Women's Everyday Basics). Current period is early June. Historical data shows a demand surge in April (~186 units/week) that stabilized in May (Period 11-15 avg: 123 units/week). Period 16 demand was higher at 157, suggesting a slight uptick as summer begins. We observed a consistent bimodal lead time: orders either arrive in 1-2 periods (P2, P5, P9, P12) or are lost entirely (P1, P3, P4). Total units in-transit is 657, but 379 of these are confirmed lost (P1: 86, P3: 159, P4: 134). Effective pipeline inventory is (657 - 379) = 278 units (from Period 16 order). With On-hand = 0, we rely on the P16 order arriving in P17 or P18. To ensure coverage for the current regime (avg ~130), I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand using recent_N=5 (Periods 12-16) to capture the current post-peak stabilization and the slight June uptick.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a Women's V-neck strap top (Basics), which typically sees a demand surge in spring (April/May) and stabilizes or slightly declines as summer begins. The April peak (avg ~186) has subsided, and demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17: 97, 113, 137, 157, 109) has averaged approximately 123 units/week. Inventory status shows 169 units on-hand. The 379 units listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (86+159+134=379). Since these will never arrive, they must be bypassed in the order logic. Because the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' (which includes these lost units) from the base stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to artificially inflate the target stock level, effectively 'adding back' the 379 units to prevent the system from under-ordering. Specifically, for a 2-period lead time (L=2) and a weekly forecast of 123 units, the normal mu_hat should be (1+2)*123 = 369. To offset the 379 'phantom' units in-transit, I set mu_hat to 369 + 379 = 748. Logistic lead times for successful orders have been 1-2 periods, so I maintain the default L=2.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck strap top' has stabilized significantly after the April peak. Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), demand has averaged approximately 119.8 units/week (113, 137, 157, 109, 83). The most recent demand (83) suggests a slight cooling off as we enter mid-summer. Logistics remain bimodal: successful orders arrive in 1-2 periods, while failed orders (Periods 1, 3, 4) never arrive. Total 'In-transit' is 579, but 379 units (P1: 86, P3: 159, P4: 134) are confirmed lost. Therefore, the true pipeline inventory is 200 units (from Period 18). With 86 on-hand and 200 in-transit, total effective inventory is 286. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 120 units/week). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the inflated 'In-transit' figure containing lost units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) period demand plus a correction for the 379 missing units, ensuring the base stock calculation targets the correct volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for June stabilized at ~120 units/week (Period 14-18) following the April peak. Lost shipment volume remains constant at 379 units (P1, P3, P4).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a Women's V-neck vest top (Everyday Basics), which has seen stabilized demand after an April seasonal peak. Demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) has averaged 112 units/week (137, 157, 109, 83, 74). Recent observations show a slight downward trend as we move further into summer. Logistic performance is bimodal: orders arrive in 1-2 periods or are lost. Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 379 units) are confirmed lost and must be accounted for by the OR backend. Currently, In-transit is 453 units; subtracting the 379 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 74 units (the P19 order). On-hand inventory is 212 units. To prevent over-ordering due to these 'phantom' lost units in the pipeline, and reflecting the stabilized/slightly declining demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) and stick to the promised lead time of 2 periods to maintain a safe but not excessive base stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historically, demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' vest top peaked in April (avg ~174) and has been steadily declining through June, with the most recent observed demand at 59 units. The average demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is approx 96 units/week, reflecting the post-peak summer stabilization. Logistic reliability remains bimodal: successful orders arrive in 1-2 periods, while others (P1, P3, P4 totaling 379 units) are lost. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 453. Subtracting the 379 units confirmed lost leaves a true pipeline of 74 units (ordered P19). With on-hand inventory at 153 and a true pipeline of 74, total effective inventory is 227. Given the declining demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering June patterns) to provide a base stock target that accounts for the current slower sales rate while preventing excessive overstocking as the peak season ends.

Carry-over insight: July demand trend: Early July demand signals a further reduction from June levels (P20 demand was 59), following the April peak. True pipeline continues to exclude 379 lost units (P1, P3, P4).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/8. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck top) has significantly decreased in July, moving from a June average of ~120 units/week to a July average of ~56 units/week (last two periods: 59, 54). Pipeline inventory shows 453 units; however, 379 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost based on historical carry-over. The functional pipeline is 74 units (ordered in P19). On-hand inventory is 99 units. Total effective inventory is 173 units. Given the lower July demand, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward trend (average ~62) and setting L to an explicit 2 to ensure we don't overreact to the bimodal delivery history while maintaining safety stock. The OR backend will use these values to manage the base stock, accounting for the reported on-hand and pipeline.

Carry-over insight: July demand trend confirmed: Demand has shifted from a June average of ~120 to a July average of ~57 (-52%) as the spring/early summer peak concludes.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Women's Essentials Basic V-neck strap top' has significantly declined in July as the spring/early summer peak concludes. Over the last three periods (P20-P22), demand was 59, 54, and 29, averaging ~47 units/week, which is a -61% drop from the June average of ~120. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this new lower demand regime using the last 3 samples. Regarding logistics, the pipeline currently shows 453 units; however, 379 of these are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (86+159+134). The true active pipeline is only 74 units (ordered in P19). Lead times for successful arrivals have stabilized at 1-2 periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average of successful deliveries and use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current downward volatility and lower demand level, ensuring we do not over-order into a seasonal decline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck strap top) is currently in a low-demand July regime. Following the April peak, demand stabilized around 120/week in June and has significantly dropped to a July average of ~44 units/week (Periods 20-23: 59, 54, 29, 34). The current date is July 22, and with an 'Everyday Basics' jersey product, demand is expected to remain relatively low until late-summer/back-to-school transitions. Regarding logistics, the pipeline inventory of 453 units includes 379 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. Thus, the 'true' pipeline is 453 - 379 = 74 units (ordered in Period 19). With on-hand inventory at 36 and 74 units arriving soon, the total available stock is 110 units, which covers over 2 weeks of current demand (~44/week). Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, requiring tight inventory control to avoid excess holding costs. I will set L to 2 (promised), mu_hat specifically to reflect the recent July demand floor, and sigma_hat to reflect current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime confirmed low: Average demand for Period 20-23 is 44 units/week (-63% from June average). High-demand season for spring/early summer basics has fully concluded.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck strap top) is in a low-demand regime following its spring/early summer peak. Demands over the last five periods (P20-P24) are 59, 54, 29, 34, and 24, averaging 40 units/week. This confirms the previously noted decline. Logistics remain bimodal: while the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times for successful deliveries (P16, P18) were 1 period, but 379 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost. The current in-transit quantity of 453 units consists of the 379 lost units and a 74-unit order from Period 19. Since P19 is now 6 periods ago and previous successful arrivals took 1-2 periods, the P19 order is also likely lost or significantly delayed. On-hand inventory is 12 units. Given the low demand (~40/week), high existing pipeline (even if mostly lost, the OR backend sees it), and 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (suggesting a 50% service level target), I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (approx. 40 * 3 = 120) and sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility. This prevents unnecessary over-ordering during a seasonal trough while maintaining a lean stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Period 19 order (74 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, bringing total estimated lost pipeline to 453 units (P1, P3, P4, P19). Demand remains stable in the low-season regime, averaging 40 units/week over P20-P24.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck strap top) is currently in a low-demand regime following its spring/early summer peak. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) being approximately 31 units per week. The inventory is currently at 0 on-hand. The 'In-transit' quantity of 453 units is comprised entirely of orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 19, which are all significantly overdue (>6 periods) and confirmed/highly likely lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. To restart replenishment for this low-demand phase while accounting for the high logistics risk (bimodal lead time), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (approx 31 * (1+L)) and sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility. Using L=2 as the baseline, though actual arrival patterns are inconsistent, allows the OR engine to calculate a base stock sufficient for the current pace of sales. The 'explicit' method for L is chosen to ensure the OR engine doesn't incorrectly factor in the long-tail 'lost' shipments into its lead time calculation.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 19 order (74 units) lost; total confirmed lost pipeline is 453 units (P1, P3, P4, P19). Low-season regime (late summer) demand stable at ~31 units/week (P21-P25).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Women's Everyday Basics' V-neck strap top. Calendar dates show we are now in mid-August (2019/8/12). Historically, demand for this spring/summer item peaked in April (avg ~186) and has steadily declined through July. The current demand regime (Periods 22-26) shows significant stability at a low level, averaging 23 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 453 units is comprised entirely of confirmed or likely lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, and 19), meaning the 'true' pipeline inventory is 0. To trigger a new order that accounts for the current low-demand regime while bypassing the 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (Period 22-26) to capture the late-summer baseline (~23 units/week). Note: The OR engine's order logic (base_stock - pipeline) will be problematic because of the 453 phantom units in transit. Since I cannot clear the backend's pipeline, I must set mu_hat explicitly to a value high enough to overcome the 453 units if I want to receive stock, or accept no ordering if I believe current stockouts are preferable to overstocking at the end of the season. Given holding costs equal profit ($1.0), and we are at the end of the season, I will use recent_N to reflect the true low demand, which will likely result in an order of 0 due to the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand regime (August) confirmed stable at ~23 units/week (P22-P26), a further decline from the July average.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. This product (V-neck strap top) has moved from a high-demand spring/early summer regime to a low-demand late summer/autumn regime. The demand average over the last five weeks (P23-P27) has dropped to approximately 21 units/week, down from the June average of ~120 and the April peak of ~180. The inventory status shows 0 on-hand. The 'In-transit' figure of 453 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 19 which are long overdue (6+ to 27+ periods) and confirmed lost per carry-over insights. To trigger a new order, I must set mu_hat to reflect the current low demand regime (approx 21 units/week). Since the backend uses a base-stock policy [base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat] and subtracts 'pipeline_inventory', and the backend views the 453 lost units as active pipeline, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to override this accounting. Specifically, I set mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (1+L)) + Lost Units. Expected demand for (1+L=3) periods is ~63 units. Adding the 453 lost units results in a mu_hat of 516. This should bypass the phantom pipeline and create an order to cover current demand while maintaining the safety stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. This product (V-neck strap top) is a seasonal spring/summer basic which has transitioned into a low-demand regime. Average demand since mid-July (P22-P28) has settled at approximately 23 units/week. Inventory management is complicated by significant logistics issues: 453 units (Periods 1, 3, 4, 19) are confirmed or highly likely lost, leaving a 'true' pipeline of only 63 units from the P28 order. On-hand inventory is 0. To prevent the OR engine from over-ordering due to perceived missing stock while acknowledging the lost units, I must adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and use the recent demand average. Setting N=7 for mu_hat captures the stable late-summer demand (~23 units/week). Lead time is set to calculate to handle the bimodal 1-2 period delivery pattern. The goal is to maintain a lean stock level suitable for the end of the season.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Women's V-neck strap top, a quintessential spring/summer basic. Demand analysis shows a sharp seasonal decline from the April peak (avg ~174) and June levels (avg ~120) to a late summer low-season. Since Period 22 (July 8), demand has stabilized at a much lower level, with the last 8 periods (P22-P29) averaging 22 units/week. Logistics remain bimodal and unreliable: 453 units (P1, P3, P4, P19) are confirmed or highly likely lost, meaning they must be subtracted from the 'In-transit' figure of 516 to find the valid pipeline (516 - 453 = 63 units, which is exactly the order from Period 28). The Period 28 order is expected to arrive imminently (L=1 or 2). Given the low-season regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to reflect the current ~22 units/week demand. With 0 on-hand and 63 valid units in transit, the system is technically covered for ~2-3 weeks of low-season demand, but the OR backend's safety stock calculation with these parameters will ensure a small replenishment if necessary to account for lead time variance and the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Late summer low-season (August/September) demand regime confirmed stable at ~22 units/week (P22-P29). Total lost pipeline remains at 453 units (P1, P3, P4, P19).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The product is a jersey vest top, which has seen its primary spring/summer demand peak conclude. Demand has stabilized into a low-season regime (August/September) averaging approximately 20 units per week. Specifically, demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) was 13, 20, 25, 16, and 19, averaging 18.6 units. Lead times for successful shipments are bimodal (1-2 periods), while several older orders (P1, P3, P4, P19) totaling 453 units are confirmed or highly likely lost. The OR backend needs to account for this stable but low demand. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P22-P30) to capture this post-peak regime for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of successful deliveries while the backend management of the 453-unit 'pipeline inventory' remains the primary challenge\u2014since these are lost, the system will effectively see them as covering future demand until the in-transit value is cleared or offset by higher base stock targets. With on-hand at 44 and demand around 20, we currently have ~2 weeks of supply.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Top) is in a sustained low-demand regime following its spring/early summer peak. Current date is Sep 16, 2019. Demand for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) has been: 20, 25, 16, 19, 24, averaging ~21 units/week. This confirms the 'Late summer low-season' insight from Period 30. Regarding the pipeline, 'In-transit' shows 453 units which corresponds exactly to orders from P1 (86), P3 (159), P4 (134), and P19 (74). These are all significantly past the 2-period promised lead time and are confirmed lost based on the bimodal delivery history (deliveries arrive in 1-2 periods or not at all). Therefore, the 'true' pipeline inventory is 0. I will use recent_N (N=5) to set mu_hat at this low level to prevent over-ordering, while maintaining 'default' lead time (2 periods) as the most recent successful delivery (P28) adhered to it. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) will capture the low volatility of this regime.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck strap top) is in its low-season late summer/early autumn regime. Demand has been extremely stable over the last 10 periods (P23-P32), averaging approximately 19 units per week. The pipeline inventory (453 units) consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, and P19), meaning the functional pipeline is 0. With On-hand inventory at 13 units and expected demand around 19-20 units, we are at risk of a stockout. I will set mu_hat based on the late-season average (last 10 periods) and use an explicit lead time of 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P28) arrived within the promised window. To ensure the backend places an order and ignores the ghost 'in-transit' units, I will provide a mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect the low-demand regime while recognizing the need to overwrite the pipeline gap.

Carry-over insight: Late-season low demand regime confirmed: Average demand for September (P30-P32) is approximately 17 units/week, consistent with the August average of ~18 units/week. Functional pipeline is 0; the 453 units in-transit are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P19).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck strap top) is currently in a low-demand late-season regime. Analysis of demand from Period 30 to 33 shows an average of 17 units/week (19, 24, 7, 18). The on-hand inventory has reached 0 after Period 33. The lead time has been mostly 1-2 periods for successful deliveries, though there is a high loss rate (453 units total are confirmed or highly likely lost from P1, P3, P4, and P19). Since the OR backend uses a pipeline inventory that includes these 453 lost units, it will not place a new order unless mu_hat is set high enough to overcome this 'phantom' inventory. However, given the current low demand regime (approx. 17/week) and the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should only hold enough to cover the median demand. To clear the phantom inventory and trigger a small replenishment for the current regime, I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised and typical actual lead time) and mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the (L+1) demand coverage (approx. 51 units) plus the 453 units that the OR backend incorrectly thinks are coming. This ensures the backend calculates (Base Stock - 453) and results in a target level appropriate for the current 17 units/week demand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The product is a women's basic jersey top, currently in its late-season/low-demand phase. Demand has stabilized at a low level; over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), the average demand is 15.2 units/week. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand, with a 'recorded' in-transit of 505 units. However, based on history, 453 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, and P19) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost as they are significantly overdue (>6 periods). Only the order from P34 (52 units) is actually expected to arrive within the promised lead time of 2 periods. To ensure the backend places an order that covers the gap (since 0 on-hand + 52 functional in-transit = 52 units, which is close to the expected demand for the next 3 weeks), I will set lead time to 2 (promised). I will set mu_hat explicitly to covering 3 periods (L+1) of demand based on the recent average (15.2 * 3 = 45.6). Since the current functional pipeline (52 units) already exceeds this forecast, the capped policy should prevent unnecessary ordering. This approach treats the lost items as truly lost, preventing the OR backend from incorrectly assuming we are overstocked.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck top) is in a stable late-season low-demand regime. Demand since the start of September (P30-P35) has averaged ~15 units/week. Logistics remain bimodal: shipments arrive in 1-2 periods or are lost. The Carry-over Insights identify 453 units as permanently lost (P1, P3, P4, P19). Current In-transit is 505 units, composed of these 453 lost units and 52 units ordered in P34. Given the 2-period promised lead time, the P34 order should arrive in Period 36 (visible next period). Current on-hand is 0. I will set L to 2 (promised) and mu_hat to 45 (3 periods * 15 demand) to cover the current period and lead time. Setting sigma_hat explicitly to 15 allows for small fluctuations. The OR backend will see (Pipeline - Lost) = 52 units, which covers our target base stock, thus preventing unnecessary ordering while waiting for the P34 arrival.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Women's Everyday Basic V-neck strap top', typically displaying high spring demand and low autumn/winter demand. Currently (Period 37, late October), we are in a low-season regime. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P30-P36) is approximately 15 units per week. In-transit inventory shows 505 units, but history confirms that 453 of these are lost (P1, P3, P4, P19). The remaining 52 units were ordered in Period 34. With a promised lead time of 2, this order was expected to arrive in Period 36 conclude but did not. Given the bimodal logistics history (1-2 periods or lost), there is a significant risk that the P34 order is also lost. However, since it is only one period late, I will treat it as potentially arriving while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the low-demand regime to avoid over-ordering. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand to capture the most recent stability (avg ~11). Lead time is set to default (2) as recent successful arrivals (P28) arrived in 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Period 34 order (52 units) is 1 period overdue; monitoring for potential loss. Low-season demand regime remains stable at ~15 units/week (P30-P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (Women's Everyday Basics V-neck top) is in a low-demand late-season regime. Current demand (Period 34-37) is stable at an average of 14.75 units/week. The logistics remain high-risk: 453 units (P1, P3, P4, P19) are confirmed/long-term lost. Crucially, the order from Period 34 (52 units) is now 4 periods old (placed in P34, expected P36); since it did not arrive in P36 or P37, and historical successful shipments arrive in 1-2 periods, this shipment is highly likely lost, following the bimodal pattern identified in Carry-over Insights. With 0 on-hand inventory and the P34 order likely lost, the 'In-transit' figure of 505 units (453 previously lost + 52 likely lost) is non-functional. To trigger a recovery order from the OR backend, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat because the OR engine's pipeline calculation includes these 505 lost units, which would otherwise prevent any new ordering. I set L to 2 (promised). I set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand at the current regime (~15 units/week), totaling 45. However, since the OR backend subtracts the 505 'in-transit' units, I must inflate mu_hat explicitly to bypass the lost inventory: target_base_stock = 45 (desired) + 505 (lost) = 550. This ensures the OR engine places an order to restore the desired stock level while accounting for the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Period 34 order (52 units) confirmed lost after 4 periods of non-arrival, consistent with bimodal logistics history. Total non-functional pipeline inventory is now 505 units (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck strap top) is currently in a low-demand, late-season regime following its peak in April. Since Period 30, demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 16 units/week. Logistics reliability remains problematic: the pipeline inventory shows 550 units, but historical evidence confirms that orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 19, and 34 (totaling 505 units) are lost. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 45 units (the order from Period 38). With 0 on-hand inventory, the objective is to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Given the current average demand of 16 units, the total expected demand over 3 periods is ~48 units. Since the pipeline already contains 45 units (excluding lost ones), only a small adjustment or safety stock buffer is needed. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this low-season target of ~50 units over 3 periods to ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the 16 unit/week demand while accounting for recent volatility (sigma_hat). L remains default since successful shipments generally arrive in 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative confirmed lost pipeline inventory is 505 units (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34). Demand remains stable in the late-season low regime, averaging ~16 units/week (P30-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (2019-11-11), the demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck top) remains in its late-season low regime, averaging approximately 16 units/week over the last 10 periods (P30-P39). The inventory situation is critical as the on-hand stock is 0. Most 'in-transit' units (505 out of 550) are confirmed lost from orders in P1, P3, P4, P19, and P34 (all significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods). The remaining 45 units from Period 38 are expected to arrive in the current period (P40) or the next (P41). To stabilize inventory for the current low demand regime, I am setting mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand using the recent 10-period average (~16 units/week). I will use an explicit L of 2 to match the promised lead time and recent successful delivery cadences, and sigma_hat is adjusted to reflect the low but present volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative confirmed lost pipeline inventory is 505 units (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34). Late-season low regime (Sept-Nov) demand is stable at ~16 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is in the late-season low-demand period for the 'V-neck strap top'. Historical demand for the period P30-P40 has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 15.5 units per week. There is a confirmed bimodal logistics issue where 505 units (from P1, P3, P4, P19, and P34) are confirmed lost and remain in the 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard. Subtracting these from the current 550 units in-transit reveals a true functional pipeline of only 45 units (the P38 order). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the functional pipeline of 45 units matches approximately 3 weeks of current demand (~15 units/week), and promised lead time is 2 periods, the stock level is currently appropriate. I will use a recent_N (N=11) to capture the stable late-season low-demand regime since P30. To ensure the OR engine does not over-order due to the phantom 'lost' inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to low values following the current demand regime (avg ~16, std ~5) and using the promised Lead Time of 2.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (V-neck strap top) is currently in a late-autumn low-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 11 units/week over the last 3 periods (P39-P41), down significantly from the early-spring peak. Logistic reliability remains bimodal; the in-transit inventory of 550 units includes 505 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34), leaving a functional pipeline of 45 units from the Period 38 order. This Period 38 order is now due to arrive. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand is low but persistent, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stable floor (~11-13 units/week). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the bimodal history, though most successful deliveries arrive in 1-2 periods. The OR backend will order to reach a base stock reflecting (~12 units * 3 weeks), likely triggering a small replenishment or staying at 0 if the P38 order arrives as expected.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand (November) has stabilized at a very low floor of ~11 units/week (P39-P41). Cumulative confirmed lost pipeline remains at 505 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699007 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Top) is in a stable late-autumn/winter low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P39-P42) is very low at 9.25 units/week. Inventory management is complicated by a high volume of lost shipments. Total in-transit inventory is 550 units, but based on historical analysis, 505 of these units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 19, and 34) are confirmed lost due to the observed bimodal logistics pattern (orders either arrive in 1-2 periods or not at all). The only functional 'in-transit' order is the 45 units placed in Period 38, which is currently at lead_time=4 and likely also lost, but we will wait one more period before finalizing that conclusion. Given current on-hand is 0 and functional pipeline is effectively 0, I will set mu_hat using the recent 4-period average (approx 10 units/week) to trigger a small replenishment order for this low-demand period, while assuming the 505 units are non-existent to prevent the OR backend from 'waiting' for stock that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed Period 34 order (52 units) lost; total confirmed lost pipeline is now 505 units. Period 38 order (45 units) is 3 periods overdue and likely also lost. Demand floor for December is stable at ~10 units/week.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Women's Everyday Basics' jersey tops has reached a seasonal minimum in December, with the last 5 periods (P39-P43) averaging ~8.2 units per week. Logistic reliability remains problematic with a bimodal pattern: orders either arrive in 1-2 periods or are lost. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 550 units, but historical evidence confirms 505 units are lost (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34). Additionally, the order from Period 38 (45 units) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost as well, making the functional pipeline 0. Given the high parity between profit and holding cost ($1 each), the OR backend aims for a 50% service level. I will set mu_hat to match the current low-demand floor (~11 units per week across L+1 periods) using the recent 5-period average, and sigma_hat to reflect the low volatility of this regime. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the 1-2 period typical arrival for successful orders, while I effectively bypass the 'ghost' pipeline by keeping L at a standard level and forecasting very low demand, which will result in small safety-stock-driven orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Period 38 order (45 units) confirmed lost after 6 periods; total cumulative lost pipeline is 550 units. Late-season demand floor (December) confirmed at ~8 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P45 (mid-December), and the product is a V-neck strap top (Women's Basics), which is in its off-season low. Demand has stabilized at a floor of approximately 8-10 units per week. Logistics for this SKU are highly unreliable and bimodal: orders either arrive in 1-2 periods or are lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 550 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34, P38), meaning the functional pipeline is 0. Since the backend's policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) would see the 550 units and never order, I must use 'explicit' values to bypass this. I will set L=2 (promised), mu_hat to 3 * 8 = 24 (covering 3 periods of demand at the current floor), and sigma_hat conservatively at 10. Given profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50%, so base_stock ~ mu_hat. This will trigger a small order to cover the current stockout without over-ordering during the low season.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a stable late-season/winter low-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 6 units per week over the last five periods (P41-P45), significantly lower than the autumn average of 16. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline of 550 units is confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34, P38). Given the promised lead time (L=2), the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand to minimize stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit). I will set mu_hat explicitly to 21 (targeting ~7 units/week) to ensure a small buffer for the very low demand levels. sigma_hat is set to a small value (10) to account for some variability without over-stocking. Logistics are treated as standard (L=2) since recent orders were either lost or arrived on time; using 'default' for L allows the backend to use the promised lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed shift to winter demand floor (late Dec) at ~6 units/week (P41-P45). Cumulative lost pipeline remains at 550 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, representing the year-end winter demand floor for a summer-seasonal item (Women's Jersey V-neck strap top). Historical demand for the most recent 5 periods (P42-P46) has stabilized at an average of 7.6 units/week. All 550 units currently in-transit (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P19, P34, P38) are confirmed lost based on the established bimodal logistics pattern (orders arrive within 1-2 periods or not at all). Consequently, the functional pipeline is 0. With 0 on-hand inventory, an order is needed to meet the expected demand for the (L+1) window. I will set mu_hat using the recent 7-period average (approx. 7 units/week) to reflect the consistent winter floor, and set the lead time L to the promised 2 periods to ensure the OR backend attempts to restore stock despite the unreliable pipeline.
