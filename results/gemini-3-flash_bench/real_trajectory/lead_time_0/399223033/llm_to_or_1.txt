Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 399223033 (Jeggings). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks shows a mean of 129.6 units (126, 120, 128, 113, 161), with a noticeable jump to 161 in the most recent week (Feb 4th). Given we are entering mid-February, we should prepare for potential early spring demand. The promised lead time is 0. With L=0, the target coverage is for the current period (L+1=1). Since there are no on-hand or in-transit units, we need a full order immediately. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the baseline demand, as the sample size is small but stable. The OR backend will calculate the base stock level using the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1) to determine the optimal service level.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a staple denim item. Observed historical demand samples are [126, 120, 128, 113, 161] and the actual demand in Period 1 was 186. There is a clear upward trend starting from the beginning of February (Period 0: 161, Period 1: 186). The confirmed lead time from Period 1's order is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 1 (demand 186 vs. stock 161). To prevent further stockouts during this rising demand phase, I will use recent_N for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture the recent volatility and volume increase. For mu_hat, N=3 covers the samples from Feb 4, Feb 11, and the actual Period 1 demand of 186. The average of [161, 186] is 173.5, and including the earlier data point [113, 161, 186] gives a mean of 153. Given the stockout, I want the OR engine to be responsive to the higher demand level.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/2/25. Looking at the history, demand for 'Jeggings H.W' has been fluctuating between 113 and 186. Period 1 saw a high demand of 186 (outstripping supply), while Period 2 settled at 134. Average demand from the 5 historical samples plus the 2 game periods is approximately (126+120+128+113+161+186+134)/7 = 138.28. The promised lead time is 0, and observations from Period 1 and Period 2 confirm an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently at 81 units with 0 in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=4 to capture the recent higher activity level compared to early January, and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a staple denim item. Looking at the history, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by successful same-period arrivals in Periods 1, 2, and 3. On-hand inventory is 81. Historical demand for the last five weeks (including pre-game samples) has been: 126, 120, 128, 113, 161. In-game demand has been: 186 (P1), 134 (P2), and 111 (P3). The average demand over all 8 available data points is approximately 134. However, Period 1 showed a significant spike (186). As we move into March, demand for denim staples usually remains steady. Given L=0, we need to cover demand for the current period. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent in-game behavior (average ~143) to stay responsive to current levels, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in the early periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a staple denim item. Looking at the demand history (starting from provided samples through Period 4): 126, 120, 128, 113, 161 (pre-game), 186, 134, 111, 94. The demand spiked at Period 1 (186 units) likely due to the lead-up to Valentine's Day or early spring shopping, but has shown a steady downward trend over the last four periods. The most recent demand (94) is the lowest recorded. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1-4. Given the clear downward trend, I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering based on the older, higher demand peaks. With L=0, mu_hat represents the forecast for the current period's demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) showed a mean of ~130. Observations from Period 1 to Period 5 show demand has been declining from a peak of 186 in Period 1 (likely a seasonal or post-stockout surge) to 82 in Period 5. The product is 'Jeggings', a staple item. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P1-P5) is ~121, but the last three periods (P3, P4, P5) show a lower, stabilized regime of 111, 94, and 82 (mean = 95.6). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Given the declining trend, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand level and prevent excessive holding costs, while maintaining a standard variability estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1794.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ladies Denim Jeggings', a year-round staple with some seasonality. Looking at the demand history: Pre-game samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) averaged 129.6. However, in-game Period 1 (Feb 11) saw a demand of 186, while Periods 2-6 (Feb 18 to Mar 18) saw a lower average of 103.6. Period 7 is Mar 25, transition into Spring, which often sees stable or slightly increasing demand for denim. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The current on-hand inventory is 49. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current stable demand regime (avg ~104) while ignoring the initial spike in Period 1 and the earlier pre-game data. Mu_hat will be (1+L) * mean of last 5, and Sigma_hat will be sqrt(1+L) * std of last 5.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a staple fashion item. Previous data showed a demand spike in Period 7 (258 units), likely due to a seasonal shift or promotion, following a period of relatively stable demand (approx 90-130 units). The stock runout in Period 7 (sold 137, demand 258) indicates we are currently under-stocked for this higher demand regime. Historically, lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the recent demand surge while acknowledging the previous lower levels, I will use a recent_N method with N=4 for mu_hat (averaging 94, 82, 97, 258) to increase the base stock level quickly. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last period. The OR backend will use these to calculate a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts while balancing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 7 (258 units), moving away from the previous 80-130 range. Inventory runout occurred as a result.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. We are in a high-demand regime that started in late March (Period 7: 258 units, Period 8: 174 units), contrasted with the earlier February/March mean of ~130. This likely reflects spring seasonality for 'Ladies Denim Jeggings'. Lead time remains 0 across all 8 concluded periods. To capture this recent spike without being overly distorted by the extreme Period 7 outlier or the older low-demand periods, I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat (average of 258 and 186 = 216 per period) and N=2 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime. On-hand is 97, and there is no pipeline; the OR engine will calculate a base stock of roughly (1+0)*216 + z*sigma, ensuring we stay well-stocked for the ongoing spring trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 7: Spring seasonality for denim has increased mean weekly demand from ~130 to ~216 (+66%).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15, 2019. We are managing 'Jeggings H.W', a ladies' denim item. Historically, denim demand fluctuates with spring seasonality. Last period (P9) demand was 104, which is significantly lower than the previous two periods (P7: 258, P8: 174) but consistent with the early spring mean (~110-130). Examining the lead time history (P1-P9), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 210 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR engine will target a high service level (approx 95%). I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the average demand of the last three periods (258, 174, 104 = 178 avg), which accounts for the recent volatility while providing a buffer against the 'Spring seasonality' shift identified in carry-over insights. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect this recent high volatility (std dev of 178, 104, 258 is approx 77). Lead time (L) remains at default (0).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-22. We are analyzing the demand for 'Ladies Denim Jeggings'. Historically, we identified a demand regime shift starting in Period 7 (March 25). However, the last two periods (Period 9 and 10) have seen a sharp decline in demand (104 and 89 respectively), moving back towards earlier levels (~80-130) after the initial spring spike. The average demand across the regime shift (Periods 7-10) is 156.25, but the recent trend is clearly downward. On-hand inventory is 217 units with 0 in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times have consistently been 0, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat, because of the high variance and recent downward trend after a spike, I will use recent_N with N=4 (covering the entire period since the spike) to balance the high demand of Period 7 with the low demand of the last two weeks. This results in a mu_hat of ~156, which, given the 0 lead time, will result in a base stock that prevents over-ordering while maintaining safety stock. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility of the last month.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223033' (Ladies Denim Jeggings) is currently in Period 12 (late April). Historically, we observed a massive spike in Period 7 (258 units), which we previously attributed to a spring regime shift. However, demand in the last three periods (Periods 9-11) has stabilized back to a lower range: 104, 89, and 119 (average ~104). This suggests the Period 7 spike was either a localized event or that the 'regime shift' was more volatile than a permanent step-up in mean. Given the date is April 29, we should be cautious of early May demand potentially mimicking the late March/Early April behavior if it was driven by pay cycles or specific spring promotions. I will use recent_N=5 for demand forecasting to capture the Period 7 surge in the variance (sigma) while reflecting the recent stabilization in the mean (mu). Actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean has stabilized around ~104 units over the last 3 periods (P9-P11) after the P7 anomaly, suggesting the earlier regime shift was transient or high-variance.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 399223033 (Ladies Denim Jeggings) shows a significant spike in Period 7 (258 units), but has since stabilized. The demand for the last four periods (P9-P12) has been 104, 89, 119, and 111, yielding a mean of approximately 106 units. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 12 that the P7-P8 volatility has subsided. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering due to the earlier high-demand regime while maintaining a high service level (Profit:Holding = 19:1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to focus on this stabilized period (P9-P12). This will provide a base stock calculation centered around the recent ~106 unit/week mean, ensuring we don't hold excessive inventory as Spring peak for this item seems to have leveled off.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean has fully stabilized at ~106 units over the last 4 periods (P9-P12), confirming the end of the P7-P8 volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-13. Reviewing historical demand for SKU 399223033 ('Jeggings in washed, superstretch denim'), the demand has stabilized following a volatile period in late March/early April (Periods 7-8). The demand for the last five periods (P9-P13) has been: 104, 89, 119, 111, and 115. This yields a recent mean of approximately 107.6 units. On-hand inventory is currently low at 37 units with no units in transit. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as promised. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime and ensure enough stock is ordered to meet the expected demand of ~108 plus a safety buffer, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which encourages a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2413.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we experienced a stockout (demand 144, sold 127) because the previous order of 90 units plus on-hand inventory was insufficient. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The demand in Period 14 (144) was higher than the previous 5-period average (~106-115), but not as extreme as the Period 7 spike. The product (Ladies Denim Jeggings) and the current date (late May) suggest relatively stable demand with occasional peaks. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent stability while including the Recent Period 14 increase (P9-P14 demand: 104, 89, 119, 111, 115, 144). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent arrival data. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 will provide a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer to prevent a repeat of the Period 14 stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Minor demand uptick noted in Period 14 (144 units) compared to the previous stable average of ~110, resulting in a stockout.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical data for this H.W Jeggings SKU suggests a stable demand regime following the volatile late March/early April period. Excluding the outliers in Period 7 (258) and Period 8 (174), the demand has averaged approximately 115 units over the last 6 periods (P9-P15). However, there has been a slight uptick in the most recent two weeks (P14: 144, P15: 128), averaging 136 units. The Lead Time is consistently 0 periods. To account for this recent increase in demand and prevent stockouts (as seen in P14), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (from P9 onwards), which captures the post-volatility stabilization while weighting the recent uptick. This N=7 includes the base stabilization and the slight rise in May, ensuring the base stock covers current trends.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand (P14-P15) shows a slight increase (avg 136) compared to the P9-P13 average (avg 107), suggesting a minor late-spring elevation.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223033 (Jeggings) currently exhibits a slightly elevated demand regime as we move into early June. Since Period 14 (May 13), weekly demand has consistently remained above the previous spring stability level (avg ~107), with the last three periods recording 144, 128, and 132 units (average ~135). This suggests a sustained minor elevation, possibly due to early summer shopping. Actual lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent shift and avoid stockouts (as seen in Period 14), I will set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to target the most recent demand average (~135). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the current volatility in this slightly higher regime. This approach will likely result in a base stock level that covers the 13 average plus a safety buffer, while the cap mechanism prevents over-ordering if the signal is noisy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level (~135 units/week) from Period 14 to Period 16, up from the previous average of ~107.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1171.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223033' (Ladies Denim Jeggings) is currently in early June. While Period 14-16 showed a settled demand average around 135 units, Period 17 saw a sharp drop to 66 units. This drop may be noise or a signal of post-spring cooling for denim items. However, looking at the wider history, demand typically hovers between 100-135 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 18, I will use a conservative N=4 for mu_hat (P14-P17) which averages ~117.5 units, helping to bridge the gap between the recent high of 135 and the latest dip of 66. This protects against the lower demand while keeping enough safety stock in case Period 17 was just a single-week anomaly. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent volatility seen in the transition from 135 to 66.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17 (Mid-June). Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1-18. Looking at demand: Period 17 and 18 saw a significant drop (66 and 81 units) from the previous 'elevated' regime of roughly 135 units observed in Periods 14-16. This suggests that the early summer peak has tapered off. A new regime from Period 14 to Period 18 has an average of 110 units (144, 128, 132, 66, 81), which is very close to the P9-P13 average of 107. The 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 17 regarding a sustained higher level of 135 needs revision as the last two periods show a clear decline. I will set N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent deceleration and return to a base level of approximately 110/week, ensuring the OR engine reactive enough to the drop while maintaining safety stock for the lingering volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift noted in Period 17 (~135 units) has reversed; Periods 17-18 show significant cooling (66 and 81 units), returning to the earlier baseline of ~100-110 units/week.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for Jeggings (SKU 399223033) has shown a significant cooling trend over the last three periods (P17: 66, P18: 81, P19: 44), averaging approximately 64 units/week. This follows a period of higher demand in May (P14-P16 avg: 135 units). As we move further into summer, the demand for this denim product appears to be settling into a lower baseline. The current on-hand inventory is 123 units, which is sufficient to cover nearly two weeks of the current observed demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and increasing holding costs, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach to capture the most recent cooling regime, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 periods of data (P17-P19). This will signal the OR backend to lower the base stock level to align with the current lower demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Period 17-19 average demand dropped to ~64 units/week, down from the mid-May average of ~135 (-52%).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223033 (Ladies Jeggings) is experiencing a sustained downward trend in demand as we move into July (summer). Demand has dropped significantly over the last four periods: 66, 81, 44, and 29. The current demand regime (P17-P20) averages approximately 55 units per week, which is a sharp decline from the ~135 units seen in May and June. Given the date (July 1st), it appears interest in superstretch high-waist denim is cooling off seasonally. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this low-demand state and prevent excessive holding costs. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to account for the current lower volatility at this demand level. Lead time L=0 remains consistent with history.

Carry-over insight: Summer decline confirmed: Demand for denim leggings has dropped from ~135 units (Period 14-16) to an average of ~55 units (Period 17-20), a reduction of ~60%.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223033 (Jeggings) is in a confirmed summer demand decline. Recent demand for the last five periods (P17-P21) has been 66, 81, 44, 29, and 34, averaging approximately 51 units/week. This is a significant drop from the spring peak of ~135. Current on-hand inventory is 60 units, and there are no units in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, we need to maintain a base stock that covers the current period's demand. The goal is to avoid overstocking during this low-demand summer phase, as holding costs ($1) relative to profit ($19) suggest a high service level (95%), but only if justified by demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this new lower-demand regime (avg ~51) for both the mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculation. This will likely result in a small order or no order, allowing the system to bleed off the existing 60 units of inventory before replenishment.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223033 (Denim Jeggings) is clearly in a summer low-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 37 units over the last 4 periods (P19=44, P20=29, P21=34, P22=38). This is a significant drop from the spring average of ~135 and the historical mean. Current inventory on-hand is 50 units, which already covers the expected demand for the upcoming period given the current run rate. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer against minor demand fluctuations, I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current cooled-down regime and set L to default (0).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for Jeggings (Ladies Denim) has entered a low-volume summer regime. Over the last four periods (P20-P23), demand has been consistently low: 29, 34, 38, and 52 respectively (average ~38 units). Period 23 resulted in a small stockout as on-hand inventory hit zero. Based on the carrying-over insight from P21, the summer decline is stable at around 60% of spring levels. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N calculation with N=4 to capture this current summer demand level (~38 units/week) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the backend sets a base stock sufficient to cover the immediate demand without over-ordering during this seasonal trough. Profit/Holding cost ratio (19:1) suggests a high service level (~95%), which the OR backend will handle naturally.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand regime confirmed for P20-P23: average weekly demand is ~38 units, down significantly from the spring average (~100-110 units).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Historical data confirms that 'Jeggings' are in a summer low-demand regime. Since Period 20, weekly demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level (29, 34, 38, 52, 35), with a mean of approximately 38 units. The spike in Period 23 (52 units) appears to be a high-variance outlier within this lower regime, as demand dropped back to 35 in Period 24. A stockout occurred in Period 23 due to an order of 0 in the previous period, but Period 24 demand was satisfied. On-hand inventory is currently 20 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory during this summer lull while maintaining a service level (given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5 from P20-P24), which captures the current low-demand state.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. We are in a summer low-demand regime for denim jeggings. Since Period 20, weekly demand has stabilized significantly at a lower level. Specifically, the average demand from Period 20 to Period 25 is approximately 38.8 units (29, 34, 38, 52, 35, 43). There were stockouts in P23 and P24 due to low starting inventory, but the demand figures themselves remain consistent with the summer cooling trend identified in previous carry-over insights. To capture this regime accurately while being responsive to small local fluctuations, I will use N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as indicated by the 'conclude' messages showing same-period arrival. Setting L=0 ensures we order only what is needed for the immediate demand cycle to minimize holding costs in this low-demand period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical demand analysis confirms a sustained summer low-demand regime for Jeggings, starting around Period 20 (late June). Recent demand for the last seven periods (P20-P26) has been consistently low: 29, 34, 38, 52, 35, 43, 51, resulting in an average of approximately 40.3 units per week. While the most recent periods (P25-P26) show a very slight upward tick towards 50, it remains significantly below the spring/early summer levels. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. With only 1 unit on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current summer low-regime statistics while allowing for the slight recent variance. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the anticipated ~40-50 units of demand for the upcoming period without overstocking as we approach the end of summer.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are exiting the summer low-demand period (July average ~40) and entering late August, where 'Back to School' and transition to autumn typically drive an increase in demand for denim/jeggings. Observed demand in Period 27 was 73 units, the highest since mid-June, causing a stockout. This signals a transition from the 'Summer Low' regime (P20-P26) to a higher early-autumn level. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (P24-P27) which captures both the low base and the recent uptick, but will use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this transition period and to prevent frequent stockouts as demand ramps up. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand beginning to rise from summer lows (P27 demand: 73 vs P20-P26 avg: 40), likely driven by late August/Back-to-School seasonality for denim.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/26 (Period 29). Demand has officially exited the summer low-demand regime (~40 units/week). Period 27 demand was 73 and Period 28 demand was 79. This confirms a significant and sustained upward shift associated with late August/Back-to-School seasonality for denim. I am setting mu_hat using N=3 (Periods 26-28) to capture this rising momentum (average of 51, 73, 79 = 67.7). With a promised lead time of 0 (L=0), the target stock is 1 period (1+L). The previous replenishment arrived on time, maintaining a lead time of 0. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to account for increased volatility during regime shifts. The target base stock will be slightly above the current mean to ensure availability as demand continues to ramp up toward the fall season.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand uptick confirmed: Demand increased from summer average (~40) to ~76 units over the last 2 weeks (P27-P28), marking the start of a fall recovery regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02 (Period 30). We are tracking 'Jeggings H.W', a product highly susceptible to seasonality. Historical data and recent carry-over insights confirm a 'Back-to-School' fall recovery regime. Demand has increased from a summer low of ~40 units (P20-P26) to 73, 79, and 100 in the last three periods (P27-P29). The demand of 100 in Period 29 resulted in a stockout, indicating that current supply is trailing demand growth. September typically sees sustained demand for denim as temperatures drop and school/work routines solidify. To avoid further lost sales and capture the fall trend, I am moving to a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to reflect the immediate recovery (Avg P27-P29 = 84 units per period). Because lead time is consistently 0, the target base stock must cover (L+1) = 1 period. For sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility during this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Fall recovery regime strengthening: Demand reached 100 units in P29, confirming a return to the ~100-110 units/week baseline observed in early spring.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223033 (Jeggings) is in a clear 'Fall Recovery/Back-to-School' growth phase. Demand has risen from a summer low of ~40 units to 129 units in Period 30. Date is 2019-09-09, which aligns with peak back-to-school and cooler weather transitions for denim. Historical data from early February (P1-P2) also showed higher demand (186, 134), suggesting a baseline of 120-140 is appropriate for this season. The system has stocked out for the last four consecutive periods (P27-P30) because the OR backend's default stats are likely lagging the rapid upward shift. To prevent further lost sales during this growth phase, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P28-P30) which captures the recovery (avg ~103), but since demand is 129 and trending up, I'll use explicit to set a slightly higher base stock. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall recovery confirmed and accelerating: Demand increased from ~76 (P27-P28) to 129 (P30), returning to early spring levels of ~130 units/week.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical demand shows a confirmed fall recovery for this denim SKU, likely driven by back-to-school and cooler weather. Recent demand over the last four periods (P28-P31) has been 79, 100, 129, and 102 units, resulting in an average of 102.5 units per week. This aligns with the early spring baseline of ~100-110 units observed in Feb-March. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments have concluded with an actual lead time of 0. I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'Fall Recovery' regime while ignoring the lower summer demand. Setting L to 'calculate' will reflect the observed 0-day lead time.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand stabilized at ~103 units/week (P28-P31), consistent with early spring baseline levels.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high-demand spring, a low-demand summer (averaging ~40 units), and a significant 'Back-to-School' fall recovery starting around Period 27/28. Over the last 4 periods (P29-P32), demand has averaged 114 units (100, 129, 102, 125), which aligns with the early spring baseline of ~110-130 units. The consistent actual lead time remains 0 periods. To account for this stabilized fall regime while remaining responsive to the current volatility (std dev of ~14 in the last 4 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this specific post-summer recovery level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2641.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (Sept 23, 2019), we observed a massive demand spike of 266 units, which is more than double the stabilized fall average of ~114 units (P29-P32). This spike likely corresponds to a specific late September retail event or a seasonal shift in weather driving denim sales. Because on-hand inventory was exhausted (sold 139 of 266 demand), we are starting Period 34 with 0 inventory. The inventory policy must now account for this significantly higher volatility and the potential for a sustained higher demand regime as we move into October. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 (P29-P33) to capture the trend while weighting the recent outlier, and use explicit sigma_hat to provide a buffer against the high variance observed in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike in Period 33: Demand reached 266 units, a 130% increase over the previous 4-week average of ~114, causing a stockout. This signals either a high-variance outlier or the start of a late-fall peak regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant spike in Period 33 (266 units), followed by a return to a more moderate but still elevated level in Period 34 (143 units). This indicates we are in a 'Late Fall/Pre-Holiday' regime, which is typically stronger than the late-summer baseline. The Period 33 spike caused a stockout, and while Period 34 demand was lower, it remains significantly higher than the P28-P32 average of ~107. To prevent further stockouts during this high-volatility period, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current fall elevation (Avg P31-P34: ~159 units) and selecting a wider sigma_hat via recent_N (N=7) to account for the massive variance introduced by the P33 spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late Fall regime confirmed: Demand shifted from a baseline of ~107 (P28-P32) to an average of ~159 (P31-P34) with high volatility (peak 266), mirroring early spring spikes.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223033 (Denim Jeggings) is currently in a 'Late Fall' regime characterized by higher demand and increased volatility, likely influenced by the transition into cooler weather in October. Over the last four periods (P32-P35), demand has averaged 164.75 units, driven by a significant peak of 266 in P33. While demand moderated in P34 (143) and P35 (125), the volatility remains high compared to the summer and early fall baselines. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level to prevent the stockouts observed in P33. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this elevated demand regime and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to account for the recent spike's impact on safety stock. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in a late fall regime where demand has been volatile, with a significant spike in Period 33 (266 units) followed by a moderation to 143, 125, and 81 units in the subsequent weeks. Although the most recent demand (P36: 81) shows a dip, the average demand for the current regime (starting P33) is approximately 154 units. The Carry-Over insights from Period 35 confirmed a shift to an average of ~159 units. Given the high volatility observed in this period last year during spring (P7 spike), it is prudent to maintain a buffer. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the mean of the late-fall regime (P33-P36) and use N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the high variance (266 peak vs 81 low). This balances the need to cover potential spikes while recognizing the recent cooling trend.

Carry-over insight: Late Fall regime (P33-P36) shows high volatility with a mean of ~154 units (range 81-266), mirroring the unstable spring peak patterns.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223033 (Jeggings) is currently in a 'Late Fall' regime characterized by significant volatility and periodic demand spikes. Period 37 saw a sharp demand increase to 233 units, following a quieter Period 36 (81 units). This mirrors the pattern seen in Periods 33-35 (266 followed by 143 and 125). In this regime (P33-P37), the average demand is approximately 170 units per week with a high standard deviation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 52 units with no units in transit. Since the promised lead time is 0 and consistently realized as 0, I will set L to calculate. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a N=5 window (P33-P37) to capture this specific late-fall volatility while ensuring the base stock level is high enough to mitigate stockouts during the frequent spikes (~200+ units) characteristic of this product's current behavior.

Carry-over insight: Late Fall regime (starting P33) confirmed with extreme bi-modal volatility: mean ~170 units, but alternating between low (~80-120) and high (~230-270) demand weeks.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223033 (Denim Jeggings) is currently in a 'Late Fall' regime characterized by high demand and extreme bi-modal volatility. Recent demand for Periods 37 and 38 was 233 and 234 units respectively, following a pattern of alternating between lower (~80-130) and significantly higher (~230-270) demand weeks. The mean demand over the last 6 periods (P33-P38) is approximately 180 units, but the last two weeks suggest a sustained peak. Given the date (Nov 4) and the product type (denim), this likely corresponds to pre-holiday shopping or seasonal transitions. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current high-volatility regime mean (approx 180), and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to account for the massive swings observed (standard deviation is roughly 75 in this window). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late Fall regime (P33-P38) confirmed as high-volume with significant bi-modal spikes; demand reached 230+ units in consecutive weeks (P37-P38), significantly above the P28-P32 baseline of ~107.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223033 is currently in a 'Late Fall' regime characterized by significant volume increases and high bi-modal volatility. Since Period 33, demand has fluctuated between ~80 and ~270 units, with the most recent three periods (P37-P39) averaging 204 units (233, 234, 145). The previous 7-period average (P33-P39) is approximately 175 units with a high standard deviation. Given we are approaching mid-November (2019/11/11), there is a strong possibility of sustained high demand or further spikes as holiday shopping commences. To ensure high service levels (Profit/Holding cost ratio \u2248 19) and prevent stockouts seen in P33, I am selecting a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture the high-volume regime while using an explicit sigma_hat of 80 to account for the extreme bi-modal swings observed between 145 and 234 in the last three weeks. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Late Fall high-demand regime (P33-P39) shows a mean volume of ~175 units with extreme bi-modal volatility (range 81-266), significantly higher than the early fall baseline of ~107.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223033 (Jeggings) is currently in a late-fall high-demand regime, which began around Period 33 (late September). The current date is 2019-11-18, approaching the typical peak retail season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Demand history from P33 to P40 shows a mean of approximately 175 units with significant bi-modal volatility (ranging from 81 to 266 units). The most recent demand (P40) was 127 units, but the preceding weeks were much higher (145, 234, 233). To capture this high-volume, high-variance regime, I am using a recent_N approach with N=8 (covering the entirety of the late-fall regime from P33 onwards). This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover potential spikes up to 260+ units while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat). The lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223033 (Jeggings) is currently in a late-fall high-demand regime (starting Period 33), characterized by a mean demand of approximately 175 units and extreme bi-modal volatility (ranging from ~80 to 266). We are currently in late November (P42), approaching the end of the game (P47). Recent demand in P40-P41 (127, 103) has trended toward the lower end of this regime's range, while the previous weeks (P37-P38) saw spikes of 230+. To capture the risk of another spike while accounting for the recent softening, I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=9 (covering the entire high-volatility regime from P33 to P41). This N captures the current mean of ~162 units and the significant variance. The OR engine's service level (based on $19 Profit vs $1 Holding Cost) will naturally favor maintaining higher stock to capture these potential 200+ unit spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0.

This spike resulted in 0 on-hand inventory. The 'Late Fall' regime (starting P33) has shown extreme bi-modal volatility (ranging from 81 to 371), but with an increasing mean. For Period 43, I expect demand to remain elevated due to early December holiday shopping, though potentially cooling from the Black Friday peak. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (capturing the late fall regime P37-P42) to adapt to the higher volume while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the bi-modal spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Extreme Holiday peak confirmed in Period 42 (371 units), a 212% increase over the P33-P41 average (~175). Period 42 also marks the highest single-week demand for the year.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak. Period 42 saw a massive spike of 371 units (likely Cyber Monday week), while Period 43 demand dropped significantly to 84 units, which is typical of the post-Cyber Monday lull. The 'Late Fall' regime (P33-P43) has been extremely volatile with a mean of ~178 units and a standard deviation of ~85. Although demand cooled in Period 43, we are entering the final pre-Christmas push. I will use N=11 (the length of the Late Fall regime) to capture the high volume and volatility of this season, ensuring protection against another potential holiday spike before year-end, while balancing the current high on-hand inventory (282 units). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Cyber Monday lull confirmed in P43 (84 units) following the P42 peak (371 units). Late Fall/Holiday regime (P33-P43) mean demand now established at ~178 units with very high volatility (std ~85).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16) occurs mid-December, after the major Cyber Monday/late November peak (P42 demand: 371). Demand in P43 (84) and P44 (108) suggests a post-peak stabilization or a second smaller holiday wave before year-end. The 'Late Fall/Holiday' regime starting P33 has been extremely volatile (mean ~170, std ~85) with bi-modal spikes. Given the date, another pre-Christmas uptick is possible but likely lower than the P42 peak. I will use a recent_N (N=11) to capture the trend since the start of the late-fall regime (P33-P43), which balances the extreme peak of P42 with the more moderate preceding and following weeks. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the late December holiday period (Period 46, Dec 23). Historical demand for this SKU showed an extreme peak in Period 42 (Nov 25, likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday week) followed by a sharp lull (P43). However, demand has rebounded recently: P45 demand was 205 units, significantly higher than the post-peak baseline. This suggests a secondary Christmas/holiday rush. Given the 0-period lead time, we must ensure on-hand inventory covers the immediate period's demand. The demand from P33 onwards has been highly volatile (Late Fall/Holiday regime) with a mean and variance much higher than the summer/early fall baselines. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=13, covering the start of the Late Fall regime at P33) to capture this higher volume and volatility, ensuring we don't stock out if another 200+ unit week occurs, while acknowledging the 0-period lead time allows for rapid adjustment.

Carry-over insight: Secondary holiday demand spike confirmed in P45 (205 units), indicating sustained high volatility in the Late Fall/Holiday regime (P33-P45).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2528.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47 (Dec 30), we are exiting the peak Holiday/Late Fall regime. Historically (Jan 2019 data provided in prompt), demand in early January settled between 113-128 units. Recent demand has been highly volatile: P42 (371), P43 (84), P44 (108), P45 (205), and P46 (142). The average demand over the last 5 periods (Holiday peak/lull) is 182 units, but we expect a significant cooling as we enter the post-holiday January period. Comparing current dates to the provided historical January samples (avg ~122), a transition is likely. I will use recent_N with N=5 (P42-P46) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high volatility and volume of the current holiday exit, while relying on the backend's base-stock calculation (with its high service level target) to provide a buffer against potential lingering holiday shopping or January clearance demand. This ensures we don't stock out if January 2020 demand exceeds January 2019 levels. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday cooling expected: Comparing Period 46 (Dec 23) demand of 142 to historical Jan samples (avg ~122) suggests a return to baseline. Late Fall/Holiday regime (P33-P46) mean was ~175 units with extreme volatility.
