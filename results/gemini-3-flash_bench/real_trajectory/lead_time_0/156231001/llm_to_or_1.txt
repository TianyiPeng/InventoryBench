Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The SKU is 'Box 4p Tights' (20 denier), which is a staple item but may see demand shifts based on weather or seasonal transitions. Historical demand (5 samples: 186, 151, 151, 198, 215) shows a mean of approximately 180.2 units per week. The last two samples (198, 215) suggest a slight upward trend. Since this is the first period and on-hand inventory is 0, we need to establish a baseline order. The promised lead time is 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available history) to capture the current demand level. As promised lead time is 0, mu_hat will represent demand for one period (1+0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Box 4p Tights', which is a stable staple item, but can see early spring demand shifts. Looking at historical demand (186, 151, 151, 198, 215) and Period 1's actual demand of 203, the mean is approximately 184. In Period 1, the order of 205 arrived immediately (observed lead time = 0), matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 2) because Period 1 demand (203) nearly exhausted the stock (205). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (including the just-observed P1 demand of 203 and the 5 historical samples) to capture the current demand level. Since lead time is 0, (1+L) = 1, and the backend will calculate the mean and standard deviation of these 6 samples to set the base stock level.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 20 denier tights. Looking at history: demand has increased from a mean of ~180 (initial samples 1-5) to 203 (P1) and then a significant jump to 313 (P2). P2 demand (313) resulted in a stockout (sold only 207). This spike aligns with late February, often a transition period in fashion retail. However, the most critical observation is that the actual lead time is 0 (arrivals occur in the same period as the order). The OR backend's default base stock calculation uses profit/holding cost to target a service level. For this SKU, the critical ratio is 4/(4+1) = 0.80. Given the recent stockout and the clear upward trend, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (covering samples 2019-02-04, P1, and P2) to capture the higher mean (avg ~243) and sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. This should raise the base stock enough to cover the current demand regime. L=0 is confirmed by P1 and P2 arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). Comparing the demand samples from January (avg ~170) to the last two weeks in February (P2: 313, P3: 309), there has been a significant demand increase (~80%). This surge aligns with the start of the spring season for 20 denier tights. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory has hit 0 for two consecutive periods, indicating we are under-ordering relative to the new demand regime. I will use the last two periods (N=2) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent high-demand level and prevent further stockouts. mu_hat will be set explicitly to reflect the recent average of ~310 per period (review + lead = 1 period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-18: Average weekly demand increased from ~170 to ~310 (+82%) likely due to seasonal transition to spring hosiery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $811.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/11. Demand analysis shows a significant shift starting around mid-February (Period 2). While Period 1 demand was ~200, Periods 2-4 averaged ~285 (313, 309, 235). The carry-over insight noted an increase to ~310; however, Period 4 saw a slight dip to 235, bringing the recent 3-period average to approx 286. Promoted lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm actual lead time is 0. With an ending on-hand of 129 and high demand volatility (std dev ~40-50 in the recent regime), I will use the last 4 periods of available data (the start of the shift) to capture this new mean and variance. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock that accounts for the higher demand (~280-300 per period) while maintaining a safety buffer for the variability seen in Period 2 and 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $538.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 20 denier tights, which often sees a seasonal peak in early spring (Feb/March) followed by potential normalization or volatility. History shows a clear regime shift after Period 1 (where demand was 203) to a significantly higher level in Periods 2 and 3 (~310), followed by a drop in Period 4 (235) and Period 5 (170). The recent demand in Period 5 (170) is significantly lower than the 'spring peak' average previously identified. Since the most recent 4 periods (P2-P5) average 257 units and show high variability, I will use a window (N=4) to capture this recent volatility while respecting the downward trend. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period for all 5 periods). Current on-hand is 142. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to account for the post-surge volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand volatility: Following the spring surge (~310), demand dropped to 235 and 170 in P4-P5, suggesting the peak may be passing or demand is highly variable.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' (Box 4p Tights) is currently in Period 7 (2019/3/25). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Historical demand shows a seasonal surge starting in P2 (late Feb), peaking at ~310 units, and then softening/stabilizing. Specifically, the last three periods of demand (P4-P6) are 235, 170, and 237, resulting in a recent mean of approximately 214 units. Given this post-surge stabilization and the seasonal nature of 20 denier tights (transitioning from early spring demand to stable spring usage), I am setting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this recent behavior using N=3. This balances the risk of over-ordering (given the drop to 170 in P5) with the need to cover the recent bounce-back to 237 observed in P6. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Post-surge demand (P4-P6) has stabilized at a lower mean of ~215 compared to the P2-P3 peak of ~310.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/01. Reviewing the historical data for SKU 156231001 (20 denier tights), demand has stabilized following a seasonal surge in late February. The demand over the last four periods (P4-P7) was 235, 170, 237, and 243, resulting in an average of 221.25. This supports the 'Demand stabilization' insight noted in the carry-over, identifying a new regime post-peak. The promised lead time is 0, and all historical arrivals have confirmed an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently very low (4 units on-hand, 0 in-transit), meaning we need a full replenishment to cover Period 8 demand. I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand level while ignoring the earlier extreme surge (P2-P3). The choice of N=4 balances the need for a stable estimate with the recent shift in behavior.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is Box 4p Tights, a seasonal hosiery item. In Period 8 (2019-04-01), we observed a significant demand spike to 351 units, which is higher than the previous spring surge peak (~310). This likely corresponds to pre-Easter demand or a specific spring transition event. We are currently out of stock (Ending On-hand: 0). The demand over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) shows high volatility (235, 170, 237, 243, 351) with a mean of 247.2. Given the stockout in P8 and the rising trend, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this heightened demand regime while accounting for the recent spike. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand surge detected in Period 8: Demand spiked to 351 (+44% vs previous 3-period average), likely tied to Easter/Spring seasonal peak.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. This is immediately after Easter (April 21 in 2019, but demand spikes usually precede the event). We observed a demand spike in Period 8 (351 units) and Period 9 (286 units). Historically, the lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (17 units) after the stockout in Period 8 was mostly replenished but then significantly depleted by Period 9's demand. Average demand over the last four periods (Periods 6-9) is (237+243+351+286)/4 = 279.25 units. Given that we are moving past the Easter peak, demand may begin to soften but is likely to stay above the pre-surge levels. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this elevated demand regime and ensure enough stock to cover the upcoming period, while maintaining the L=0 parameter since delivery has been instantaneous.

Carry-over insight: Easter demand peak observed in Period 8 (351) and Period 9 (286), confirming a seasonal surge for rights/hosiery in early April.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 (2019/4/22). History shows the seasonal demand peak associated with Easter (early April) has likely passed, as demand dropped from 286 (P9) to 214 (P10). In the 'Carry-over insights', it was noted that demand stabilized around 215 in mid-March (P4-P6), and the most recent demand (214) aligns perfectly with that baseline after the Easter surge. Therefore, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the post-peak trend (P8-P10, mean ~283) while allowing the OR backend to naturally adjust downwards as the 351 (P8) value drops out of the window. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods based on all 10 completed cycles. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect the recent high volatility observed during the Easter peak-and-fade, ensuring sufficient safety stock for any lingering seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter demand normalization: Demand returned to the pre-Easter baseline of ~215 units in Period 10 (214 units), confirming the holiday surge has ended.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we have exited the spring/Easter peak for hosiery (20 denier tights). Demand in the last two periods (P10: 214, P11: 181) confirms a return to the post-surge baseline identified in Period 7 (~215 units). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in every period (P1 through P11). Currently, we have 161 units on hand. To avoid overstocking during the late spring decline, I am using a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the trend of the last 5 weeks (mean ~253, which includes the tail end of the surge and the recent drop). This provides a balanced forecast that is more responsive than the full history but smoother than a 2-period view. Lead time L is kept at 0 (default).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Historical data for this hosiery SKU shows two distinct demand peaks: one in late February/early March (avg ~310) and an Easter surge in early April (avg ~320). Following the Easter peak, demand has normalized. Periods 10, 11, and 12 show demand of 214, 181, and 209 respectively, averaging approximately 201 units. This aligns with the 'post-surge' baseline previously observed in Period 7. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. With an ending on-hand inventory of 102 units, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture this stabilized post-holiday baseline while maintaining sufficient safety stock via sigma_hat to handle the inherent secondary-level volatility (std dev ~20-30).

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter stabilization confirmed: Demand for Periods 10-12 averaged 201 units, establishing a new May baseline after the seasonal April surge.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). Historical demand analysis confirms the Easter peak (late March/early April) has concluded. Demand for the last four periods (P10-P13) has been 214, 181, 209, and 185, with an average of 197. This represents a stabilized post-seasonal baseline. Lead time is reliably 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 to capture this stable post-peak demand level, which helps avoid overstocking following the high-demand periods in April. sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N (N=4) to account for current volatility. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a base stock level that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost, given the zero lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' (20 denier tights) has entered a stable post-Easter demand regime. Analyzing the demand history from Period 10 (2019-04-15) to Period 14 (2019-05-13), we see values of 214, 181, 209, 185, and 205. The mean for these last 5 periods is 198.8 units, which aligns with the 'carry-over insight' from Period 13 suggesting a May baseline of ~200. There is no evidence of a new seasonal shift as we move into late May. The lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as verified by every 'concluded' message (ordered and arrived in the same period). To capture this stable regime, I am using recent_N=5 for the demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This provides a tight, data-driven forecast that reflects the current 200-unit weekly baseline while providing enough buffer for the observed variance (std \u2248 14.5). Lead time is set to default (0).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is 20 denier matt tights, which typically sees peak demand in spring (February-April) and a secondary decline/stabilization as weather warms up. Historical data shows a clear post-Easter normalization starting Period 10 (mid-April). Demand for the last 6 periods (P10-P15) has been consistent: 214, 181, 209, 185, 205, 227 (Average ~204). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this stable post-peak demand regime (~204 units) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent variability. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' based on consistent historical 0-period arrivals.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. This SKU (20 denier tights) is a seasonal product that saw significant demand during the spring and Easter periods. Historical data from May (Periods 13-16) shows demand has moderated and stabilized, ranging from 157 to 227 units, with an average of 193.5 units. The most recent demand (Period 16) was 157 units, which is lower than the previous weeks, suggesting a potential downward trend as summer approaches and the need for tights decreases. There is no evidence of lead time deviation (consistently 0 periods) or lost shipments. To avoid overstocking during a likely seasonal decline in June, I will use a recent demand window (N=4) to capture the May baseline (~194 units) while allowing the OR engine to account for the most recent volatility. The service level target remains high due to the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter demand stabilization in May confirmed: Periods 13-16 average 193.5 units. Possible seasonal decline starting June (Period 16 demand dropped to 157).

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Matt tights' (20 denier) is entering a clear seasonal decline as warmer summer temperatures arrive. In the last two periods, demand has dropped significantly from the May baseline (~200) to 157 (Period 16) and 99 (Period 17). This trend is consistent with consumer behavior for hosiery as summer begins in June. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To adapt to this rapid drop and avoid excess holding costs (given current on-hand inventory is 120 units, which is already higher than the most recent demand), I will shift to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this downward trend immediately. Using N=3 (Periods 15-17) results in a mean of 161, which is a safer target than the long-term average as demand continues to cool.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand decline confirmed for June: Weekly demand dropped from ~200 in May to 157 (May 27) and 99 (June 3), signaling the end of the spring hosiery season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 20 denier tights, which is highly seasonal and typically sees a sharp decline in the summer months (June-July). Current history confirms this transition: demand dropped from a May average of ~200 to 157 (Period 16), 99 (Period 17), and 127 (Period 18). This reflects the seasonal end of the 'spring hosiery' season as warmer weather sets in. Given the consistent lead time of 0 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this new lower-demand summer regime (average demand ~127). The OR backend uses lead time L=0, meaning base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By using recent_N=3, the system will adjust the order downward to reflect the lower June demand baseline and minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand decline confirmed: Average weekly demand has dropped from ~200 (May) to ~128 (last 3 weeks of June) as the product enters the off-season.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (20 denier tights) is currently in a confirmed summer off-season decline. The demand trend for June (Periods 17-19) shows values of 99, 127, and 83, averaging approximately 103 units per week. This is a significant drop from the May average of ~193 and the April surge of ~300. The current on-hand inventory is 70. Given the promised lead time of 0 (which has been consistently 0 throughout history), the system will order enough to meet the base stock targets for the current period. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this lower summer demand level (avg ~103) and adjust the safety stock via sigma_hat (recent_N=3) to reflect the recent volatility in this lower regime. Setting L to default (0) as all historical orders have arrived within the same period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (20 denier tights) has entered a clear summer off-season decline. Weekly demand has dropped significantly from the spring average of ~200 to a recent 4-week average of 87.5 units, with the most recent observation being only 41 units (Period 20). The Promised Lead Time is 0, and historical observations confirm actual lead time remains 0. Currently, we have 81 units on-hand, which is nearly double the last period's demand. To avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand summer period, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand level (approx. 88 units/period). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=4) to account for the reduced volatility in this lower regime. This will likely result in a very small or zero order for Period 21, as the inventory position (81) already covers the forecasted demand for the immediate period and lead time.

Carry-over insight: Significant summer demand contraction confirmed: Demand dropped from ~130 in mid-June to 41 in late June (P20), establishing a summer baseline significantly lower than the spring average (~200).

This is a significant drop from the spring average (~200) and the early June average (~128). The promised lead time continues to be 0 periods, confirmed by the 'conclude' messages. Given the seasonality of 20 denier tights, we are likely at the summer baseline. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this low-demand regime, ensuring we do not over-order and incur holding costs during the off-season. Service level is maintained by the OR engine's quantile calculation (profit=4, holding=1, so ~80% target service level).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline confirmed: Period 19-21 average demand is 59 units, down from ~128 in mid-June through a sustained contraction.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (20 denier tights) is at the height of its summer off-season. Current demand shows a sustained low-level baseline: Period 19-22 demand values were 83, 41, 53, and 53 respectively. The average over these last four periods is 57.5 units. Given the transition from mid-June (~128 units) to July (~55 units), N=4 is the most representative regime length for the current summer trough. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Forecast parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) are set using recent_N (N=4) to align with this summer baseline and avoid over-ordering based on the high spring demand seen in earlier months.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 20 denier tights, which is highly seasonal and enters its lowest demand phase during the summer (July). Current demand has stabilized at a low baseline: the average demand for the last 3 periods (P21-P23) is 45.33 units, and the last 6 periods (P18-P23) average 64.5 units, showing a clear downward trend from the spring peak. Period 23 saw a demand of only 30 units. With 43 units on-hand and a promised/actual lead time of 0 (confirmed consistently in history), we are entering Period 24 with enough inventory to cover the expected low summer demand. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this most recent low-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to avoid over-ordering during the off-season. Lead time remains 0.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (20 denier tights) is at the peak of its summer off-season, which is reflected in the demand drop. Demand has plummeted from a late spring average of ~200 units to a very low summer baseline. Specifically, Period 24 demand was only 9 units, following a trend of 53, 53, 30, and 9 over the last four weeks. The current summer regime (Periods 20-24) shows an average demand of approximately 37 units (41, 53, 53, 30, 9). With an on-hand inventory of 48 units and lead time consistently 0, the current stock already covers the anticipated demand for the next period. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this low summer trough while maintaining a small buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed: July demand has reached a seasonal low, with Period 24 demand dropping to single digits (9 units). The current 5-period average is ~37 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' (20 denier tights) is currently in a deep summer seasonal trough. Historical demand has plummeted from ~200 in May to an average of ~33 units over the last 6 weeks (Periods 20-25), with the most recent demand being 19 units. The product is entering August, which typically remains off-season for hosiery. On-hand inventory is 34 units, which actually exceeds the recent weekly average. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture the current low-demand regime (averaging approx. 33 units), while maintaining the promised lead time of 0 periods. This strategy minimizes holding costs during the off-season while keeping enough stock to meet the current low baseline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 12, 2019. Period 26 demand spiked significantly to 84 units, breaking a sustained low-demand trend in July (where demand was mostly < 20). This suggests a potential early start to the autumn hosiery season as retailers transition away from summer. Previous periods (21-25) had average demand of ~33 units. However, given the sharp increase in Period 26 and the product type (20 denier tights), I expect demand to continue climbing toward the autumn. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this transition, while applying 'calculate' for lead time as the observed lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Early autumn demand recovery detected in Period 26: Demand increased to 84 units, significantly above the July average (~33), signaling the end of the summer trough.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Demand in Period 27 spiked to 197 units, following a recovery in Period 26 (84 units). This confirms a sharp regime shift from the summer trough (July average ~33) to an autumn surge. Tights typically see significant demand increases in late August as 'Back to School' and autumn preparation begins. The last two periods (84, 197) show a rapid acceleration. Setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods would yield (1+0)*(84+197)/2 = 140.5, but given the trajectory and historical spring peaks (~200-300), 140.5 likely underestimates the immediate need. However, using recent_N=2 is the most reactive balanced approach within the OR constraints. I will use recent_N=2 for demand to capture this momentum. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed starting August (P26-P27): Demand increased from summer lows (~33) to 84 (P26) and 197 (P27), indicating the start of the peak autumn hosiery season.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the late August period (2019/8/26), which signals the start of the autumn hosiery season. Demand has surged from a summer trough of ~33 units to 84 (P26), 197 (P27), and 149 (P28). The average of these three most recent periods is 143.3 units. Given the seasonality of 20 denier tights, we expect a rapid climb back toward the spring baseline of ~200 units as consumers transition to autumn wardrobes. The current on-hand inventory is 59 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts during this recovery phase, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the immediate autumn ramp-up, while using an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during regime transitions (197 vs 149).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' (20 denier tights) is entering the peak autumn season. Historical data shows a clear demand trough in July (averaging ~33 units) followed by a strong recovery in August (P26-P28), where demand reached as high as 197. Recently, demand has tempered slightly (P28: 149, P29: 114), but given the product type and the start of September, we expect demand to remain higher than the summer baseline. The current average of the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is 136 units. To capture the ongoing autumn recovery while acknowledging the slight cooling in the last two weeks, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4). The observed lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default. This configuration ensures the base stock reflects the current seasonal shift without overreacting to the single P27 spike of 197.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: After the initial August surge (P26: 84, P27: 197), demand in late August (P28-P29) has stabilized at a mean of ~132 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '156231001' (20 denier tights) is currently in its autumn seasonal recovery. Period 30 saw a significant demand spike to 243 units (Date: 2019/9/2), which exceeded the recent stabilized mean of ~132. This suggests a secondary autumn surge or higher-than-expected volatility as the weather cools. The inventory is currently 0, indicating a stockout in Period 30. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for demand to capture this recent increase while acknowledging the variability (recent demand: 84, 197, 149, 114, 243). Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 0-period lead time. Mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 5 periods to aggressively react to the autumn demand levels and prevent further lost sales during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge intensified in Period 30: Demand spike to 243 units (+84% vs P28-29 avg) indicates increasing seasonal strength or high volatility in September.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period 2019/9/16 indicates a significant and sustained autumn surge. In the last two periods, demand has jumped to 243 (P30) and 274 (P31), resulting in stockouts. The current 3-period average (P29-P31) is 210 units, while the 2-period surge average is 258 units. Given the product is '20 denier hosiery', this aligns with seasonal back-to-school and autumn wardrobe transitions. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility (sigma), I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this intensified autumn regime (avg ~210). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'ordered on Period Z, lead_time was 0 periods' history, including the most recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge intensified further in September: Period 30 and 31 demand averaged 258 units, a significant increase from the August baseline of ~132 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $993.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (20 denier tights) has entered its peak autumn seasonal regime. Current demand observations for September (P30: 243, P31: 274, P32: 255) show a sustained and high average of 257.3 units per week, which is significantly higher than the August baseline. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profitability ($4.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0), the service level remains high. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus exclusively on this high-demand September regime and ensure sufficient inventory to prevent stockouts seen in P30 and P31. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the current volatility of this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand confirmed for September: Periods 30-32 average demand is 257 units, establishing a high-volume seasonal baseline significantly above the August average of ~132.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 156231001 (20 denier tights) is experiencing a powerful autumn seasonal surge. In Period 33, demand spiked to 496 units, nearly double the average of the preceding three periods (approx. 257 units). This indicates an intensification of the peak season as we enter October. The current stock-out (ending on-hand inventory = 0) confirms that previous parameters were insufficient for this acceleration. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this significant momentum and avoid further lost sales while balancing the high holding cost ($1 vs $4 profit), I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat. Given the jump to ~500 units, I will set mu_hat to 500 (covering review period + 0 lead time) to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to meet this new demand level. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for the increased volatility seen during recent peak periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn peak intensification: Demand surged from a Sept average of ~257 to 496 in Period 33 (+93%). This confirms a high-velocity peak regime for October.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Box 4p Tights' is experiencing its autumn peak season. Period 33 saw a massive demand spike to 496 units, followed by 358 units in Period 34. This indicates a high-demand regime for October (avg 427 units over the last 2 weeks). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the autumn surge while accounting for the high volatility (std dev) observed in recent weeks, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current seasonal regime. Specifically, mu_hat should reflect the recent average which is significantly higher than the all-time mean. Period 34 demand (358) shows a slight deceleration from Period 33 (496), but still remains very high compared to September levels (~257). Setting N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the surge starting from Period 30.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak plateau/adjustment: After a spike to 496 (P33), demand stabilized at 358 (P34). The early October average is ~427, confirming a high-velocity regime for the hosiery category.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak autumn hosiery season (mid-October). Period 35 demand was 351 units, following a volatile but high-demand period (P33: 496, P34: 358). The average demand over the last three weeks (P33-P35) is approximately 402 units, confirming a high-velocity regime significantly above the September average (~257). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the priority is maintaining high availability to capture this seasonal peak. I will use the last 3 periods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current plateau, ensuring the base stock level is responsive to the recent ~400 units/week volume while accounting for the high volatility seen in P33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1214.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 20 denier tights, a seasonal product that peaks in autumn and spring. We are currently in mid-October (P37), the peak of the autumn season. Demand over the last four periods (P33-P36) has been 496, 358, 351, and 337, demonstrating a high-velocity plateau following the initial October spike. The average demand over these four periods is approximately 385 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this current peak regime (385 units per period) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in the transition (especially the 496 spike in P33). This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock high enough to prevent stockouts during this high-velocity seasonal window while reflecting the slight downward normalization seen in the last three weeks.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak stabilization: Demand has averaged 385 units over the last 4 periods (P33-P36), confirming a high-velocity autumn plateau for the hosiery category.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (20 denier tights) is currently in its peak autumn season. Demand has been high and relatively stable over the last five periods (P33-P37), with an average of 397.8 units. The most recent demand (P37) was 447 units, indicating sustained high velocity as we move into late October. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level during this peak without overstocking as we approach potential November shifts, I am using the recent_N method based on the current high-velocity regime (last 5 periods). Setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current season's mean (~398 units) and volatility accurately.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the peak autumn/winter hosiery season. Demand over the last five periods (P34-P38) has been 358, 351, 337, 447, and 309, averaging approximately 360 units. While demand stabilized around 385 units in Oct, the most recent value (309) and the preceding peak (447) show high volatility. Given the 20 denier tights description, demand is expected to remain high through November. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-velocity regime while allowing for the recent fluctuation in demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak maintained through October: Average demand for P34-P38 is ~360 units, confirming a sustained high-velocity regime for the category into November.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a sustained high-velocity autumn/winter demand regime for tights/hosiery. Demand has averaged ~355 units over the last 6 periods (P34-P39: 358, 351, 337, 447, 309, 322). This follows the massive October spike. As we move further into November, demand is expected to remain high due to colder weather, though there is some fluctuation. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this high but slightly volatile plateau, I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat to set the base stock level around the current regime mean. For sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture the volatility of both the peak and the subsequent stabilization, ensuring sufficient buffer against the 400+ unit spikes seen recently.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the mid-November period for hosiery (20 denier tights). Historically, demand for this category intensified in October (Avg ~385) and has shown a slight deceleration in the first two weeks of November (P39: 322, P40: 271). The recent 3-period average is ~300 units. I will use a recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the broader high-velocity autumn/winter regime (~350 units per period) while allowing for the slight downward trend observed in the last two weeks. This provides a safety buffer for potential late November/Black Friday spikes, which are common for basic apparel. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Mid-November demand normalization: After the October peak (~385), demand in early November (P39-P40) has averaged ~296 units, suggesting a slight stabilization before potential holiday surges.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for this 20 denier hosiery SKU has normalized following the October peak. In the last three periods (P39-P41), demand has been 322, 271, and 285 units respectively, creating an average of 292.7 units. This represents a stabilization around the ~300 unit mark as we move deeper into November. While a pre-holiday surge is possible in December, the immediate trend is slightly down from the October plateau (~360-385). I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this most recent stabilization for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, which is confirmed by every historical conclusion (arrived=ordered in the same period).

Carry-over insight: Mid-November stabilization: Demand has stayed consistent between 270-325 units (avg ~293) for the last three periods (P39-P41), following the October high of ~385.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/2 (Period 43). This is the start of the deep winter/holiday season for 20 denier tights (Box 4p Tights). Historical demand in Period 42 showed a significant spike to 461 units (+62% vs. the previous 3-period average of ~293), likely signaling the start of a pre-holiday surge. My previous stabilization estimate (~293) was too low for this seasonal shift. I am resetting the demand mean (mu_hat) to reflect this higher velocity. Because we are entering the peak holiday month (December), I will use an explicit forecast of 450 units to ensure sufficient stock for potential further increases, as 20 denier hosiery is a key winter category. On-hand is currently 0 due to the large demand spike in P42 exceeding available supply. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected starting Period 42: Demand spiked to 461 units (+62% vs Nov baseline), signaling the start of the December peak for hosiery.

However, the 200 unit figure is likely misleading due to potentially partial sales or early-period stabilization before the final December push. Given the history of the autumn peak averaging ~385 and a holiday surge expected to exceed that, the Period 43 demand of 200 is treated as a high-volatility outlier or a mid-surge dip. I will forecast mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the transition from mid-November (avg ~293) into the holiday peak, but I will provide a slightly higher explicit sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed between Period 42 (461) and Period 43 (200). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: December demand spiked to 461 (P42) then dropped to 200 (P43), indicating extreme week-to-week variance during the peak hosiery season.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019, which is the peak holiday shopping season for hosiery/tights. Demand in the last three periods has been highly volatile: 461 (P42), 200 (P43), and 367 (P44), averaging 342.6 units. This is significantly higher than the mid-November baseline of ~293. The drop to 200 in Period 43 appears to be a weekly oscillation rather than a trend reversal, as Period 44 bounced back to 367. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this high-velocity holiday demand while managing the risk of sudden post-holiday drops, I will use recent_N with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat). This results in an average of ~343 units. I will use the default sigma_hat to ensure adequate safety stock during this volatile period, as the standard deviation of all samples will reflect the category's natural variance.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed for December: Periods 42-44 average 343 units with high week-to-week volatility (range 200-461).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), which is the peak of the Christmas/Holiday season for hosiery. In the previous period (P45), demand reached a seasonal high of 468 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). Demand throughout December has been highly volatile but stays in a high regime, averaging approximately 374 units (P43: 200, P44: 367, P45: 468). Historically, for this product category, demand typically remains elevated during Christmas week but may drop significantly immediately after. Given the recent stockout and the high seasonal velocity, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to capture the current December average (~345) and sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed in this window (ranging from 200 to 468). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand intensified late December: Period 45 demand reached 468 units, the highest since October. 3-period December average (P43-P45) is 345 units with high volatility.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-30. Period 46 saw high demand (450 units), continuing the late December peak (P45: 468, P46: 450). Demand since Period 42 has been extremely volatile but generally high, with a 5-period average (P42-P46) of approximately 389 units. Historically, hosiery demand tends to drop significantly after the New Year (as seen in the initial samples from Jan 2019: 186, 151, 151, 198). However, we must ensure enough stock for the immediate transition out of the holiday peak. The current on-hand inventory is very low (9 units). With a promised lead time of 0 (consistently realized in history), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current high-velocity regime while recognizing that sigma_hat should remain high to account for the extreme week-to-week volatility observed in December (range 200-468).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand transition: High holiday demand (avg ~389 units/week in Dec) is expected to normalize to late-January levels (~170 units) based on historical Jan 2019 samples.
