Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'Cheeky Tanga' swimwear bottom. This category typically sees a significant demand increase as spring approaches in the Northern Hemisphere. Historical data from late January and early February shows a demand jump from 0 to approximately 80 units per week. The last three data points (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) show demand of 69, 88, and 88, indicating a new demand regime (~81.67 units/week) compared to the zero-demand start of January. With a promised lead time (L) of 0, the target base stock must cover at least the current period's expected demand. Given the seasonal relevance of swimwear in February, I will project demand based on the most recent 3 samples (N=3) to capture this upward shift, while maintaining the default lead time (0 periods) until observed otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'Simple as that Cheeky Tanga', a swimwear bottom. Historically (Jan-Feb), demand has been 0, 0, 69, 88, 88, and most recently 77 in Period 1. This suggests a seasonal ramp-up as spring approaches. Period 1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0 (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). With 23 units on hand and 0 in transit, we need to order to meet expected demand. Given the item's seasonality (swimwear in February), demand is likely to stay at these levels or increase slightly. I will use recent history (N=3) to estimate demand (approx 84 units/period) and volatility to ensure high service levels while minimizing holding costs.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Cheeky Tanga' swimwear product. Current date is 2019-02-25. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 69, 88, 88 (Jan) and 77, 94 (Feb weeks). This aligns with the transition into the spring break and summer preparation season for swimwear. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods for the last two orders. The backend OR logic uses q = Profit/(Profit+Holding) = 19/20 = 0.95. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent growth (averaging 86.3 over the last 3 samples: 88, 77, 94) and 'default' for sigma to reflect the inherent volatility of a growing seasonal product. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock high enough to cover the immediate period's demand without overstocking too early in the season.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Cheeky Tanga' swimwear bottom. We are currently in early March (2019-03-04), heading into the spring/summer season for the Northern Hemisphere, where swimwear demand typically accelerates. Historical demand samples (late Jan to early Feb) were around 70-80 units. In the first three active periods, demand has been 77, 94, and 69 (average ~80). The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently 86 units. Given the transition into March, I will use a conservative recent average (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level (~80 units/week), while staying alert for the seasonal uptick as spring progresses. With a 0-period lead time, the OR backend logic will target a base stock covering the current period's demand.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a 'Cheeky Tanga' swimwear bottom, which is highly seasonal. We are entering the Spring season, moving towards Summer, where demand for swimwear typically increases. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 69, 88, 88, 77, 94, 69, 79. The mean of these 7 samples is approximately 80.57. However, with the transition into March (Period 5), we anticipate a seasonal uplift. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will set L to 'default' (0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent demand behavior while entering the spring season, providing a stable baseline for the OR backend to calculate the inventory target (Base Stock).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Cheeky Tanga' swimwear bottom. As of March 18th (Period 6), we are entering the spring season where demand for swimwear typically accelerates. Historically, demand has been stable around 80 units, but Period 5 saw a significant jump to 124 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 102, ending 0). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this seasonal ramp-up, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend (averaging approx 90.6 units/period) and provide a buffer for the expected spring increase. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock. With L=0, the OR backend aims to cover the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 5 (124 units), likely signaling the start of the spring swimwear season. Previous 4-week average was 79.7.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019-03-25). The SKU 688537004 is a swimwear item. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend as we enter spring: P3: 69, P4: 79, P5: 124, P6: 172. The stock-outs in Period 5 (demand 124, sold 102) and Period 6 (demand 172, sold 139) indicate that the previous demand estimates were too conservative. The average demand of the last two periods is 148, but the trend suggests it will continue to rise. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on this new higher-demand regime. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. The OR backend needs higher base stock to accommodate the seasonal surge and prevent further stock-outs, as lost sales at $19 profit far outweigh $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand increased from an average of 80 (P1-P4) to 148 (P5-P6). Accelerated growth (+38% week-over-week in Period 6) aligns with spring seasonal ramp-up for swimwear.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, and the product is a 'Cheeky Tanga' bikini bottom. We are in a clear spring seasonal ramp-up for swimwear. Demand has increased significantly over the last three weeks: Period 5 (124), Period 6 (172), and Period 7 (198). The average demand of the last three periods (the high-growth regime) is 164.67 units, compared to the initial average of ~80. Given the date (April 1st) and the product type, demand is expected to continue increasing or at least sustain these high levels as the peak summer season approaches. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 5 and 6 and to account for the current demand level of ~200, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to the current seasonal regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Average demand for P5-P7 (164.7) is more than double the P1-P4 average (80), confirming peak spring/summer swimwear seasonal regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4313.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear item, and demand has entered an explosive growth phase consistent with the peak spring/summer season. Demand in Period 8 reached 309 units, far exceeding the P5-P7 average of 164.7 and leading to a significant stockout (sold 227 vs 309 demand). Current inventory is zero. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this sharp upward trend and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3, which covers the period from P6 to P8. However, because P8 demand (309) is much higher than P6 (172) and P7 (198), I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers an anticipated demand of ~320 units. This allows the system to build enough inventory for the continuing seasonal peak while balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly in Period 8 (309 units), a 56% increase over Period 7 (198). This confirms a high-velocity peak season for swimwear starting April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, and the product is a swimwear bottom, which is currently in its peak demand season. Looking at historical demand, there was a major regime shift starting in Period 5 (March), with recent demand stabilizing around 308-309 units in Periods 8 and 9. This represents a high-velocity period compared to early February. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 10, I will set L to 'default' (0). I am targeting a base stock that covers the current high demand level. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=2 to capture the most recent stabilized peak (avg of 309 and 308 = 308.5). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=2 to reflect the recent high volatility observed during this peak. This strategy ensures the OR backend orders enough to meet the 300+ units/week demand while managing the risk of stockouts during the spring surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a peak level of ~308 units/week over Periods 8 and 9 (April), confirming the full transition into peak swimwear season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5810.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (2019-04-22), which is the heart of the peak swimwear season. Demand has stabilized at a high level, with the last three periods (P8-P10) showing demand of 309, 308, and 306 respectively (avg ~308). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Inventory is currently very low (4 units on-hand, 0 in-transit) after satisfying Period 10 demand. To maintain the high service level required by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3-period regime (P8-P10) where demand has plateaued at its peak. This ensures we order enough to cover the expected ~300+ units for the current period while accounting for the low volatility observed during this plateau.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019, which is the heart of the spring/summer swimwear shopping season. Demand in Period 11 spiked to 433 units, following a stable three-week peak of ~308 units (P8, P9, P10). The average demand over the last four periods (P8-P11) is 339 units. The stockout in Period 11 (sold 311 vs demand 433) indicates that previous parameters underestimated the variance and peak velocity. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To account for this higher seasonal ceiling and prevent further stockouts during this peak regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P8-P11) to capture the current high-demand environment, while using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility (from 306 to 433 in one week).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 11 demand reached 433 units, marking a new seasonal peak (+40% vs P10). Peak swimwear season is now significantly higher than the previous 300-unit plateau.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. This is the peak pre-summer season for swimwear. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: P8-P10 averaged ~308, which jumped to 433 in P11 and 383 in P12. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 367.8. Given the 'stock out' in P11 and nearly empty inventory in several recent periods, demand is likely still constrained by availability. Lead time remains consistently 0 (same-period arrival). I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture this high-velocity regime while allowing for the slight volatility seen between P11 and P12. This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~400 units/week volume required for the seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: May seasonal peak sustained: Average demand for P11-P12 is 408 units, a ~32% increase over the April plateau of ~308 units. Demand remains extremely high as summer approaches.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, right in the heart of the peak swimwear season. Historically, demand for SKU 688537004 has shown significant growth starting from March and peaking in May. Looking at the recent performance: Period 11 (433 units), Period 12 (383 units), and Period 13 (322 units). While Period 13 shows a slight dip compare to the extreme peak in Period 11, the 3-week average remains high at 379 units. This is consistent with the established seasonal pattern of sustained summer demand. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for highly responsive ordering. I will use a recent_N method with N=3 to capture this stabilized but high-velocity seasonal demand regime (mean ~379) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to prevent stockouts (which were observed in Period 11) while respecting the current three-week trend.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019, which is squarely in the peak spring/summer swimwear season for the 'Simple as that Cheeky Tanga'. Demand has stabilized at a high plateau over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), with values of 433, 383, 322, and 364, averaging 375.5 units per week. This follows a ramp-up from April's ~300 average. The observed lead time has consistently remained 0 periods (same-period arrival), which ensures that ordering based on the current period's expected demand is highly effective. To capture this stable peak seasonal demand and protect against under-stocking while demand remains high (inventory was exhausted in P11), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect the most recent regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to capture the current volatility during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in May (P11-P14) with a mean of 375.5 units, up from April's ~308 plateau (+22%). This represents the seasonal peak for swimwear.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-27, which is the final week of May and leading into the peak summer swimwear season (June/July). Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P11-P15) shows a high-volume regime with observations of 433, 383, 322, 364, and 346 (mean of 369.8). This confirms a sustained peak level compared to the April average (~308). The product is 'Simple as that Cheeky Tanga', a swimwear bottom, which aligns perfectly with this seasonal timing. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and responsive replenishment. To ensure we capture the remaining peak and potential June surges, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the stabilized May peak regime while discounting earlier lower-demand periods. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1) during the highest demand weeks of the year.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for Period 16 spiked significantly to 538 units, well above the May average of approx 375 units. This suggests we are entering the absolute peak of the summer swimwear season (early June). Despite a promised lead time of 0, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory due to the Period 16 stockout (sold 439 against demand of 538). We need to set parameters based on this new seasonal high. I will use a recent N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to lean into the recent upward trend, but will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat to account for the jump to >500 units observed in P16, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to meet this peak demand. I used recent_N (N=6) for sigma to capture the volatility of the high-season ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: demand surged to 538 units, a 43% increase over the May mean (375), signaling the June summer seasonal peak.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019, which is the peak summer swimwear season. In Period 16, demand surged to 538, and although it pulled back to 379 in Period 17, the seasonal context and extreme volatility (std ~112 in the last 7 periods) suggest we must maintain a high service level to capture potential spikes. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the high-demand volatility of the current plateau (averaging ~390 units/week), and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect the significant variability observed during this peak season. This ensures the base stock calculation, which uses a high critical ratio (0.95), will sufficiently cover the high end of possible demand scenarios while remaining sensitive to the current seasonal level.

Carry-over insight: June summer seasonal peak confirmed with high volatility. Period 16 (538) and Period 17 (379) show a mean of ~458 units, maintaining the peak seasonal regime established in late May.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019, which is the peak of the summer swimwear season. Demand over the last two periods (P17: 379, P18: 352) has moderated slightly compared to the surge in P16 (538), but remains high. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P16-P18) is 423 units. Given that we are in June, I expect demand to remain at this elevated level or slightly higher as we approach the summer solstice and peak vacation travel. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for highly responsive ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent peak-June regime (mean ~423, std ~100) while moving past the extreme outlier of P16. This should ensure we maintain enough stock for a potential late-June surge while acknowledging the recent stabilization.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, which is the peak summer swimwear season. Demand over the last four periods (P16-P19) has averaged 443.5 units, though it shows significant volatility (ranging from 352 to 538). Specifically, demand surged in Period 16 (538) and Period 19 (505). Since the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I need to ensure that (1+L) periods of demand are covered. I will use a 4-period window (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this intense June peak regime without over-relying on the lower demand levels from May. This approach targets the current high-velocity demand which is roughly 18% higher than the May average.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: June plateau confirmed. Average demand for P16-P19 is 443.5, driven by frequent spikes above 500 units, representing the established summer seasonal peak for womens swimwear.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. Historical data confirms we are in the peak summer seasonal regime for swimwear. Period 20 observed a massive demand spike of 799 units, the highest to date, which significantly exceeded our inventory (sold 595, left 0 on-hand). The previous four periods (P16-P19) had an average demand of 443.5; however, including P20 raises the 5-period average (P16-P20) to 514.6. Given the product's seasonal nature (bikini bottoms), early July is likely to remain at or near this peak intensity. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods. To avoid further lost sales like in P20, I am shifting mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this more aggressive \ucd5c\uadfc demand regime (N=5) to reflect the demonstrated July peak capacity (~515 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: demand surged to 799 units, a significant jump compared to the June average of ~443, indicating the highest phase of the summer seasonal peak.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, reflecting the middle of the summer peak for swimwear. Recent demand history shows a very high-velocity regime: P20 (799) and P21 (540). The average demand over the last two periods is 669.5 units, which is significantly higher than the June plateau (~443). Since the product is 'Womens Swimwear', we are currently in the expected annual demand peak (July). Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods consistently. I am setting L to 'calculate' (0) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture this immediate high-velocity July peak, while ensuring the OR backend order is aggressive enough to cover continued high demand before the end-of-summer taper begins. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=2) to account for the heightened volatility observed in the last two weeks (range 540-799).

Carry-over insight: July peak confirmed: Demand for P20-P21 averaged 669.5 units, a 50% increase over the June plateau of ~443, representing the absolute seasonal peak for swimwear.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, which is historically the absolute seasonal peak for swimwear in the Northern Hemisphere. Demand in the most recent periods (P20-P22) has averaged 607 units (799, 540, 483), confirming a step-change from the June average of ~443 units. Although Period 21 and 22 showed a sequential decline from the Period 20 peak of 799, this is likely mid-July volatility rather than a terminal seasonal drop, as summer demand typically stays high through the end of July. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as seen in all historically concluded periods. To avoid stockouts during this high-velocity window while accounting for the recent slight softening, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent July dynamics. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the immediate demand with a high service level appropriate for a $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak confirmed (P20-P22 average: 607 units), representing the highest sustained demand level of the season, significantly exceeding the June plateau of ~443 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. We are in the late July period for swimwear. Historically, demand peaked in late June and early July (P20-P21 average: ~670 units) and has since begun a downward trajectory (P22: 483, P23: 436). This suggests that while still in the summer season, the absolute peak has passed and we are entering a stabilization or late-season taper. The current on-hand inventory is 449 units. Using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (P20-P23) would average ~565 units, which is higher than the most recent observations. However, given the volatility (799 vs 436), maintaining a slightly higher mu_hat via recent_N=4 is prudent to avoid stockouts if another late-July spike occurs. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high volatility of the peak month while acknowledging the recent dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering from July peak: After a peak average of 670 units (P20-P21), demand has declined for two consecutive weeks (P22: 483, P23: 436), suggesting the start of the post-peak summer transition.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688537004 (swimwear) is currently in the post-peak summer transition. Period 24 demand (713) was a significant outlier/spike compared to the tapering trend observed in Periods 22 and 23 (483, 436), which likely indicates a late-July clearance or final summer surge. Given the date is July 29, we expect demand to continue its general downward trend as the school season approaches and summer concludes. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (average demand ~514) to capture the current volatility while acknowledging the tapering from the July 20-21 peak (~670). Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) captures the high recent variance (std ~148), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for potential late-season spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late July surge: Period 24 demand spiked to 713 units, interrupting the post-peak downward trend (P22: 483, P23: 436), suggesting high end-of-season volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in early August (Period 26). The product is womens swimwear, which has passed its absolute seasonal peak (July, P20-P24 average: 594 units). Recent demand shows high volatility: P24 was 713 units, followed by P25 at 383 units. Historically, August signals the beginning of the clearance/end-of-season phase. The mean demand over the last 6 periods (P20-P25) is 559 units, but the last two periods suggest a downward trend despite the P24 spike. Given the current on-hand inventory of 467 units and a promised lead time of 0, I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=4) to calculate mu_hat, capturing the transition from the 700+ peak toward the late-summer levels. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to account for the high volatility observed in the last month (range 383-713). Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed in all historical cycles.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak transition confirmed: Demand has become highly volatile in late July/early August (P24: 713, P25: 383), signaling the end of the high-velocity summer peak and the start of the seasonal drawdown.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688537004' (Swimwear Tanga) is currently in a seasonal drawdown phase as we move into mid-August (2019/8/12). Historical demand analysis shows a significant drop from the July peak (average ~600+) to a much lower level. Specifically, the last two periods (P25: 383, P26: 245) confirm a rapid deceleration. We are currently holding 498 units on-hand, which is significantly higher than the most recent demand observation. Given the seasonal nature of swimwear, demand is expected to continue declining. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (average demand P24-P26 is ~447) but rely on the OR engine's logic to see that current on-hand (498) is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the coming period (L=0). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal drawdown: Demand for Period 25-26 averaged 314 units, a 48% decrease from the July peak (average ~607 units), confirming the end of the summer swimwear peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2757.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's swimwear, which is now entering its post-peak seasonal decline (mid-August). Demand has dropped significantly: P26 (245) and P27 (180) are well below the July peak (average ~600) and the previous plateau (300-400). The current on-hand inventory is 663 units, which is enough to cover nearly 3-4 weeks of current demand levels. Since lead time is consistently 0, and we have significant excess inventory, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent downward trend (using recent_N where N=3 to capture the sharp drop from 383 to 180) and set L to default. This should result in zero or minimal new orders while we wind down inventory for the end of the season, avoiding excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal decline confirmed: Demand for P26-P27 averaged 212.5 units, a 65% drop from the July average (~607 units), reflecting the typical end of the swimwear season in mid-August.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Historical demand shows a consistent and significant downward trend as the summer swimwear season concludes. Demand has dropped from a July peak average of ~607 units to a recent 3-week average (P26-P28) of 187.3 units. The most recent demand (P28) was 137 units. Current on-hand inventory is 526 units, which already covers nearly 4 weeks of demand at current levels. To avoid excessive holding costs during this seasonal drawdown, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the most current declining demand regime. Given the high stock relative to the declining demand, the OR backend logic will likely result in zero or minimal ordering, which is appropriate as we phase out of the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal drawdown acceleration: Demand has declined for four of the last five weeks (P24-P28), with the most recent 3-week average (187.3) being 70% lower than the July peak (607), confirming a rapid end-of-season exit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2134.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, which is typically the very end of the summer swimwear season. Historical demand data shows a clear and significant decline over the last month: demand has dropped from a peak average of ~607 units in July to only 133 units in the most recent period. The last three periods (P27-P29) show demand of 180, 137, and 133 respectively, representing a plateaued but low end-of-season state. With on-hand inventory currently at 393 units, which is nearly 3x the recent weekly demand, there is a substantial surplus relative to the expected sales for the remainder of the season. To avoid excessive holding costs on what is likely transitioning into clearance items or dead stock, I am setting mu_hat to carefully reflect the most recent 3-week average (~150 per period including the safety margin) and utilizing the 'recent_N' method to weight the forecast toward the current low-demand regime. This will prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary replacement orders.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season plateau confirmed (P27-P29): Demand has stabilized around 130-180 units, marking an 80% decrease from the July peak of ~607. Significant inventory surplus (393 units) relative to current demand velocity.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688537004' (Swimwear) is in a clear seasonal drawdown phase at the start of September. Demand has dropped from a July average of ~600 units to a three-week average (P28-P30) of 112.3 units. The most recent demand (Period 30) was only 67 units, signaling a continued decline as the summer season ends. Current on-hand inventory is 326 units, which represents approximately 4.8 weeks of supply based on the most recent 3-week average, or nearly 5 periods of supply if using the P30 demand. Given this surplus, no new orders should be placed until inventory levels align with the lower demand regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most current post-peak deceleration (mean ~112) while allowing the existing on-hand stock to be slowly depleted, minimizing further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak drawdown accelerated in September: Demand dropped to 67 units in Period 30, marking the lowest level since the season began. Effective end-of-season mean (P28-P30) is 112.3 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688537004' (Swimwear Tanga) is currently in a deep post-peak seasonal decline as of mid-September. Demand has consistently dropped from its July peak of ~600+ units to a recent 3-week average (P29-P31) of approximately 89.7 units (67, 133, 69). The most recent observation (P31) shows demand at 69 units. Current on-hand inventory is 257 units, which at the current demand rate, covers roughly 3 periods of sales. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, the current stock is more than sufficient to cover immediate demand. The primary goal is to avoid accumulating more holding costs ($1.0/unit) while the product exits its seasonal relevance. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to reflect this lower-velocity end-of-season regime and allow the inventory to bleed down naturally. Ordering will remain at zero due to the existing inventory surplus relative to current demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal drawdown for swimwear confirmed: demand averaged 89.7 units over P29-P31, representing a >85% decrease from the July peak. Inventory levels are being managed down to minimize holding costs during the off-season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (womens swimwear) is in its clear end-of-season drawdown phase, as confirmed by late September dates and recent demand history. Demand has significantly decreased: P30 (67), P31 (69), and P32 (45), averaging 60.3 units over the last 3 weeks. Currently, we have 212 units on-hand, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 3.5 weeks. Since the lead time is 0 (arriving same-period), our current on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand without further ordering. The goal now is to deplete existing stock to minimize holding costs ($1.0/unit) as the off-season approaches. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3-period regime to reflect the current low-demand environment, which will prevent the OR system from generating new orders while on-hand inventory remains high.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor reached: September demand (P30-P32) has stabilized between 45-70 units, a 90% reduction from the July peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688537004 (swimwear) is in a deep post-peak seasonal drawdown. Historical demand has plummeted from a July peak average of ~600 units to a September floor (P30-P33) of approximately 56 units (67, 69, 45, 42). Current on-hand inventory is 170 units, which represents approximately 3 weeks of cover at the current demand velocity. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $19.0, and the continuing downward trend as we enter October, maintaining high safety stock is inefficient. I am setting L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current off-season floor (P30-P33) and prevent the OR backend from over-ordering based on the high-volume summer data. No new orders are expected or required this period as on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover the immediate demand while we continue to bleed off excess stock.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor confirmed: P30-P33 demand has stabilized at a mean of 55.75 units, significantly lower than the August drawdown phase. Continuing to prioritize inventory reduction for off-season.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019, which is deep into the off-season for swimwear. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) has stabilized at a low floor: 67, 69, 45, 42, 71 (mean = 58.8). The current on-hand inventory is 99 units, which covers approximately 1.7 periods of current demand. Since the promised lead time is 0 and recent history confirms that shipments arrive within the same period (L=0), we are currently overstocked relative to the mean demand. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized off-season floor while minimizing further inventory accumulation and holding costs. No new order will likely be triggered by the OR backend as current inventory (99) exceeds the calculated base stock for this low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Swimwear off-season floor confirmed: Demand for P30-P34 has stabilized at a mean of 58.8 units, marking the final stage of the seasonal drawdown.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019, which is deep into the off-season for swimwear. Demand remains at its seasonal floor, with the last 6 periods (P30-P35) averaging 55.7 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 59 units, which almost perfectly covers one week of demand at the current rate (mean ~56). Since the promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has consistently been 0, I can afford to keep inventory lean to avoid holding costs. To maintain a safe but minimal stock level, I will set mu_hat to be explicit based on the current 6-week off-season average (approx. 56) and use a recent_N sigma calculation centered on this low-demand regime to account for the reduced volatility compared to the summer peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, late autumn, and the SKU is a 'Cheeky Tanga' swimwear bottom. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm we are in the deep off-season. Demand has consistently stabilized at a floor level: the average demand over the last 7 periods (P30-P36) is 52.5 units, with the most recent sample at 34 units. We have 46 units on hand, which almost covers one full week of average off-season demand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR engine's base-stock policy will aim for high service levels, but we must prevent over-stocking during this low-velocity period. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized off-season floor (P30-P36). This ensures the backend calculates parameters based on the current 50-60 unit weekly demand regime rather than the high-volume summer peaks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained off-season floor confirmed (P30-P36): Demand has averaged 52.5 units over the last 7 weeks, with no individual week exceeding 71 units, representing a stable late-autumn baseline for swimwear.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear item (bikini bottoms) currently in its off-season (late October). Demand has stabilized at a very low baseline, averaging 52.5 units over the last 7 weeks (P30-P36). In the most recent period (P37), demand dropped further to 21 units. With a current on-hand inventory of 58 units and no in-transit orders, the inventory level is sufficient to cover approximately one week of the current 7-week average or nearly three weeks of the most recent demand level. Given the promised lead time of 0 (confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in recent history) and the holding cost of $1/unit, I will set parameters to maintain a lean inventory that covers the off-season floor without accumulating excess. I'll use a recent N=8 for demand to capture the full stabilization since the September drop (P30-P37).

Carry-over insight: Swimwear off-season floor remains stable through October: Demand for P30-P37 has averaged 48.6 units, significantly lower than the P27-P29 end-of-season plateau (~150 units).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear bottom entering early November. Historically, demand has stabilized at a low off-season floor (P30-P38 average: 47.1 units). The most recent period (P38) saw demand of 35 units, following a trend of very low volume typical for this category in late autumn. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (confirmed by P36, P37, and P38 conclusions), I will set L to 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the entire stable off-season floor period since P30 (range: 21-71 units). The inventory level (44 on-hand) is currently low but appropriate for this low-demand regime, and since lead time is 0, the OR backend will order only what is necessary to maintain this base stock level while minimizing holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the off-season floor for swimwear. Demand over the last 10 periods (P30-P39) has been very stable, averaging 49.9 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) averaging 33 units. Recent demand observations (34, 21, 35, 35) suggest a slight further cooling or stabilization at a very low level compared to the summer peak. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 42 units, which is approximately 1.25 weeks of current demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the most recent off-season stability while ensuring the OR backend maintains a lean inventory profile during this low-demand phase to minimize holding costs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688537004 (swimwear bottom) is currently in its off-season floor, with demand consistently averaging around 40-50 units per week since October. Period 40 saw a slight demand spike to 48 units, which depleted the remaining on-hand inventory (ending at 0). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable based on historical arrival data. To replenish stock and resume the off-season service level, I will set mu_hat based on the last 11 periods (P30-P40) to capture this stable late-autumn baseline (mean ~48.7 units). This approach balances the need to satisfy base demand while avoiding excess holding costs during a known low-demand period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a womens swimwear item (cheeky tanga bikini bottom), which is currently in its off-season (late November). Historical demand analysis shows a stable off-season floor starting from Period 30 (September). Specifically, for the last 12 periods (P30-P41), demand has averaged 45.25 units per week, with a recent range between 21 and 48 units. Period 40 saw a minor stockout which was corrected by a 73-unit order in Period 41, leaving 48 units on-hand for Period 42. Since the promised lead time is 0 and consistently observed as 0, the objective is to maintain a lean inventory to minimize holding costs while covering the stable off-season demand. I will use a recent_N of 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained low-demand regime since September.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Simple as that Cheeky Tanga' (womens swimwear) remains in its off-season floor as of early December (Period 43). Recent demand has been volatile but low: P40 (48), P41 (25), P42 (75), with a mean of 49.3 over the last three weeks. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 42 where demand (75) exceeded start-of-period inventory (72). As the promised lead time is 0, orders arrive within the same period. For Period 43, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-week average (approx 44 units) to cover the current baseline, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility (25-75 range). This ensures the OR engine places an order to replenish the 0 on-hand stock and provide a buffer for the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Swimwear off-season demand remains stable into December: P40-P42 average demand is 49.3 units, consistent with the October-November floor (~48-50 units).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a womens swimwear item in the off-season (December). Demand has stabilized at a low floor following the summer peak. Over the last 14 periods (P30-P43), the mean demand has been 46.4 units. In the most recent 4 periods (P40-P43), demand has shown some volatility (48, 25, 75, 37) with a mean of 46.25 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. With on-hand inventory at 39 units and no units in transit, I will set mu_hat to reflect the stable off-season mean (~46 units). I'll use recent_N with N=14 to capture this off-season floor while smoothing out the recent high volatility observed in P42. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current variance.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019, which is deep into the swimwear off-season. Demand for SKU 688537004 has remained remarkably stable and consistent with the established 'off-season floor' identified in the carry-over insights. The recent demand samples (P41-P44) are 25, 75, 37, and 35 units. While Period 42 showed a spike to 75, the overall average since Period 40 is approximately 43 units, which aligns with the long-term off-season average of ~48-50 units observed since October. Inventory is currently at 40 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the stable winter baseline while accounting for minor week-over-week volatility. Sigma_hat will also use N=10 to reflect the current moderate variance (influenced by the P42 spike) without being over-reactive to a single data point. This strategy maintains a low but safe stock level during the low-demand period, minimizing holding costs while preventing stockouts.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the week of Christmas. The SKU is a swimwear bottom, which is currently in its off-season demand floor. Historical data from October through mid-December (P30-P45) shows demand has stabilized at a low baseline, averaging approximately 51 units per week. Specifically, the last 4 weeks (P42-P45) have seen demands of 75, 37, 35, and 32. While there was a slight spike in P42 (75 units), the overall trend remains low and stable. Given we are in the middle of winter, no significant seasonal ramp-up is expected for several more weeks. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' replenishment. Current on-hand inventory is 31 units with 0 in-transit. To ensure high service levels during the holiday week while minimizing holding costs, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 10-week average (N=10), which captures the stable late-autumn baseline of approximately 42 units per week. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the deep off-season for swimwear. Historical demand throughout October, November, and December has consistently remained at a floor level, with the most recent 7 periods (P40-P46) averaging approximately 38.1 units. The observation from Period 46 shows a seasonal low of 15 units, likely due to the Christmas holiday period. Lead time has been consistently 0 throughout the history. Given the stability of the off-season regime and the current on-hand inventory of 48 units, which already covers the recent average demand, I will set parameters to maintain this baseline level and avoid unnecessary holding costs. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the specific late-year off-season behavior while smoothing out the very low holiday-week dip.
