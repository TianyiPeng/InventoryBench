Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is 'Super Skinny Low-Rise Slim Jeans' (Ladies Denim), which is a staple fashion item. On-hand and In-transit inventory are both zero. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed today should arrive within this same period to satisfy this period's demand. Based on the 5 historical demand samples (114, 94, 135, 102, 100), the mean is 109 and the standard deviation is approximately 16.4. Since this is the first period and we have no evidence of lead time deviation or demand regime shifts, I am using 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the most recent level. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level to cover current demand plus a safety buffer based on the observed volatility (approx 1.28 standard deviations for the targeted service level).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 starts on 2019/2/18. The product is a staple item (ladies skinny denim). In Period 1, the order of 136 arrived immediately (lead_time = 0 as promised), and demand was 127 units. On-hand inventory is now 9. Historical demand samples (last 5) show: 114, 94, 135, 102, 100, which average ~109. Period 1 demand (127) is slightly above this average but within a reasonable range. Given the promised lead time of 0 is currently reliable, I will use a 6-sample window (including the Period 1 demand) to calculate parameters. The N=6 window (114, 94, 135, 102, 100, 127) yields a mean of 112. This captures the slight recent increase while smoothing volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a Ladies Denim product. Historical demand (6 samples: 114, 94, 135, 102, 100, 127) and recent demand (Period 2: 113) show a stable pattern centered around 114 units/week. No significant seasonality or trend shifts are yet confirmed, though we are moving into the spring season. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is low (26 on-hand), so we need to order to meet next period demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent behavior while including enough samples to stabilize the estimate. Lead time remains 'default' at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1404.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is ladies' super-skinny denim (399087021). The historical demand average is approximately 109 units/period. The most recent demand (P3) dropped to 77, but the first two periods were 127 and 113. Observed actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promise. Currenly, we have 59 units on-hand. The OR backend will calculate a base stock. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), it will aim for a high service level. I will use the recent N=3 periods to inform the parameters, allowing it to adapt to the slight decline in demand while maintaining enough inventory to satisfy the average (~106 for the last 3 periods). Using 'default' for L keeps it at 0.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is 'Ladies Denim Super-Skinny Jeans'. Historical demand samples (Pre-game: 114, 94, 135, 102, 100) and game history (P1-P4: 127, 113, 77, 90) show a relatively stable mean of ~106 units/period. The promised lead time is 0, and all four game periods have confirmed actual lead_time = 0. On-hand inventory is 59. The OR backend uses a calculation for base stock (z* based on Profit $19 and Holding $1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand trend (averaging P4, P3, P2, P1, and the last pre-game sample), which covers the transition from February to March. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. L remains default (0).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is ladies' denim jeans. Reviewing historical demand (including pre-game samples): 114, 94, 135, 102, 100, 127, 113, 77, 90, 63. There is a visible downward trend in demand over the last four periods (from 113 to 63). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is high (~95%). However, recent demand is significantly lower than the overall mean. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~88.6) rather than the long-term average (~101). Given the decreasing trend, this helps prevent overstocking while maintaining enough inventory for potential volatility. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current variance.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Ladies Denim Super Skinny Low Rise' jean. Historical demand from Jan to mid-Feb (pre-game to P2) was consistently around 95-135 units. Starting in Period 3 (Late Feb), demand dropped to 77, 90, 63, and 61 (average ~73 over the last 4 weeks). This suggests a regime shift post-winter/early spring. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they were placed. Current on-hand is 76 units, which roughly covers one week of current demand. I will use a recent window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime seen since late February, while maintaining L=0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 3 (2019-02-25): average weekly demand decreased from ~110 to ~73 (-34%).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1, 2019. The product is a staple item (Super Skinny Ladies Denim). Historical demand showed a shift starting in Period 3 (late February), dropping from a mean of ~110 to ~73. Over the last 5 periods (P3-P7), demand has stabilized at an average of 69.6 units (77, 90, 63, 61, 57). While the initial 5-sample pre-game data (Jan/Feb) showed higher demand (avg 109), the recent lower regime is more representative of the current spring period. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this lower demand regime exactly. This will prevent overstocking and high holding costs. Current on-hand is 38, zero in-transit, which is below the expected one-period demand, necessitating an order.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P9 (2019-04-08). Analysis of the last 6 periods (P3-P8) shows a significant demand drop compared to the initial samples (avg ~66 vs previous ~110). Specifically, P8 showed an unusually low demand of 17, which might be a temporary outlier or a further downward trend. Since the product is 'Super Skinny Low-Rise Jeans' and it's early April, we are moving away from the peak winter/spring transition. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 76 units, which is higher than the recent average demand. I will use recent_N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime while being slightly cautious about the P8 outlier by using a window that includes the higher March values.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 3 (2019-02-25) confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~110 to ~66 across P3-P8. Note Period 8 (2019-04-01) showed a sharp low of 17 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087021 (Ladies Denim Trousers) has significantly decreased throughout March and early April, with the most recent periods (P8 and P9) showing extremely low demand of 17 and 8 units, respectively. This follows a broader regime shift that began in Period 3 where average demand dropped from ~110 to ~64, and is now falling further. Given the product is a standard 'Super-skinny low-rise jean', this drop might reflect a mid-spring seasonal transition or a waning trend for this specific fit. Current on-hand inventory is 94 units, which is quite high relative to the last two weeks of demand (avg 12.5). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid incurring unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent low-demand signals heavily. This will likely result in a very small to zero order for Period 10, allowing the existing on-hand stock to satisfy demand.

Carry-over insight: Further demand decline observed: Demand across P8-P9 (Apr 1 - Apr 8) averaged 12.5 units, a 80% decrease from the P3-P7 average of ~64 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087021 (Ladies Denim Trousers) has entered a significant downward regime. While demand was initially over 100 units/week, it dropped to ~60 from P3-P7, and has plummeted further in April (P8-P10), averaging only 14.3 units per week during this period. The current on-hand inventory is 76 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 5 weeks of supply. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, current inventory is vastly sufficient. To avoid excessive holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand average (~14) and volatility, allowing the inventory to bleed down without triggering new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 8 (2019-04-01): Average demand dropped from ~64 to ~14 units/week (-78%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a severe and sustained demand decline. Carry-over insights and recent history confirm a regime shift starting Period 8 (2019-04-01). Over the last four periods (P8-P11), demand has been 17, 8, 18, and 6, averaging 12.25 units per week. This is a significant drop from the P3-P7 average of ~64. Current on-hand inventory is 70 units, which is nearly 6 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to align with this lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering while the system burns off excess stock. Sigma_hat is also calculated over N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility in this regime. L remains at the promised default of 0.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087021 (Ladies Denim Trousers) has undergone a significant downward regime shift starting at Period 8 (April 1). Demand over the last five periods (P8-P12) has been 17, 8, 18, 6, and 16, resulting in an average of 13 units per week. This is a sharp decline from the previous regime (P3-P7 avg ~70). Currently, there are 54 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With the actual lead time confirmed to be 0 periods across all historical arrivals, the total pipeline inventory of 54 units covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate (13 units/week). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase while still maintaining a reasonable service level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the current regime). The OR backend will see that the current on-hand inventory (54) exceeds the base-stock levels calculated from this low demand, resulting in no new orders being placed until inventory levels naturally deplete to safer levels.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Denim Trousers) has experienced a sustained and severe decline in demand. The initial regime (Period 1-2) averaged ~120 units, the second regime (Period 3-7) averaged ~64 units, and the current regime (Period 8-13) has dropped to an average of approximately 11.5 units per week (specifically 17, 8, 18, 6, 16, 4). Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on history through Period 9. On-hand inventory is currently 50 units, which represents more than 4 weeks of supply at the current demand rate (~11.5/week). Therefore, no new order is required. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (Periods 8-13) and maintain L at 'default' (0). This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than current inventory, ensuring no order is placed while holding costs are managed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 8 (2019-04-01): average demand has stabilized at ~11.5 units/week over the last 6 periods, down from ~64 units/week in the prior regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087021 has undergone a significant regime shift. Starting Period 8 (2019-04-01), weekly demand dropped sharply and has remained consistently low. Over the last seven periods (P8-P14), demand values were 17, 8, 18, 6, 16, 4, and 8, resulting in a mean of 11.0 units/week. The current on-hand inventory of 42 units is sufficient to cover approximately 4 weeks of demand at this current rate. Since the promised lead time is 0 periods and the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. To reflect the current low-demand regime, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7, which captures the entire duration of the current regime starting from Period 8. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current demand environment rather than the higher historical averages.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Super Skinny Ladies Denim) has experienced a significant and sustained demand decline. Carry-over insights and historical data confirm a regime shift starting Period 8 (2019-04-01). Over the last 8 periods (P8-P15), demand has averaged approximately 10.5 units/week (17, 8, 18, 6, 16, 4, 8, 7), with a standard deviation of approximately 5.6. The current on-hand inventory is 35 units. Given that the promised and actual lead times are 0 periods, we currently hold over 3 weeks of stock based on the new demand average. To manage this decline and avoid unnecessary holding costs, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture the post-April regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since actual lead times consistently match the promised lead time of 0, I will use the 'default' method for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 8 (2019-04-01) remains stable at a low level: average demand of 10.5 units/week over the last 8 periods (P8-P15).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Ladies Super Skinny Denim) has entered a stable low-demand regime since Period 8 (2019-04-01). Over the last 9 periods (P8-P16), the average demand is 10.22 units/week (17, 8, 18, 6, 16, 4, 8, 7, 8). Currently, on-hand inventory is 27 units with 0 in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 0 and historical lead times have consistently been 0, a base stock level (mu_hat) calculated over this recent period (N=9) will effectively manage the current stock. Given the mean of ~10.2 and a review+lead period of 1 (1+L where L=0), the OR backend will target a base stock level. With 27 units on hand, the system will likely not order this period as on-hand exceeds the required base stock (approx 10-15 units including safety stock). This is appropriate to minimize holding costs while the low-demand regime persists.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399087021 has stabilized at an extremely low volume starting from Period 8 (2019-04-01). Over the last 10 periods (P8-P17), the average demand is 8.5 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 22 units, which is enough to cover approximately 2.5 periods of demand at this rate. Since the promised lead time is 0, the OR engine will determine if an order is necessary based on this low-mean regime. I will use a recent_N window of 10 to capture this stabilized low-demand period (P8-P17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as confirmed by historical arrival data, so the default lead time parameter is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (starting Period 8) remains persistent: over 10 periods (P8-P17), average demand is 8.5 units/week compared to the prior regime of ~64 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Super Skinny Low-rise Jeans) has entered a stable low-demand regime since Period 8 (2019-04-01). Over the last 11 periods (P8-P18), the weekly demand has averaged approximately 8 units (range 3-18). Current on-hand inventory is 19 units with no units in-transit. Given a lead time of 0 periods, the current stock covers approximately 2.375 weeks of demand in the current regime. To maintain service levels while minimizing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 samples (the entire duration of the low-demand regime). The OR backend will compute a base stock level (likely around 12-15 units); since current on-hand (19) exceeds this, no new order will be triggered, allowing excess inventory to deplete naturally. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods when orders were placed.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Super-Skinny Jeans) is in a multi-period low-demand regime that began around Period 8 (2019-04-01). Over the last 12 periods (P8-P19), demand has averaged approximately 7.9 units per week, with a notable downward drift in the most recent periods (P17-P19 saw demand of 5, 3, and 2 respectively). The promised lead time of 0 is consistently verified by history. On-hand inventory is currently 17 units, which is approximately double the average weekly demand of the current regime. Given this coverage and the declining trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 12 periods (recent_N=12) to capture this low-demand state while allowing the inventory to naturally bleed down. This will prevent the system from placing unnecessary orders while the current stock suffices for approximately two weeks.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (starting Period 8) remains persistent: over 12 periods (P8-P19), average demand is 7.9 units/week, with the most recent 3 periods (P17-P19) showing a further decline to an average of 3.3 units/week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this ladies' denim SKU has been in a sustained decline since early April (Period 8), dropping from approximately 64 units/week to 8 units/week. Recent data (Periods 17-20) shows a further decline, averaging only 2.5 units per week, with Period 20 recording 0 demand. Given the product type (jeans) and the current summer date (July 1st), it is likely that demand remains significantly suppressed due to seasonality. Current on-hand inventory is 18 units, which covers over 7 weeks of supply at the recent average demand of 2.5. Therefore, no new order is necessary. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 17-20), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the localized volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 17 (2019-06-03) confirmed: Average demand has dropped further to 2.5 units/week (Periods 17-20) from the previous low-demand regime of ~10 units/week.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Super Skinny Ladies Denim) is in a long-term low-demand phase. After an initial drop in Period 8, a second decline occurred around Period 17 (June). Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand has been extremely low: 5, 3, 2, 0, and 1, averaging 2.2 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 17 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 7.7 weeks of demand at the current rate (17 / 2.2). Since the promised lead time remains 0 and there is a significant holding cost ($1.0) compared to the potential margin ($19.0), keeping inventory lean is crucial to avoid erosion of profits. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this latest demand level of ~2.2 per week. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the low volatility of this regime. Lead time method remains default (0).

LLM Rationale:
The product '399087021' (Ladies Denim) is in a multi-stage demand decline, likely due to the summer seasonality for this specific style or the end of its life cycle. Demand has dropped from ~110 (P1-P2) to ~64 (P3-P7), then to ~10 (P8-P16), and most recently to ~2.5 (P17-P22). In the last three periods (P20-P22), demand was 0, 1, and 0 respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 17 units. With an average demand of less than 1 unit per week over the last month, the current stock is more than sufficient to cover at least 15-20 periods of demand at the current rate. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (P17-P22) to reflect the current extremely low demand regime (average 1.83, std 1.94). The OR backend will see that on-hand (17) is greater than the calculated base stock and will correctly place a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 17 (2019-06-03) remains stable at near-zero: Average demand across P17-P22 is 1.83 units/week.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Super Skinny Ladies Denim) is in a persistent very-low-demand regime that shifted further downwards around Period 17 (June 2019). Over the last 7 periods (P17-P23), demand has been extremely sparse, with weekly values of [5, 3, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1], averaging approximately 1.7 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 16 units, which at the current depletion rate, covers roughly 9-10 weeks of demand. Given the high holding cost relative to the near-zero demand and the currently high inventory level (on-hand is 16, while expected demand for the review+lead period (L=0) is ~1.7), the goal is to prevent any further ordering until the redundant inventory is cleared. I will set mu_hat to a recent average (N=7) and sigma_hat to reflect the low volatility, which will keep the base stock level well below the current 16 units on-hand, resulting in a zero order as desired. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 when orders were placed.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a specific type of ladies' skinny jeans. We are currently in late July (Period 25). The demand has experienced three major downward shifts: first in late February, second in early April, and the most recent in early June. Since Period 17 (2019-06-03), the demand has practically flatlined, with a total of only 13 units demanded over the last 8 periods, averaging ~1.6 units/week. Over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand was 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, averaging 0.6 units/week. On-hand inventory is 15 units, which provides over 25 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. There is no reason to order more at this time. I will use the recent_N method with N=8 to capture this lowest demand regime (starting P17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 17 (2019-06-03) is stable at ultra-low levels: average demand across P17-P24 is 1.63 units/week, with the most recent 5 weeks averaging 0.6 units/week.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Denim Trousers) continues to be in an ultra-low demand regime that began around Period 17 (June 2019). Over the last 9 periods (P17-P25), the total demand has been 14 units, averaging approximately 1.5 units per week. In the most recent 6 periods (P20-P25), demand has dropped even further, with 4 weeks showing 0 or 1 units, and total demand for these 6 weeks being only 4 units (average 0.67). We currently have 14 units on-hand, which at the current average demand rate of ~1 unit per week, provides over 3 months of coverage. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs a profit of $19.0, we want to avoid unnecessary inventory. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9) to reflect this persistent low-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0. No new orders are needed as current stock is sufficient for the immediate future.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 17 (2019-06-03) is stable at ultra-low levels: average demand across P17-P25 is 1.55 units/week, with the most recent 6 weeks (P20-P25) averaging 0.67 units/week.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26 (2019/08/05), we observed a significant demand spike of 44 units, which is the highest demand since Period 7 and far exceeds the 1.6 units/week average of the previous two months. This spike corresponds to early August, likely signaling the start of 'Back to School' shopping for this skinny denim product. The spike resulted in a stockout (sold 14, ending on-hand 0). Given the product category (denim) and the timing (August), this demand increase is expected to persist or grow through the month. I will transition from the ultra-low demand regime to an 'explicit' forecast that anticipates higher seasonal demand while acknowledging the stockout signal. Although recent history averaged < 2 units, I will set mu_hat based on a more aggressive forecast closer to the Period 26 observed demand to prevent further lost sales during this peak season. I will use a mu_hat reflected by the recent spike (~40 units/week). L remains 0 based on consistent immediate arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 (2019-08-05): Demand spiked to 44 units after 10+ weeks of <2 units/week, likely signaling seasonal 'Back to School' demand for denim trousers.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Ladies Denim Trousers'. Period 26 and 27 (August 5 and August 12) showed a massive demand jump (44 and 107 units respectively), confirming a 'Back to School' seasonal shift. In Period 27, demand (107) significantly exceeded supply (65), leading to a stockout. The average demand for the last two weeks is 75.5 units. Historically, early-year demand (P1-P4) was around 100-110 units. Given the stockout and the product's high profit margin ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), a stockout-avoidance strategy is essential. I will set mu_hat to 110 (anticipating sustained peak demand) and use a high sigma_hat based on the recent volatility of this spike.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: August demand (Periods 26-27) increased from <2 to 75.5 avg units/week (+3700%), matching 'Back to School' patterns for denim.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087021 (Ladies Denim Trousers) has clearly entered its 'Back to School' seasonal peak. Demand spiked from <2 units/week to an average of 85 units/week over the last three periods (P26: 44, P27: 107, P28: 104). Historical lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 81 units. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand phase (last period demand was 104, so 81 units is insufficient for the upcoming period), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus purely on the seasonal peak demand levels. Using N=3 captures the shift from the ultra-low regime to the current high-demand regime without being diluted by months of near-zero demand.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak for Ladies Denim confirmed: Mid-August demand increased from ~1.5 units/week to 85 units/week average (P26-P28), signifying a strong Back to School trend.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a strong seasonal peak for Ladies Denim (Back to School) starting at Period 26 (Aug 5). Demand spiked from near-zero to 44, 107, 104, and 71 in the last four periods. The most recent demand (71) suggests the peak may be plateauing or slightly softening, but volume remains significantly higher than the summer lows. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new regime (mean ~81.5), which is appropriate for the 'Back to School' window. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by recent arrivals. Setting lead time (L) to 0 (promised) and using the recent 4-period window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR engine to stock sufficiently for the current high-demand context while acknowledging the high volatility (std dev) typical of seasonal peaks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak of the 'Back to School' and Fall season for Ladies Denim. Demand has surged since Period 26 (August 5), with the last five periods recording demands of 44, 107, 104, 71, and 87. This yields an average of 82.6 units per week for this high-demand regime. Current on-hand inventory is 44 units, and lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level during this volatile peak and avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 26-27, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the current seasonal average (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent 80+ units/week demand levels rather than the ultra-low summer levels.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The seasonal peak for Ladies Denim (Back to School/Early Autumn) is currently in full swing. Since Period 26, weekly demand has consistently remained high: 44, 107, 104, 71, 87, and 100 units. The average demand over these 6 peak-season weeks is approximately 85.5 units. The current on-hand inventory is low at 26 units with no units in transit. Given the promised lead time of 0 periods (which has been consistent in all recent arrivals), I need to ensure the base stock covers at least the upcoming period's demand (85.5 units). Using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) will provide the OR backend with a forecast focused on this high-demand seasonal regime, allowing it to calculate a base stock that replenishes inventory sufficiently to meet the current high turnover while accounting for recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand seasonal regime confirmed (P26-P31): Demand for Ladies Denim has averaged 85.5 units/week over the last 6 periods, up from <2 units/week in the prior summer regime.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P26-P32), driven by 'Back to School' seasonality for Ladies Denim, remains stable with a high average demand of approximately 84 units/week (last 7 periods). While Period 32 demand was slightly lower at 73 units, the overall trend since August 5th (Period 26) shows significant and sustained volume compared to the summer lows. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this specific seasonal regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on historical arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 53 units, and with no units in transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to cover expected demand and a safety buffer for Period 33 based on these parameters.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087021' (Ladies Denim) is currently in a high-demand seasonal regime that began around Period 26 (August), correlating with Back to School and transition to Autumn. Over the last 8 periods (P26-P33), weekly demand has averaged 87.5 units, with the most recent performance (Period 33) reaching 114 units. On-hand inventory is very low at 8 units with no units in transit. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 8-period regime to ensure the base stock levels reflect the current high-demand state and prevent stockouts. Specifically, using N=8 for mu_hat captures the seasonal average of ~88 units, providing sufficient coverage for the upcoming period while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) seen in this peak period.

Carry-over insight: High-demand seasonal regime (P26-P33) remains stable: average demand is 87.5 units/week, with strong variability (Range: 44-114).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Ladies Denim Trousers) continues in its high-demand 'Back to School' and early autumn regime, which started around Period 26 (August). Over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), the average demand has been approximately 86 units per week, with significant volatility (weekly demand ranging from 44 to 114). The most recent period (P34) saw demand of 73 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by same-period arrivals in all recent orders. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture only the current seasonal regime statistics while ignoring the ultra-low summer sales data. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level capable of handling the current high-volume seasonal demand while accounting for its inherent volatility.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand seasonal regime (Autumn/Back-to-School) that began in Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand has averaged approximately 84 units per week, with a consistent range between 44 and 114. Most recently (Periods 32-35), demand has been 73, 114, 73, and 66 (average 81.5), indicating stability near the 80-85 mark. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture this seasonal regime (spanning Periods 26-35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will provide a robust basis for the OR backend's single-period base stock calculation while acknowledging the high volatility (sigma) observed during this peak season. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' based on consistent historical performance of 0-period arrivals.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087021 (Ladies Denim) is currently in a sustained high-demand seasonal regime that began in Period 26. Since the start of this regime (P26-P36), demand has averaged approximately 81.3 units per week, although there is considerable week-to-week volatility (ranging from 44 to 114). Most recently (P32-P36), the average has slightly moderated to 79.2 units. Given the transition into late October (Period 37), demand remains robust. I am setting mu_hat using the last 11 periods (N=11) to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime since the 'Back to School' spike. Sigma_hat is also set using N=11 to reflect the actual volatility seen during this period. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will maintain the base stock logic to cover the current period's demand while holding a buffer for the observed high variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: High-demand seasonal regime (P26-P36) remains sustained with an average of 81.3 units/week and high volatility (StdDev ~22 units), maintaining the 'Back to School'/Autumn trend.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Ladies Denim (399087021) has been in a sustained high-demand seasonal regime since Period 26. Recent demand from Period 32 to Period 37 has averaged 76 units per week (73, 114, 73, 66, 70, 62). While this is slightly lower than the initial Back-to-School peak (P26-P31 average ~85), it remains stable and significantly higher than the summer low. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'order-up-to' behavior within the same period. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized Autumn demand regime while maintaining enough of the recent volatility (range 62-114). On-hand inventory is 56, and with expected demand around 70-80, an order will be triggered to maintain safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Stabilized high-demand Autumn regime (P32-P37): demand has moderated to an average of ~76 units/week compared to the initial peak of ~85 units/week (P26-P31), but remains consistent.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ladies Denim' remains in its Autumn/stabilized high-demand regime, which started around Period 26. Since Period 32 (seven weeks ago), the demand has averaged approximately 74.3 units per week (73, 114, 73, 66, 70, 62, 62), showing lower volatility than the initial 'Back to School' spike but maintaining a consistent volume. The current date (Nov 4) suggests we are past the initial peak but still in a period where trousers/denim are seasonally relevant. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stability of the last 7 weeks. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P32-P38) stabilized: mean demand ~74 units/week, down from the peak P26-P31 average of ~85 units/week.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Ladies Denim has entered a more moderate phase within the Autumn regime. Over the most recent 8 periods (P32-P39), the average demand is 71.1 units/week, which is a decline from the initial seasonal peak of ~85 units/week seen in P26-P31. The most recent demand (P39) was 48 units, the lowest in this regime since the initial spike, suggesting a potential cooling trend as we move further into November. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this moderated mean (~71 units) and its associated volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 57 units. With a promised lead time of 0 (consistently realized in history), setting mu_hat based on the last 8 weeks will provide a base stock target that accounts for the current 70+ unit trend while allowing for the recent fluctuation. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same window to capture the regime's variance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P32-P39) has moderated to an average of 71.1 units/week, down from the early-autumn peak of 85.5 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ladies Denim 5-pocket jeans' has entered a cooling phase following the peak 'Back to School'/Autumn season. Since Period 32 (mid-September), we've seen a gradual decline from early peak averages of ~85 to a more recent average of ~51 units/week over the last 3 periods (P38-P40), with Period 40 marking a low of 32 units. This deceleration is consistent with seasonal cycles for denim before potential winter clearance or holiday shifts. I am reducing mu_hat by using a recent_N of 5 to capture the moderating trend (averaging ~53 units/week) instead of the higher full-season average. Lead time remains stable at 0. Reducing the base stock target reflects the decrease in both mean demand and observed volatility as the season matures, helping to minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the remaining inventory on hand (71 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed starting Period 38 (2019-10-28): 3-period average (P38-P40) is 47.3 units/week, down from the P32-P37 average of 76 units (-38%).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ladies Denim' SKU 399087021 has entered a clear deceleration phase as we move past the peak autumn season into late November. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P38-P41) is 45.25 units, which is significantly lower than the P32-P37 average of 76 units. The most recent demand (P41) was 39 units. Given the carry-over insight of a confirmed regime shift at Period 38, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this lower mean for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current moderated volatility (StdDev ~13). This allows the OR backend to set a base-stock level that avoids overstocking during this downward trend, while maintaining a sufficient service level for the remaining seasonal volume. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1273.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (2019/11/25), demand spiked significantly to 119 units, exhausting all 67 units of on-hand inventory and resulting in lost sales. This spike aligns with the 'Black Friday' retail event (late November), which frequently overrides typical seasonal deceleration for denim. Historical data shows that while demand was moderating (P38-P41 average ~45), this event represents a significant outlier that must be addressed to prevent stockouts in the immediate post-Black Friday / Holiday transition period. I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N=5 (P38-P42) to capture this recent spike while acknowledging the prior moderation, resulting in a mean of ~60 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the heightened volatility (range 32 to 119). Lead time remains 0 as confirmed by the P42 order arrival. Since on-hand is currently 0 and there is nothing in transit, the OR backend will trigger a substantial replenishment order to meet the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike to 119 units in Period 42 confirmed as a significant event (Black Friday), interrupting the previous deceleration trend. New regime mean (P38-P42) is ~60 units/week with high volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (2019-12-09). The previous period (P42) saw a major demand spike (119 units) due to Black Friday, which caused a stockout. Period 43 demand dropped significantly to 24 units, suggesting a post-Black Friday slump. Historically, after the 'Black Friday' spike in late November, demand for Ladies Denim usually settles into a lower December regime as the 'Back to School/Autumn' cycle concludes. The most recent demand (P43: 24 units) and the general deceleration seen in P40-P41 (32 and 39 units) suggest a mean demand shift. I will use a 6-period window (P38-P43) which captures the transition from peak autumn, the Black Friday spike, and the subsequent drop, to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This provides a balanced estimate that acknowledges recent volatility (\u03c3\u0302) while grounding the mean (\u03bc\u0302) in the current downward trend. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand regime (starting P43): Demand dropped to 24 units/week following the 119-unit spike, aligning with a seasonal deceleration after the Autumn/Peak season.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late December period (Period 45), following a Black Friday spike (P42) and a subsequent drop. Historical demand analysis shows a deceleration trend: the last two periods (P43-P44) averaged 30.5 units, which is a significant drop from the peak autumn levels (~80 units) but higher than the mid-spring/summer lows (<2 units). The product, Ladies Super Skinny Jeans, is a staple but demand usually softens after the major autumn/early winter shopping peaks. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (Periods 42, 43, 44) to capture the blend of the holiday spike and the immediate post-spike correction, while maintaining a moderate safety stock via sigma_hat (recent_N=3) to handle late holiday shopping volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand deceleration: Period 43-44 demand average is 30.5 units/week, confirming a transition away from the high-demand Autumn regime (~71-85 units).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. We are in a post-Black Friday seasonal deceleration period for Ladies Denim. Period 42 was the Black Friday peak (119 demand), but the subsequent three periods (P43-P45) have shown much lower demand: 24, 37, and 36 units (averaging 32.3 units/week). This confirms the demand regime shift flagged in the carry-over insights. With 109 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, our current inventory covers over three weeks of the current demand average. Given the promised lead time 'L' is 0 (confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in history), the OR backend will calculate a base stock based on \u03bc\u0302 (mean demand over review+lead period). To capture this stabilized lower demand regime and prevent overstocking during the winter lull, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the P43-P45 behavior. I will also use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the October/November peaks. The lead time L is set to 'default' as shipments have consistently arrived in the same period.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand stabilization: Demand for Periods 43-45 has averaged 32.3 units/week, representing a significant drop from the Autumn peak (~71-85 units).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the final week of the year and following the Christmas/Winter holiday peak. Historical data for the 'Post-Black Friday' regime (Periods 43-46) shows demand has stabilized at a lower level, with weekly figures of 24, 37, 36, and 23 (average ~30 units/week). This represents a significant deceleration from the Autumn 'Back to School' peak. Starting Period 43, the mean and volatility have both decreased. Since on-hand inventory is currently 86 units, and the expected weekly demand is around 30, we have nearly 3 weeks of stock on hand for a lead time of 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new stabilized post-peak regime and avoid over-ordering during the January demand lull, which is common in retail for denim after the holidays.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Demand for Periods 43-46 (Dec 2019) has stabilized at an average of 30.0 units/week, marking a clear transition to a lower-demand winter regime compared to the Autumn peak.
