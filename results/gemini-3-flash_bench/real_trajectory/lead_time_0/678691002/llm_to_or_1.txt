Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a sports bra providing extra firm support. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) show: 81, 48, 71, 68, 74. The mean is 68.4 and standard deviation is ~12.5. Since it's Period 1, we have no observed lead time data, so I will rely on the promised lead time (L=0). Lead time 0 means orders placed now arrive in the same period to satisfy demand. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the critical fractile is 0.95, justifying a relatively high service level. Given the steady demand pattern around 70 units and being the start of the exercise, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean and variance for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2 (2019-02-18), we are managing a high-support sports bra. History shows an initial demand sample of 56 in Period 1, following historical samples in January and February ranging from 48 to 81 (mean ~68). The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time=0 confirmed). Current on-hand is 33. The average demand across all 6 samples (5 historical + P1) is (81+48+71+68+74+56)/6 = 66.3. Since lead time is 0, the backend requires parameters for (1+L) = 1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the broader average including the most recent observation, as demand appears stable with a slight downward trend in the last sample.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Carina High Support Bra) has shown steady demand over the last 7 weeks. Historical samples (including pre-game) are: 81, 48, 71, 68, 74, 56, and 60. The mean of all 7 samples is approximately 65.4 units/week. Looking at the last 3 weeks (74, 56, 60), the mean is 63.3. There is no significant seasonal shift detected for late February in this category based on current data. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 27 units, and no shipments are in transit. I will use the mean of all historical samples to forecast demand (mu_hat) and calculate the associated volatility (sigma_hat) to maintain a high service level, as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high (19:1).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a high-support sports bra, and we have 5 historical demand samples (81, 48, 71, 68, 74) plus 3 realized game periods (56, 60, 54). The mean demand across all 8 samples is approximately 64 units per week. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 31 units on-hand with nothing in transit. Given the stability of the demand (mean ~64, std ~11) and the immediate delivery (L=0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and sigma to capture the current stable regime. This will target a base stock level that covers the 1-week cycle (Period 4's sales) with a safe buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1223.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a high-support sports bra (CARINA HIGH SUPPORT BRA), which typically shows stable demand. The current date is March 11, 2019. Observed demand over the last 4 periods (56, 60, 54, 65) averages 58.75 units, which aligns well with the pre-game samples (81, 48, 71, 68, 74, avg: 68.4). There is no significant seasonal spike detected yet in March. On-hand inventory is low (12 units) because the Period 4 order just covered Period 4 demand. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use the promised lead time (0) and calculate demand parameters based on recent performance to maintain a high service level while managing holding costs. Using N=4 for mu_hat captures the immediate post-February demand trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $973.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a high-support sports bra. Historical demand over the last 10 periods (including the pre-game samples) has been stable. Pre-game mean: 68.4 (n=5). Game history mean: 57.4 (n=5). Combined mean: 62.9. The promised lead time is 0, and all five game orders have arrived with an actual lead time of 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (15 units) with no in-transit stock. Since the demand is relatively stable across the 10-week horizon with no obvious seasonal shift between February and March, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on all available data points (5 samples + 5 game periods) to smooth out short-term fluctuations and maintain the service level while reflecting actual lead time consistency.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. Historically, for this SKU (Carina High Support Bra), demand has been relatively stable with a slight upward trend in recent weeks (Period 4: 65, Period 6: 70). The average demand over the last 6 weeks is approximately 59.5, but the last 3 weeks average 62.3. As we process through March into April, sports apparel often sees a sustained interest due to spring fitness trends. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Ending on-hand inventory is currently low (11 units). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the slightly elevated recent demand while smoothing out noise, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock against the recent volatility (range 52-70). The OR backend uses a service level based on the profit/holding ratio (approx 95%), which is appropriate here.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Carina High Support Bra) is in Period 8. Historical demand samples (including P1-P7) show a relatively stable mean around 62 units (samples: 81, 48, 71, 68, 74, 56, 60, 54, 65, 52, 70, 63). There are no major seasonal spikes detected yet for early April (Spring start). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=7 to capture the most recent mean (~60 units) and volatility. Setting L to default (0) as all orders have arrived within the same period. The current on-hand inventory is 10, and no units are in-transit, which matches the end-of-period state from P7.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (High Support Bra) is experiencing a stockout as of Period 8 conclude, with 10 units of lost demand (demand 81 vs sold 71). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 4, demand has shown an upward trend (65, 52, 70, 63, 81), with the most recent demand of 81 being significantly higher than the initial average. The current on-hand inventory is 0. To recover from the stockout and meet the increasing demand, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the higher demand regime observed over the last 5 periods (average ~66.2 vs historical ~68.2 including high early Jan data). I will use explicit sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility (std of last 5 periods is ~10.8). Setting L=0 as confirmed by all history.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/15. The product is a sports bra. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 64 units per week, with a notable peak of 81 in Period 8 followed by a significant drop to 35 in Period 9. The lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since Period 9's demand was an outlier (the lowest observed in history, likely post-peak or randomized fluctuation), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture recent trends (averaging 65, 52, 70, 63, 81, and 35, though the backend will weigh the most recent 5) while using a broader N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last two periods. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for the 'CARINA HIGH SUPPORT BRA' showed a significant spike around late March/early April (reaching 81 units), which likely corresponds to a spring fitness or seasonal sales period. However, the last two periods (April 8th and 15th) have seen a sharp decline to 35 and 34 units respectively, suggesting a post-peak stabilization or shift. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 56 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To respond to the recent drop in demand while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility, I will use a recent_N window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the spike and the subsequent drop (81, 35, 34 + the predicted demand) to transition the forecast down without overreacting to just one or two data points. Lead time remains set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting April 8th: Average demand dropped from ~65 to ~35 units following a late-March peak.

Historical demand for the 'CARINA HIGH SUPPORT BRA' showed a consistent range of 52-81 units during February and March, but shifted to a significantly lower regime in April (demand of 35, 34, 32 in the last three periods). This drop likely follows the peak seasonal demand for sports gear during early spring. Lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as arrivals match the order period. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new lower-demand regime (averaging ~33.7 units/period) while ignoring the higher March data. We have 59 units on-hand, and with demand hovering around 34, the OR backend's base-stock logic will likely trigger a small order or no order to prevent unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.95).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear shift starting in period 9 (April 8th). Before this, demand averaged ~63 units (Periods 1-8). Since Period 9, demand has significantly dropped, averaging ~38 units (Periods 9-12). This decline followed a late March seasonal peak. The most recent demand (Period 12) was 51, which is higher than the previous three weeks but still below the earlier high-season average. Given current on-hand inventory is low (8 units) and the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set parameters based on the new demand regime (last 4 periods, N=4) to avoid overstocking while adjusting for the recent slight uptick in demand. The OR backend needs to maintain a service level appropriate for high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (High Support Sports Bra) exhibits a seasonal pattern. After a peak in demand during March (avg ~65 units), demand dropped significantly in April (avg ~35 units). However, the last two periods (Period 12 and 13) show an uptick in demand back towards the high 40s (51 and 47 units respectively), possibly indicating a stabilization at a level higher than the April low but lower than the March peak. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this recent stabilization while remaining responsive to the shift from the April lows, I will set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (covering Periods 9-13: 35, 34, 32, 51, 47). This gives a more accurate current average of ~40 units rather than the very low April average or the over-influenced total history. Sigma_hat is set to the same N to capture recent volatility. Parameters focus on maintaining availability for this stabilized demand level while avoiding overstocking in case the recent uptick is temporary.

Carry-over insight: Demand shifted from a late-March peak (~65) to an April low (~35), and has recently stabilized/recovered slightly to ~45-50 units in early May.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a high-support sports bra, which typically sees consistent demand with minor fluctuations based on fitness trends. Historical data and recent game history show three distinct phases: a steady start around 60 units (Feb-Mar), a peak of 81 in early April, a slump to ~34 (mid-April), and a recent stabilization/recovery to ~45 (May). The last three periods (P12-P14) show demands of 51, 47, and 36, averaging 44.6 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. I will use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent stabilized demand level (approx 45) while accounting for the slight dip in P14. This balanced approach protects against stockouts as seen in P8 while minimizing excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a new regime of approximately 45 units per week (avg of P12-P14) following the April volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is May 27, 2019 (Period 16). The SKU is a high-support sports bra. Historically, we saw a demand peak in late March (Period 8, demand=81), followed by a drop in April (avg ~34), and a recovery in May. Period 15 saw a significant demand spike to 66 units, which exhausted my on-hand inventory. Looking at the last 4 weeks (P12-P15), demand has been 51, 47, 36, and 66, averaging 50. This confirms a recovery from the April lows. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, I need to ensure a robust 'base stock' to cover this week's demand. I will use the recent 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the higher volatility and mean observed since early May. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovered in May: Mean increased from ~34 (April) to ~50 (May). Period 15 spike (66 units) suggests high seasonal volatility for high-support sports bras as summer approaches.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3rd, 2019. The SKU is a 'Carina High Support Bra' (Sportswear). Historical demand shows a seasonal regime shift: April demand was low (avg ~34), while May demand spiked and became more volatile (avg ~48, with a peak of 66). Period 16 demand was lower at 37, but given the summer season and the high support product type, demand is expected to remain in the higher regime of 45-55 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across the entire history. Currently, on-hand inventory is 34 units with none in-transit. To capture the recent May regime shift and prepare for summer demand, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (P13-P16 mean is 46.5) and using the recent_N method for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in late May. L remains at the default promised 0.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10th. The product is a high-support sports bra, which typically sees sustained demand during late spring and early summer due to increased outdoor activity. Looking at the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has averaged 45.2 units (47, 36, 66, 37, 40). While Period 15 showed a peak of 66, the following two periods have stabilized around 37-40 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts during occasional summer spikes against the holding cost, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current post-April recovery level. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the heightened volatility observed in the May/June transition.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19 (June 17), we observe the SKU 678691002 (Carina High Support Bra). Historically, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Demand entered a new regime in mid-May (Period 15 onwards), characterized by an average demand of approximately 45 units (Mean of P15-P18: (66+37+40+40)/4 = 45.75). The last two periods (P17, P18) have shown stable demand at exactly 40 units. As we are in mid-June with summer approaching, high-support sports bras typically see steady to slightly fluctuating demand. Given current on-hand inventory of 26 units and a target mean (mu_hat) around 45, the system needs to maintain stock levels to avoid the stockouts seen in Period 15. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current stable May/June regime (P15-P18) for demand mean and volatility, while keeping the lead time at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in June at approximately 40-45 units (Avg P15-P18: 45.75). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24). The current demand context shows a stable regime in June, primarily ranging between 40-55 units. Recent demand samples are P15: 66, P16: 37, P17: 40, P18: 40, P19: 55. The average of the last 5 periods (N=5) is 47.6 units. Lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. Product: CARINA HIGH SUPPORT BRA. June demand is slightly higher than May as summer fitness activities likely peak. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current June stability while remaining sensitive to the variance (std dev ~12). With a 0-period lead time, the OR backend aims for a base stock covering the current period's demand (1+L = 1 period). High profitability ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) justifies a high service level (approx. 95%).

Carry-over insight: June demand regime stabilized at approximately 48 units/week (Avg P15-P19: 47.6), showing higher volatility (range 37-66) compared to the stable April/May period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st, 2019. The product is a high-support sports bra, and we are entering the peak summer season. Historically, demand has remained relatively stable in the June period, with an average demand of approximately 48 units (P16-P20 mean: (37+40+40+55+51)/5 = 44.6; however, July often sees a slight uptick or sustained demand due to summer fitness activity). Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 18, in-transit 0). To avoid stockouts while entering July, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the stabilize demand around 45-50 units. sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect recent volatility. L remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: July demand entry: June mean demand stabilized at 44.6 units per week (P16-P20).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is a high-support sports bra, which typically sees sustained demand during the summer fitness season. Recent demand (P16-P21) has shown a mean of 41.3 units (37, 40, 40, 55, 51, 25), though the most recent period (P21) saw a sharp drop to 25. Given the July date, this drop may be a single-period fluctuation rather than a regime shift, as fitness apparel demand usually remains steady through mid-summer. However, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the stabilization observed since late May (Period 16 onwards), which averages out the recent peak in Period 19/20 and the trough in Period 21. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the imminent period's demand, balancing the high profit ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1) to target a high service level.

Carry-over insight: July demand observation: Period 21 showed a significant drop to 25 units, deviating from the June average of ~48; will monitor if this initiates a mid-summer downtrend or is a one-off outlier.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. Period 21 (July 1st) showed a sharp drop in demand (25 units), but Period 22 (July 8th) showed a partial recovery to 38 units. This suggests the drop in P21 might be a localized fluctuation rather than a permanent crash, though demand is clearly lower than the June average (~48 units). For Period 23, I am adopting a more cautious forecast to align with the July slowdown seen thus far (Avg P21-P22 is 31.5). I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 (covering roughly the last month) to capture this downward trend while weighting the most recent data. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 21, and there is no pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: July demand trend: Early July (P21-P22) indicates a downward shift compared to June, with an average of ~32 units/week versus ~48 units/week in June.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for the Carina High Support Bra has shown late-July volatility. While Period 21 was low (25 units), Periods 22 and 23 bounced back to 38 and 48 units respectively, averaging 37 units for the month of July so far. This suggests the down-trend mentioned in the carry-over insights was likely less severe than initially feared, or there is significant mid-summer volatility. I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current July behavior (Mean: 37, Std Dev: 11.5) while remaining responsive to the recent rebound in Period 23. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime (P21-P23) characterized by increased volatility (range 25-48) and an average of 37 units/week, down from the June average of ~48.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in a summer demand regime for high-support sports bras. Analysis of July (Periods 21-24) shows demand values of 25, 38, 48, and 24, resulting in a mean of 33.75 units per week. This is a noticeable drop from the June average of ~48 units, suggesting a late-summer slowdown. Despite this lower mean, volatility remains present (range 24-48). Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (order arrives same period). Since Profit ($19) is significantly higher than Holding Cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current July demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which prevents over-stocking based on the higher June averages while providing enough safety stock to cover potential spikes back toward the 40s.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime (P21-P24) confirmed a downshift to an average of ~34 units/week (range 24-48), ending the higher June demand period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. Historical demand for this SKU (Carina High Support Bra) shows a clear shift in July. While June demand averaged ~47.6 units, July (P21-P25) saw a downshift to an average of 32.8 units (25, 38, 48, 24, 29). The product is a sports bra, and we are entering the tail end of summer, which might explain the cooling demand compared to the May/June peak. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. To account for this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5), covering the entire July downshift. This helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering based on the higher spring/early summer averages.

Carry-over insight: August entry: July demand regime (P21-P25) confirmed a downshift to an average of 32.8 units/week, down from the June average of ~48 units/week.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 12th. Demand for this high-support sports bra has shown a distinct downshift in mid-to-late summer. The July-August period (P21-P26) shows a mean demand of 33.0 units (samples: 25, 38, 48, 24, 29, 34), which is significantly lower than the June mean of ~48 units. This reflects lower activity-based demand as the peak summer season progresses or perhaps a transition in sport-related shopping patterns. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this lower July-August regime. With the target service level (q) being 0.95 (Profit 19 / [19+1]), the backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the end-of-summer demand while minimizing holding costs on the 16 units currently on hand.

Carry-over insight: August entry: July-August demand regime (P21-P26) confirmed a downshift to an average of 33 units/week, significantly lower than the June average of 48 units/week.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 observation shows a demand spike to 57 units in P27, which is a significant deviation from the July-August downshift average of ~33 units. This spike coincides with mid-August, potentially representing a 'back-to-school' or late-summer fitness interest increase for sports bras. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we stocked out in P27. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will adjust the mu_hat to capture this recent increase by using recent_N (N=7), covering the July-August regime including the recent spike. This N=7 captures the volatility while acknowledging the upward trend (Avg P21-P27 \u2248 36.4). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=7) to account for the increased variance seen in the recent 57-unit demand compared to the 24-34 range previously observed in July/August.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Mid-August demand spike observed (57 units), breaking the July-August low-demand regime (avg ~33). Potential seasonal recovery or back-to-school effect.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 29 (2019/08/26). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The demand pattern has shown significant volatility recently: July (P21-P25) averaged ~32.8 units/week, while August showed a sharp spike in P27 (57 units) followed by a sharp drop in P28 (27 units). This suggests the market is in a transition phase, potentially driven by the end of summer or back-to-school season for sports bras. Looking at the last 8 periods (P21-P28) covering July and August, the average demand is 35.25. Given the high volatility (range 24-57), using a recent window that captures both the July low and the August spike is prudent. I will use N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to encompass this entire late-summer period while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock for the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand showing high volatility: P27 spike (57) followed by P28 drop (27). July-August average stabilized at ~35 units/week.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. The SKU is a high-support sports bra. Demand in July and August (P21-P29) has been characterized by a lower mean and higher volatility compared to June, averaging approximately 34.8 units/week with significant fluctuations (range 24-57). Period 27 saw a spike to 57 units, followed by lower demands of 27 and 31 in P28 and P29. As we enter September, we may see a 'back-to-school' or 'post-summer' recovery in fitness-related products, but the immediate evidence suggests stability around the ~35 unit mark. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the July-August regime) for mean and volatility to capture this current state while remaining sensitive to the recent high-demand outlier (P27). Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: September entry: July-August demand regime (P21-P29) stabilized at an average of 34.8 units/week with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 11.5). No clear seasonal surge observed yet for early September.

Period 30 data (demand=41) aligns with this regime's upper range. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by 30 consecutive periods of same-period arrival. To manage the upcoming mid-September period, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized July-September behavior while remaining sensitive to recent volatility (Range 24-57). The OR backend will use these parameters to determine a base stock that covers the current period's demand (L+1=1) with a high service level due to the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Carina High Support Bra) is currently in a mid-September period. Analysis of the recent July-August-September demand (P21 to P31) shows a stabilized but volatile regime. The average demand across these 11 periods is approximately 34.7 units, with a standard deviation around 10.6. Recent weeks (P28-P31) have shown demand values of 27, 31, 41, and 27. There is no sustained seasonal surge yet, although a brief spike was noted in mid-August (P27). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To balance meeting demand while minimizing holding costs for this sports bra, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=11 covers the current stabilized regime since the July downshift, accurately capturing both the lower mean and the observed volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 23, 2019. The latest demand observations (P31: 27, P32: 16) indicate a potential downward shift or high volatility as we move deeper into September. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P28-P32) is approximately 28.4 units, which is a decline from the July-August regime average of ~35 units. The Period 32 demand of 16 is particularly low, warranting a closer look at recent trends. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-inventorying during this slowdown, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to capture the most recent trend while maintaining enough safety stock via sigma_hat to handle the product's inherent volatility (std dev of P28-P32 is approx 9.5).

Carry-over insight: September demand shift: Early to mid-September (P30-P32) shows a decline in demand (avg ~28) compared to the July-August regime (avg ~35), with P32 recording a sharp drop to 16 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Sept 30, 2019. Period 33 concluding data shows a significant demand surge to 54 units, which completely depleted the 44 units of starting on-hand inventory, resulting in 10 lost sales. This spike follows a period of very low demand (P32: 16 units) and contradicts the recent downward trend noted in the carry-over insights (P30-P32 avg was ~28). This suggests that the 'September shift' was either a temporary dip or has ended, possibly due to a late-September fitness surge or promotion for sports bras. Given the stockout and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), I must adjust mu_hat upward to prevent further lost sales. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the recent volatility (27, 16, 54 plus the previous 41) which averages to 34.5, but apply a slightly more aggressive explicit estimate to account for the stockout signal and the potential return to the June/July mean of ~45. I'll set L to 'calculate' as lead time has consistently been 0, and use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the high recent variance.

Carry-over insight: September demand volatility: Early Sept dip (avg ~28) ended with a sharp spike to 54 units in P33, resulting in a stockout. High volatility regime continues.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra) is currently in Period 35 (early October). Reviewing historical demand, we are in a high-volatility regime that began in late August/early September. Recent demand points are P30: 41, P31: 27, P32: 16, P33: 54 (spike), and P34: 30. The mean of these last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 33.6 units, which aligns closely with the July-August average of ~34.8. High support sports bras often see demand fluctuations around fitness cycle shifts (e.g., back-to-school or New Year, though we are currently in the mid-autumn lull). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent demand window of N=5 to capture the current volatility and mean while ensuring we have enough stock to handle the sporadic spikes (like the 54 units in P33) without over-investing in holding costs, especially since on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 40 units.

Carry-over insight: September-October demand regime remains highly volatile (range 16-54) with a mean of approximately 34 units/week (Avg P30-P34).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra) continues to exhibit significant demand volatility as it transitions into October. Following a sharp spike to 54 units in P33 and a subsequent stocked-out condition, demand has retracted sharply to 30 units (P34) and 12 units (P35). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P26-P35) is approximately 34.2 units, which aligns with the July-August regime despite the recent volatility. Given the most recent low demand (12 units) following a period of high inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 (P30-P35) to capture the current September-October volatility (avg ~30, range 12-54). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. This approach balances the risk of another sudden spike while accounting for the lower mean observed in the last two weeks.

Carry-over insight: October entry (P34-P35): Demand volatility remains high but mean has softened following the late September spike; average of the last two periods is 21 units compared to the September average of ~34.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Period 37 (Oct 21). The product is a sports bra. Demand in the last three periods (P34-P36) has been significantly lower (30, 12, 19; avg ~20.3) compared to the September average of ~34 units. This indicates a potential seasonal downshift as we move deeper into autumn. On-hand inventory is 37, which currently covers nearly two weeks of recent demand at the current average. Lead time is consistently 0. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent local demand trend (avg P33-P36: 28.75), which balances the late September spike with the October lull. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to account for the high volatility seen throughout September and October (range 12-54).

Carry-over insight: October demand downshift: Demand in October (P35-P36) averaged ~15.5 units, significantly lower than the September average of ~34 and early October (P34) 30 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the high-support sports bra has entered a significant low-demand regime in October. Over the last three periods (P35-P37), demand has stabilized at an average of 16.0 units (12, 19, 17), which is a sharp decrease from the September average of ~34 and the peak volatility seen earlier in the year. This likely reflects a seasonal drop as the weather cools and outdoor high-impact training decreases. On-hand inventory is currently 40 units, which is 2.5 times the current weekly mean, signaling a need to reduce orders to avoid excessive holding costs. The lead time remains consistent at 0. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current low-demand environment (approx 16 units mean, 3.6 std).

Carry-over insight: October demand regime shift confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower mean of ~16 units/week (P35-P37) compared to the September average of ~34 units/week, suggesting a seasonal slowdown in high-support bra purchases.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the high-support sports bra has shown a significant regime shift. After a volatile September (avg ~34), October (P35-P37) saw a stabilized low mean of ~16 units. However, Period 38 (Oct 28) shows a sudden jump to 34 units, potentially signaling the start of a pre-holiday or early November trend shift. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will adjust the mu_hat using recent_N=4 (P35-P38) which averages to 20.5, capturing both the low October baseline and the recent spike. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=8 to account for the high volatility observed across both the late-September peak and the current October/November transition. This approach provides enough buffer to handle potential further recovery while avoiding excessive overstocking on a low-demand base.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand spike (34 units) in P38 breaks the three-week October low-demand regime (avg ~16), suggesting a possible early November recovery or seasonal fluctuation.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Nov 11, 2019. The 'high-support bra' SKU has entered a regime of increased volatility in November after an October slump. Demand in P38 (34 units) and P39 (25 units) suggests a recovery compared to the October average of ~16 units. The product description (high support, fast-drying) is less seasonally tied to deep winter than standard fashion items, but may see fluctuations around indoor sports seasons. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent demand stabilization at a higher level than October, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (Avg P35-P39: ~21.4) and sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility (range 12-34). This balances the need to hold enough stock for potential demand surges while avoiding excessive holding costs if the trend softens again.

Carry-over insight: November Demand Shift: Demand in early November (P38-P39) has increased to an average of 29.5 units, up from the October average of ~16 units, suggesting a seasonal recovery.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the high-support sports bra is currently in a November recovery phase. After a significant low in October (average ~16 units), the last three periods (P38-P40) have shown a clear uptick with demand values of 34, 25, and 26, averaging 28.3 units/week. This suggests a seasonal shift as we move into the holiday/pre-New Year fitness season. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this specific November mean (28.3 units) and volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0. Setting mu_hat to reflect this new mean will ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to handle the increased traffic while minimizing stockout risk as observed in P33 and P38 when inventory was too low.

Carry-over insight: November Demand Shift: Demand from P38-P40 has stabilized at an average of 28.3 units/week, marking a sustained recovery from the October average of ~16 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the high-support sports bra (678691002) has recovered in November after a significant October slump. Demand values for the last four periods are 34, 25, 26, and 30, resulting in a stable November average (P38-P41) of approximately 28.75 units per week. This aligns with the carry-over insight of a sustained recovery from the October average of ~16. Given the date (Nov 25, 2019), we are approaching the holiday season where athletic wear often sees steady demand. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and capture this recovered demand without overstocking as we approach the end of the year (Period 47), I will use a recent_N method with N=4 to anchor the forecast to the current November regime (approx 29 units) and its associated volatility. This balances meeting the ~30 unit demand while managing the 7 units currently on-hand.

Carry-over insight: November demand stabilization: Mean demand for P38-P41 is 28.75 units (range 25-34), confirming a full recovery from the October low-regime of ~16 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), a massive demand spike of 123 units occurred, which is more than 4x the recent average (~29 units) and significantly higher than the previous historical peak (81 units). This aligns with the start of the holiday shopping season (Black Friday week). This surge resulted in a stockout (sold 36, ending on-hand 0). With the next period being early December, elevated demand is expected to continue through the holiday season. The actual lead time remains 0. To prevent further stockouts and capture the seasonal peak, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 130 to cover the potential for another high-demand week, and increase sigma_hat to 40 to account for high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Season demand spike confirmed Period 42: Demand surged to 123 units, deviating significantly from the Nov average of ~29 units. Expect sustained high demand and volatility through December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 follows the massive demand spike in Period 42 (123 units) and a subsequent drop in Period 43 (22 units). The spike was likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales given the late November timing. Historically, demand for sports apparel often exhibits high volatility during the December holiday season. While Period 43 was low (22 units), Period 42 suggests that stockouts are a major risk. We are currently holding 174 units on-hand. Given the product's high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level (approx 95th percentile). I will use the recent_N method (N=6) to capture the pre-holiday baseline and the spike (P38-P43: 34, 25, 26, 30, 123, 22), providing a mean of ~43 units and capturing the high volatility (sigma) caused by the holiday surge. This ensures the base stock remains high enough to cover potential pre-Christmas peaks without over-ordering excessively, given the 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Holiday volatility confirmed; P42 spike (123 units) followed by P43 drop (22 units) indicates extreme demand variance in December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final weeks of the year (mid-December). Historical data shows extreme volatility in December: Period 42 saw a massive spike (123 units) likely related to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, followed by a sharp drop to 22 units in Period 43 and 9 units in Period 44. The SKU (Carina High Support Bra) is a staple item, but holiday demand patterns are unpredictable. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (165 units) due to the large defensive order placed in Period 44. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 45 of 47) and demand has cooled significantly in the last two weeks, I will set parameters to work through the current stock while remaining prepared for one final holiday pulse. Using an explicit mu_hat based on the average of the last 3 periods (~51 units) covers the recent mean while accounting for the Period 42 spike, but the backend's capped policy will likely result in a zero order given the 165 units on hand. This is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (late Nov/Dec): Observed extreme volatility with a peak of 123 (P42) followed by a low of 9 (P44). High variance indicates unstable demand during peak retail season.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Carina High Support Bra) is in the middle of a high-volatility holiday demand regime. Period 45 recorded a massive demand spike of 211 units, leading to a stockout (on-hand is 0). This follows a previous spike of 123 (P42) and subsequent low of 9 (P44). Given the date (Dec 23rd), we are at the peak of the holiday shopping season. The current on-hand and pipeline are both zero, so a significant order is required. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new high-demand, high-volatility regime (P42-P45). This period (Dec 23-30) usually sees strong post-Christmas sales and 'New Year, New Me' fitness-related push for sports bras. Lead time is consistently 0. I will maintain a high base stock to avoid another stockout during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (Dec) confirmed extreme volatility with spikes of 123 (P42) and 211 (P45). Observed mean demand for this period is ~91 units/week (Avg P42-P45).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3452.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 30th, the end of the peak holiday retail season. Historical demand for this SKU (High Support Sports Bra) has shown extreme volatility in December, with massive spikes in P42 (123), P45 (211), and P46 (185) interspersed with low periods. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is 110 units. Given that we are at the very end of December, demand may start to normalize in January as the immediate holiday surge fades, but 'New Year, New Me' fitness resolutions often drive a secondary surge in sports apparel. Therefore, I will maintain a high mu_hat based on recent high-demand observations to ensure we capture any residual holiday or early January fitness demand. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the holiday regime shift (avg ~110), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the extreme holiday variance (std ~87).

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand regime (P42-P46) exhibited extreme volatility and a significantly higher mean of 110.0 units/week (range 9-211) compared to the November average of ~29 units.
