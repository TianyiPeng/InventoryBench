Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a basic/staple item (high-waisted superstretch skinny jeans) in the 'Divided' collection. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 1, 6, 7, 3, 15. There is a visible upward trend concluding with 15 units in the last week (Feb 4th). Given it's February, we may be seeing the start of early spring collection interest. The promised lead time is 0. Since there is no lead time history yet, I will use the default lead time. For demand forecast (mu_hat), the historical mean is 6.4 units/week. However, the step jump to 15 units suggests a shift. I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the trend without overreacting until more data arrives. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. These settings will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the 0-period lead time plus the review period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 on-hand inventory. An order of 16 units was placed and arrived immediately (lead_time=0), but demand was significantly higher at 57 units, resulting in 41 units of lost sales and 0 ending inventory. This indicates a massive demand spike compared to the pre-game historical samples (which averaged ~6 units). The product 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is a staple item, and mid-February often sees a rise in 'New Season' or 'Spring Wardrobe' shopping for transitional denim. Given this sudden jump, I will use a recent demand window to capture the new level. I'll set mu_hat based on the most recent observation to prevent further stockouts, while keeping L at the promised value of 0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016004' (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is experiencing a radical demand shift compared to the January training data (avg ~6). Period 1 witnessed demand of 57, and Period 2 saw 72. Both periods resulted in stockouts (ending on-hand=0) despite lead time being 0. As we are moving into late February, demand for skinny denim is likely picking up for early spring. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. I will use the recent_N method (N=2) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime. Since the observed lead time is 0, L remains at the promised default. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover the current period's expected high demand (avg of 57 and 72) plus a safety buffer for the high volatility observed in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Period 1: demand increased from Jan avg of 6.4 to Feb avg of 64.5 (+900%), correlating with spring fashion seasonality.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 4 (2019/03/04). Demand for this 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' SKU shifted significantly in February (avg ~64 units/week) compared to January (~6 units/week), confirming a spring fashion regime change. In Period 1 and 2, we stocked out due to high demand, but Period 3 stabilized with a demand of 64 and 18 units remaining on-hand. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. For the forecast (mu_hat), I will use the average of the last 3 periods (P1-P3: 57, 72, 64) which is approximately 64.3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this stabilized 'February Fashion' regime. Standard deviation (sigma_hat) will also be based on these 3 samples to account for recent volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. We are dealing with 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', which has shown a massive surge in demand since February, consistent with spring fashion trends. Looking at the history: P1 demand=57, P2 demand=72, P3 demand=64, P4 demand=92. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (the 'February/March spring regime') is 71.25. In P4, we stocked out with 77 units available against a demand of 92, resulting in lost sales. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time (W = X - Z) has consistently been 0 (e.g., P4 order arrived in P4). To prevent further stockouts and capture the full demand of this high-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding), I will increase the demand forecast. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus exclusively on the high-demand regime, ensuring the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to cover the current upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand from Period 1-4 is 71.25, significantly higher than January historical samples. Stockout in Period 4 (demand 92 vs 77 supplied) confirms demand is likely exceeding previous estimates.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is experiencing a significant demand uptrend as we move into March and the spring season. Historical January data (avg ~4) is no longer relevant. Recent performance shows demand increasing: P1 (57), P2 (72), P3 (64), P4 (92), P5 (112). We have stockouted in 4 out of 5 periods because demand exceeded the available inventory (which is capped by the OR backend). Since the lead time is consistently 0, the primary risk is under-forecasting \u03bc\u0302. The average demand over the last 5 periods is 79.4, but the last two periods averaged 102. Given the trend and the consistent stockouts, I will set \u03bc\u0302 to 110 (explicitly) to stay ahead of the growth and avoid further lost sales. sigma_hat is also increasing with the mean; I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this volatility while weighting toward the higher recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand trend: March demand (avg 102) is significantly higher than February (avg 64.3). Stockouts in P1, P2, P4, and P5 indicate current order caps are too low for the seasonal peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2793.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is experiencing a sharp seasonal upward trend as we move into spring (late March). Demand in Period 6 spiked to 184 units, far exceeding the 147 supplied, leading to another stockout. Historical data from January (avg ~4) is no longer relevant. Every period since Period 4 has ended in a stockout (Ending Inventory = 0), indicating that the current OR backend order cap is clipping our ability to meet actual demand. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms L=0 arrival consistently. To break the cycle of stockouts, I need to raise the mu_hat and sigma_hat significantly to reflect the recent high-velocity demand. I've used N=3 for demand to capture the March surge (avg: 129.3) specifically, rather than leaning on the slower February numbers.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal surge confirmed in March: demand rose from 92 (P4) to 112 (P5) to 184 (P6). Inventory stockouts for 3 consecutive periods (P4-P6) prove current replenishment levels are insufficient for the spring fashion window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3171.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim, which aligns with a significant spring fashion seasonal surge in March/April. History shows actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Demand has increased rapidly: Period 4 (92), Period 5 (112), Period 6 (184), and slightly moderated in Period 7 (169). The average demand over the last four periods is 139.25. However, the stockouts in Periods 4, 5, and 6 suggest that latent demand might be higher than recorded sales. Since March/April is peak spring season for denim trousers, I will set mu_hat using recent demand more aggressively. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the high-regime demand (Period 4-7) which averages ~139 units per week. Given the volatility in this growth phase, sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same N=4 recent samples to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock (z-score will be high due to profit/holding cost ratio).

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued slightly in Period 7 (169 units) relative to Period 6 (184), but remains in the high-demand regime established in March (avg ~139 vs Jan avg ~6).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Historical data and game history for SKU 706016004 (High-waisted skinny denim) show a massive seasonal surge starting in February and peaking through March. Demand in Period 8 was 209, the highest observed yet, following a high of 184 in Period 6 and 169 in Period 7. The product is in a high-demand spring 'Divided Collection' regime. Current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). In-transit is 0. Observed lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 4-8), as the average demand in this period is significantly higher (~153 units) than the overall history. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that reflects this April peak and provides a sufficient ordering cap to prevent the stockouts seen earlier in the season.

Carry-over insight: Demand peaked in Period 8 (209 units), confirming that the April spring denim peak is sustained and significantly higher than March averages. Current regime (P4-P8) average is 153.2 units compared to Feb/March levels.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016004 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a high-demand spring/early summer regime. In Period 9 (2019-04-08), demand dropped to 140 units from a peak of 209 in Period 8. However, given the product type (denim) and the mid-April date (2019-04-15), demand is expected to remain high but potentially stabilize as it transitions from the initial peak. The 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat (using N=5) captures the high-demand window (P5-P9 average: 162.8 units) which is more representative than the full history. The lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by history (ordered P9, arrived P9). On-hand inventory is currently significant (95 units), so mu_hat should reflect the need to cover the current and next period's demand while the backend OR logic subtracts the on-hand stock and applies the cap to avoid over-ordering after a demand dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in Period 9: Demand decreased from 209 (P8) to 140 (P9), suggesting the peak spring surge may be stabilizing or starting a late-spring plateau. Current regime (P5-P9) average is 162.8 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late April (2019/4/22). History shows a clear seasonal cycle for this denim SKU: demand surged from February reaching a peak in early April (Period 8, demand=209) and has since trended downwards (Period 9=140, Period 10=110). This indicates the primary spring peak has passed. The current on-hand inventory is 116 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand observation. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent overstocking as we exit the seasonal peak, I am adjusting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (Periods 8-10) to capture the cooling trend while remaining sensitive to the fact that demand is still significantly higher than the January baseline. Using N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR engine on this most recent downward regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Seasonal peak ended Period 8 (209 units). Post-peak cooling observed over P9-P10, with demand dropping from 209 to 110 units (-47%).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016004' (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is in a clear post-peak decline as the spring fashion season winds down in late April. Demand has dropped steadily from a peak of 209 (P8) to 140 (P9), 110 (P10), and now 94 (P11). The current ending inventory (on-hand) is 143 units, which already exceeds the most recent weekly demand. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, we can react immediately. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P9-P11) to capture the cooling trend (avg ~115) and sigma_hat similarly to account for the reduced volatility in this downward phase. This approach prevents overstocking as we exit the seasonal peak while maintaining sufficient stock for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak cooling trend confirmed: Demand has dropped for three consecutive periods (140, 110, 94) from the P8 peak of 209. Average demand over P9-P11 is 114.7 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016004 (High-waisted skinny denim) has entered a post-peak seasonal cooling phase as we move into May. Demand has stabilized at a lower level over the last four periods (140, 110, 94, 97), with an average of 110.25 units. This is a significant drop from the April peak of 209 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (on-hand is currently 57) while maintaining a high service level for the remaining seasonal demand, I am using a recent regime of N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the current stabilized demand floor more accurately than the full history or the volatile peak periods. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a base stock that covers the expected 110 units, adjusted for variance, and minus the current inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Over the four periods P9-P12, demand has averaged 110 units (140, 110, 94, 97), following the April peak of 209. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016004 (High-waisted skinny denim) has stabilized following its April seasonal peak (Period 8). In the last five periods (P9-P13), demand has been 140, 110, 94, 97, and 86 respectively. The mean demand for this post-peak regime is approximately 105.4 units, with a noticeable gentle downward trend as spring concludes. The most recent demand of 86 suggests we are entering a lower steady state. To reflect this current regime while accounting for the recent deceleration, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the post-peak level without being overly influenced by the historical April surge. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (confirmed through P13), so I will use 'calculate' to maintain that baseline. The current on-hand inventory is 59 units, and with no in-transit stock, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock level required for a high service level (profit/holding cost ratio is ~19:1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained post-peak demand stabilization: Average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 105.4, down from the P8 peak of 209, confirming the end of the spring denim surge and transition to a May steady-state.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical data confirms that the spring denim peak (which reached 209 units in early April) has subsided, and demand has entered a stable post-peak regime. Over the last six periods (P9 to P14), demand has consistently hovered around a mean of 104.5 units (140, 110, 94, 97, 86, 100), showing significantly less volatility compared to the high-growth phase. Since lead time (L) has consistently been 0, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat, I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=6 to specifically capture the stabilized post-peak demand average of ~104.5 units per period. This allows the OR engine to set a base stock that avoids the excessive inventory holding costs associated with the earlier April peaks while maintaining a high service level for the current steady-state demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' in late May (Period 15) has shown a surprising uptick to 137 units, which is higher than the established May plateau of ~105 units. This suggests either a late-spring spike or statistical volatility. As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are entering the end of May/beginning of June. Historically, demand was significantly higher in March/April (peaking at 209). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory due to a slight stockout in Period 15. The lead time is consistently 0. To capture the recent demand increase while balancing against the previous cooling trend, I will use a recent window that captures the stabilization and the latest spike. Choosing N=7 for mu_hat (Periods 9-15) yields an average of (140+110+94+97+86+100+137)/7 = 109 units. I will use N=7 for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent volatility. The L parameter remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late May: P15 demand (137) broke the cooling trend (avg ~95 in P11-P14), suggesting potential residual spring demand or early summer shift.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is exhibiting a second demand surge after the initial April peak. Demand has increased from a stable avg of ~105 (P9-P14) to 137 (P15) and 151 (P16). This aligns with early summer fashion cycles. Consecutive stockouts in P15 and P16 (sold 136/137 and 145/151 respectively) indicate that current inventory replenishment is lagging behind this new upward trend. To capture this growth and minimize stockouts during this high-profit window ($19/unit), I am shifting the mu_hat focus to recent observations. I've selected N=3 (P14-P16) to capture the trend transition while giving weight to the recent 151 demand. Combined with a recent_N sigma calculation (N=6 to capture volatility since the stabilize-to-resurge transition), this will elevate the base stock to meet target service levels. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Second demand surge detected in June: Demand increased for two consecutive periods (137 in P15, 151 in P16), surpassing the May average of ~100. Stockouts in both P15 and P16 confirm the regime shift.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has entered a second significant seasonal surge in June. Period 17 demand was 163, following demand of 151 (P16) and 137 (P15). This confirms the 'June surge' identified in the Period 17 carry-over insight. The average demand over the last three periods (P15-P17) is approximately 150 units. While demand slightly plateaued in P17 compared to the steep increases of the prior two periods, we remain in a high-demand regime relative to May's average of ~100. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the priority is avoiding stockouts during this surge. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this June regime (average ~150), and N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen during this transition.

Carry-over insight: June demand surge confirmed: Demand has risen from ~100 (May avg) to 150 (June avg, P15-P17). Stabilization/Plateau observed in Period 17 (163 units) following tight stockouts in P15-P16.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, demand significantly dropped to 117 units, following a three-period surge in early June (137, 151, 163). This suggests the second seasonal peak may have already crested. The June average (P15-P18) is approximately 142 units, but the most recent observation (117) implies we should be cautious about a post-peak cooling trend similar to what was observed in late April. However, we must maintain enough stock to cover the current stabilized level. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the June regime, which includes both the surge and the recent drop, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 142 units per period. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Second seasonal peak cooling: Demand in Period 18 (117) shows a 28% drop from the Period 17 peak (163), signaling the end of the early June surge.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 analysis (2019/6/24). The second seasonal peak that occurred in June (P15-P17) has clearly cooled. Demand over the last two periods (P18-P19) has stabilized at 117 and 115 units respectively, down from the P17 peak of 163. This mirrors the post-peak cooling seen earlier in May. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the stability of the last two weeks, I am setting the demand regime length N=2 to focus specifically on this new post-peak plateau (average ~116). This will prevent over-ordering as the summer progresses while maintaining enough safety stock to cover small fluctuations from this current base level.

Carry-over insight: Second peak cooling confirmed: Demand decreased from June peak (163 in P17) to a stabilized range of ~115 (P18-P19), indicating a mid-summer steady state.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Recent history shows that the early June demand surge (peaking at 163 units in Period 17) has consistently cooled over the last three periods: 117 (P18), 115 (P19), and 89 (P20). This follows a pattern similar to the post-April peak cooling. Currently, demand is stabilizing around the 90-115 unit range. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the transition into July, which is typically a secondary summer clearance or steady-state period for denim before back-to-school preparation, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (average 107.0) to capture this downward stabilization rather than the higher average of the full June surge. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the lower volatility during this settling phase. These parameters aim to maintain high service levels (q=0.95 given $19/$20 ratio) while preventing overstocking as demand softens.

Carry-over insight: July demand transition: P20 demand (89) marks a return to late-May levels (~90-100), confirming the end of the June mini-peak (P15-P17).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has entered a post-peak stabilization phase following the June mini-surge. After peaking at 163 (P17), demand has consistently decreased over the last four periods: 117, 115, 89, 78. This indicates a transition into a July steady-state where demand is significantly lower than during the spring/early summer peaks. The current demand level is averaging 83.5 units over the last two periods (P20-P21). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this downward trend into the summer regime. N=4 includes the start of the decline from 117 down to 78, providing a conservative but responsive estimate for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand stabilization confirmed: Period 20 and 21 demand (89, 78) shows a 50% reduction from the June peak (163) and aligns with the late-May levels (~90-100).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016004 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a mid-summer stabilization phase following two distinct seasonal peaks (Spring denim peak in April and a secondary June surge). Demand over the last three periods (P20-P22) has been 89, 78, and 91 respectively, averaging approximately 86 units. This is a significant decrease from the June peak (avg ~145) but remains consistent with the late-May levels. Lead time is reliably 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this 'Divided Collection' staple, I will use a recent demand window of N=3 to capture this post-June-surge stabilization. Specifically, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 will align the OR backend's base stock with the current 80-90 unit demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the high-waisted skinny denim trousers (SKU 706016004) has stabilized into a mid-summer steady state following the June peak. Observed demand over the last four periods (P20-P23) has been 89, 78, 91, and 77, respectively, yielding a consistent average of 83.75 units. This follows a clear cooling from the June 10-17 levels (~115-163). The current date is July 22, and the product is a staple denim item which likely maintains a base level of sales through late summer before any possible back-to-school surge. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of the current regime, I will use a recent_N window of 4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent July demand levels (average 83.75), which prevents over-ordering based on the higher June volume. L will be set to the promised lead time of 0.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a late-summer cooling phase. Period 24 saw a significant drop in demand to 38 units, the lowest since early February. This follows a stabilization trend throughout July where demand was consistently between 77-91 units. The drop to 38 in Period 24 (late July) aligns with typical retail patterns where summer apparel demand tapers off before the late August back-to-school or autumn shifts. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the sharp drop in Period 24, I will use a short-window recent_N (N=3) to capture this downward momentum for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the lower demand regime (avg ~69 over the last 3 periods) to minimize holding costs while the product enters a potential seasonal trough. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on this reduced mean and volatility, appropriately reflecting current market conditions.

Carry-over insight: Significant late-summer demand drop detected in Period 24 (demand=38), marking a shift from the July steady-state (avg ~84) to a lower demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016004 (denim trousers) is currently in a late-summer lower-demand regime. Following a significant drop in Period 24 (demand=38) and a moderate rebound in Period 25 (demand=62), the average demand over the last two periods is 50. This is a substantial decrease from the July steady-state average of approximately 84. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the move into August (a transition month), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward shift while accounting for the recent volatility. This conservative approach balances the lower demand observations with the potential for minor late-season fluctuations, ensuring we don't overstock during the clearance/end-of-season transition.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand drop confirmed: Augmenting Period 25 insight, demand has averaged 50 over P24-P25, down from July's ~84 avg.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical demand shows a mid-August cooldown following the spring and early summer peaks. Period 26 demand was 71, preceded by 62 and 38. The demand has shifted from the July average (~84) to a lower August regime (avg ~57 over the last 3 periods). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. To prevent overstocking during this late-summer transition while maintaining service levels, I'm setting the forecast to reflect the most recent 3-period regime (P24-P26) to capture the current lower mean and variance. This strategy aligns with the 'late-summer demand drop' identified in the carry-over insights.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand for the last four periods (P24-P27) was 38, 62, 71, and 91, showing a steady climb back from the late-summer drop detected in P24-P25. Period 27 ending inventory is 0 after a minor stockout (demand 91 vs. 86 supply). This suggests a transition back into a higher demand regime as we approach late August/early September 'Back-to-School' shopping for denim products. I will use the last 4 periods (P24-P27) as the current regime (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this recovery trend while remaining sensitive to the recent low data points. The lead time remains consistently 0. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) will account for the recent volatility during this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand recovery detected: Demand increased for three consecutive periods (38, 62, 71, 91) from the P24 trough, suggesting a return to higher volume as fall seasonality/back-to-school approaches.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016004 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a late-summer recovery and transition phase as we move into late August (Period 29: 2019/8/26). Following a trough in late July (P24: 38 units), demand has shown a generally upward trend (62, 71, 91 units) before a dip in P28 (58 units). The carry-over insights suggest a return to higher volume as fall seasonality/back-to-school approaches, which is typical for denim. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent volatility and the upward trend while accounting for the recent dip, I will use recent_N demand statistics. Since the trend started approximately at Period 24, N=5 is appropriate to cover the trough-to-recovery transition. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the potential start of the fall volume increase while balancing against current on-hand inventory (44 units).

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonality transition confirmed: Demand recovered from P24 trough (38) to an average of 70.5 over P25-P28, signaling the start of late-summer/back-to-school volume increases.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Historical demand shows a recovery from the late-summer trough (P24 demand=38) followed by a stabilization in late August (P28=58, P29=48). This suggests the back-to-school surge was brief or has transitioned into a steady fall demand level. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=5 (covering P25-P29) to capture the current late-August/early-September demand regime, which averages ~67 units. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for current volume while ignoring the much higher spring/summer peaks.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand stabilization: Late August (P28-P29) demand has cooled to an average of 53 units following the brief early-August recovery (P26-P27 avg ~81), indicating a stabilized early-fall regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in the early fall period. Looking at the demand history for the last 5 periods (P26-P30), we see a pattern of stabilization following the late-summer fluctuations. Demand has been 71, 91, 58, 48, and 55. This averages to approximately 64.6 units. The most recent three periods (P28-P30) show a tighter range averaging 53.7 units, which aligns with the 'Fall demand stabilization' carry-over insight. Given the product is skinny denim, we might expect a gradual increase as we move deeper into autumn, but currently, we are in a lower-volume regime compared to the spring peaks. I will set N=5 for demand forecasting to capture the current stable fall regime while smoothing out the brief spike from early August. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The base stock policy will aim to cover demand for the current period plus lead time, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical data and recent demand samples (P28-P31: 58, 48, 55, 46) indicate that the 'fall demand stabilization' noted in Period 30 has continued. The average demand over these last four periods is approximately 51.75 units. This reflects a significant cooling from the August peaks and aligns with a mid-September steady-state before potential late-fall shifts. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'concluded' messages through Period 31. To capture this stabilized regime while remaining sensitive to minor fluctuations, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set the base stock to cover current demand levels (approx. 52 units) while maintaining a sufficient safety buffer, as the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Fall steady-state confirmed: Demand has stabilized over P28-P31 with an average of 51.75 units, following the late-August volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Historical demand analysis shows a 'fall steady-state' regime has been established since Period 28 (late August). Over the last five periods (P28-P32), demand has been 58, 48, 55, 46, and 35, averaging 48.4 units. This is a significant decrease from the early-August recovery where demand temporarily peaked at 91 (P27). The most recent period (P32) shows the lowest demand in this regime (35), suggesting a potential further cooling as we move deeper into autumn. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this stabilized early-fall demand level while remaining responsive to the gradual downward trend. L is kept at the default promised lead time of 0.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a steady-state fall regime. In Period 33, demand increased to 73, exceeding the starting on-hand inventory of 64 and causing a stockout. This follows a period of lower demand (35 in P32), indicating that while the overall fall average is around 50-55, volatility remains present. The lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize recent demand behavior since the fall transition (P28 onwards) to capture the current mean and variance. N=6 (Periods 28-33) provides a sample that includes both the recent spike and the preceding stabilization, resulting in an average demand of approximately 55.8. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and provides a buffer for the observed volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016004' (High-waisted skinny denim) is entering October. Historically, demand for denim often sees a secondary peak in fall. Recent data shows a rise in demand over the last two periods (73 in P33 and 75 in P34) compared to the September average of ~45-50. This shift follows a stockout in both P33 and P34, suggesting the current inventory levels are insufficient for the emerging fall demand regime. I am setting L to 'default' (0 periods) as all historical shipments have arrived instantly. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this upward movement (averaging the shift from 35, 73, and 75). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the increased volatility during this transition. This approach aims to restore service levels and prevent further lost sales during the October denim demand window.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand surge detected: Demand increased significantly in P33 and P34 (avg 74) compared to the P31-P32 average (avg 40.5). Back-to-back stockouts in P33-P34 confirm this regime shift.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-October (P36), a period historically associated with stable fall demand for high-waisted jeans. Recent history shows a demand surge in P33-P34 (avg 74) resulting in stockouts, followed by a slight moderation to 67 in P35. The carry-over insight for P35 correctly identified a fall regime shift. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current fall steady-state (avg ~72) while moving away from the lower September averages (~45). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Utilizing recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR engine calculates the base stock based on the latest seasonal volatility and mean demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016004 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is in the mid-fall period (late October). After a significant demand surge in late September/early October (P33-P34 avg=74), demand has slightly cooled and stabilized in the mid-60s range (P35=67, P36=60). The 'fall demand surge' noted in Period 35 is sustained but seems to have plateaued. To reflect this, I am using a recent_N of 4 (P33-P36) for demand forecasting, which captures both the initial surge and the recent slight softening, yielding a mean demand of approximately 68.75. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 19. My parameters target a base stock that covers the expected demand for the upcoming period while maintaining a safety buffer for potential fall volatility.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand surge stabilized: Average demand over P33-P36 is 68.75, confirming a higher-volume regime compared to the September steady-state (avg ~40.5).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016004 is currently in a stable fall demand regime. Over the last five periods (P33-P37), demand has averaged 67.4 units (73, 75, 67, 60, 62). While demand spiked in late September (P33-P34), it has settled into a steady range around 60-65 units throughout October. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this stabilized fall volume. Sigma_hat is also set using N=5 to capture recent volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation covers expected demand and safety stock for the current period, given we have 18 units on-hand and 0 in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime has stabilized following the late-September surge: Average demand over P35-P37 is 63 units, compared to the P33-P34 average of 74 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for Period 38 was 59, which is consistent with the stable fall regime identified over the last four periods (P35-P38: 67, 60, 62, 59), averaging 62 units. This supports the carry-over insight from Period 38 that the demand has stabilized following the late-September peak. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. For the OR parameters: L is set to calculated as lead time is stable at 0. mu_hat is set using recent_N with N=4 to reflect this stabilized late-fall demand regime (average ~62). sigma_hat also uses N=4 to capture the current volatility accurately. These parameters aim to maintain a stock level that satisfies demand with a high service level given the high profit/holding cost ratio (q \u2248 0.95), while avoiding excessive overstocking as the season progresses.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016004 (High-waisted skinny denim) has entered a stable fall regime following the late-September surge. In the last five periods (P35-P39), demand has been consistent, averaging 58.2 units (67, 60, 62, 59, 43). The most recent period (P39) showed a slight drop to 43, but remains within the established range. Given that we are now in mid-November, I expect demand to remain steady or potentially increase slightly as we approach the holiday shopping season. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stable fall regime while being responsive to the most recent cooling. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to align volatility estimates with this specific regime, ensuring the inventory levels cover the demand spread without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Fall steady-state established: Average demand over P35-P39 is 58.2 units, showing high stability compared to the volatile transitions in September.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical data and recent demand samples (P35-P40) show a stable fall regime with an average demand of approximately 56.7 units. Period 40 demand (49) and Period 39 demand (43) are slightly below this average, suggesting a minor cooling effect as we move deeper into November, or simply natural variance within the established steady-state. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire game history. On-hand inventory is 25 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (covering P35-P40) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized fall performance while allowing for the slight downward trend in the most recent two weeks to be reflected in the variance. L will be set to 'calculate' to continue utilizing the stable 0-period lead time observation.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). Demand for the last three periods (P39-P41) has been 43, 49, and 42, showing a very stable late-fall steady state. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P35-P41) is 54.5, but focusing on the most recent 3-5 periods captures the slight cooling into late November accurately. There is no evidence of a pre-holiday surge yet for this specific SKU ('Jade HW Skinny Denim'). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=5 (P37-P41) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which reflects the current stabilized demand regime of approximately 50 units per period. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a base stock that covers the immediate demand while minimizing holding costs for this high-waisted denim product.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike (143 units), significantly higher than the previous 5-period average of ~50 units. This is likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (Date: 2019/11/25). Given the item is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim'\u2014a fashion staple\u2014this volatility is expected during major retail events. I have completely stocked out (on-hand 0). To prevent further stockouts as we enter the December holiday shopping period, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to an 'explicit' forecast. I will forecast demand for the upcoming period at approximately 100 units to reach a middle ground between the typical November steady-state and the extreme Black Friday peak, ensuring enough inventory is ordered to capture sustained holiday demand while managing risk. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected: Period 42 demand spiked to 143 units (Black Friday week), up from the November average of ~45 (+217%).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday period. Period 42 saw a significant holiday spike (143 units), followed by a sharp drop to 54 units in Period 43. This pattern is typical for retail\u2014a massive surge during promotional weeks followed by a cooling-off period. The on-hand inventory is currently high at 112 units due to a large order placed in Period 43 to cover the expected holiday demand. Given that the peak has passed, I need to adjust the mu_hat to avoid overstocking while maintaining enough inventory for residual December demand. I will use a recent_N of 5 (covering Periods 39-43) to balance the high outlier from Period 42 with the more moderate demand seen in surrounding weeks. Actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak occurred in Period 42 (143 units) followed by an immediate cooling to 54 units in Period 43, indicating a short-lived Black Friday spike rather than a sustained holiday regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 706016004 indicates a short-lived holiday spike in Period 42 (Black Friday week, 143 units), followed by immediate cooling in Periods 43-44 (54 and 34 units respectively). This matches the pattern seen in the carry-over insights. We are currently in mid-December (Date: 2019/12/16), post-Black Friday, where demand historically stabilizes or drops briefly before potential end-of-year clearance or winter steady-state. Since the large order in P43 (166 units) has replenished inventory to 104 units on-hand, we are well-covered for the current low-demand regime (avg ~44 units over P43-P44). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spike cooling trend (averaging P42-P44: ~77 units) while letting the OR engine account for the high on-hand inventory. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday period. Period 42 saw a major spike (143 units), but demand immediately settled to 54, 34, and 64 in the following periods (P43-P45). The average demand over these last three periods is approximately 50.7 units. Historically, January demand for this SKU (from 2019-01-07 to 2019-01-28) was very low, averaging around 4.25 units per week. Given the late December date, we should anticipate a significant drop-off in demand as the holiday season ends and we enter the low-demand January regime observed at the start of the data. Period 45 demand of 64 suggests some residual holiday activity, but the broader trend is downward. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the post-spike levels (avg ~51), which provides a safer buffer than the historical January average while acknowledging the cooling trend from the spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling confirmed: Following the Black Friday spike (P42=143), demand has stabilized at an average of 50.7 units over P43-P45, significantly lower than the peak but still higher than the Jan 2019 historical baseline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are in the post-holiday period. Historical data and carry-over insights show that the Black Friday spike (P42, demand=143) was temporary, and demand has since stabilized. The last four periods (P43-P46) show demand values of 54, 34, 64, and 46, averaging approximately 49.5 units. This is consistent with the established late-fall and post-holiday steady-state. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given we have 63 units on hand and demand is averaging ~50, the pipeline is sufficient. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this current steady-state regime while ignoring the Black Friday outlier. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current demand levels while maintaining a safe service level for the skinny denim product.
