Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for 'Tess Tee' (a jersey basic long t-shirt) shows a clear upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 6, 13, 32, 49, 62. This suggests a seasonal ramp-up or a product gaining traction. Given the product is a staple t-shirt and we are approaching spring, this growth is likely to continue or stabilize. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to cover the expected demand for the current period. Using the last 3 samples (32, 49, 62) gives a mean of 47.6, but the most recent sample (62) is the most relevant given the sharp growth. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 65 to account for the continued upward trend and sigma_hat explicitly to 15 to manage the volatility seen in the rapid growth phase. L is set to default (0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-02-18. We are looking at a T-shirt (basic jersey) which generally shows growing demand as the season transitions from winter to spring. Historical demand samples (6, 13, 32, 49, 62) and the Period 1 demand of 38 suggest a significant upward trend compared to the early January baseline, though Period 1 was lower than the last sample. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on Period 1's conclusion (ordered 90, arrived 90 in the same period). Inventory is healthy (52 on hand). To account for the upward trend and the recent dip, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent regime shift (moving into Feb demand levels). With L=0, the OR backend logic will target a base stock of (1+0) * mean of recent 3 samples + safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1330.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053004 is a basic long t-shirt. Current demand data (6, 13, 32, 49, 62 from pre-game, plus 38 and 73 in Periods 1-2) shows a clear and rapid upward trend as we move towards Spring. Period 2 demand (73) exceeded the available stock (70), resulting in lost sales. The promised lead time of 0 is currently accurate (observed lead_time 0 in both P1 and P2). To address the stockout and the accelerating demand trend, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent high demand periods (49, 62, 38, 73... using the most recent 3: 62, 38, 73). However, given the trend, the mean of the last 3 periods (approx 57.6) might still be too low. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 85 to ensure we cover the expected growth and replenish the exhausted safety stock. I will also use explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand is in a rapid growth phase (early spring seasonality for t-shirts); Period 2 demand of 73 caused a stockout (on-hand 0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $925.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Long T-shirt', which shows strong upward demand growth as we approach spring (February/March). Historical demand has risen from single digits in early January (6, 13) to significant levels in February (38, 73, 52). While Period 3 demand (52) was lower than Period 2 (73), Period 2 was a stockout, suggesting actual demand was likely higher. We are currently in Period 4 (Early March). The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0. To capture the recent accelerating demand and ensure we don't stock out during this growth phase, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility, which covers the most relevant period of high activity. This keeps \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 responsive to the current spring trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed for spring season: mean demand increased significantly from Jan (avg ~20) to Feb (avg ~54).

Daily Reward (R_t): $516.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711053004' (Long T-shirt) is entering March (Period 5). Historical data and previous carry-over insights indicate a significant growth phase transitioning from January (avg ~20) into February/March (avg ~54). Recent demand shows high volatility: Period 2 peaked at 73, while Period 4 dipped to 30. Despite the dip in Period 4, the seasonal trend for basic jersey T-shirts in early spring remains upward. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts like the one in Period 2 while managing holding costs, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the February-March demand regime (samples: 38, 73, 52, 30; mean 48.25). Sigma will also use recent_N to reflect the current high volatility (std dev ~18). This captures the spring trend better than the full history which includes low Jan values.

Daily Reward (R_t): $660.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Long T-shirt', which is seeing seasonal demand as we enter spring (mid-March). Historical demand shows a significant shift from January (avg ~25) to February and March (avg ~46). In Period 2, we experienced a stockout, but demand has stabilized slightly in the last three periods (52, 30, 37). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current period (Mar 18) is approaching peak spring/summer demand, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current regime which includes the ramp-up and the recent stabilization. This ensures the base stock (mu_hat) reflects current averages (~46 units/period) rather than the lower January figures, providing a safety buffer for potential spring peaks while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. We are managing a 'Long T-shirt', which is highly relevant for the spring season. Historical demand shows a significant shift from January (avg ~25) to February and March (avg ~45). Reviewing the last 4 periods (P3-P6), demand has stabilized somewhat around a mean of 39.5 (52, 30, 37, 39). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current spring demand level while smoothing out the volatility seen in February. For sigma_hat, N=4 will similarly reflect the recent demand variability. This approach maintains a responsive inventory level for this seasonal basic shirt while avoiding overstocking as we move deeper into the season.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Tess Tee' (Long T-shirt), which is highly seasonal for Spring/Summer. We are currently at Period 8 (April 1st). Reviewing historical demand: Jan avg ~25, Feb avg ~54 (with a peak of 73 in P2), and March (Periods 4-7) stabilized at a mean of 32.5. However, as we enter April, we should anticipate another seasonal uptick. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 7 historical observations. On-hand inventory is 31, and there is no pipeline inventory. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the stable March demand (mean 32.5, std ~6.6) but will set mu_hat slightly higher via explicit forecasting to account for the expected April seasonal increase in t-shirt demand. Setting mu_hat to 45 (approx 1.4x the March average) to ensure we don't stock out during the transition into Spring, with sigma_hat reflecting the recent volatility of the last 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in March (Periods 4-7) with a mean of 32.5 units/week, following a volatile February. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, 2019. This SKU is a 'Long T-shirt', which is a spring/summer staple. Historically, demand was very high in February (avg ~54 in early Feb), then stabilized in March (Periods 4-7 avg = 32.5). However, Period 8 saw a slight uptick to 38. Given the lead time is consistently 0 (same-day arrival), the backend OR engine will calculate orders to reach a target base stock for the current period's demand. I am using recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized March-April period (Periods 4-8), which reflects a more consistent demand regime (30, 37, 39, 24, 38) compared to the volatile start of the year. This N value allows for sufficient sample size while excluding the February outlier of 73 and the early January trends. The 0-day lead time is stable based on all 8 concluded periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved cotton blend T-shirt. Historically, demand showed a growth phase in February, followed by a stabilization in March and early April (Periods 4-9). The last 6 periods show a stable mean of 33.17 units per week (30, 37, 39, 24, 38, 31). As we move into mid-April, late spring/early summer seasonality is expected to keep demand steady or slightly rising. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (14 units on-hand), so setting parameters to target a base stock covering the current demand regime is necessary to prevent stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this stable period from early March to now.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 4 (March/April): mean demand is ~33 units/week (Periods 4-9 avg: 33.17) with low lead time variability (L=0).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Period 10 witnessed a significant demand spike of 76 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 6-period average of ~33 units. This caused a stockout (ending inventory 0). Given the product is a 'Long T-shirt in soft jersey', we are likely entering a sustained late-spring/early-summer demand regime. The jump from 31 (Period 9) to 76 (Period 10) suggests a new mean level or increased volatility. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for this surge, I am shifting mu_hat to a recent_N calculation using N=4 (capturing the mid-April surge and the preceding stable weeks) and increasing sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to better manage the increased volatility and ensure a higher service level during this seasonal transition. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 10: weekly demand jumped from a stable average of 33 (Periods 4-9) to 76 units, likely signaling late-spring/early-summer fashion seasonality.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711053004' (Long T-shirt) is currently in a high-growth seasonal phase, likely driven by late spring/early summer weather. We have experienced stockouts for two consecutive periods (Period 10 and 11) because demand jumped from a stable mean of ~33 (Periods 4-9) to 76 in Period 10 and 93 in Period 11. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this surge, I am shifting mu_hat to a recent_N calculation using N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 9-11 averages ~67, but the last two are 76 and 93). I will also use N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this period of rapid growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Weekly demand rose from 33 (avg Periods 4-9) to 84.5 (avg Periods 10-11). Two consecutive periods of stockouts (P10, P11) confirm supply must be significantly increased to match summer seasonality.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711053004' (Long T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand late-spring/early-summer season. History shows a clear demand shift starting at Period 10. Comparing the stable mid-spring regime (Periods 4-9 avg: 33.17) to the recent three periods (Periods 10-12 avg: 74.0), demand has more than doubled. Period 12 saw a demand of 53, following much higher peaks of 76 and 93 in Periods 10 and 11, which suggests high volatility or potential stabilization at a higher level. Because the product is a staple T-shirt during May (Period 13), I want to maintain a high service level to avoid the stockouts observed in P10 and P11. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while budgeting for the high volatility (std dev) seen since Period 10.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed 2.2x higher than spring average starting May (Period 10-12 avg: 74 vs P4-9 avg: 33).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/05/13). Historically, this item (soft jersey t-shirt) experienced a demand surge in mid-to-late April (Periods 10 & 11) with demands of 76 and 93, followed by a significant cooldown in the last two periods (Period 12: 53, Period 13: 39). This suggests the initial summer surge may have been a front-loaded seasonal event or influenced by specific promotions. The Period 13 demand (39) is much closer to the March/April spring average (33) than the surge peaks. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which mandates high service levels, and the volatile nature of the recent four periods (76, 93, 53, 39), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent high-demand regime while acknowledging the recent downward trend to avoid excessive overstocking. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in May: following a surge (avg 84.5 in P10-11), demand stabilized lower (avg 46 in P12-13). Lead time remains 0.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711053004' (Long T-shirt) is currently in the late spring/early summer season (late May). After a significant surge and stockouts in Periods 10-11 (demand peaked at 93), demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P12-P14) with observations of 53, 39, and 39. This suggests the initial early-summer spike has leveled off to a new mean. Calculating the average of the most recent 5 periods (P10-P14) gives 60 units, but focusing on the last 3 periods since the surge shows a mean of 43.6. Given the product's seasonal relevance, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current regime while acknowledging the recent stabilization. Sigma_hat also uses N=5 to reflect the high volatility seen during the surge. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), which is captured by the 'calculate' method.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized following May surge: mean demand for Periods 12-14 is 43.6 units, compared to the peak of 84.5 in Periods 10-11.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. This SKU (Tess Tee t-shirt) experienced a significant demand spike in mid-April (Periods 10-11, peaking at 93 units) which appears to have been a transition into summer seasonality. However, for the last four periods (Periods 12-15), demand has stabilized significantly with a mean of 42.25 units (53, 39, 39, 38). This suggests the initial summer surge has plateaued into a stable early-summer regime. The lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To manage costs while maintaining a high service level (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to define the current demand regime (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This period reflects the shift from the peak surge back to a stable, albeit slightly higher than spring, consumption rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May: Periods 12-15 show a stable mean of 42.25 units/week following the April surge (Periods 10-11 avg: 84.5).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a cotton-blend T-shirt, which is entering its peak summer season. Period 16 saw a significant demand spike to 86 units, causing a stockout (on-hand is now 0). This mirrors the surge seen in late April (Periods 10-11), suggesting a cyclical or weather-driven demand pattern for summer apparel. The previous stabilization at ~42 units (Periods 12-15) has been broken. To prevent further lost sales during this high-demand period, I am shifting the focus to a more recent window that captures this growth. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 (Periods 12-16) to bridge the previous stable mean (41) and the new spike (86), resulting in an average of 51 units per period. Since lead time is 0, the backend will calculate a base stock to cover this anticipated demand. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility observed in the most recent period.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected at Period 16 (86 units), signaling the start of peak summer seasonality for T-shirts, ending a four-period stable regime (Avg 41.5).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711053004' (a Jersey T-shirt) is currently in its peak summer season (June). Period 17 (June 3) saw a massive demand surge to 180 units, up from 86 in Period 16, resulting in a complete stockout. This shift reflects a move from early-summer demand (avg ~42) to peak-summer demand. Historical January-February data and early spring averages are no longer relevant. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to 180 (the latest observed peak demand) to ensure the base stock covers this new level, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent extreme volatility. Lead time remains 0 based on consistent history. The OR backend will use these values to maximize the service level during this high-demand, high-margin period.

Carry-over insight: Peak summer demand spike confirmed in Period 17: weekly demand jumped to 180 units, significantly exceeding the previous May surge (avg ~85).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019, which is peak summer season for T-shirts. Demand for SKU 711053004 has spiked significantly in the last three periods: Period 16 (86), Period 17 (180), and Period 18 (141). This confirms a new high-demand summer regime. The average demand over these last three periods is 135.67 units/week, a massive increase from the previous May stability (~42 units/week). Lead time consistently remains at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation of ~47 during this peak), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus the OR engine on this specific summer peak regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current high-volume sales. The 'recent_N' method for mu_hat will compute (1+L) * mean of the last 3 periods, covering the immediate demand for the current period.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime confirmed (Periods 16-18): Avg demand increased to 135.7 units/week from the spring average of ~42 (+223%). High volatility observed (SD ~47).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, which is peak summer season for T-shirts. Demand history shows a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 86, 180, 141, and 187, respectively. This confirms a high-demand summer peak regime with a mean of approximately 148.5 units/week. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods across all successfully concluded orders. To capture this recent summer surge and manage high volatility (standard deviation ~46.6 in this new regime), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 samples (N=4) to ensure the base stock levels are responsive to current peak sales and avoid stockouts seen in Periods 16 and 17. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio remains very high ($19 vs $1), justifying a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (June) confirmed (Periods 16-19): Mean demand increased to 148.5 units/week from the spring average of ~42 (+253%). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Based on the product description (Long T-shirt) and recent demand history, we are firmly in the peak summer demand regime. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 86, 180, 141, 187, and 147, with an average of 148.2 units/week. This represents a significant and sustained increase compared to previous months. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am selecting recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this summer peak mean and its associated high volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 40). This will ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover the expected triple-digit weekly demand throughout July.

Carry-over insight: Peak summer demand regime (July) confirmed: Average demand of 148.2 units/week (Periods 16-20) with high volatility (Std Dev ~40).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019, which is squarely in the peak summer demand regime for this T-shirt SKU. Recent history (Periods 16-21) shows an average demand of 151.3 units per week, significantly higher than the spring average. The standard deviation over these last 6 periods is approximately 36.6. Although the previous period's demand (167) was slightly above the average, the regime appears relatively stable in its heightened state for early July. I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture this summer peak mean and volatility accurately for the OR backend. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0) warrants a high service level, which the OR engine will target via these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (July) confirmed: mean demand for Periods 16-21 is 151.3 units/week, up from ~42 in mid-spring.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, which is peak summer season for this cotton jersey T-shirt. Historical data from early June to mid-July (Periods 17-22) shows a clear shift to a high-demand regime, with demand values of 180, 141, 187, 147, 167, and 103. Period 22 dropped to 103, which may be a regression toward the mean or a slight cooling from the absolute peak, but demand remains significantly higher than the spring average. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P17-P22) is approximately 154 units/week. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To balance the high profit margin ($19) against holding costs ($1) during this volatile peak season, I will use a recent_N approach (N=7 to capture the full shift starting Period 16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels are responsive to current summer volumes while capturing the recent variance.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the summer season appears to have peaked and is now in a cooling phase as we move into late July. Demand transitioned from a peak average of ~150 units/week (Periods 16-21) to 103 in Period 22 and 76 in Period 23. This decline represents a significant shift from the high-summer peak. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (Periods 21-23) to capture this downward trend (average ~115) while maintaining enough buffer for potential late-July heatwaves. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current variability during this transition. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 23: summer peak is cooling; weekly demand dropped from ~150 units/week (Periods 16-21) to 76 units, suggesting the end of the primary summer surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3567.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tess Tee' (Long T-shirt) has shown high volatility as we move through late July. After a significant drop in Period 23 (76 units), demand surged again in Period 24 to 188 units, suggesting the 'cooling' noted in the previous carry-over insight was premature or that high-summer demand is oscillating rather than strictly declining. The current period is 2019/7/29, entering August. Historically, summer items remain active through August but may begin a steadier decline soon. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle the high volatility (recent range 76 to 188), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent high-variance behavior (avg ~122), while sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the high standard deviation in this transition period, ensuring we don't stock out if demand spikes again to 180+ levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in late July: Period 23 saw a drop to 76, immediately followed by a jump to 188 in Period 24, indicating a high-variance summer-end regime rather than a clean downward trend.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Analysis of the last 10 periods (since June) shows heavy volatility as we move through peak summer, with demand values of 180, 141, 187, 147, 167, 103, 76, 188, and 107. While Period 23 (76 units) suggested a cooldown, the rebound to 188 and 107 in subsequent weeks indicates high-variance late-summer demand rather than a terminal decline. Since the product is a staple t-shirt, demand is expected to remain substantial through August before the autumn transition. The mean demand over the last 8 periods (June-July) is approximately 140 units. Given the high standard deviation in recent weeks (approx. 40-50 units), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this elevated summer regime. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=8 for sigma_hat as well to ensure the backend accounts for the current high volatility and maintains a sufficient service level against stockouts (critical given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1).

Carry-over insight: High-variance summer demand regime remains active in early August: Mean of 140 units/week (Periods 18-25) with significant weekly swings (Range 76-188).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU shows that the peak summer season (characterized by high averages of ~150 units/week between mid-June and late-July) is beginning to transition. Recent demand in Periods 23-26 (76, 188, 107, 78) indicates significantly higher volatility as the season winds down, with a recent mean of approximately 112 units/week over the last 4 periods. However, the drop to 78 in the most recent period suggests a cooling trend typical of late summer. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the tail end of the high-summer volatility while acknowledging the slowing trend, balancing the risk of stockouts against potential holding costs as we exit the peak-demand months.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime transition detected in August: Mean demand decreased from ~150 (Periods 18-21) to ~112 (Periods 23-26), with high inter-week volatility (SD ~50+) continuing into the late summer season.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear transition from the peak summer demand (June/July, avg ~150) to a late-summer regime. The last five periods (P23-P27) show demand values of 76, 188, 107, 78, and 79 with a mean of 105.6. While Period 24 was a significant outlier (188), the most recent three periods (P25-P27) have stabilized around a mean of 88. This suggests that the 'High-variance summer demand' noted in previous insights is cooling down as fall approaches. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the transition) to capture this cooling trend while still accounting for the residual volatility (sigma_hat, also recent_N=5). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods through consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in mid-August: Mean demand decreased from ~150 (early summer) to ~88 over the last three periods (P25-P27), signaling the end of the peak summer season.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Historical demand data and carry-over insights indicate that the peak summer season for this T-shirt SKU has concluded. Demand has transitioned from a high-summer average of ~150 units/week (Periods 16-21) to a significantly lower late-August regime. Specifically, the last four periods (P25-P28) show demand of 107, 78, 79, and 65, resulting in a mean of 82.25 units/week. This downward trend is consistent with back-to-school transitions and the end of summer fashion seasonality. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs as demand continues to cool, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent downward-trending regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~82 unit demand level rather than the triple-digit peaks seen in July.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in late August: Mean demand decreased to 82.25 units/week over the last 4 periods (P25-P28), a 45% drop from the July peak regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/09/02), the demand for this SKU (a cotton-blend T-shirt) is continuing its post-summer cooling trend. Looking at recent demand samples (P26: 78, P27: 79, P28: 65, P29: 61), the average has stabilized around 71 units per week, significantly lower than the July peak of ~150. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this late-August/early-September regime. This will allow the base stock to adjust downward to the current demand level of approximately 71 units, preventing further overstocking as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in late August/early September confirmed: Mean demand for Periods 26-29 is 70.75 units/week, representing a further cooling from the mid-August transition phase (avg ~82).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Long T-shirt' SKU 711053004 is clearly entering a Post-Summer/Autumn cooling phase. In Period 30 (early September), demand was 62, following a four-period downward trend (P26-P29: 78, 79, 65, 61). The mean demand over these last five periods is approximately 69 units. This is significantly lower than the July peak (~150) and aligns with the expected seasonal transition for t-shirts. On-hand inventory is currently 24. To prevent overstocking during this cooling period while maintaining a sufficient service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I am setting mu_hat to capture the recent 5-period average (N=5) and using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased but still present volatility from the summer transition. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in early September: Mean demand for Periods 26-30 is 69 units/week, down from the August transition average of ~82.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are seeing a demand spike in the most recent period (Period 31: 107 units), contrasting with the cooling trend observed during late August where demand averaged ~70 units (Periods 26-30). This spike caused a stockout (on-hand 0). Historically, mid-September can see a minor resurgence in t-shirt demand (back-to-school or late-summer clearance). Given the recent stockout and the jump from 62 to 107, I am adjusting the demand forecast upward. I will use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 26-31) to capture the cooling phase while accounting for the recent spike, which results in a mean of (78+79+65+61+62+107)/6 = 75.3. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 will appropriately capture the increased volatility (Std Dev ~18).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in mid-September: after a stable cooling phase (avg ~66 for P28-30), demand jumped to 107 in P31, causing a stockout.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in the late summer/early fall transition period for the T-shirt SKU. Recent demand has shown increased volatility as the summer peak ends: Period 31 saw a spike to 107 (causing a stockout), followed by a return to 76 in Period 32. The 'cooling' trend noted in previous periods (avg ~69-70) is being challenged by these higher late-season spikes. Lead time is consistently 0. To prevent stockouts from similar spikes while demand generally trends downward, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covering Periods 28-32). This captures the recent cooling trend (avg ~78) and the recent spike's impact on volatility. L remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in mid-September: after a stable cooling phase (avg ~66 for P28-30), demand jumped to 107 in P31, and remained relatively high at 76 in P32, requiring a higher safety stock than earlier in September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The demand history shows a transition from the peak summer season (July/August) into a more volatile fall season. Specifically, after a cooling phase in late August (avg ~69), demand spiked in mid-September (Period 31: 107 units, Period 32: 76 units, Period 33: 81 units), causing a stockout in Period 31. This suggests that while summer peaks are over, there is renewed volatility or a secondary peak in late September. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage this recent volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat targeting the last 4 periods (P30-P33) to capture the increased mean (~81.5) and the variance associated with the recent spike. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in late September: following an August cooling phase (avg ~69), the mean demand for Periods 31-33 increased to 88 units/week (+27%), necessitating a higher safety stock for the early fall transition.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are entering the fall season. Demand in late September showed a recovery from August lows (averaging ~88 units in Periods 31-33), but Period 34 saw a significant drop to 39 units. This suggests either high volatility or a potential downward shift as we move further into October. Given the previous 'false cooling' in Period 31 (followed by a spike), I will use a balanced approach. The recent mean for the last 4 periods (P31-P34) is 75.75 units. I will set mu_hat based on these last 4 samples (N=4) to capture the current fall level while absorbing the most recent low data point. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to account for the high variance observed in September (range 39-107). Lead time is stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in late September/early October: Period 34 demand (39) is significantly lower than the preceding three-period mean (88), suggesting a possible downward shift or continued high-variance regime transition into fall.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th. Demand for this long T-shirt is entering a mid-fall phase. Over the last two periods (P34-P35), demand has dropped significantly to 39 and 38 units, respectively, compared to the late-September peak average of 88 units (P31-P33). This indicates a clear shift from the high-volatility September regime to a more stable, lower-volume October regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a safe service level for this lower demand period, I am switching to a recent_N method focusing on the last 5 periods (P31-P35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the recent spike (107) and the subsequent cooling (38-39), providing a balanced forecast that accounts for recent volatility but respects the current downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in early October: Mean demand for Periods 34-35 is 38.5 units/week, down 56% from the mid-September average of 88 (P31-P33).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 37 (late October) is characterized by a continued stabilization into the fall season. Periods 34-36 show highly consistent demand levels of 39, 38, and 35 respectively (mean = 37.3 units/week), confirming the regime shift noted in Period 36. This follows a volatile September. Since the current on-hand inventory is 82 units and the expected demand is ~37, the system is well-covered for the current period (L=0). I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-summer cooling stability and avoid the noise from the mid-September spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall stability confirmed: Mean demand for Periods 34-36 is 37.3 units/week (SD ~2), representing a stable low-demand regime following the volatile September transition.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We have confirmed a stable fall demand regime following the summer peak and a volatile September. For the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has been 39, 38, 35, and 63. While P37 saw a slight uptick to 63, the average over these four periods is 43.75. The product is a T-shirt, and demand typically decreases or remains low during late fall. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this fall regime (43.75 * (1+0) = 43.75), which the OR backend will use to calculate the base stock. sigma_hat will also use N=4 to account for the recent variance caused by the P37 spike. This ensures we carry enough stock for the current lower-demand environment without over-ordering and incurring excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (late Oct): Mean demand of 43.75 units/week over the last 4 periods (P34-P37), showing a significant decrease from the summer and September volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a post-summer fall regime for this SKU (long T-shirt). Demand has stabilized since the volatility of September. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has been 39, 38, 35, 63, and 41, resulting in a mean of 43.2 units per week. The spike to 63 in P37 indicates some residual volatility, but the overall trend is significantly lower than the summer peak of ~150. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs in this lower-demand period, I will use a recent_N strategy (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local mean and variance. This ensures we don't over-order based on the high summer historical data while protecting against the minor spikes seen in October.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Long T-shirt' (711053004) has entered a stable fall/winter regime. The most recent demand (Period 39) was 21 units, following a stable range between 35-63 units over the preceding five periods (P34-P38). The average demand for the last six periods (P34-P39) is approximately 39.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 41 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the move into mid-November, I expect demand to remain low and stable for this basic item. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this fall regime (average ~40), which aligns with the current seasonal expectation for a basic jersey top.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in mid-November: Mean demand for Periods 34-39 is 39.5 units/week, indicating a stable cold-weather baseline for this SKU.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The demand for product 711053004 (Long T-shirt) has entered a stable late-fall/early-winter regime. Recent demand samples (Periods 39 and 40) show a significant drop to 21 and 15 units, respectively, compared to the October average of ~44. This aligns with the transition to colder weather for a basic t-shirt SKU. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am selecting a recent_N window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend (P37-P40 average is approx 35 units). This will lower the base stock level while still providing safety stock for the observed volatility in the transition period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Mean demand decreased from ~44 (Oct) to ~18 (early Nov) for late-fall/winter cooling.

LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a late-fall/winter demand regime for this T-shirt SKU. Recent demand samples show a significant cooling compared to the summer peak: Period 39 (21), Period 40 (15), and Period 41 (32). This averages to approximately 22.7 units per week over the last three periods. The previous month (October) had an average demand of approximately 44 units. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower, early-winter baseline while remaining responsive to the recent slight uptick in Period 41. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). This is a long-sleeve/base-layer T-shirt product entering the winter season. Historical data and recent carry-over insights indicate a significant demand drop following the summer surge, followed by a stabilizing lower-demand regime in late autumn. Since Period 39 (early November), demand has averaged 24 units per week (21, 15, 32, 27). This represents a stable winter baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 12 units on-hand. Given the consistency of the last 4 periods (P39-P42), I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent low-demand regime, ensuring we don't over-order based on the high-volatility summer/fall data. Set L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Winter demand baseline confirmed (Periods 39-42): Mean demand stabilized at ~24 units/week, down from the October average of ~40. Lead time remains stable at 0.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019. The product is a long T-shirt, which is currently in a stable winter demand baseline regime. Since Period 39 (early November), demand has significantly cooled, with the last 5 periods (P39-P43) showing values of 21, 15, 32, 27, and 12 (mean = 21.4). This aligns with the 'Winter demand baseline' noted in the Carry-Over Insights. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent winter stabilized mean and variance, ensuring we maintain lean inventory levels to minimize holding costs while the demand is low.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019, which is deep into the winter season for this long T-shirt SKU. Historical demand analysis shows a stable winter baseline has been established since Period 39 (early November). Recent demand samples are: P39 (21), P40 (15), P41 (32), P42 (27), P43 (12), P44 (12). The mean demand over these last 6 periods is 19.83 units/week. While demand in late December may slightly increase due to holiday gifting or end-of-year clearance, there is no evidence yet of a significant surge compared to the summer/spring peaks. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 23 units, which is slightly above the recent mean. I will use recent_N=6 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this stable low-demand winter regime to avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the minor volatility seen in P41 and P42.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. We are in the final periods of the game (Period 46 of 47). This product is a long T-shirt, which has shown a stable low-demand regime since early November (Period 39). The mean demand for the last seven periods (P39-P45) is 18.7 units/week (21, 15, 32, 27, 12, 12, 20). Lead time is consistently 0. Given there are only two decisions left (Period 46 and 47), and current on-hand is 14, I will set parameters to cover the expected demand for the remaining duration while minimizing unnecessary holding costs. I use N=7 for recent_N to capture the stable winter baseline established since mid-November.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (Dec) remains stable: mean demand for Periods 39-45 is 18.7 units/week compared to the fall average of ~40.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, entering the depths of winter. The SKU (Long T-shirt) has shown a stable winter demand baseline since early November. Over the last 8 periods (Period 39 to 46), demand has averaged 19.37 units per week (min 12, max 32) with a standard deviation of approximately 6.5. This represents a significant and sustained drop from the fall average (~40) and summer peak (~150). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this stable winter regime and avoid being skewed by previous higher-demand seasons. This will maintain a lean inventory appropriate for the current low-demand environment while providing enough safety stock to cover the moderate weekly variance observed in December.
