Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 562245046 (Luna skinny RW jeans). The provided initial demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) show a clear upward trend: 96, 108, 122, 131, 140. Given this steady growth, using a simple global mean would underestimate current demand. The current demand mean over these 5 samples is 119.4, but the most recent observation is 140. I will prioritize recent data to capture this momentum. The promised lead time is 0, which means orders arrive during the same period they are placed. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the recent growth while maintaining some stability. Since there is no on-hand or in-transit inventory, the system needs to place an initial order immediately to cover the expected demand for Period 1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the item 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Trousers) had a promised lead time of 0, which was met (ordered 135, arrived 135). Demand in Period 1 was 155, exceeding our order and leaving 0 on-hand. Looking at the history (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04), demand has been steadily increasing: 96, 108, 122, 131, 140. Period 1's demand of 155 confirms this upward trend. Since the current date is mid-February, we are likely seeing a pre-spring buildup for denim/everyday trousers. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent growth (131, 140, 155). The average of these is 142. Parameters for mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on this recent window to ensure we cover the rising demand profile and avoid further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend confirmed: Demand increased from average ~110 in early Jan to 155 in mid-Feb (+40% growth).

Daily Reward (R_t): $612.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's 5-pocket jeans SKU. Historical demand shows a consistent upward trend: early Jan (96-131), early Feb (140), and late Feb (155, 193). Period 2 saw a significant jump to 193 units, leading to a stockout for the second consecutive period despite ordering 153 units. The stockouts occur because demand (155 and 193) exceeds the inventory arriving in the same period. Since the promised lead time (L=0) is consistently being met, I will maintain L=0. To address the accelerating demand and stop the cycle of lost sales (stockouts), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the recent high-volume trend (avg of ~163 over the last 3 samples, but the most recent is 193). Given the clear upward momentum and the low profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I need a more aggressive stock level to capture growth. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 220 to account for potential further growth in the 'Womens Everyday Collection' moving into March, ensuring we cover the expected demand + safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Demand rose from 140 (Feb 4) to 193 (Feb 18), a 38% increase in 2 weeks. Stockouts occurred in both P1 and P2 due to underestimating this growth.

Daily Reward (R_t): $792.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's 5-pocket jeans staple. Historical demand shows a strong upward trend: 96 (Jan 7) to 207 (Feb 25). Recent demand values for Period 1, 2, and 3 were 155, 193, and 207 respectively. Despite a brief slowdown in growth between P2 and P3 (7% growth vs 24% previously), the overall trend is aggressively positive. We have experienced stockouts in P1 and P2 because the base stock level was too low. The current on-hand inventory is 36 units. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and capture the full demand while acknowledging the current holding of 36 units, I will use a 3-week average (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime (~185 units/period). This setting ensures the base stock calculation (which targets a service level of ~80% given profit $4 vs holding cost $1) is grounded in the most recent high-volume data.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued slightly at 207 units (P3) after rapid growth, but remains in a high-demand regime (>180 units/period) compared to Jan baseline (~110). Lead time consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $832.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Luna skinny RW jeans' is experiencing a significant demand surge as we enter March 2019. Historical demand has accelerated from ~110 (January) to 155 (P1), 193 (P2), 207 (P3), and finally 257 (P4). This represents a 65% increase over the last four weeks. Despite ordering 243 units in P3 and 172 in P4 (plus 36 units of safety stock carryover), we stocked out in P4, losing 49 units of potential sales (Demand 257 - Starting On-Hand 208). The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and capture the full sales volume of this high-growth 'Womens Everyday Collection' item, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (Avg: 219) and setting sigma_hat explicitly high (40) to account for increasing volatility during this growth phase. The service level target (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.80) translates to a z-score of ~0.84, which the OR engine will apply to our parameters.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-growth demand regime confirmed: Period 4 demand reached 257 units, a 24% increase from Period 3 (207). Demand has now increased for 4 consecutive periods, moving from a mean of ~110 in Jan to >250 in March.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1012.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans), showing a strong upward growth trend as we move into the spring season (mid-March). Historical demand has risen significantly: 155, 193, 207, 257, and recently 312 in Period 5. This represents a sustained growth regime. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts in four of the last five periods (P1, P2, P4, P5), meaning actual demand is likely higher than units sold. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0. Given the consistent acceleration, the mean of all samples is too low. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg of 207, 257, 312 = ~258.7). For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=3 to reflect the current variance. This strategy aims to increase the base stock level to satisfy the accelerating spring demand and prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Extreme demand growth confirmed; demand has increased for 5 consecutive periods (155 to 312), nearly doubling since February. Structural stockouts occurring due to rapid trend; shifting to recent 3-period averages for parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $877.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's denim item (Luna skinny jeans). Period 6 saw the first demand drop (from 312 down to 236) after five consecutive periods of growth. This suggests a potential stabilization or a post-peak correction as we move further into March. Despite the drop, demand remains significantly higher than the original January baseline (~110). On-hand inventory is currently 67. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To account for the recent demand volatility while acknowledging the break in the upward trend, I will use a 3-period window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent peak of 312 with the lower 236 to prevent over-ordering if the trend has indeed turned, while still maintaining high service levels for this profitable item.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend broke in Period 6: Demand decreased from 312 to 236 (-24%) after 5 periods of growth, suggesting a potential plateau or stabilization phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $753.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's denim trouser (Everyday Collection). Demand experience a significant growth phase through February and March, peaking at 312 in Period 5, but has since declined for two consecutive periods (Period 6: 236, Period 7: 211). This suggests the peak of a seasonal or trend cycle has passed and demand is stabilizing at a lower, though still substantial, level compared to the January baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while demand is trending downwards, I will shift from a 3-period average to a 4-period window for mu_hat to capture the recent deceleration, while keeping sigma_hat responsive to the high recent volatility. I am setting L to 0 based on consistent empirical data.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Following a peak of 312 in Period 5, demand has decreased for two consecutive periods (236, 211), indicating the rapid growth phase has ended and the product has entered a secondary, lower-volume plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1164.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Collection) is currently volatile. After a growth phase peaking at 312 and a two-week decline (236, 211), Period 8 saw a sharp rebound to 305 units. This suggests the product is not entering a lower-volume plateau, but is instead oscillating in a high-demand regime, likely driven by spring seasonality in April. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will prioritize recent history to capture this high-volume volatility, using a 3-period window to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent peak (305) against the preceding low (211) while providing enough buffer for potential stockouts, which have occurred in 5 out of 8 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in high-volume regime: After a brief decline, demand surged back to 305 units in Period 8, contradicting previous stabilization signals and suggesting seasonal spring activity.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans) is demonstrating high volatility within a higher demand regime. Current date is April 15. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) has been 312, 236, 211, 305, and 251. This averages to approximately 263 units per period. The recent volatility (305 vs 251) suggests that we should not over-react to a single period's drop. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 'conclude' messages. To balance the service level (0.8 critical ratio) against holding costs while accounting for recent fluctuations, I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the recent high-volume volatility (averaging ~250 units) while moving away from the extreme peak of 312 in P5.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in mid-April: Recent 4-period demand (P6-P9) suggests a stable but volatile cluster around 250 units, distinct from the initial growth phase.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Luna skinny RW jeans' shows a transition from high-growth in March back to a more volatile but slightly lower demand level in April. Period 10 (Apr 15) demand was 184, which is the lowest since early February and represents a 26% drop from Period 9 (251). Looking at the historical samples (Jan/Feb) and the game history, the weekly demand mean since Period 6 has fluctuated between 184 and 305 with an average of ~237. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the recent drop, I am shifting from a growth-oriented forecast to a more balanced 4-period window (P7-P10: 211, 305, 251, 184) to capture the current volatility without overreacting to the single low Period 10 data point. I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand entered a volatile stabilization phase in April: After peaking at 312 (P5), demand has fluctuated significantly between 184 and 305, averaging 237 over the last 5 weeks. The sharp drop to 184 in Period 10 confirms the end of the high-growth phase.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245046' (Womens Everyday Jeans) has entered a clear downward stabilization phase as we move into late April. Demand has decreased for three consecutive periods (251, 184, 177), moving from a volatile average of ~250 in early April to an average of ~180 over the last two weeks. This aligns with a post-Easter/Spring shopping cooldown. Historically, actual lead time remains 0. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), the backend needs to capture this lower mean to avoid building excessive safety stock. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to prioritize the most recent stabilization data (P8-P11) while still accounting for the volatility observed in early April (305 vs 177).

Carry-over insight: Post-Spring demand correction: Demand has dropped and stabilized at a lower mean of ~180 units (Periods 10-11) compared to the March/Early April average of ~250 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Everyday 5-pocket jeans) shows a stabilization in demand after the volatile Spring period. The current date is May 6. Historical demand for the last three periods (P10-P12) shows a cluster: 184, 177, 211 (mean = 190.7). This is a significant drop from the March/April peak of ~250-300 units, but higher than the initial January baseline. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend will aim for an 80th percentile service level. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture this lower but stabilized demand regime, and recent_N of 3 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility levels. Lead time L is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: May demand stabilization: Demand has settled into a new regime (avg ~191) following the Spring peak and April volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (May 6th) showed demand of 225, which is slightly above the recent May average of ~191. The SKU is a 'Luna skinny' trouser from the Women's Everyday collection, a staple item. Demand remains in a stabilization phase following the Spring peak, but a recent slight uptick (225) suggests we should maintain a robust buffer. Cumulative on-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we stocked out slightly in Period 13 (demand 225 vs sold 206). To set parameters for Period 14 (May 13), I am using a recent_N approach with N=4 to capture the stability of current May levels (recent demands: 184, 177, 211, 225). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for SKU 562245046 (Womens Everyday Jeans) has shown a decline in May, dropping from an average of ~200 in early May to 145 in the most recent period (P14). This suggests a transition from the volatile Spring peak into a potentially lower-volume early Summer regime. The current on-hand inventory is 74 units. Historical data indicates lead time is consistently 0. Given the recent drop, I will use a shorter window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the deceleration in demand (avg P11-P14 is 189.5 units), and a slightly longer window (N=6) for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed throughout April and May. This approach aims to reduce the risk of overstocking as demand cools down while maintaining enough buffer for the lingering volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration entering mid-May: Demand dropped to 145 in Period 14, marking a significant decrease from the previous 4-week average of ~200 units and signaling a potential seasonal shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 (Luna skinny jeans) is experiencing a significant downward demand trend as we approach the end of May. Demand has dropped from a stable average of ~195 (Periods 11-13) to 145 (Period 14) and most recently 82 (Period 15). This suggests a transition out of the Spring peak season into a lower Summer demand regime. My carry-over insight from Period 15 flagged initial deceleration; Period 15's actual demand of 82 confirms a sharp contraction. To avoid excessive holding costs (which are significant at $1/unit compared to $4 profit) and respond to this new low-demand environment, I am shortening the window for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to the most recent 3 periods (Periods 13, 14, 15: 225, 145, 82). This produces a mean of ~150 per lead cycle. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N=3 will allow the inventory target to drop quickly to match the observed decline.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand collapse confirmed in late May: Demand dropped from ~200 units to 82 units over 3 weeks, signaling the end of the Spring high-demand period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245046' (Luna skinny jeans) is experiencing a sharp seasonal decline as we enter June. Demand has collapsed from a mid-May level of 145 to 82 in P15 and 51 in P16. This follows the previously identified end of the Spring high-demand period. Current inventory (160 units) is roughly triple the most recent demand, creating a significant overstock risk given the $1.00 holding cost versus $4.00 profit. To prevent further accumulation of slow-moving inventory during this summer slump, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3: 145, 82, 51) to capture the rapid downward trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The goal is to allow the existing inventory to be consumed before placing significant new orders.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand collapse confirmed: Late May to early June demand has fallen from ~200 to 51 units (-75%), reflecting a significant seasonal shift for this denim product.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens 5-pocket denim) has completed its Spring high-demand phase and is currently in a significant seasonal decline as of early June. Demand has dropped from a peak of 312 down to 38 in Period 17. The last three periods (P15, P16, P17) show a clear downward trend: 82, 51, and 38 units respectively. This represents a confirmed seasonal shift where holding costs ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) now pose a significant risk if inventory is overstocked. Lead time is consistently 0. Current on-hand inventory (122 units) is significantly higher than the most recent demand (38). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand summer regime, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=3) to capture the current trough, which will allow the OR backend to draw down the existing stock before placing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor reached: Early June demand has stabilized at a low level (~40-50 units) following the seasonal peak, a 85% reduction from March highs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is entering mid-June, clearly past its Spring peak. Demand has collapsed from an average of ~200-250 units in April/May to a low-volume Summer regime. Recent demand over the last four weeks (Period 15-18) was 82, 51, 38, and 72. Although demand ticked up slightly to 72 in Period 18, it remains significantly below the annual average. The inventory on-hand (50) combined with the persistent 0-period lead time allows for responsive replenishments. Given the current low-demand stability, I will use a 4-period window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the recent floor (avg ~61) while accounting for the low-side volatility. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (skinny jeans) is in a low-demand summer phase. Following the dramatic collapse in May from ~200 units to <50 units, demand has stabilized over the last three weeks (P17-P19) at a mean of 61.3 units (38, 72, 74). The previous strategy of ordering 0 units successfully cleared excess inventory from the spring peak, reducing on-hand from 160 to 4. Current lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this new low-volume summer 'floor' and stabilize inventory levels against the current demand of approximately 60-75 units per week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (skinny jeans) is in a stable Summer demand floor. Current date is July 1st. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has stabilized at a low level with values of 51, 38, 72, 74, and 69, resulting in a mean of 60.8 units per period. This is a significant shift from the Spring peak of >250 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 10 units with 0 in-transit. To optimize for the current low-demand regime and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level (q = 0.8), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this summer plateau.

The product (skinny jeans) is currently in a stable low-demand summer phase. Period 21 date is 2019/7/8. Since the summer demand collapse noted in early June (Period 18), demand has found a floor and slightly stabilized over the last four periods (P18-P21 demand: 72, 74, 69, 88), averaging 75.75 units. Period 21 saw a slight uptick to 88, resulting in a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the stability around the ~75-80 unit mark, using a recent_N of 4 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this local 'summer floor' mean and variance while ignoring the much higher spring peaks. Profit/Holding cost ratio is 4:1 (Service level target 80%), which is appropriate for a steady collection item.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilized: Since Period 18 (June 10), demand has stayed within a 69-88 range (avg ~76), confirming a stable low-season floor for this category.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (washed superstretch denim) has broken out of its stable summer floor (~76 units) observed between Periods 18-21. Period 22's demand jumped to 114 units, a 30% increase from the previous high in the floor range, suggesting the start of a late-summer or back-to-school upward trend. Since the product previously saw massive spikes in February/March, I need to be reactive to this potential growth to avoid stockouts (inventory hit zero in Period 22). Lead time remains consistently 0. I will shift mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the recent upward movement (88, 114) while discarding the lower 60s-70s range.

Carry-over insight: Category rebound detected in Period 22: Demand rose to 114 units, breaking a 4-week stable floor of ~76 units. Potential start of late-summer/pre-fall seasonality.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245046' (denim jeans) is entering late July. Historical demand shows a stable summer floor of ~76 units followed by a sudden spike to 114 units (Period 22) and then a settling at 81 units (Period 23). This suggests the 'back-to-school' or late-summer transition has begun but is volatile. The previous carry-over insight (Period 23) noted a category rebound. To capture this rising trend while mitigating the risk of high holding costs if the spike was an anomaly, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P21-P23: 88, 114, 81), which averages approximately 94 units per period. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation allows the model to stay responsive to the suspected seasonal upswing without over-indexing on the very high spring demand levels.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 (Womens 5-pocket denim jeans) is currently in a late-July period. Historically, demand for this item saw a significant peak in March/April (~250-300 units), a sharp collapse in May, and a stable summer floor (~75 units). Period 22 showed a temporary spike to 114, but Periods 23 (81) and 24 (52) indicate that we are still in a low-demand regime. The drop to 52 in late July matches the early June lows. Given the product type, we expect a 'Back to School' or Fall rebound to begin in August, but current evidence shows demand is still fluctuating at the floor. I will set parameters based on the last 5 periods (including the spike and the subsequent drops) to capture the current average of ~80 units while maintaining enough safety stock to handle potential early August increases. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Looking at the product history, we saw a summer low-season (June/July) where demand stabilized around 76 units. In late July, we saw a fluctuations between 52 and 114 units. Period 25 (last period) demand was 99 units, following a lower 52. Historically, this SKUs category (jeans/denim) begins its 'Back-to-School' and Fall ramp-up in mid-to-late August. Although the most recent sample is 99, we should anticipate a structural increase as we head into August. The last 4 periods (P22-P25) have a mean of 86.5 units ((114+81+52+99)/4), which is higher than the June floor. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture this slight uptick while excluding the deep summer lows, and a recent_N of 6 for sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility observed in July (range 52-114). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for 'Luna skinny RW 5-pocket jeans' has shown a recovery from the summer floor (~76 units) towards a pre-fall rebound. Period 26 saw a jump to 137 units, following patterns in Period 22 (114) and Period 25 (99). This indicates a shift from steady low-summer demand to a more volatile, increasing trend likely associated with back-to-school or early fall shopping. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will prioritize the most recent 4 periods (P23-P26: 81, 52, 99, 137) to capture this rising variance and mean (avg ~92.25) while ensuring the system reacts to the recent spike to 137. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances the low periods in late July with the August upturn, preventing excessive holding costs while preparing for further growth.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall rebound confirmed: Demand increased to 137 in Period 26, following a volatile July. This suggests a transition out of the stable summer floor (~76) into a higher-volume seasonal regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans) has shown a significant rebound over the last three weeks, moving from 99 (P25) to 137 (P26) and now 183 (P27). This confirms the 'pre-fall rebound' noted in carry-over insights. The product is likely entering a high-demand seasonal period (Back-to-School/Autumn transition). We have experienced stockouts in both Period 26 and Period 27 because the ordering policy did not react fast enough to this sharp growth. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this acceleration and minimize lost sales during this upward trend, I am switching the demand forecast (mu_hat) to a 'recent_N' method with N=3. This focuses on the high-growth trajectory (avg of 99, 137, 183 is ~140, but the OR engine will use 1+L which is 1*avg). I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Autumn growth confirmed: Demand has increased from 52 to 183 over 4 periods (+250% increase), with the last two periods showing significant acceleration (137 to 183).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245046' (denim trousers) is currently experiencing a strong Autumn seasonal rebound. Demand has risen from a summer floor of ~76 units to 183 and 187 in the last two periods (P27, P28). This acceleration mirrors the growth seen in February/March. Current inventory is 0, and lead time has consistently been 0. Given the strong upward trend (Period 26: 137, Period 27: 183, Period 28: 187), using a recent 3-period window (average 169) would likely underestimate the coming week's demand. Therefore, I will use an explicit mu_hat forecast of 210 to account for continued seasonal momentum into late August/early September and set L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal growth plateauing/stabilizing around 180-190 units: Demand has held steady for the last two periods (183, 187) following a sharp climb from 137.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 (Womens Denim Jeans) is currently in its Autumn seasonal growth phase. After a rapid climb from 52 units (P24) to a peak of 187 units (P28), demand cooled slightly to 163 units in Period 29. The Carry-over Insights from previous periods (P3-P5) show this product is prone to volatile growth in transitional seasons. While the last period saw a small dip, the overall regime for August/September is significantly higher than the summer floor. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (covering Periods 25-29) to capture this higher mean (~134) while remaining cautious of the slight dip in P29. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for agile response to demand fluctuations. Given the high volatility in transitional periods (sigma_hat), I will use recent_N of 5 for sigma to ensure the safety stock covers current variance without over-ordering as we stabilize in the 160-190 range.

Carry-over insight: Autumn growth phase stabilization: After peaking at 187 (P28), demand dipped to 163 (P29), suggesting the initial rapid climb has settled into a high-volume Autumn regime (~160-190 units).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245046' (Luna skinny jeans) is exhibiting strong Autumn seasonal growth. In Period 30, demand surged to 300 units, significantly exceeding the previous 'plateau' estimate of ~180 units. This is a recurring pattern for this denim product, mirroring the Spring peak observed in Period 5 (312 units). We are currently in a stockout situation (ended P30 with 0 on-hand inventory). To capture this surge and prevent further lost sales, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to an explicit value of 300 units (based on the most recent P30 observation) to ensure the OR engine targets a high enough base stock for the current Autumn peak. This reflects a transition from a 'high-volume regime' to an 'active peak regime'. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Period 30 demand reached 300 units, matching the Spring seasonal peak (312) and significantly exceeding the late-August average of ~178.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 is experiencing a strong Autumn seasonal surge, similar to its Spring peak. Demand has spiked significantly over the last two periods (300 in P30, 349 in P31), far exceeding the August average of ~178. This reflects the transition into high-volume denim sales in September. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the rapid acceleration and the goal to capture this peak demand without significant stockouts, I am shifting mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this new, higher-demand regime (averaging ~270 units). This approach allows the OR backend to adjust to the current spike while providing a safety buffer for the volatility observed in previous peak seasons.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Autumn peak confirmed: Demand has surged to >300 units in consecutive periods (P30: 300, P31: 349), matching the Spring peak and confirming a high-volume seasonal regime for September.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (skinny jeans) is currently in a sustained Autumn peak, with demand exceeding 300 units for the third consecutive period (P30: 300, P31: 349, P32: 354). This matches the seasonal behavior observed during the Spring peak. Average demand over the last 3 periods is 334 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Given the lead time remains 0, I must set mu_hat to cover this high-volume regime. I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture this specific peak intensity while maintaining responsiveness to the high volatility observed in September.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified in mid-September: Demand has exceeded 300 units for three consecutive weeks (P30-P32), averaging 334 units, which is a 85% increase over the August average (~180).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 demand spiked to 709 units, more than double the previous 3-week average of ~334. This likely represents a massive seasonal peak (e.g., late September fashion launch or pay-day surge). Given that we stocked out in 4 of the last 5 periods (P30, P31, P32, P33), the 'order up to' level has been consistently too low to capture the actual peak demand for these superstretch skinny jeans. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to account for the rapid escalation from ~300 to >700, and N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in this transition. This will set a base stock that significantly exceeds the previous 350-unit cap to attempt to meet this high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Extreme Autumn peak confirmed: Period 33 demand reached 709 units, more than double the previous 3-week average (~334), indicating a massive seasonal surge.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October (Period 35). Historically, it experienced a massive demand surge in late September, peaking at 709 units (P33), followed by a pullback to 448 units (P34). This suggests the peak of the Autumn season has passed, but demand remains significantly higher than the August baseline (~180). We are likely in a high-volume Autumn plateau. Demand over the last four periods (P31-P34) was 349, 354, 709, and 448 (average ~465). However, the extreme outlier of 709 skewing the mean might lead to overstocking if the trend is cooling. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new regime while providing enough coverage for potential October volatility. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to reflect the high volatility observed in P33 and ensure a sufficient safety stock. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed to have transitioned to a high-volume plateau: Following the P33 surge of 709 units, demand settled at 448 units in P34, establishing a new high-volume regime significantly above the August average.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 (Womens Jeans) is currently in a high-demand Autumn regime. After the extreme peak in Period 33 (709 units), demand has stabilized over the last two periods (448 and 375 units). This confirms that while the absolute peak has passed, the product remains in a high-volume plateau significantly above the August baseline (~180 units) and comparable to the Spring peak (~312 units). Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (4:1), it is critical to prevent stockouts while demand remains elevated. I will use a 3-period average (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture this current high-volume regime (averaging approx 510 units over p33-p35) and a slightly wider window for sigma_hat (recent_N=5) to account for the extreme volatility observed during the September surge. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-volume plateau confirmed: Following the 709-unit spike, demand has settled into a 375-450 unit range, which is roughly double the late-August volume.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October (Period 37). Historically, demand for denim ('Luna skinny RW') peaked in mid-September (709 units in P33) and has since trended downward through a high-volume plateau. Recent demand over the last three periods has softened: 375 (P35), and 293 (P36), down from the 400+ unit plateau. This indicates a move away from the Autumn peak toward a more stable late-Autumn/early-Winter regime. Current on-hand inventory is 346, which exceeds the most recent period's demand. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level for this profitable item, I am setting mu_hat based on the average of the last 3 periods (P34-P36: 448, 375, 293) to capture the cooling trend while remaining conservative enough for volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling from Autumn peak: Late September/October demand has dropped from 709 (P33) to 293 (P36), representing a -58% correction toward a lower-volume plateau.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Luna skinny jeans has passed its extreme Autumn peak (which peaked at 709 in P33) and is currently in a cooling/stabilization phase for late October. The last four periods (P34-P37) show demand trending downwards from the peak: 448, 375, 293, and 310. The average demand over these last four periods is approximately 356 units. With Period 38 starting late October (10/28), and seeing that the Spring cycle showed a significant drop in late May, I anticipate a continued cooling but relatively high baseline for everyday denim. Actual lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current post-peak regime while maintaining responsiveness to the slightly higher demand observed in P37 (310). This balances the risk of overstocking during a cool-down with the need to meet a still-substantial demand floor.

Carry-over insight: Post-Autumn peak cooling: Demand has stabilized into a 290-310 unit range in late October (P36-37) after declining from the September peak (~709).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245046 (womens jeans) is currently in a high-demand Autumn/Winter phase. In Period 38, demand spiked to 482 units, significantly higher than the previous two-week stabilization range of 290-310. This indicates renewed volatility or a secondary peak as we enter November. Current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, meaning we must order to cover both current and immediate future demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for the recent spike while acknowledging the volatile nature of the current regime, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the average of the last month (approx 390 units per period), which balances the 482 spike against the ~300 stabilized level. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to capture this increased volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for the high-volume season.

Carry-over insight: Secondary Autumn demand spike detected: Period 38 demand reached 482, breaking the late-October stabilization range of 290-310 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11) shows demand returning to the 280-310 unit range (P39 demand: 284) after the sudden P38 spike of 482 units. This confirms that while the Autumn season remains active, it is highly volatile. The current on-hand inventory is 154 units. With a promised and actual lead time of 0 periods, I need to set base stock levels to cover the immediate period's demand. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture the current high-but-fluctuating demand regime (averaging ~345 units over P36-P39) rather than the long-term history. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to reflect the high volatility observed (variance between 284 and 482) ensuring we maintain a high service level for this high-margin ($4 vs $1 cost) item during the active November shopping season.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Autumn volatility: Demand in November has returned to the 280-310 unit range (P39: 284) after a sharp P38 spike, confirming a volatile high-volume state.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245046' (Luna skinny jeans) is currently in a high-volume, volatile late-Autumn/November regime. Demand in the most recent period (P40) was 288 units, consistent with the 280-310 unit range identified in Period 40's carry-over (excluding the P38 spike). This suggests a stabilization around a mean of ~290. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently realized in history. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatile-but-stable cluster (P37-P40: 310, 482, 284, 288), which yields a mean of 341. This slightly higher mu_hat accounts for the P38 outlier volatility to ensure adequate service levels while maintaining protection against stockouts observed frequently in this product's lifecycle. L is set to default as arrivals are same-period.

Carry-over insight: November demand stabilization confirmed: Period 40 demand (288) aligns with the 280-310 unit range observed in P36, P37, and P39, indicating a stable high-volume late-Autumn regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a stable, high-volume late-Autumn/early-Winter regime. Over the last six periods (P36-P41), demand has clustered tightly around a mean of ~290 units, with one notable outlier in P38 (482 units). Specifically, demand values were 293, 310, 482, 284, 288, and 281. Excluding the P38 spike, the last three periods are extremely consistent (284, 288, 281), averaging 284.3. Given the approach of the holiday season, maintenance of this high-volume inventory level is necessary. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilization while accounting for recent consistent volume, I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat (covering the post-peak stabilization phase) and recent_N of 6 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility introduced by the P38 spike, ensuring sufficient safety stock for potential late-year surges.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Date: 2019/11/25), demand spiked significantly to 999 units, far exceeding the stable November range of ~280 units. This is a clear outlier indicative of 'Black Friday' or early December holiday shopping surges, consistent with the product being a 'Womens Everyday Collection' denim item. Because this spike is likely a temporary seasonal event, using a long-term average would be too slow, and 'recent_N' would over-react if the surge is purely event-driven. However, historical data shows a previous extreme peak in October (709 units), suggesting this SKU is prone to high-volume seasonal spikes. To protect against continued holiday demand while acknowledging the current stockout (on-hand is 0), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 (P40-P42) to capture the trend change, which averages (288+281+999)/3 = 522.6. Lead time (L) remains 0 as it has been consistent throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 999 units, a 250% increase over the stable November average (~280), signaling the start of the December peak shopping season.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2), demand reached 922 units, following the massive surge to 999 units in Period 42. This confirms we are in the peak holiday shopping weeks for this SKU (Womens Everyday Collection denim). The current date is 2019/12/09 (Period 44), which is typically another peak week for holiday retail before the late-month drop. Given that the last two periods averaged ~960 units and the lead time remains 0, I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for sustained peak holiday demand. Last period (P43) we stocked out slightly (870 sold vs 922 demand) with zero ending inventory. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1000 to ensure we capture the full demand of this peak week, and 'recent_N' with N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (from ~280 to ~960) introduced by the holiday regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak sustained: Period 43 demand (922) confirms a high-volume regime (>900 units/week) for the first two weeks of December, significantly higher than the November baseline (~280).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Dec 9), demand plummeted to 210 units from over 900 units in the previous two weeks (999, 922). This cliff-edge drop suggests that the pre-Christmas/Holiday peak shopping period for this SKU has concluded sharply, or shifted to order fulfillment that isn't reflected in this week's demand. With 1,122 units on hand and a holding cost of $1.0 vs. a profit of $4.0, the cost of overstocking is high. Given the lead time is 0, I can afford to let inventory bleed down. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 210 to match the most recent observation, as the seasonal peak has clearly ended. This will prevent the OR engine from ordering more until the current excess inventory is consumed by this new, lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand collapse: Period 44 demand dropped from >900 units to 210 units (-77%), signaling the immediate end of the December peak season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a post-holiday collapse phase. Following the December peak (demand > 900 in P42-43), demand plummeted by ~77% to 210 in P44 and has remained low at 245 in P45. This matches the seasonal pattern seen in Spring (Period 15-16), where demand crashed immediately after a peak. We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), which is historically a period of lower activity or transition after the pre-holiday surge. With 877 units on-hand and an estimated demand regime of ~220-250 units, the current inventory provides approximately 4 periods of coverage. Since the promised lead time remains 0 and actual lead time has consistently been 0, there is no need for additional orders. For the OR backend, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 3 periods (P43-P45) to capture the sharp downturn and higher volatility during this transition, ensuring the base stock level remains below our current excessive on-hand stock to prevent further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand collapse confirmed: Demand dropped from a peak of >900 units/week (P42-43) to an average of ~227 units (P44-P45), a reduction of 75%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-7.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30). Demand has sharply declined following the December holiday peak (P42=999, P43=922) to a much lower post-holiday regime. The last three periods (P44-P46) show demand of 210, 245, and 174, averaging approximately 210 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 703 units due to a large order placed during the peak (P44). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the current surplus and align with the lower demand regime, I will use a 3-period average for mu_hat (N=3) to focus on the post-holiday levels (approx 210). Given the high on-hand inventory (703), the OR backend (base stock policy) will likely result in zero or minimal orders until the inventory is depleted toward the new base stock level, which aligns with minimizing holding costs in a low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand regime established (late Dec): Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~210 units (P44-P46) following the >900 unit December peak.
