  "rationale": "Product 671852003 is a 'Gwen Jersey Top', a women's vest top. Given the date (February 11, 2019), we are approaching the Spring/Summer fashion season, where demand for lightweight tops and layering pieces typically increases. Historical data from Jan-Feb shows demand ranging between 18 and 46 units per week, with an average of roughly 35 units. The most recent week (Feb 4) saw 34 units. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive in the current period and be available for this period's demand. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately, I will target a stock level that accounts for the average demand (~35) plus a safety buffer for the high-end variance observed (up to 46). Ordering 50 units provides a sufficient buffer for Period 1 while keeping holding costs manageable, as I can adjust in Period 2 once the actual lead time is confirmed at the start of next week.",
