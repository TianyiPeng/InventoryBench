Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT'. The five historical demand samples (64, 36, 45, 52, 56) yield a mean of 50.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 10.6. Given the product is a basic jersey sweatshirt and we are in mid-February, we are likely entering a stable post-winter/early spring demand phase. There are no current in-transit orders or on-hand inventory. The promised lead time is 0. Since there is no evidence yet of lead time drift or lost shipments, I will use the 'default' calculation for Lead Time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (the full extent of available history) to capture the most relevant baseline demand while staying responsive to future shifts. This ensures the base stock calculation targets the optimal service level dictated by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 95%).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a Men's Jersey Basic sweatshirt. Looking at the demand history provided (64, 36, 45, 52, 56) and the demand from Period 1 (54), there is no evidence of a significant regime shift yet; demand remains stable around a mean of ~51. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time was 0), confirming the current actual lead time matches the promised lead time. I will use 0 for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available historical samples (N=6) to capture the baseline variance and mean. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers one period of demand (L+1=1) plus a safety buffer appropriate for the product's profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU is a Men's sweatshirt (685813002). Historical demand samples show a stable range (36-64 units). Observed demand in P1 and P2 was 54 and 68. The current ending inventory is 0, indicating high stockout risk. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for the first two orders. To set parameters, I'll use the mean of the available historical samples (64, 36, 45, 52, 56) plus recent periods (54, 68), which averages approximately 53.5 units. Given the sweatshirt category and late February timing, demand is likely to remain steady or slightly decrease as winter ends, but we need to recover from the stockout. I will set L=0 explicitly based on observation, and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand variance.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Petar Sweatshirt, which is a seasonal item (Spring transition). We are currently in early March (Period 4). The demand samples provided (starting 2019-01-07 through 2019-02-04) show values of 64, 36, 45, 52, 56 (mean: 50.6). The game history for Periods 1-3 shows demand of 54, 68, and 57 (mean: 59.7). There is a slight upward trend as we move into March, likely reflecting late-winter/early-spring sweatshirt demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods for P1-P3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the recent higher mean (~60 units/week) compared to the older January samples. Lead time (L) remains at the default (promised 0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $648.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a classic transitional garment. The current date is March 11, moving from late winter into early spring. Historical demand samples (64, 36, 45, 52, 56) and recent game history (54, 68, 57, 36) show a mean of approximately 52 units per week. The demand drop in Period 4 (36 units) may reflect a slight softening as spring approaches, but remains within the historical range. Promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed in P1-P4). Consequently, the actual lead time L=0 is stable. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the game history demand performance for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock reacts to the recent mean (approx 53.75) and volatility. With Profit=19 and Holding=1, the critical ratio q is 0.95, justifying a high service level.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18) context: This is a men's 'soft sweatshirt' (PETAR SWEATSHIRT). The demand data shows a clear regime shift after Period 3. For Periods 1-3, demand was high (avg ~60: 54, 68, 57). In Periods 4-5 (March), demand dropped significantly to 36 and 37 (avg 36.5). This aligns with seasonal transitions in late March where demand for heavier 'brushed inside' layers typically decreases. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (Periods 1-5) confirm lead_time=0 is consistent. Since the demand has shifted downwards over the last two weeks, I will use recent_N=2 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the new March regime (36.5 units/week) to avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs (currently at $1.0/unit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 4 (early March): Average weekly demand decreased from ~60 to ~37 units (-38%), likely due to seasonal warming affecting sweatshirt sales.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (March 25, 2019). The product is a sweatshirt, which is seeing a seasonal decline in demand as spring progresses. Historical demand has shifted: the early weeks (P1-P3) averaged ~60 units, while the recent 3 weeks (P4-P6) averaged ~34 units (36, 37, 28). Current on-hand inventory is 11 units. The promised lead time is 0, and all previous orders (P1-P5) have arrived within the same period (Lead Time = 0), confirming L=0 is stable. I will use the last 3 samples (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime (mean ~34) and avoid over-ordering higher-cost inventory as temperatures rise. This ensures we maintain a service level appropriate for the $19 profit margin while minimizing holding costs on a declining SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $658.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (April 1st) shows continued low demand consistent with the shift detected in Period 4. The product 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' is seasonally sensitive to warming weather. Since Period 4 (March 4th), demand has been 36, 37, 28, and 35, averaging 34 units per period. The on-hand inventory is very low (7 units) because the order in Period 6 was 0. Given the promised lead time of 0 periods, and historical lead times also being 0, setting L to default (0) is appropriate. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (calculated q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime (last 4 periods).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. We are managing the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a seasonal garment. Historical demand shows a significant shift starting around Period 4 (Early March), where demand dropped from an average of ~60 to ~37. However, Period 8 saw a sudden spike to 55 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 41, demand 55, ending on-hand 0). This spike might be a pre-Easter fluctuation or localized weather change, but it's risky to ignore. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 8 concluded periods. Since we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to restock immediately to cover Period 9 demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the post-shift average (periods 4-8), which includes the recent spike, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last two weeks.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15. The product is a sweatshirt, which typically sees declining demand as spring progresses. However, Period 8 saw a spike to 55 units, followed by a return to 34 units in Period 9. The current demand regime (Periods 4-9) has an average of approximately 37.5 units, significantly lower than the pre-March average of ~60 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all completed orders (P1-P5, P7-P9). On-hand inventory is 21 units with 0 in-transit. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the spring regime (avg ~37.5) andRecent_N=6 for sigma_hat (std ~8.8) to account for the Period 8 volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand while maintaining a buffer for the recent variability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a sweatshirt, which typically sees declining demand as warmer spring/summer weather arrives. Analysis of historical demand since the detected regime shift in Period 4 (early March) confirms an average weekly demand of approximately 35.6 units, compared to the earlier ~55 unit average. While Period 8 showed a spike to 55 units (likely related to pre-Easter shopping), the subsequent two periods (P9 and P10) have returned to the lower regime (34 and 24 units respectively). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To balance the high service level target (95% critical ratio) against the seasonal decline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (P4-P10) to capture the current low-demand regime behavior while accounting for the recent variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a seasonal item that typically sees lower demand as spring temperatures rise. Since the significant drop at Period 4 (early March), demand has fluctuated around a lower mean, though Period 8 showed a temporary spike. Excluding that outlier, recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged 32.3 units. Inventory is currently at 13 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent, stable demand regime (Periods 9-11) while excluding the Period 8 spike, which prevents over-ordering for a product that is entering its off-season. This setting helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost while acknowledging the inventory on hand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813002 is a soft sweatshirt, which typically sees declining demand as temperatures rise in spring (May/June). A regime shift was previously identified in P4, where demand dropped from ~60 to ~37. Recent data (P7-P12) shows an average demand of 37.0 units (35, 55, 34, 24, 39, 35), confirming this lower regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 10 units with 0 in-transit. I will use the recent 6 periods (since P7) to capture the current stable demand level and higher volatility observed in P8 (demand of 55). Setting N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure the base stock calculation reflects this current seasonal norm (approx 37 units/period) while accounting for the recent variability.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). The product is a sweatshirt, which typically experiences lower demand as temperatures rise in spring and summer. History shows a demand regime shift occurred around Period 4 (early March), where demand dropped from ~60 to ~37 units. Over the last 10 periods (P4-P13), the average demand has been approximately 34.7 units. Recent demand (P10-P13) has fluctuated between 24 and 39 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the post-March regime for mean demand calculation and the last 5 periods for sigma to reflect current volatility. This configuration helps the OR engine maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover the expected seasonal demand while minimizing holding costs as we move deeper into the warm season.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a sweatshirt, which is entering its seasonal off-peak period as weather warms. Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift that occurred around Period 4 (early March). Since Period 10, demand has consistently stayed in a lower range (averaging ~29 units per week: 24, 39, 35, 24, 25). The last two periods (Period 13 and 14) show very low demand (24 and 25 units), reinforcing the low-seasonal trend for this product category (sweatshirts in late spring). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (100% reliability in history). I will use a recent_N window of 5 periods to capture this stabilized low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will prevent over-ordering based on older, high-demand winter data while maintaining enough buffer for minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late spring (Period 10-14): average weekly demand further moderated to ~29 units, confirming the seasonal downturn for heavyweight jersey/sweatshirt products.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/27. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a warm garment that has entered a low-demand phase due to the approaching summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Period 15 conclusion shows demand dropping to 20 units, continuing the downward trend established since Period 10. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 28.6 units, while the peak winter demand was over 50. Given the consistent seasonal decline noted in the Carry-over Insights (latest regime ~29 units), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this lower volume and reduced volatility accurately. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every order from P1 to P15 arriving within the same period. Therefore, I will stick with the 'default' lead time of 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 22, which is nearly equal to the most recent demand (20), suggesting only a small replenishment order is needed to meet the base stock target for the (L+1) period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The SKU is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is a seasonal item experiencing declining demand as the weather warms. Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-3 averaged ~60 units, Period 4-9 averaged ~37 units, and the most recent periods (Period 10-16) have stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 27 units (24, 39, 35, 24, 25, 20, 20). The last three weeks specifically show demand at 25, 20, and 20 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with no missed or delayed shipments. To optimize inventory and avoid holding costs for this cooling category, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 periods (N=7) to reflect the localized 'summer' baseline. This will capture the recent stabilization between 20-30 units while maintaining a small buffer for the slightly higher variance seen in late April/early May.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is highly seasonal (spring/summer downturn). Current date is June 10 (Period 18). Historical data shows a clear downward shift in demand as temperatures rise: Period 1-3 averaged ~60 units, Period 4-9 averaged ~37 units, and the most recent periods (10-17) have stabilized around a mean of 26.6 units (24, 39, 35, 24, 25, 20, 20, 22). In the last 3 periods (15, 16, 17), demand has been very stable at 20, 20, and 22. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as promised. Given the consistent low-demand regime since late April, I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current seasonal floor (approx 27 units per period) and sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility in this low-demand state. On-hand inventory is 17 units with no in-transit, which is below the expected one-period demand (L+1), necessitating a small replenishment order to maintain service levels while minimizing holding costs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a sweatshirt, which is entering its seasonal off-peak period as temperatures rise during summer. Historical demand analysis shows a distinct drop-off from early spring levels (~50-60 units) to a stable summer regime starting around Period 15. Over the last 4 periods (Period 15-18), demand has been very consistent (20, 20, 22, 24), averaging 21.5 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this stable summer demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects current seasonal needs while minimizing excess holding costs during a low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (Period 15-18): Average weekly demand has stabilized at ~21.5 units, down from the spring average of ~29 units (-26%), reflecting minimum seasonal utility for sweatshirts in June.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late June (Period 20, 2019/6/24). The product is a sweatshirt, which is seasonally at its low point during the summer. Analysis of the most recent demand (Periods 15-19) shows levels of 20, 20, 22, 24, and 9. The average demand over these last 5 periods is 19 units, with the most recent observation (9 units) indicating a potential further softening as summer heat peaks. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (Period 1-19) confirm that actual lead time consistently equals 0. Pipeline inventory is currently 0, with 16 units on-hand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level. To reflect the current summer demand regime, I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=5 captures the recent stabilization and the latest drop, ensuring the order covers the expected low summer demand while maintaining enough safety stock for typical volatility in this segment.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813002 is a soft sweatshirt, currently in the peak of summer (July 1st). Carry-over insights and recent history (Periods 19-20) show a significant further drop in demand to ~9.5 units per week, which is lower than the previous summer average of ~21.5 units. This suggests we are in the deepest part of the seasonal trough for heavy apparel. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and the associated holding cost of $1/unit, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this new local demand regime. I will use the last 3 periods (average demand 14.3 units) to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining a small buffer for variance. sigma_hat is set to recent_N to reflect the lower volatility currently observed.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough confirmed (Period 19-20): Average weekly demand has dropped to ~10 units, down from the early-summer average of 21.5 units, representing the seasonal minimum for sweatshirt products.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a seasonally sensitive item that has reached its demand trough during the mid-summer period (July). Historical demand has systematically declined from ~60 units in February to ~10 units in the most recent periods (P19-P21). Period 21 demand was 11 units, following 10 and 9 units in the preceding weeks, confirming a very stable low-demand regime for July. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the system targets a high service level, but the absolute volume is low. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while demand is at its seasonal minimum, I will use a restricted window (recent_N=3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current 10-unit weekly average. This approach balances the need for high service levels with the reality of the observed seasonal minimum.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are dealing with 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a product with high seasonal sensitivity. Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward trend from ~60 units in February to ~10-17 units in July. Specifically, the last four periods (P19-P22) show demand of 9, 10, 11, and 17. The jump to 17 in Period 22 suggests a slight variation but remains within the mid-summer low-volume regime compared to spring levels. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. On-hand inventory is effectively depleted (1 unit). I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (P19-P22) to capture the current summer demand state (mean ~11.75). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the low volatility observed during this trough. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current seasonal minimum while maintaining a high service level due to the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (July 22) finds us in the peak of summer, traditionally the low season for the 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' (brushed inside jersey). Historically, demand since the start of July (Periods 21-23) has shown a slight uptick compared to the late June trough, averaging around 15 units per week (11, 17, 17 respectively), though still significantly lower than spring levels. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. We currently have 1 unit on-hand and 0 in-transit, needing to cover the upcoming period. Given the consistency of the zero lead time and the recent stabilizing demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for demand parameters to capture the current summer floor and the slight recent increase without being influenced by the higher spring/early summer data.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand floor confirmed: demand stabilized at an average of ~15 units (Periods 21-23) after a late June trough of ~10 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are at the end of July, typically the hottest part of summer, which serves as the seasonal floor for sweatshirt demand. Historical data from the last four periods (Periods 21-24) shows demand of 11, 17, 17, and 11, averaging 14 units per week. This aligns with the 'mid-summer demand floor' identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the stability of this low-demand regime, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current mean (~14) and standard deviation centered around this floor. This allows the OR backend to set a lean base stock, minimizing holding costs while units are slowly turning over during the off-season. On-hand inventory is currently 9, and the OR engine will calculate the necessary replenishment to meet this forecast.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26 (August 5th). Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal cycle for this sweatshirt SKU. We moved from a high-demand winter/early spring regime (~60 units) to a summer floor (~15 units). The demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 21-25) has been 11, 17, 17, 11, 16, averaging 14.4 units per week. This confirms the mid-summer demand floor described in the carry-over insights. As we are now in early August, we should remain at this baseline for a few more weeks before the back-to-school or autumn transition begins. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while avoiding excessive holding costs on a low-demand item, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) and allow sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility within that regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are analyzing a sweatshirt product, which typically hits its seasonal demand floor during the summer months (June-August). Recent demand has been highly stable, averaging ~14.67 units over the last 6 periods (P21-P26: 11, 17, 17, 11, 16, 15). There is no evidence of the fall seasonal increase starting yet, which usually occurs toward late August or September. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every successfully concluded order in the history. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current stable summer demand regime while ignoring the higher spring/winter values, ensuring a lean inventory position to minimize holding costs while the demand floor persists.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-August (2019-08-19). Historical data shows demand for this sweatshirt SKU reached a seasonal floor in June/July (averaging ~10-15 units) and has recently begun a slight upward trend as we approach late summer/early autumn (Period 25-27 demand: 16, 15, 18). While the sweatshirt is a 'Jersey Basic', its utility increases as temperatures drop. I expect demand to gradually return toward the spring regime (~25-30 units) over the coming weeks. For Period 28, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the recent slight increase in demand (mean ~15 units) while maintaining safety stock for the expected seasonal transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand recovery: Average weekly demand has increased from the mid-summer trough (~13 units in Periods 19-24) to ~16.3 units (Periods 25-27), signaling the start of the autumn seasonal build-up.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 28) reached 31 units, which is a significant jump from the previous 16.3 average and signals a clear onset of seasonal autumn demand for sweatshirts as we enter late August. Historically, February demand was in the 50-60 range. While one data point (31) isn't a full regime shift, waiting for 3 samples would lead to massive stockouts. I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) significantly to anticipate the return to autumn/winter volume. I'll use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the observed jump to 31 and the seasonal expectation of further increases, targeting a base stock that covers this growth. I've set L to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently been 0, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent increase in volatility as demand trends upward.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Autumn recovery acceleration detected; Period 28 demand (31) is the highest since early May, nearly double the mid-summer average of 16.3.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (Sept 2). The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a classic seasonal item. Historical data shows demand significantly increased to 31 in Period 28 (mid-August), marking the start of the autumn seasonal recovery. While Period 29 demand (recorded as 9) appears unusually low compared to that trend, it is likely a transient fluctuation rather than a reversal of the seasonal buildup. September typically sees a strong sustained increase in demand for sweatshirts as temperatures drop. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture both the recent volatility and the upward seasonal trend without overreacting to the single low data point in Period 29, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (covering the transition from late summer to autumn) and active volatility modeling for sigma_hat. This balances the 31 and 9 observations to provide a robust base stock that can absorb the expected autumn surge while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal recovery confirmed: Demand spike to 31 in Period 28 (mid-August) aligns with seasonal sweatshirt demand buildup; Period 29 (9 units) is treated as a high-variance fluctuation within an overall upward trend.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we saw a significant demand surge to 59 units, confirming the autumn seasonal recovery for sweatshirts (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) as we enter September. This aligns with the 'Autumn Seasonal Build-up' insight. The previous dip to 9 units in Period 29 is now clearly an outlier within an upward trend. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Given the high demand in Period 30 and the historical average from the previous autumn/spring peaks (which ranged from 35 to 60+), I will shift to a 'recent_N' strategy (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current upward momentum (average of 31, 9, 59 is ~33, but the most recent 59 is the strongest signal). I will use N=3 for sigma_hat as well to account for the recent high volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: Period 30 demand (59) and Period 28 (31) indicate a strong seasonal recovery as temperatures drop in September, returning to early spring demand levels (~35-60 units).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a sweatshirt, which is entering its peak autumn season as of mid-September (Period 32). Recent demand history shows a clear and rapid surge: Period 28 (31), Period 30 (59), and Period 31 (85). The demand of 85 in Period 31 exceeded the available inventory (stockout). To capture this accelerating seasonal trend, I am focusing on the most recent 4 periods (Periods 28-31) which cover the autumn ramp-up. The mean demand for these 4 periods is (31+9+59+85)/4 = 46. However, the last two observations (59, 85) suggest the mean is shifting higher. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat will calculate (1+0)*46 = 46, which is conservative given the last demand was 85. Given the high criticality of not stocking out during this growth phase (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), and the clear upward trend, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to compute base stock, allowing the OR engine's service-level logic to account for the volatility seen in the 9-85 range. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand acceleration confirmed: Demand reached 85 units in Period 31, surpassing the early spring peak (~68) and confirming a strong seasonal surge as temperatures drop in September.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1319.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the sweatshirt SKU (685813002) is in a strong autumn growth phase. Recent demand figures (P28: 31, P30: 59, P31: 85, P32: 71) confirm a significant shift from the summer floor of ~15 units to a high-demand autumn regime. While Period 32 (71) was slightly lower than Period 31 (85), it remains substantially higher than early spring peaks, indicating the seasonal surge is ongoing as we enter late September. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this shift while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) observed during seasonal transitions, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This covers the period from mid-August to mid-September (Periods 28-32), reflecting the current upward trend and increased variance. The backend OR logic will use these to calculate a base stock level that targets a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: Demand has averaged ~64 units over the last 3 periods (P30-P32), a 4x increase from the summer floor, confirming peak seasonality for sweatshirts in September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Petar Sweatshirt) is currently in its peak autumn seasonal surge. Demand in Period 33 reached 116 units, the highest recorded value to date, significantly exceeding the previous autumn average of ~64. Since the start of September (Period 30), demand has been 59, 85, 71, and 116. This upward trajectory suggests we are entering the core of the cooler weather season. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts (as seen in Period 33 where only 102 of 116 units were sold), I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the September surge (P30-P33) while allowing for further acceleration. The average of the last 4 periods is 82.75; mu_hat will use this basis to project demand for the next period, and sigma_hat will reflect the high variance observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak acceleration: Demand reached 116 units in Period 33, a significant increase over the early September average of ~64, confirming sustained high-volume seasonal demand for sweatshirts.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Petar Sweatshirt) is currently in its peak autumn seasonal demand phase. The date is October 7, and recent demand history shows a dramatic surge as expected for a sweatshirt product: P31 (85), P32 (71), P33 (116), and P34 (95). The average demand over these last 4 weeks is approximately 91.75 units, a massive increase from the summer floor of ~15 units. We observed stockouts in P31 and P33 despite high order quantities, indicating that volatility is high and the system needs to maintain a more aggressive stock level to capture this high-profit margin ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. For Period 35, I am setting mu_hat to 95 (explicitly based on the average of the last 4 surge periods) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this new high-demand regime, and using recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility without over-penalizing based on the low-variance summer data.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak plateau confirmed: Demand from P31-P34 suggests a consistent high-volume regime averaging ~92 units per week, up from the early September estimate of 64 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', currently in its peak autumn seasonal demand phase (October). Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) has been high: 85, 71, 116, 95, 69, averaging approximately 87 units per week. Although demand dropped to 69 in the most recent period (P35), this is consistent with high-variance peak seasonality. We are currently in mid-October, and demand for fleece-lined sweatshirts typically remains strong or increases until the pre-holiday plateau. I will use recent_N (N=5) for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture this recent high-volume regime while acknowledging the volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 58 units, so an order targeting the base stock derived from an ~87 unit/week mean will be generated to ensure availability for the next week.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand for the PETAR SWEATSHIRT has entered a post-peak autumn cooling phase after the September surge. Demand decreased from a high of 116 (P33) and 95 (P34) to 69 (P35) and 43 (P36). This aligns with the 'autumn peak plateau' mentioned in the Carry-over Insights beginning to subside as the initial seasonal buying surge for sweatshirts concludes. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 76 units on-hand with no in-transit. Given the rapid decline in recent demand (43 units last period), I will shift forecasting to use the most recent 3 periods (P34-P36) to avoid over-ordering based on the high September peak. The average demand of the last 3 periods is approx 69 units. Decreasing the window helps the OR backend react quickly to the downward trend and minimize holding costs as demand stabilizes into late autumn.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand has begun to subside: Weekly demand decreased from an average of ~92 units (P31-P34) to 56 units (P35-P36), a -39% reduction signaling the end of the initial seasonal surge.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The sweatshirt SKU is currently in the post-autumn peak phase (late October). Demand in Period 37 (87 units) spiked after two weeks of moderation (69 and 43 units), suggesting that while the initial late-September surge has passed, demand remains high and volatile as colder weather sets in. The average demand over the last three periods (P35-P37) is 66.3 units, which is significantly lower than the P31-P34 average of ~92 units, but still robust compared to summer lows. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the service level remains high (q=0.95). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this slightly moderated but volatile late-autumn regime, and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect the high local variance observed in the last three weeks (69, 43, 87). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in early November (Period 39). The 'Autumn peak' noted earlier has evolved into a high-volume steady state. Demand in the last two periods (P37: 87, P38: 88) is consistently high, suggesting the previous 'subside' reported in Period 37 was premature or a temporary dip (P36 saw 43). The current demand regime for late October averages ~87.5 units. Given the product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' with a 'Soft brushed inside', demand is likely to remain robust as winter approaches. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the last two periods of demand (N=2) to capture this stabilized high-volume level, and use a recent window for sigma_hat to account for the high variance seen throughout the autumn climb.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn Stabilized High-Volume: Demand has stabilized at a high level (~87.5 units/week) in late October (P37-P38), correcting the previous observation of a decline. This reflects sustained seasonal utility for cold-weather apparel.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a sweatshirt, currently in the peak late-autumn/early-winter season (November 11). Demand has stabilized at a high-volume plateau over the last 3 periods (P37-P39), with demand values of 87, 88, and 76, averaging 83.7 units. This confirms the late autumn regime identified in Period 39's insight. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach with N=3 to capture this stabilized high-volume demand while remaining responsive to any late-season shifts. This will set a base stock level that accounts for the current mean (~84) plus a safety buffer for volatility, ensuring high service levels during this profitable peak season while the $19/unit profit heavily outweighs the $1/unit holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn High-Volume Plateau (P37-P39): Demand has stabilized at a high level averaging ~84 units/week in late October and early November, confirming sustained seasonal demand for sweatshirts.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is in the peak of the autumn/winter sweatshirt season. Demand has stabilized at a high plateau over the last four periods (P37-P40), with observed demands of 87, 88, 76, and 73. The average demand during this recent regime is 81 units per week. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized high-volume plateau while discarding the earlier autumn surge and October dip, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected 81 units plus a safety buffer for the moderately high variance observed in this period (standard deviation ~7.6 units).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813002 (sweatshirt) has entered a stable late-autumn/early-winter demand plateau. Over the last five periods (P37-P41), demand has been very consistent, averaging 79.2 units per week (87, 88, 76, 73, 72) with relatively low variance compared to the September peak. As we move into late November (current date 2019/11/25), this high-volume regime is expected to persist due to cold weather, though we must watch for potential Black Friday spikes or December holiday shifts. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized plateau accurately. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustment. The current on-hand inventory is 22, and the parameters will guide the OR backend to top up stock to meet the expected 79.2 units plus a safety buffer for the high service level required (Profit $19/Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Early Winter plateau finalized: Demand has stabilized at an average of ~79 units/week (P37-P41), showing high consistency and lower volatility than the earlier autumn surge.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Nov 25) saw a massive demand spike to 212 units, coinciding with Black Friday week. This is a significant seasonal outlier compared to the previous stable average of ~79 units/week. Since sweatshirts are a cold-weather staple, this high demand may persist through the early December holiday shopping period, although likely at a level lower than the Black Friday peak but higher than the November plateau. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 6 periods to incorporate the late-autumn baseline (avg ~79) while factoring in the recent surge. I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to account for the heightened volatility observed during holiday promotional events. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday surge detected: Period 42 demand spiked to 212 units from a 79-unit average, indicating extreme holiday seasonality for sweatshirts.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday period (P44, Date: 2019/12/9). Period 42 saw a massive Black Friday surge (212 units), which has since normalized to a high winter level of 72 units in Period 43. Given the product is a men's sweatshirt, we are in the peak seasonal utility window. While the extreme BF surge is over, demand will likely remain elevated leading into the Christmas/New Year period compared to the pre-holiday plateau of ~79. On-hand inventory is 112. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To capture both the recent holiday volatility and the seasonal plateau, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7, covering the late autumn/winter period from P37 onwards) to average approximately 97 units/week. This avoids overreacting solely to the 212 spike while acknowledging that current demand is higher than summer levels. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for holiday-season variance.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand stabilization: Period 43 demand (72) suggests a return to the winter plateau (~75-80) following the extreme P42 holiday spike (212).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand in Period 44 was 105 units, which is higher than the previously established winter plateau of ~79 units but aligns with general pre-holiday shopping expectations for mid-December. The Black Friday spike (P42, 212 units) is behind us, and P43 (72 units) showed a temporary dip. Current demand (105) likely represents the mid-December seasonal peak for 'Top in soft sweatshirt fabric' as a gifting item. We should expect elevated demand for the next 1-2 periods before a post-Christmas drop. On-hand inventory is 77 units with no in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this elevated late-December demand. Using recent_N with N=3 captures the post-Black Friday behavior (72, 105) and includes the high period, which averages 88.5 per period. Since L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*88.5. This allows the backend to order up to a base stock that covers This period's likely high demand of ~100+ units, minimizing stockout risk while acknowledging we are near the end of the game (P47).

Carry-over insight: Mid-December demand surge: Period 44 demand (105) indicates a secondary seasonal peak following the late-autumn plateau, likely driven by holiday gifting.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late December (Period 46, Dec 23). Historical demand shows a mid-to-late December surge (P44: 105, P45: 112) following the Black Friday peak (P42: 212). This sweatshirt product is in its peak seasonal utility. Based on the pattern observed after Black Friday, demand has risen again for the holiday gift-giving season. For Period 46 (Christmas week), I expect demand to remain elevated but likely start tapering off immediately following the holiday. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this December high-volume regime (P42-P45 average is ~125), which provides a safe buffer for the final holiday rush. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0. The OR backend will use these values to manage the current on-hand inventory of 139 units against the expected holiday demand.

Carry-over insight: Mid-December holiday surge confirmed: Demand has averaged ~108 units over P44-P45, representing a secondary seasonal peak after Black Friday.

Daily Reward (R_t): $695.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019 (Period 47). Historical demand shows a post-holiday drop in Period 46 (demand 46), following a mid-December peak (avg ~108). This is consistent with a transition out of the peak gifting season and into the winter plateau. On-hand inventory is currently high (179 units) due to aggressive ordering in Period 45/46. To prevent excessive holding costs as demand naturally moderates in January, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend change from the holiday peak (~100+) to a more sustainable winter level (estimated ~60-80). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand decline: Period 46 demand (46 units) indicates the conclusion of the December gifting peak and a return toward pre-holiday winter levels (~79 units/week).
