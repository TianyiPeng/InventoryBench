Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a range of 88 to 154 units, with an average of 120.4 units. The most recent observation (117) aligns with this average. Promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now arrive within this period and are available for Period 1 demand. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To cover Period 1 demand and maintain a small buffer for Period 2 (given lead time is 0 but we want to avoid stockouts if demand spikes), I will target the historical average plus a small safety margin.

Starting on-hand is 74, but after Period 6 demand is subtracted, ending inventory will likely be around 10-20.

In late May/June, demand for knitwear is expected to reach its lowest seasonal levels before potential clearance or final stock-outs. I currently have 13 units on-hand. Given the downward trend and the seasonality of a sweater entering June, demand for Period 16 is forecasted around 10-12 units. With 13 units on-hand and an actual lead time consistently at 0 periods, I have sufficient stock to cover current demand without incurring excessive holding costs or risking a significant stock-out. Ordering 0 units allows the system to bleed off remaining inventory as the product reaches its seasonal end-of-life.",
