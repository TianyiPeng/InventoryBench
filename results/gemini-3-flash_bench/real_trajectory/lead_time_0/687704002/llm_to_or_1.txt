Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Ladies Denim 5-pocket super-skinny jeans'. Historical demand shows a sharp ramp-up: 0, 0, 26, 111, to 277 units in the most recent week (Feb 4). This indicates the product is exiting its launch/learning phase and entering a robust active sales regime. Given the product type (denim/basics) and the current date (post-winter, moving into Spring fashion), demand is expected to remain high or continue growing. Promised lead time is 0, meaning same-period arrival. To avoid a stockout immediately, I will use recent trends. Since there are only 5 historical samples and demand shifted significantly 3 periods ago, I will use N=3 to capture the active sales period (mean of 26, 111, 277 is approx 138). I will set explicit values to ensure we cover the current momentum of 277 units/period plus a buffer for growth.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a staple item (Ladies Denim). Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 0, 0, 26, 111, 277 (pre-game) and 266 in Period 1. This suggests the product is transitioning from a launch phase to a stable high-demand regime. Average demand over the last three active periods (P-2, P-1, P1) is (111+277+266)/3 = 218. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the current actual lead time is 0. I will use recent_N to capture this momentum while smoothing out the volatility observed in the launch. Since L=0, mu_hat becomes 1 * mean(last N). I will set N=3 for demand to focus on the high-volume levels seen in Feb.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim item (Super Skinny Ankle Jeans), which typically maintains relatively stable demand but shows significant early-season volume. Period 1 demand was 266, following a pre-game sample of 277, while Period 2 dipped to 158. The average demand across these last three significant observations (P1, P2, and the last pre-game sample) is approximately 233. Promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time has consistently been 0 for the first two periods. With on-hand inventory at 139 and 0 in-transit, I need to ensure the base stock covers the current period's expected demand. Given the fluctuation between ~270 and ~160, I will use a recent_N approach for demand to weigh the current active selling season more heavily than the zero-demand periods in January. N=3 captures the most relevant 'in-season' data (Feb 4, Feb 11, Feb 18).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a pair of ladies' super-skinny ankle jeans. Historical demand data shows a significant ramp-up in late January/early February (from 0 to 277). However, since the game started (Period 1-3), demand has been steadily declining: 266 (P1) -> 158 (P2) -> 115 (P3). This suggests the initial spike was a seasonal launch or promotion that is now cooling off. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0. With L=0, we need to cover the current period's demand (1+L=1). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the recent downward trend in demand (mean ~180) and adjust the stock levels accordingly to avoid overstocking and high holding costs, while still maintaining some safety stock for potential stabilized demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $339.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ladies Denim Super-Skinny Jeans', a staple fashion item. Historically (pre-game), demand was increasing (26, 111, 277). In-game demand stabilized: Period 1 (266), Period 2 (158), Period 3 (115), Period 4 (117). This indicates a post-launch taper or seasonal stabilization. The promised lead time is 0, and all four in-game periods have confirmed an actual lead time of 0. Inventory management is efficient with 'just-in-time' arrivals. I will use a 3-period window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 130 units/period) while moving away from the high initial burst of 266. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent lower volatility (158, 115, 117) compared to the initial high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 130 units/week following an initial launch spike in Period 1; Lead time confirmed as 0 periods over 4 consecutive observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $294.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704002 (Ladies Denim) is in a post-launch phase. Historical demand shows a downward trend: 266 (P1), 158 (P2), 115 (P3), 117 (P4), and 89 (P5). The last three weeks have stabilized somewhat, averaging 107 units/week. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory (62) is below the recent average weekly demand, an order is necessary to maintain service levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P3-P5) and avoid over-ordering based on the high P1/P2 launch volumes. For lead time, 'default' is appropriate as 0 periods is both the promised and observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand forecast: The last 3 periods (P3-P5) show a lower demand regime averaging 107 units/week, compared to the initial launch average of 212 units/week (P1-P2).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product (Ladies Super-Skinny Denim) has transitioned from an initial high-demand launch phase (P1-P2, avg ~212) to a lower, stabilized regime (P3-P6, avg ~104). The last four periods show demand values of 115, 117, 89, and 96. To capture this stabilization while acknowledging the slight downward drift in the last two periods, I am setting N=4 for mu_hat to use the full 'stable' window. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods for 6 consecutive orders, confirming it remains at the promised level. The chosen parameters use recent_N=4 to avoid the distorting effect of the Period 1 launch spike, allowing the OR engine to set a base stock that balances the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost without overstocking based on obsolete launch data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: P3-P6 average is 104 units/week with low volatility (std ~13), significantly down from early stage launch peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $429.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 begins on April 1st, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear two-stage pattern: an initial launch spike (P1-P2 average: 212) followed by a stabilized regime. Over the last five periods (P3-P7), demand has stabilized with an average of 105.2 units and low volatility (std \u2248 12). Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods across all 7 historical periods. Current on-hand inventory is very low (7 units) with no units in transit. To prevent a stockout while avoiding excess holding costs for this basic denim item, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the stable demand regime (P3-P7). This ensures the OR engine calculates base stock based on the current run rate rather than the launch peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized over P3-P7: average 105 units/week with low volatility (std ~12). Initial launch period (P1-P2) demand averaging 200+ is no longer representative.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704002 (Ladies Denim) experienced a stockout in Period 8, selling all 116 available units against a demand of 137. The demand regime has shifted slightly upward over the last three weeks (96, 109, 137), averaging 114 units compared to the previous stable period average of ~100. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains confirmed through Period 8. To recover from the stockout and meet the slightly rising demand, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the recent upward trend. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility observed during this shift. L remains at the default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Last 3 periods average 114 units/week, up from the previous corridor of ~100 units/week. Periodic stockout occurred in Period 8 due to demand (137) exceeding inventory (116).

Daily Reward (R_t): $353.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a staple item (Super-skinny jeans) with a promised lead time of 0. History confirms actual lead time consistently equals 0. Demand shifted from a launch peak (P1: 266, P2: 158) to a stable regime. Over the last 7 periods (P3-P9), demand has averaged 108.6 units/week. While P8 saw a peak of 137 leading to a stockout, P9 demand returned to 97. The current on-hand inventory is 35 units. I will use a recent window (N=7) to capture the current post-launch demand level while excluding the initial outliers. This ensures the base stock (approx. (1+L)*mu + safety stock) accounts for the current mean and observed volatility to avoid further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704002 is a staple item (Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W jeans) whose demand has settled after a launch peak in Feb 2019. The last 8 periods (P3-P10) show a consolidated demand regime averaging 106.1 units/week (115, 117, 89, 96, 109, 137, 97, 87) after the initial P1-P2 launch spikes. Period 10's demand of 87 units is slightly lower than the recent 3-period average, suggesting a return to the long-term stable level of ~100-110 units. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all 10 historical records. I will set L to 0 using the calculate method. For mu_hat, I will use a window of N=8 to capture the stable post-launch demand regime (P3-P10) while ignoring the unrepresentative initial spikes. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to reflect the typical volatility of this stable period, ensuring the OR engine maintains sufficient safety stock to prevent a repeat of the Period 8 stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized over P3-P10: average 106 units/week; actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704002 (Ladies Denim) is in Period 12 (late April). Historically, demand for this item spiked during launch (P1-P2) but has since settled into a stable regime. From P3 to P11, the average demand is approximately 101.6 units per week. However, the last three periods (P9-P11) show a slight downward trend (97, 87, 67), with an average of 83.7 units. The Lead Time has been consistently confirmed as 0 periods across all 11 previous cycles. On-hand inventory is currently 54 units. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs for stable demand, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the stabilized regime since Period 3, which averages ~102 units. Given the recent dip, recent_N=9 provides a balanced buffer (mu_hat ~ 102, sigma_hat ~ 20) against current on-hand levels.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and the product is a staple item (Ladies Skinny Ankle Jeans). Demand history from Period 3 onwards (P3-P12) shows a stable regime, moving away from the high-demand launch phase (P1-P2). Specifically, the average demand over the last 10 periods (P3-P12) is approximately 101 units/week, while the most recent 4 periods (P9-P12) show a slight variation around 86 units/week. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend targets a service level of 80%; setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable post-launch era (N=10) provides a robust estimate for this balance. Lead time (L) is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), which is correctly observed in all 12 prior periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704002 has shown a decreasing trend in recent weeks, particularly with the latest observation of 47 units in Period 13. While earlier periods (P3-P11) averaged approximately 105 units/week, the average of the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has dropped to 78.4 units/week. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid holding excess inventory during this apparent slowdown while still maintaining a reasonable service level, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=5 (capturing the recent trend since the Period 8 stockout) and calculating sigma_hat over the same window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean demand has decreased to approx. 78 units/week over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), down from the previous stabilization level of ~105 units/week.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704002 is currently in Period 15. Historical demand analysis shows a distinct downward shift starting around Period 11. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), demand has averaged 70.75 units (67, 94, 47, 75), which is significantly lower than the previous regime (~105 units). The date (Late May) suggests we are moving past the early spring peak for denim. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, on-hand inventory is 22 units. To prevent stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=4 to capture this lower demand regime and moderate volatility. The level (L) remains at default (promised 0) as it is well-supported by history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level (~71 units/week) over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), confirming the shift noted in Period 14.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for this SKU has shown several distinct regimes. After a launch peak (P1-P2) and a mid-term stabilization (~105 units/week), demand has shifted downward over the last 5 periods (P11-P15). The demand values for the last 5 periods are 67, 94, 47, 75, and 56, resulting in a mean of 67.8 units/week. This lower regime appears sustained, likely reflecting a post-peak lifecycle phase for this denim product. The lead time has remained exceptionally stable at 0 periods throughout the entire history. To reflect this current lower demand level and minimize holding costs while capturing the remaining sales, I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation. This balances the recent volatility (range 47-94) with the confirmed lower average. Lead time (L) remains set to default, as 0-period arrival is consistently observed.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 687704002 shows a sustained decrease compared to earlier periods. Since Period 13, weekly demand has been: 47, 75, 56, and 48 units. The average for these last 4 periods is approximately 57 units/week, marking a notable drop from the ~71-78 units/week observed in the previous regime (P11-P14). Current on-hand inventory is 36 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (standard deviation of the last 4 periods is ~12.5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent stabilized demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level (~57 units/week) over the last 4 periods (P13-P16), continuing the downward trend from earlier months.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704002 (Ladies Denim) is in a clear downward demand trend. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has averaged 54.6 units per week (47, 75, 56, 48, 47), a significant decrease from the early April average of over 100 units. The current date is June 10th. Historically, the 'promised' lead time is 0, and this has been consistently confirmed by 17 consecutive observations of 'ordered on Period N, lead_time was 0 periods'. There are no missing shipments (in-transit is 0). Given the consistent downward trend and stabilization near 50 units/week, I will use a recent window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower regime and prevent over-ordering as the product's popularity wanes or seasonality shifts into summer. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: P13-P17 average demand has fallen to ~55 units/week, marking a persistent decline from the P9-P13 average of ~78 units/week.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704002 (Ladies Super Skinny High Waist Denim) is in a clear downward trend. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), demand has been: 47, 75, 56, 48, 47, 39. The most recent three periods (P16-P18) show a stabilization around a lower mean of ~45 units/week. As we are moving further into June, this product (specifically 'super-skinny ankle-length jeans') may be seeing reduced demand in favor of lighter summer apparel. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in a declining market, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to focus on the last 5 periods (P14-P18) where the mean is ~53 units/week. This balances the slightly higher demand in P14/P15 with the very low recent demand in P18.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline continues: P14-P18 mean is ~53 units/week, down from the P9-P13 mean of ~78 units/week. Most recent 3 periods (P16-P18) average ~45 units/week.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704002 continues a steady and significant decline. Current demand averages for recent windows are: P14-P19 (6 periods) = 49.83 units/week; P17-P19 (3 periods) = 39.7 units/week. The most recent period (P19) demand was 33 units. Given this consistent downward trend from the previous regime of ~105 and subsequent ~78, I am choosing N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=6 captures the shift while providing enough data to mitigate volatility. The lead time remains firmly at 0 periods, confirmed over 19 consecutive conclusions.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline is sustained and accelerating: P14-P19 average is 50 units/week, with the most recent 3 periods (P17-P19) dropping further to 40 units/week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704002 (Ladies Denim) is in a significant downward trend. In the last three periods (P18-P20), demand has dropped sequentially: 39, 33, and 20 units. The mean demand for the most recent 3 periods is 30.67 units/week, which is much lower than the previous regime (P14-P17) of ~56 units/week. Since it's now July, interest in 'Skinny Ankle' denim likely faces seasonal pressure or lifecycle exhaustion. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs in a declining market, I will use a very recent window (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current low-demand environment. This will lower the base stock level to match the observed 30-40 units/week range.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline is accelerateing at Period 21: The P18-P20 average has reached 31 units/week, a 40% reduction from the P14-P17 average of 52 units/week.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704002 (Ladies Denim) is in a sustained and accelerating demand decline. Period 21 demand was 27 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P19-P21) is 26.6 units, while the average over the last five periods (P17-P21) is 33.2 units. Given the clear downward trend documented in the carry-over insights (declining from ~100 to ~30 units), a 'recent_N' approach is used. I am setting N=3 to capture the most recent, lower demand levels (average ~27). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. With 16 units currently on hand and no in-transit units, the OR engine will place a small order to reach the base stock level calculated from this lower demand regime, thus minimizing holding costs as the product life cycle winds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline is confirmed as reaching a new floor: P19-P21 average is 27 units/week, down from the P14-P19 average of 50 units/week.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 687704002 shows a significant and sustained downward trend, moving from an average of ~100 units/week to a low of approximately 27-31 units/week in the most recent periods. However, Period 22 observed a slight uptick in demand (39 units), which resulted in a stockout (ending on-hand 0). To account for this volatility at the new floor and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 (covering P19-P22) to capture the current mean of 29.75 units. I will set sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility seen during this stabilization phase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand has found a new floor, averaging ~30 units/week over the last 4 periods (P19-P22), following a long-term decline from the initial >100 units/week regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704002' (Ladies Denim) is in a sustained long-term decline. Current date is July 22, 2019. Demand has shifted from a stabilized regime of ~105 units early on to a recent floor of approximately 30 units/week. Over the last 5 periods (P19-P23), demand has been 33, 20, 27, 39, and 24, averaging 28.6 units/week. While Period 22 saw a slight spike to 39, the overall trend remains low. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current low-demand volatility while being responsive to the slight variance (std ~7). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed over many cycles.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704002 continues a long-term decline, reaching a new low of 14 units in Period 24. Over the last 4 periods (P21-P24), demand has averaged 26 units/week (27, 39, 24, 14), with the most recent two periods showing a sharper drop (average 19 units/week). The product is a 'Super-Skinny Ankle Denim', and the current date is late July, suggesting we are entering a late-summer clearance or end-of-season phase where demand for this specific style may be bottoming out. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a declining product, I will use a restricted window (recent_N=4) to capture the current mean while allowing the sigma to buffer against the volatility seen in Period 22 (39 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand decline has accelerated into late July: P23-P24 average is 19 units/week, down from the P19-P22 average of ~30 units/week, possibly reflecting seasonal end-of-lifecycle for this denim style.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing high demand volatility during a long-term decline phase. In Period 25 (Late July), demand spiked to 43 units, causing a stockout (ending inventory 0) despite a trailing average of ~20 units. This suggests either a final end-of-season clearance peak or high localized volatility as the product phases out. Given that on-hand inventory is currently 0 and the actual lead time is consistently 0, I must order enough to cover the immediate demand of Period 26. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 (covering Periods 22-25) to capture the recent volatility and the average mean of ~30 units, while allowing the sigma calculation to account for the leap from 14 to 43 units in the last two weeks. This balances the risk of further stockouts against the high holding cost ($1) and declining trend.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed high volatility in the late-lifecycle stage; demand spiked to 43 in P25 after a low of 14 in P24, resulting in a stockout.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is exhibiting high volatility in its late-lifecycle stage. Demand has spiked significantly over the last two periods (43 and 54 units), leading to consecutive stockouts (ending on-hand = 0). This contrasts sharply with the average of ~20 units observed in July (P23-P24). Given the current stockout and the recent upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand behavior (avg \u2248 37 units/period). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders in the same period they were placed (P1-P20 and P22-P26). Parameters are set to ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this elevated demand level while acknowledging the increased variance (sigma_hat recent_N=3).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly in the late-lifecycle stage (August): after a floor of ~20 units in July, demand spiked to 43 (P25) and 54 (P26), causing consecutive stockouts.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant demand spike in August (Periods 25-27), with demand reaching 43, 54, and 74 units, far exceeding the July floor of ~20 units. This has resulted in three consecutive stockouts because replenishment parameters (based on recent history) were disconnected from this new trend. The current date (2019/8/19) suggests a late-summer surge or pre-fall transition. To address the repeated stockouts and capture this trend, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. The last 3 periods average 57 units, but the trend is strictly increasing (43 -> 54 -> 74). I will set mu_hat to 80 units for the next period (L=0, so 1+L=1) to provide better coverage against this volatility. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current high-volatility regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-August demand surge confirmed: Demand has increased from a July floor of ~20 units to 43 (P25), 54 (P26), and 74 (P27), indicating a significant upward trend and high volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant demand surge in August, following a summer low. This upward trend is likely driven by the 'Back-to-School' season, which typically boosts denim sales as students update their wardrobes for the new academic year. Demand in the last four periods has jumped from a low of 14 to an average of 57 (P25-P28), with a peak of 74. Although Period 28 saw a slight cooling (57 units), the overall momentum remains strong compared to the July floor of ~20 units. To prevent further stockouts (which occurred in P25, P26, and P27), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this higher-demand August regime while acknowledging the volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School seasonal surge confirmed: Demand in August (P25-P28) has tripled compared to July levels, averaging ~57 units/week vs ~20 units/week.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September (Period 30), following a significant Back-to-School demand surge in August. Historical demand from the last 5 periods (P25-P29: 43, 54, 74, 57, 44) shows a clear regime shift from the July floor (~20 units) to an average of 54.4 units/week. While demand reached a peak of 74 in Period 27, it has since moderated to 44 in Period 29, suggesting the initial seasonal peak is stabilizing but remains much higher than early summer levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this elevated August-September regime (~54 units/week) while remaining responsive to the recent deceleration. Sigma_hat is set with 'recent_N' (N=5) to account for the high volatility observed during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September (Period 31), following a significant Back-to-School surge in August. Demand in Period 30 (48 units) and Period 29 (44 units) suggests that while the extreme peak seen in Period 27 (74 units) has passed, the regime has found a new post-peak plateau around 45-55 units/week. This is much higher than the July floor of ~20 units. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high volatility observed in August (std dev is significant), I am using N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand after the peak (P27-P30 average is ~56 units), and N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen during the entire surge period. This strategy ensures enough stock for the current 40-50 unit demand level while protecting against the residual volatility of the late-summer season.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization: September demand is settling into a 45-50 units/week regime following the August Back-to-School peak of 74 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704002 is currently in a post-Back-to-School stabilization phase (September). After the August peak (which reached 74 units), demand in the last three periods (P29-P31) has been exceptionally stable at 44, 48, and 48 units respectively. This represents a new regime following the seasonal surge. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this stabilized demand level while remaining responsive to the current trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3. This N is chosen to focus specifically on the September stabilization (P29, P30, P31) and ignore the more volatile August peak data, ensuring the OR engine bases the base stock on the current 45-50 unit/week environment.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a post-peak stabilization phase following the August Back-to-School surge. Demand in September (P30-P32) has been very consistent, recording 48, 48, and 50 units respectively, averaging 48.7 units/week. This represents a stabilization after the high volatility of August. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand (50) slightly exceeding the total available (49) in Period 32. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level for this consistent demand regime, mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 3 to capture this tight 49-brand range, and sigma_hat is set using the same window to reflect the now-reduced volatility compared to the August peak.

Carry-over insight: September demand has stabilized: P30-P32 average is 49 units/week with near-zero variance, following the August Back-to-School peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September/early October. The demand in Period 33 jumped to 86 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization level of 49 units (P30-P32). This indicates a potential secondary seasonal peak or post-back-to-school volatility. Because current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are coming off a stockout, I need to raise parameters to capture this increased mean. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4: P30-P33) which averages 58 units/week, adjusting for the recent surge while smoothing the volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a higher volatility estimate (sigma_hat) using recent_N (N=5) to account for the jump from 50 to 86 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand surge detected in late September; Period 33 saw 86 units, breaking the previous 49 units/week stabilization. Monitoring for a sustained second peak or increased late-season volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early October (Period 35). Recent demand history shows a second significant peak following the August Back-to-School surge. Demand in Period 33 was 86 units and Period 34 was 81 units, representing a sustained jump from the September baseline of ~49 units. This suggests a secondary seasonal peak or a shift in the demand floor. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts (which occurred in P32, P33, and P34), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on the last 3 periods (P32-P34) which reflect this higher demand regime (average ~72 units). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=3 will allow the OR engine to react quickly to this heightened volatility and demand level while maintaining a 0-period lead time assumption.

Carry-over insight: Second seasonal demand surge confirmed in late September/early October: P33-P34 average demand is 83.5 units, significantly higher than the September stabilization level of 49 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in Period 36 (mid-October). Looking at the recent history, following an August 'Back-to-School' peak and a subsequent stabilization in September (average ~49), demand experienced a second surge in late September/early October (P33 and P34 demand was 86 and 81, respectively). However, Period 35 demand slowed significantly to 52 units. This suggests the second peak may be tapering off or moving into a new stabilization phase for mid-autumn. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the high P33-P34 surge while remaining responsive to the current trend, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 (P33-P35 average = 73 units), which captures the recent elevated levels but moderates for the P35 decline. Sigma_hat is set to 20 (explicit) to account for the high volatility observed between P34 (81) and P35 (52).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Late-season demand volatility remains high; demand dropped to 52 in P35 after a two-week surge (P33-P34 avg 83.5), suggesting the second autumn peak is receding.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volatility autumn regime. After the initial post-peak stabilization in September (~50 units/week), a second surge occurred in P33-P34 (avg 83.5), followed by a dip in P35 (52) and another spike in P36 (82). This bi-modal behavior suggests either a secondary seasonal peak or significant late-season volatility. Current inventory is critically low (8 units). Given the high demand in the most recent period and the trend of repeated surges, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P33-P36) average, which is 75.25, ensuring we have enough stock to handle another 80+ unit week. Sigma_hat is also set to reflect this recent high variance. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn volatility confirmed: Demand in P33-P36 alternates between highs (80+) and lows (~50), averaging 75 units/week, significantly higher than the early September stabilization level of 49 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing high autumn volatility with significant demand spikes. Period 37 saw a demand of 93 units, which again resulted in a stockout (sold 89, 0 remaining). Over the last five periods (P33-P37), demand has been 86, 81, 52, 82, and 93, resulting in four stockouts in five weeks. This indicates that the current ordering strategy is underestimating both the mean and the variance of this second seasonal peak. To prevent further lost sales during this high-demand window (late October), I am using an 'explicit' forecast. I estimate mean demand at 85 units per period to cover the recent upper range of observed demand, and I am increasing sigma_hat to 25 to account for the high volatility (swings between 52 and 93). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: P33-P37 average demand is 78.8 units with high volatility (std ~16), characterized by frequent stockouts when inventory is below 90.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are in the late autumn/early winter season. Historically, demand for these skinny jeans has been volatile since the August Back-to-School peak. A second autumn peak was observed (P33-P37) with demand reaching as high as 93 units. Period 38 saw a cooldown to 60 units. Given the high volatility (std ~16 in the recent peak regime) and the recent stockouts when starting inventory was below 90, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 6 periods (P33-P38) which is approx 75.7 units. This accounts for the higher autumn floor. Leading into November, we may expect continued elevated demand or early holiday effects. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I choose recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent high-volatility, higher-demand autumn regime while discounting the lower September and July periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Holiday demand regime (P33-P38): Average demand elevated to ~76 units/week (vs ~50 in early Sept) with high volatility (std ~16). Demand is sensitive to inventory levels below 90.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W' jeans are in an Autumn/Holiday demand regime (P33-P39) characterized by significant weekly fluctuations (86, 81, 52, 82, 93, 60, 51). The average demand over this 7-week period is approximately 72.1 units with a standard deviation of 16.7. Recent demand (P38-P39) has cooled slightly (60, 51) compared to the October peaks, but we must maintain a protective stock level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (recommending a 80% service level target). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the elevated demand level and high volatility of this late-season regime while giving weight to the most recent cooling, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to cover the entire Autumn window.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704002 has stabilized recently after the high volatility observed during the September/October autumn peak. Looking at the last three periods (P38-P40), demand has been 60, 51, and 49 units respectively, averaging 53.3 units/week. This suggests the aggressive 75+ units/week regime from the autumn peak is receding, likely shifting into a more stable pre-holiday or early winter phase. Given the current date is November 18, we must remain vigilant for Black Friday/Holiday surges, but the immediate trend is downward stabilization. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this most recent downward shift in mean demand and variance, as using a longer window (like N=8) would over-forecast based on the now-passed October peaks. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Post-autumn peak stabilization confirmed. Demand has settled to an average of ~53 units/week over the last 3 periods (P38-P40), down from the ~76 units/week average during the P33-P38 peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has stabilized following the autumn peak. Over the last four periods (P38-P41), demand has been 60, 51, 49, and 53, averaging 53.25 units/week. This confirms the post-peak stabilization level noted in Carry-over Insights (Period 41). Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. With only 6 units on hand and a stable demand regime, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this post-peak behavior while ignoring the older, higher-volume autumn data. Because the variance has also decreased significantly compared to the autumn surge, using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) will more accurately reflect current volatility and avoid overstocking costs.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked to 119 units, likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales, leading to a stockout. This follows a stabilization phase where demand averaged ~52 units (P38-P41). With lead_time remaining at 0 periods, I must ensure inventory is sufficient for the current period's demand (P43). Given the recent holiday volatility and the peak observed in P42, the target base stock needs to be elevated to prevent further stockouts while acknowledging that extreme late-November peaks often subside in early December before the Christmas rush. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the ~50-unit baseline to the ~120-unit peak (Average P38-P42 = 66.4), ensuring a responsive but balanced buffer.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand reached 119 units (+125% vs previous 4-week average), confirming seasonal volatility in late November.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019 (Period 44). We are in the post-Black Friday holiday season. Period 42 saw a major holiday spike (119 units), followed by a significant drop in Period 43 (39 units). Historically, this SKU (denim jeans) exhibits high volatility during the autumn/winter period with secondary peaks. The on-hand inventory is 53 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, we can adjust parameters each week to react to the holiday variance. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 6 periods (P38-P43), which captures the pre-spike, spike, and post-spike behavior (~58.5 units/week), while adjusting sigma_hat using the same window to account for the high volatility (std ~28). This conservative approach ensures we cover potential remaining December spikes without over-committing into the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Holiday volatility confirmed. P42 demand spike (119) followed by P43 drop (39) indicates high variance in late Q4; the last 6 periods (P38-P43) average 58.5 units/week with a high standard deviation (~28).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-December (2019/12/16), Period 45. Last period's demand (38) and the period before (39) suggest a significant retreat from the late November spike (Period 42 demand was 119). However, historical data and product category knowledge (Ladies Denim/Trousers) suggest that the pre-Christmas week often sees a final surge or increased volatility before the end-of-year clearance or post-January lull. Looking at recent performance, the last 4 periods (P41-P44) had demands of 53, 119, 39, and 38. This averages 62 units/week but with extreme volatility (std ~38). Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 75 units (slightly above the recent 4-week average) allows the OR engine to buffer for a potential final holiday surge while recognizing that the peak of 119 was likely an outlier. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a high sigma_hat (recent_N=4) to account for the massive variance seen in the last month, ensuring the base stock calculation prevents another stockout like the one in P42.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Post-holiday-spike demand has returned to a baseline of ~40 units (P43-P44), but high volatility remains a risk for the remaining December periods. P41-P44 average is 62 units/week with std ~38.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). We are in the post-holiday period. Historical data shows a major demand spike in late November (P42: 119 units), followed by a return to a lower baseline (P43-P45: 39, 38, 51 units). The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 43 units. Given the transition into the late December/January period, which often sees a seasonal dip in fashion retail after the Christmas peak, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this return to baseline while maintaining enough inventory to avoid stockouts if a late-December surge occurs. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility seen during the Q4 holiday shifts.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand return to baseline: P43-P45 average 43 units/week, significantly lower than the P42 spike (119 units).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Historical demand for the last four periods (P43-P46) has been relatively stable, averaging 48 units/week (39, 38, 51, 64) following the late-November holiday spike. This aligns with the 'post-holiday demand return' noted in the carry-over insights. As we enter the transitional period into early January, demand typically remains steady or slightly lower before any new styling launches. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this post-holiday stabilization (avg ~48, std ~12) while allowing the OR backend to maintain an appropriate service level based on the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.
