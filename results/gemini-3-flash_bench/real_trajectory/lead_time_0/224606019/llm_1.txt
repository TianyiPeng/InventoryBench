  "rationale": "Product Description: Flora hip belt (1), a women's narrow fashion belt. Historical demand (Jan-Early Feb) shows a mean of approximately 49.2 units per week (min 41, max 59). Today is Feb 11th. In many retail contexts, mid-February can see a slight uptick due to spring fashion transitions and Valentine's Day. Promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand for Period 1. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To satisfy the expected demand of ~50 units for the current period and maintain a small safety buffer against volatility (standard deviation of ~7), I will order 60 units. This covers the forecasted demand for Period 1 with minimal excess to control holding costs, which are equal to profit ($1.0). Since L=0, I am ordering to cover only the upcoming period's demand to minimize risk of high holding costs if demand fluctuates downward.",

  "rationale": "The product is a 'Flora hip belt' (Women's accessories). Historical data from January showed average demand around 49 units. However, since entering February, demand has surged significantly: Period 1 was 72 and Period 2 was 150. This surge likely relates to pre-spring fashion transitions or a 'Valentine's Day' retail push. I have stocked out in both Period 1 and Period 2 because demand far exceeded the quantities ordered (60 and 75). Looking at 'Period 1 conclude' and 'Period 2 conclude', the actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods (same-period arrival). This means any order I place now will arrive during this period's arrival phase. Given the 150 demand in Period 2 (where I sold only 75), I need to be more aggressive to avoid another stockout. I will target a stock level of 160 to capture the current high-demand momentum while acknowledging that holding costs are high ($1.0/unit), making overstocking risky if the trend reverses.",

Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. Currently, I have 82 units on-hand. March usually begins a shift toward spring fashion, which may support the higher demand levels seen in Feb. To target a stock level that covers a high-demand scenario (targeting ~130-150 units to mitigate stockouts like those in P1 and P2) while minimizing unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit is high), I will order a quantity that brings total available inventory to 150.

With 20 units currently on-hand and a confirmed same-period lead time (L=0), I need to order enough to cover the expected demand for the current period while maintaining a small safety buffer, as the inventory cost equals the profit margin.

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Flora hip belt', an accessory likely subject to seasonal fashion peaks. We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30), which is the end of the holiday peak observed in Periods 42-46 (demand: 135, 67, 80, 62, 61). Historically, these cyclical spikes last 3-4 periods before reverting to a lower baseline. Throughout 2019, post-peak baselines ranged from ~35 to ~45 units. Given that Period 46 demand (61) still shows some residual holiday volume and inventory is currently 0, I expect next week's demand (first week of January) to begin reverting toward the baseline. Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To maximize reward while minimizing holding costs for a potential lower-demand January, I will order 50 units. This covers a conservative estimate of the baseline (45-50 units) plus a small buffer, ensuring we satisfy demand without overstocking as the holiday surge concludes.",
  "carry_over_insight": "December holiday surge peaked in Period 42 (135 units) and has sustained through Period 46 (averaging 81 units over 5 weeks); historical patterns suggest a return to a ~40-unit baseline in January.",
