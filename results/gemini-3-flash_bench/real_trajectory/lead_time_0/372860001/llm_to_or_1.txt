Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 372860001 (Women's Fine-knit trainer socks). On-hand inventory is 0. Data shows 5 historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) with results of 231, 255, 302, 272, and 272. The mean demand is 266.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 26.6. Since the promised lead time is 0 and we have no shipment history yet to suggest otherwise, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=5) to capture the current demand regime. With Profit ($1) equal to Holding Cost ($1), the target cycle service level q = P/(P+H) is 0.50, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand for base stock. I'll use the 5 available samples to establish the baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The historical demand data (last 5 weeks) and the Period 1 observation show a stable demand regime with a mean of approximately 270 units (231, 255, 302, 272, 272, 287). The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks', a stable staple item. Period 1 showed a lead time of 0 periods (order placed and arrived in P1). However, Period 1 demand (287) exceeded the order/on-hand (267), resulting in 20 units of lost sales and 0 ending inventory. Since the promised lead time is 0 and the observed lead time was 0, I will stay with L=0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including Period 1's demand of 287 + the 5 historical samples) to capture the most recent demand mean and volatility. This should set a base stock level that covers the expected 270-290 units of demand for the upcoming period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Fine-knit trainer socks) is experiencing a massive demand surge. Historical demand was ~267/week, but Period 2 saw demand spike to 548 units. This aligns with late February/early March timing when seasonal transitions often drive sales of hosiery and socks. Currently, the system is stock-out (ending inventory 0 for two consecutive periods), resulting in significant lost sales because we are ordering roughly 270 units while demand is nearly double. The promised and actual lead time is 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat to rapidly catch up to the current demand regime (forecasting ~550 units) and set L to default (0). I'm increasing sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-18 (Period 2): demand jumped from ~270 to 548 (+103%), likely seasonal.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/3/4. Historical demand analysis shows a significant shift in Period 2 (2019/02/18) where demand spiked to 548, followed by 399 in Period 3. This is significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~270. Based on the product description (Women's trainer socks), this could be the start of a spring seasonal uplift. The previous 'Carry-over insight' correctly identified this jump. Looking at the last two periods (548 and 399), the mean is 473.5. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (confirmed in Periods 1, 2, and 3). Current on-hand is 151. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the recent high-demand regime while smoothing the volatility between the 548 peak and the 399 follow-up. Using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat ensures we account for the increased variance seen in this new regime, allowing the backend to maintain a safety stock appropriate for the higher volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $202.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Nightwear/Socks) experienced a massive demand spike in Period 2 (548 units), which has since stabilized but remains higher than the initial pre-February baseline. The last two periods (P3: 399, P4: 338) suggest a new mean around 370-400 units, significantly higher than the initial samples (~270). Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new regime (Periods 2, 3, and 4) while excluding the early lower-demand data. With a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, the service level target q is 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand. On-hand inventory is currently 136, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to meet the (1+0) period demand coverage.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike stabilization: Demand has settled into a new range (338-399) after the initial Feb 18 spike, confirming a sustained shift from the original ~270 baseline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Nightwear/Socks) experienced a significant demand spike in Period 2 (2019-02-18), followed by a moderate stabilization. Demand samples are now: [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] (Historical) and [287, 548, 399, 338, 252] (Game Periods). The latest demand of 252 suggests the seasonal peak has passed and demand is returning towards the initial baseline (272). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 2's value of 548 is an outlier compared to the more recent stabilization (399, 338, 252), I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand and sigma estimation to capture this cooling trend and prevent over-ordering. This balances the profit/holding cost (ratio 0.5) by tracking the current regime more closely than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend observed: post-spike demand decreased across three consecutive periods (399 -> 338 -> 252), approaching the original baseline of ~270.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a post-spike stabilization phase. After an initial demand spike in late February (Period 2), demand has fluctuated between 252 and 399 units. The most recent demand (Period 6) was 329 units, suggesting that while the initial cooling trend noted in Period 6 seemed to point toward the original baseline of ~270, the actual demand remains slightly higher than the pre-February average. All recorded cycles have shown an actual lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 1, in-transit: 0), so a sufficient restock is required. I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand forecasting to capture the post-spike mean (approx 330 units) while ignoring the extreme outlier of Period 2 (548 units) and the pre-spike baseline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (fine-knit trainer socks) is entering April, which typically sees rising demand for low-cut hosiery as weather warms. Recent history shows high volatility: demand jumped to 415 in Period 7 (from 329 previously), following a dip to 252 in Period 5. This suggests the 'cooling trend' noted in Period 6 was temporary, and we are entering a new higher-demand regime or a second spring spike. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent upward momentum while acknowledging historical variance, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (average ~332) to prioritize recent activity, and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods to account for the significant variability (range 252-415). Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock effectively equal to the lead-time demand forecast (mu_hat).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high; the cooling trend in Period 6 was reversed by a 26% increase in Period 7 (415 units), suggesting erratic early spring demand for trainer socks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is entering April, often associated with rising demand as weather warms. Historically, demand has been erratic: a massive spike in P2 (548), a cooling trend, and a recent resurgence to 415 and 382 units in P7 and P8 respectively. Current on-hand is 0, and we have sold out in the last two periods, indicating that demand likely exceeded supply (stockouts). The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high volatility and recent trend, I will use a recent_N method focusing on the last 4 periods (P5-P8) to capture the recent upward trajectory while smoothing the volatility. Specifically, the mean demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 345 units. With L=0, mu_hat needs to cover (1+0) periods. Using recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR engine to adapt to the recent demand level and variability, ensuring we mitigate stockouts as demand builds into spring.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand and stockouts in P7-P8: Demand averaged ~400 in the last two weeks, significantly higher than the P5-P6 cooling trend (avg ~290), indicating a mid-spring demand resurgence.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the demand for trainer socks remains in a high-demand regime, though it softened slightly from ~400 units in P7-P8 to 322 units in P9. The historical period-conclude messages confirm a lead time of 0 periods consistently. Since the onset of the spring demand shift (Period 2), demand has averaged 373 units per week (Samples: 548, 399, 338, 252, 329, 415, 382, 322). Given the extreme volatility (std ~84) and recent stockouts in P7 and P8, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 to capture this entire spring regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 373 units plus a safety buffer for the high variance, ensuring we recover from the low inventory state (on-hand 23) and avoid further lost sales as spring progresses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $242.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019-04-22), we are managing trainer socks, which are entering peak seasonal demand for late spring. Looking at the history, actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand has stabilized over the last 4 periods (P7-P10) with values of 415, 382, 322, and 308, averaging 356.75 units. This is significantly higher than the initial baseline (270) but lower than the volatile spike in P2. We recently saw two consecutive periods of 300+ demand following a stockout phase, suggesting a shift toward a steady spring demand level. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized demand level (approx 357 units), and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current moderate volatility. The OR engine will use these toward a base stock calculation with an implied service level of 50% (since Profit=1 and Holding=1), which is appropriate given the 0-period lead time and the need to avoid excessive holding costs while meeting demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: After a volatile spring surge, demand has stabilized over P7-P10 to an average of ~357 units (+32% vs baseline). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019, which is late spring/early summer. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a seasonal item that typically sees increased demand as weather warms. History shows a stabilization period (P7-P10) followed by a significant surge in Period 11 to 427 units (which caused a stockout). Over the last 5 periods (P7-P11), the demand average is 370.8 units with a standard deviation of 48.7. The stockout in P11 suggests we are entering a peak seasonal demand phase. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (1:1, implying a 50% service level target in the base stock formula), the OR engine needs slightly more aggressive parameters to prevent further stockouts during this warming period. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the mid-to-late spring demand level while allowing for the recent surge to influence the safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand phase (late April): Demand surged to 427 in P11, confirming that after the P7nd-P10 stabilization near 350, the seasonal trainer sock peak is continuing into early summer.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are in the middle of a high-demand seasonal peak for trainer socks. Demand in Period 11 (427) and Period 12 (438) has significantly increased from the previous Period 7-10 average of ~357. The ending inventory is 0, having sold out the last two periods, indicating that we are under-ordered for the current seasonal momentum. Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent upward trend and avoid stockouts during this early summer peak, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3. This focuses the forecast on the most recent shift (308, 427, 438) rather than the longer-term average. An N of 3 captures the significant uptick observed since late April. L is set to default as the promised 0-period lead time is reliable.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand peak confirmed: Period 11 and 12 demand averaged 432 units, a 21% increase over the previous four-week average of 357 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. This SKU (Fine-knit trainer socks) is a seasonal item prone to early summer demand fluctuations. Period 13 saw a sudden drop in demand to 267 units, following a high-demand phase in P11 and P12 (avg 432). This drop could be a short-term variation or a cooling trend after a seasonal peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Given the stockouts in P11 and P12 and the carry-over insight noting a summer peak, I will avoid overreacting to the single low-demand sample from Period 13. I'm choosing recent_N=4 for mean and variance to capture the late-April to mid-May transition (avg ~360) while smoothing out the volatility. With L=0, base stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z\u03c3\u0302. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning z=0 (base stock = \u03bc\u0302). My parameters are designed to maintain inventory levels that cover the recent average demand while providing a buffer against the high volatility observed in this category.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand decreased by 39% in P13 (267 units) vs P11-P12 average (432 units), indicating potential high-summer volatility or a cooling trend after the initial seasonal surge.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for fine-knit trainer socks has shown a clear cooling trend over the last two periods (P13: 267 units, P14: 275 units) compared to the early summer peak in P11-P12 (avg 432 units). This suggests the seasonal peak may have passed or stabilized at a lower level for the mid-summer period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (which equal profit at $1.0), I will use a recent_N method with N=4 to capture the recent cooling while still accounting for the possibility that demand remains above the original February baseline (~270). This balances the risk of stockouts if demand bounces back slightly against the cost of carrying inventory if the cooling trend continues.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Average demand over P13-P14 (271 units) is 37% lower than the P11-P12 peak (432 units), returning closer to the original baseline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that the 'early summer peak' for trainer socks seen in Periods 11-12 (avg ~432) has subsided. Demand in the most recent three periods (P13-P15) was 267, 275, and 348 respectively, averaging 297 units. This confirms the 'cooling trend' noted in Period 15, returning demand closer to the early spring baseline rather than the late spring surge. Inventory is extremely low (4 units on-hand), and since the lead time is consistently 0, I must order enough to cover this period's demand. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'post-peak' demand regime while remaining responsive to the slight uptick seen in Period 15 (348 units). Standard lead time remains 0.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. We are managing 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a seasonal product that typically sees high demand in late spring and early summer. Historical data indicates a significant peak in late April/early May (P11-P12 avg ~432), followed by a cooling period in mid-May (P13-P14 avg ~271). However, the last two periods (P15-P16) show a resurgence in demand (348 and 370 units respectively), suggesting a stabilized early summer demand regime higher than the mid-May dip. Period 16 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout (sold 297 vs demand 370), so we must increase the mu_hat to capture this higher demand level. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the most recent trend (P13-P16), which averages approximately 315 units, but since the trend is upward and we just stocked out at 370, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current 350-370 range to avoid further lost sales. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand resurgence in late May/early June: P15-P16 demand (avg 359) is 32% higher than the mid-May dip (avg 271), suggesting a new stabilized summer demand level.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which are in peak seasonal demand during early summer. Looking at recent history, demand in Period 15 and 16 was significantly higher (avg 359) than the mid-May dip (avg 271). While Period 17 saw a slight cooling to 297, the broader summer trend for this SKU has fluctuated between 300 and 430 units. We are currently in a stabilized summer regime. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has averaged 311 units, but excluding the sharp mid-May dip, the active summer average is closer to 340-360. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the shift from the May dip towards the June stabilization, which yields an expected demand of around 311 per period. Given the volatile nature of this SKU's seasonal demand (spiking up to 438 in P12), I will use the 'default' sigma_hat to ensure the backend considers the full historical volatility to protect against stockouts during potential mid-summer surges.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' has stabilized over the last four periods (P15-P18) with an average of 327 units (348, 370, 297, 294), compared to the more volatile early summer peak (P11-P12 avg ~432). As we are in mid-June, trainer sock demand is expected to remain firm but less erratic than the spring ramp-up. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. Inventory starts at 18 units. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4-period regime (N=4) to capture the current stable summer demand level (~327). This accommodates recent slight cooling while being prepared for potential summer spikes.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer stabilization: Demand has converged to an average of ~327 units over P15-P18, transitioning from the volatile late-spring peak (400+) to a more consistent summer level.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, entering mid-summer. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically experiences peak demand during spring and summer months. Recent performance (P15-P19) shows demand has stabilized into a range between ~294 and ~370, with an average of approximately 328 units. Period 19 ended with a stockout (sold 328 vs demand 334), indicating that demand remains resilient. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 0 periods across all 19 historical periods. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this current stable summer regime (averaging 328.6 units). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the current moderate volatility. Using L=0 reflects the proven same-period arrival mechanism.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically experiences peak demand during the spring and summer. Historical analysis shows a transition from a volatile spring (P7-P12, avg ~387) to a more stabilized summer regime (P15-P20, avg ~322). The lead time is consistently 0 periods. For Period 21, demand in the recent 4 periods (P17-P20) has been 297, 294, 334, and 289 (mean: 303.5). Given the proximity to July (high summer), I will use a recent window of N=6 (covering P15-P20) to capture the current summer stabilization level while accounting for recent variance. This balances the risk of stockouts (observed in P16 and P19) against holding costs, with a profit/holding cost ratio suggesting a 50% service level target (z*=0), which the OR backend will calculate based on these parameters.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for women's trainer socks has stabilized during the summer months. Over the last six periods (P16-P21), demand has averaged 317 units (370, 297, 294, 334, 289, 317). This indicates a consistent mid-summer regime. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (5 units), requiring a full replenishment to meet this period's demand. I will set L to 'default' (0) and use a recent_N of 6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized summer demand profile while managing the slight volatility seen in this period range.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is in a stable mid-summer demand phase. Demand has settled at a consistent level over the last four periods (P19-P22: 334, 289, 317, 313), averaging approximately 313 units. This period (P23, July 15) remains within the peak summer season for this product. The 'recent_N' method with N=4 is chosen for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stabilization while remaining responsive to potential late-summer volatility. Lead time is confirmed as a consistent 0 periods. The base stock policy will aim to cover current period demand with minimal holding cost, targeting a service level near 50% given that profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), but the OR backend's cap at 95% safety level will prevent excessive stockouts during minor fluctuations.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which are in their peak summer season. Demand has been highly stable over the last 9 periods (P15-P23), averaging 327.4 units with relatively low variance compared to the spring peaks. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P20-P23) have shown demand values of [289, 317, 313, 352], averaging 317.75. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach with N=9 to capture this summer stabilization phase (P15 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need for recent accuracy while maintaining enough data points (since P15) to account for slight weekly fluctuations. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and profit/holding costs are equal ($1.0), the OR backend will target a 50% service level which is appropriate for this stable but high-demand period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Historical data confirms the product (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a stable summer demand regime. Over the last 10 periods (P15 to P24), demand has averaged approximately 320 units, with a slight resurgence in mid-July followed by a dip in P24 (277 units). The carry-over insights correctly identified a mid-summer stabilization at ~327 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts seen in high-demand weeks against holding costs when demand dips, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=10 for mu_hat captures the entire summer stabilization period, providing a robust mean estimate (~320). Using N=10 for sigma_hat ensures the OR backend accounts for the observed volatility within this summer window.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, heading into late summer. Demand for trainer socks has shown a cooling trend over the last two periods (P24: 277, P25: 256) compared to the July average of ~315. This suggests the high-summer peak is tapering off. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture this downward shift (avg ~302) while maintaining enough stock to cover slight fluctuations, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), necessitating a balanced service level.

Carry-over insight: Late summer cooling trend: Demand decreased for two consecutive periods (avg 266 units) compared to the July average (~315), suggesting the seasonal peak for trainer socks is subsiding.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical demand analysis confirms a seasonal cooling trend for trainer socks as summer peaks subside. Over the last three periods (P24-P26), demand has averaged 263.7 units, significantly lower than the July (P21-P23) average of 327.3 units. This downward shift is consistent with the 'late summer cooling trend' insight. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this decline while maintaining service levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P22-P26), which captures the transition from the high-summer phase to the current lower demand level while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. This yields a base stock level that aligns with the current lower demand trajectory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are managing 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a seasonal item. Historically, demand for this SKU peaked in early summer (Period 11-12 avg ~432) and stabilized in mid-summer (Period 15-24 avg ~315). The latest data indicates a cooling trend as we transition into late summer/early autumn. Demand in the last two weeks (P26-P27) has averaged 279 units. Period 27 ending inventory is 0, having sold out. Given the downward seasonal trajectory, I will use a recent_N of 4 periods to capture the cooling trend while maintaining enough stock to cover the recent average demand and some volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all history.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which are highly seasonal, typically peaking in spring/early summer and declining as autumn approaches. Recent demand data confirms this cooling trend: Period 24-28 demand values are [277, 256, 258, 301, 294], averaging approximately 277 units. This is a significant step down from the June/July average of ~315-330. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this late-summer decline while maintaining service levels (profit and holding cost are equal, suggesting a target service level of 50%, but the OR engine's q-calc and capping logic provide a safety buffer), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the contemporary cooling trend (avg ~277). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand cooling confirmed: Period 24-28 demand averaged 277 units, a 15% decrease from the July average (~325), marking the end of the summer peak for trainer socks.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Historical demand for the '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks' shows a clear seasonal pattern: demand peaked in early summer (April\u2013June) and has been gradually cooling through August. In the most recent period (P29), demand dropped to 229, the lowest since early February. This confirms a cooling trend as we transition into early autumn, a period typically seeing lower demand for trainer socks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Based on the cooling signal in Period 29 (229 units) and the average of the last 5 periods (P25-P29 avg ~267), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the last 5 weeks) to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough stock for low-volatility baseline demand. This balancing act ensures we don't overstock as the season ends while maintaining a high service level for remaining customers.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn cooling trend: Demand in Period 29 (229 units) is the lowest observed since the start of the simulation, confirming that the trainer sock season is winding down. The average demand for P25-P29 (~267 units) is 18% lower than the July average.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for trainer socks is entering a clear autumn cooling phase. Period 30 demand was 274, while the average demand over the last six periods (P25-P30) is approximately 268 units. This is a significant drop from the July average of ~325. As we move further into September, demand is expected to remain at this lower baseline or continue to decrease. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking in a declining market, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this lower average demand (approx. 268) and volatility. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the OR backend will target a 50% service level for the base stock calculation.

The current date is September 23, 2019. The SKU is 'fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees lower demand as autumn progresses. Data from the last 8 periods (since late July) shows demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the summer peak. Specifically, demand in the last 4 periods (P29-P32) has been 229, 274, 254, and 248, averaging ~251 units. This is significantly lower than the July average of ~325 units and confirms the 'autumn cooling trend' noted in previous insights. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining a high service level for this lower-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the stabilized post-peak behavior (P25-P32), which reflects recent mean and volatility accurately for the transition into late September.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn regime: Demand has stabilized at an average of ~259 units over the last 8 periods (P25-P32), representing a 20% reduction from the summer peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/30 (Period 34). Demand in Period 33 was 405 units, a significant spike compared to the sustained autumn average of ~259 units (P25-P32). This spike is likely a late-season anomaly or a short-term promotional event, as 'Fine-knit trainer socks' typically see declining demand in autumn. Despite the stockout (sold 265/405), I will treat this as high volatility rather than a permanent regime shift, as the broader trend is downward. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the autumn baseline (P25-P33) while partially accounting for the recent spike in the mean and volatility calculations. This helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock for potential volatility without overreacting to a single late-season outlier.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand spike in Period 33 (405 units) disrupted the autumn cooling trend, but requires further evidence to confirm if it represents a sustained shift or a one-time outlier.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for fine-knit trainer socks shows a significant spike in Period 33 (405 units) and a continued relatively high demand in Period 34 (312 units) compared to the Autumn baseline of ~260. While the product is seasonal (trainer socks), these two periods suggest a possible late-season resurgence or clearance-style demand spike. The last two weeks (P33-P34) average 358.5 units. However, given the date (Oct 7), we should be cautious about over-committing to high inventory as winter approaches. I will use a balanced approach: L remains 0 (confirmed consistently in history). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the shift while providing some smoothing against the P33 outlier. This N=10 period (P25-P34) captures the cooling trend and the recent spike, averaging ~288 per period (forecast: 288 units). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to account for the increased volatility introduced by the P33 spike, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock without over-purchasing in a declining seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late September (P33-P34): Average demand surged to 358 units, a 38% increase over the P25-P32 autumn baseline (~259 units), potentially indicating a late-season clearance spike or atypical weather-driven demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand spike observed in Period 33 (405 units) appears to be an outlier rather then a sustain regime shift, as demand in Period 35 has returned to 266 units, which aligns with the autumn baseline established in P25-P32 (~259 units). Given the product (fine-knit trainer socks) and the date (mid-October), we are in a low-demand season. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the demand behavior since late August (Period 25), which balances the recent outlier with the overall cooling trend, providing a stable estimate for the current autumn environment.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn regime confirmed: Despite a one-week spike in P33, demand from P25-P35 has averaged 278 units, significantly lower than the summer average (~325), confirming the seasonal winding down for trainer socks.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Inventory is at 42 units with no in-transit. Demand for trainer socks is in a sustained autumn regime. Following the volatility observed in late September (P33: 405, P34: 312), the last two periods have stabilized (P35: 266, P36: 240). The Carry-Over Insight from P36 confirms the autumn average is approximately 278 units. Given the recent stabilization over the last 4 periods (averaging 305 specifically due to the P33-P34 volatility, but 253 over the last 2), a regime length (N) of 7 is chosen to capture the stabilization while acknowledging the recent spike. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Parameters are set to ensure the base stock covers one period (L=0) with enough buffer for recent volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand in the most recent period (P37) was 306 units, following a period of 240 units. As we are in late autumn for 'trainer socks', demand remains somewhat volatile but generally lower than the summer peak. Over the last 8 periods (P30-P37), demand has averaged approximately 282 units. Period 33 was an outlier (405), but the subsequent periods (P34-P37) have averaged 281 units, which is consistent with the autumn stable regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To balance the relatively high service requirement (profit = holding cost, so q = 0.5, but the system's cap provides safety) against recent volatility, I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the most current autumn trend (averaging 285 units) while filtering out the P33 spike. Setting L to default (0).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019 (Period 39). Demand for fine-knit trainer socks is in a stabilized autumn regime after a late-September volatility spike. Over the last 4 periods (P35-P38), demand has averaged 272 units, which is consistent with the post-summer baseline of ~278 units identified in Carry-over Insights. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=5 (P34-P38) to capture this stable autumn demand (avg ~272) while smoothing over the transition from the P33 outlier. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility levels. This approach provides sufficient base stock to meet demand while minimizing holding costs as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand is firmly stabilized: Average demand over P34-P38 is 272 units, confirming the end of the transient September volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a stable autumn demand regime for trainer socks. Period 39 demand was 241, and the average over the last five periods (P35-P39) is 265.8 units. The 'autumn stabilization' identified in the carry-over insights remains the dominant pattern. Lead time is consistently 0. I will continue using the recent_N method with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this stabilized late-season demand while remaining responsive to any minor end-of-season shifts. This balances the risk of stockouts against the cost of holding inventory as we approach the final weeks of the simulation.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is trainer socks, a seasonal product that is currently in a stable autumn regime (late November). Demand has been consistent over the last five periods (P36-P40), averaging 263 units. The most recent demand was 252 units. Observed lead time remains 0 periods as confirmed by P40's arrival message. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the core of the stabilized autumn period (P34-P40, avg ~270) which provides a more robust estimate than the very recent dip while still respecting the end-of-season cooling. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect current moderate volatility (stdev ~24) vs the higher historical average. This configuration ensures the base stock covers (0+1) units of demand, minimizing holding cost while maintaining a high service level for the remaining weeks of the season.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the late autumn/early winter period for trainer socks, which is traditionally a low-demand season. The last three periods (P39-P41) show a clear cooling trend with demands of 241, 252, and 210 (avg 234), which is significantly lower than the P34-P38 average of 272. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this immediate downward trend as we approach December. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set using the same recent window to reflect current volatility and prevent overstocking of seasonal items that are likely to see further declines in demand as weather gets colder.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn cooling confirmed: Demand in P39-P41 averaged 234 units, a 14% decrease from the previous stabilized autumn average of 272 units (P34-P38).

Daily Reward (R_t): $235.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked unexpectedly to 354 units, significantly higher than the previous 3-period average of 234 units (P39-P41). This spike resulted in 0 ending inventory. While the broader trend has been a late autumn cooling, this recent volatility suggests either a transient pre-holiday spike or increased late-season variance for trainer socks. Given that lead time remains stable at 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture both the low-demand baseline from early November and the recent 354-unit surge, allowing the OR backend to adjust for this increased uncertainty without overreacting to a single outlier.

Carry-over insight: Late November demand surge: Period 42 demand spiked to 354 units (+51% vs P39-P41 average), disrupting the established late autumn cooling trend.

This volatility suggests the product (fine-knit trainer socks) is experiencing irregular demand patterns as we enter the holiday season (December). The Period 42 spike may have been a Black Friday/Cyber Monday anomaly, and the current drop to 143 signals a potential cooling or return to the late autumn average of ~234. Given the extreme fluctuation (354 to 143), using the last 3 samples (P41-P43) provides a balanced mean of 235.6 units, which aligns well with the late autumn average. Setting L to 'calculate' (0) and using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will help the OR backend adjust to this recent volatility without overly reacting to the single low data point from P43, while maintaining safety stock for potential pre-Christmas activity. We have 122 units on hand, and no in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: December volatility: P42 spike (354) followed by P43 drop (143) indicates high late-season uncertainty for trainer socks.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (Dec 16), the demand for trainer socks (typically a seasonal product for warmer weather) is in its late-year phase. Recent demand has been erratic: a spike in P42 (354) followed by a deep drop in P43 (143) and a moderate value in P44 (209). This volatility is common during the December holiday season when shopper behavior shifts. Given the low on-hand inventory of 27 units and the 0-period lead time, I must set parameters that allow for a rapid response should demand stay around the 200-250 range. I'm using a recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the average of the late November/early December volatility (229 units per period). Sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the high standard deviation observed across those recent 4 weeks (calculated at approximately 89), ensuring the base stock level is robust enough to prevent stockouts if another spike occurs.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). Demand for trainer socks in December has shown extreme volatility: a spike to 354 (P42), followed by a crash to 143 (P43), and recent stabilization around 210-230 (P44-P45). Given the holiday season (Christmas/Boxing Day), demand may see a final end-of-year clearance spike or remain low as the season concludes. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize the most recent 4 periods (P42-P45) to set mu_hat, as this captures the recent winter volatility while slightly weighting towards the current stabilize-around-220 level. This results in a mu_hat of ~234 ((354+143+209+231)/4). I use the same N for sigma_hat to account for the high variance seen in this period.

Carry-over insight: December demand volatility: Period 42-45 showed extreme swings (range 143-354) with a four-week average of 234 units, indicating high end-of-year uncertainty for this SKU.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Dec 30, the final period. Demand for trainer socks has stabilized in late Dec following autumn/winter volatility. The demand in P45-P46 (231, 224) averaged 227.5 units, which is consistent with the late-season baseline and significantly lower than the late November spike. Given this is the final decision period and the goal is to maximize R_t = Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory, I must ensure service level for the upcoming week while strictly avoiding excess ending inventory that would incur holding costs with no future benefit. I will set mu_hat using the last 2 periods of stable demand (N=2) to reflect the current end-of-year pace, rather than the broader monthly volatility. I will use the default sigma_hat to account for recent variance. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.
