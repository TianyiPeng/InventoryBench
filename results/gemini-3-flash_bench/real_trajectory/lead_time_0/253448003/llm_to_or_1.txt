Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 253448003 (Push-up bra). The historical data shows 5 samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) with demand: 54, 38, 37, 54, 35. The mean is 43.6 and the standard deviation is approximately 9.32. The current date (Feb 11) is the week of Valentine's Day, which is a major sales event for lingerie. I expect a significant demand spike this week and potentially next. Promised lead time is 0. My goal is to set parameters that cover the expected Valentine's peak. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to account for this seasonal boost, setting it to roughly double the historical mean to ensure sufficient stock for the holiday rush (approx 85 units). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'explicit' to reflect higher volatility during a holiday period. L will remain at the default promised lead time of 0.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's push-up bra. In Period 1, we ordered 85 units with a promised lead time of 0, and the order arrived the same period (confirmed by Period 1 conclude: arrived=85, lead_time=0). Current on-hand inventory is 48. Historical demand samples (last 6 periods): 54, 38, 37, 54, 35, 37. The demand is relatively stable with no clear seasonal spike yet for mid-February. The average demand across all samples is approximately 42.5. Since the lead time is 0, the OR backend logic for base_stock targets (1+L) periods of demand, which is 1 period (42.5 units). Given Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should approximately equal the median/mean. I will use the 'default' method for lead time (0) and demand statistics (all 6 samples) to maintain a steady inventory level and avoid over-ordering, as holding costs are equal to profit margins.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/02/25. The product is a women's push-up bra. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show values: 54, 38, 37, 54, 35. In Period 1, demand was 37, and in Period 2, it spiked to 55, resulting in a stockout (sold 48 out of 55 demanded). The mean across all 7 available data points is approximately 44.1. Lead time for Period 1 was confirmed as 0. I will set L to 'default' (0). For demand estimation (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the recent spike, which helps the OR engine calculate a base stock covering the current period's expected demand. Since demand fluctuates between mid-30s and mid-50s, using a recent window is safer than the long-term average to recover from the stockout.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a push-up bra, which generally sees stable demand outside of major holidays or Valentine's Day (which just passed). Reviewing history, demand for the last three weeks has been 37, 55, and 55. We suffered stockouts in Period 2 and Period 3 because on-hand inventory was insufficient to cover demand. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data (P1 and P3) confirms actual lead time is indeed 0. However, because demand resolution occurs after the decision, we must ensure our base stock covers the current period's demand. Based on the 5 recorded samples (54, 38, 37, 54, 35) and recent performance (37, 55, 55), the mean demand is around 45-48 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the recent higher demand levels and avoid further stockouts, as the current on-hand inventory is 0.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a women's push-up bra. Historical demand samples (including the 5 pre-game samples and 4 game periods) show a relatively stable mean of approximately 44.2 units per week (samples: 54, 38, 37, 54, 35, 37, 55, 55, 37). The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, in Periods 2 and 3, the system ran out of stock (sold < demand), indicating that the previous order quantities were insufficient to cover the variability. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand (z=0). To prevent further stockouts and ensure we capture the demand peaks (which reach 54-55), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to include all available data points (pre-game + game) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will provide a more robust estimate of volatility than the shorter game history alone. lead_time (L) remains 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's push-up bra. Current date is March 18, 2019. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Historical demand samples (including pre-game and the first 5 game periods) are: 54, 38, 37, 54, 35, 37, 55, 55, 37, 30. The average demand across these 10 samples is approximately 43.1. There is no clear seasonal trend or regime shift evident in the first 5 game periods; demand fluctuates between 30 and 55. Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5 (profit / (profit + holding_cost)), meaning the base stock level should target the median demand. Since lead time L=0, we need to cover demand for the current period (L+1 = 1). I will use the average of all available samples (N=10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure a stable inventory level that avoids the stockouts seen in Periods 2 and 3.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, observing the 'OP Push Melbourne' bra. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in the same period they were ordered (P1, P3, P4, P5, and P6). Demand has been relatively stable with an average around 43 units across the last 6 periods (37, 55, 55, 37, 30, 43). There is currently 1 unit on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given L=0, the backend will target a base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. I will use the recent_N method with N=6 to capture the full recent history since the samples began, ensuring the OR engine has enough data to estimate mean and variance for the upcoming period correctly.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a women's push-up bra. Historical demand over the last 7 periods has been relatively stable, averaging 43.1 units per period, with a range of 30 to 55. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all 7 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Since the profit ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, effectively targeting the median of the demand distribution. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable demand regime while accounting for recent volatility (std dev ~9.3). L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 periods matches historical performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 253448003 (Women's Push-up Bra) had a significant demand spike in Period 8 (83 units, vs. a previous average of approx 43). This aligns with the transition into April, which often sees shifts in lingerie retail demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving same-period as confirmed by Period 1-8 history. I currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The OR backend uses a critical ratio (Profit/(Profit+Holding)) which is 0.5 for this item, implying the target base stock is the median demand. Due to the high stockout in Period 8 and the recent demand shift, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the elevated demand trend while capping sigma_hat using recent data to account for the increased volatility seen in the spike. This ensures the OR backend orders enough to satisfy the higher expected 'new normal' without over-penalizing for a single high outlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 8: demand increased from an average of ~43 units to 83 units (+93%), likely seasonal.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/15. We previously identified a demand spike in Period 8 (83 units), but Period 9 saw a return to lower levels (41 units). The average demand from Period 1 to 7 was approximately 43 units. The Carry-over insight suggested a significant regime shift, but given Period 9's drop, the demand is currently volatile rather than consistently doubled. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent volatility (avg ~56) and ensure we cover the risk seen in Period 8. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased variance. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, so the OR engine will aim to stock the median expected demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/22. Historically, for 253448003 (Women's Push-up Bra), we saw a major demand spike in Period 8 (83 units) followed by Period 10 (58 demand, with stockout limit). The Carry-over insight suggested a regime shift to ~83 units based on P8, but subsequent demand (41 in P9 and 58 in P10) indicates high volatility rather than a sustained 83-unit floor. However, we are frequently stocking out (Periods 2, 3, 7, 8, 10), indicating significant lost sales. Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level by default. To capture the current higher demand level and protect against stockouts, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=4) to calculate mu_hat, which averages the recent volatile period (demand: 83, 41, 58, and include the earlier 45 from P7). This N=4 window covers the period since the confirmed shift. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message to date.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The carry-over insight noted a demand regime shift starting in Period 8 (April 1). Looking at recent data: demand in Periods 8, 10, and 11 were 83 (capped by supply), 58 (capped by supply), and 64 (capped by supply) respectively, while Period 9 was 41. The product is a push-up bra, which often sees increased demand in spring. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there is 0 in-transit, meaning we are completely stocked out at the start of Period 12. Because demand has consistently hit or exceeded the inventory levels we ordered (selling 57/57 in P11, 57/57 in P10, and 44/44 in P8), we are under-forecasting. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat (Periods 8-11: avg ~61.5) and sigma_hat. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '253448003' (Push-up bra) is experiencing a sustained demand increase that likely aligns with a seasonal shift detected in Period 8. In the most recent 5 periods (P8-P12), demand has averaged 63.8 units, compared to the earlier average of ~43 units. The current inventory is at 0 with no units in transit, and the system is consistently stock-out limited (sold = on-hand < demand in periods 10, 11, and 12). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages. To capture this higher demand regime and prevent lost sales, I am shifting from using the full history to using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will elevate the base stock to align with the higher observed mean and variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since P8 confirmed: 5-period average (P8-P12) is 63.8 units compared to initial average of 43 units (+48%). Consistent stock-outs observed.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 253448003 (Women's Lingerie) is currently experiencing a high-demand regime that started around Period 8 (April). The last few periods (P10-P13) show consistent stock-outs with demand values of 58, 64, 73, and 79. The most recent demand (P13) was 79, and the backend OR logic using historical data is consistently under-ordering (ordering 64 units when demand was 79). To capture this upward trend and mitigate the constant stock-outs, I will use a mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (P9-P13), which averages ~63 units, but since the lead time is 0 and demand is trending up (79 in P13), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to ensure the OR backend captures the shift. Lead time is consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all concluded periods in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand continues to trend upward: P10-P13 demand sequence is 58, 64, 73, 79 units. The 4-period average is 68.5 units, significantly higher than the initial average of 43 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448003 (Push-up bra) has experienced a massive surge, culminating in a recorded demand of 163 units in Period 14. This is a dramatic increase from the already elevated demand of ~70 units observed in the preceding weeks (P10-P13). The 5-period average (P10-P14) is now approximately 87.4 units, but the most recent observation suggest a peak seasonal spike. Given the product type and current date (May 20), this could be a major promotional event or seasonal shift. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). The lead time remains consistently 0. To capture this significant upward mobility and minimize lost sales (service level) while balancing holding costs (Profit $1 vs Holding $1 implies a 50% service level target in the inventory model, but high demand variance warrants a more aggressive mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to the new demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed: Period 14 demand reached 163 units, more than double the previous 4-period average of 68.5. 5-period average (P10-P14) is now 87.4 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-growth demand regime, likely seasonal (Womens Lingerie). Since Period 8 (April), demand has escalated from an average of ~43 units to over 140 units in the last two periods (P14: 163, P15: 141). We have consistently stocked out because the base stock calculation, which uses historical data including the earlier low-demand phase, is under-ordering. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. However, given the rapid upward trend and the fact that we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to aggressively raise parameters to capture current demand levels. I will use N=3 to focus on the recent spike (Avg P13-15: 127.6) and use an explicit mu_hat to ensure we cover at least 150 units to prevent another stock-out, as the trend suggests demand could stay high. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike intensified: Period 14-15 average demand is 152 units, compared to Period 10-13 average of 68.5 units (+121%). System is consistently under-ordering due to legacy low-demand data.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448003 has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, demand was around 43 units, but starting from Period 14, it has spiked dramatically, with the last three periods recording 163, 141, and 139 units respectively. The current date (June 3rd) suggests this may be related to mid-year seasonal trends or stable summer demand in certain regions. The last 3-period average is approx 147 units. Previous periods suffered from severe stock-outs because the OR backend was using a larger history window (legacy low-demand data). In Period 16, we ordered 155 units and finally cleared most demand (139 units), ending with 16 units on hand. To maintain this service level and account for the new demand plateau, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit recent window (N=3) to focus solely on this high-demand regime (Periods 14-16). The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high level: Period 14-16 average is 147.7 units, a +243% increase from the initial baseline of 43 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448003 (Push-up bra) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, demand was ~43 units, but starting around Period 14 (mid-May), it spiked significantly (reaching 163, then 141, 139). The most recent demand (Period 17) was 105. This high-demand period likely corresponds to a seasonal shift or promotion. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P14-P17) is 137 units. Period 17 showed a slight softening (105), but we must remain responsive to the higher volume to avoid the repeated stockouts seen earlier. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (immediate delivery). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current high-demand state while acknowledging the most recent data point, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high level: P14-P17 average is 137.0 units. Although P17 (105) shows a slight drop from the P14-P16 peak (147.7), it remains >200% higher than the initial baseline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), demand is cooling down after a significant seasonal spike that peaked in mid-May (P14-P16 averaged 148 units). The most recent demand figures (P17: 105, P18: 80) indicate a downward trend, though levels remain above the original baseline of 43 units. The 5-period average (P14-P18) is 125.6, but the 3-period average (P16-P18) is 108. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1 each), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. To prevent overstocking as demand recedes, I am setting mu_hat using a recent window of N=5 to capture the high recent volume while acknowledging the deceleration. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which is maintained.

Carry-over insight: Demand is receding from early summer peak: Period 17-18 average (92.5) is 37% lower than the Period 14-16 peak average (147.7).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 253448003 (Push-up bra) is currently in a high-demand phase compared to its early-year baseline, though it has stabilized or slightly receded from its mid-May peak. Period 19 demand was 120 units, which is a significant increase from Period 18 (80 units) and Period 17 (105 units), suggesting that demand remains volatile but high. The 3-period average (P17-P19) is approximately 101.6 units. Given the seasonality of lingerie and the current summer date (June 24), maintaining higher stock levels is prudent to avoid the frequent stock-outs seen in earlier regimes. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand level (approx. 101.6 units per period) while acknowledging the high variance (std of ~20 units across these three points). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains high but volatile after the May peak; Period 17-19 average demand is 101.6 units, significantly above the original 43-unit baseline, but lower than the 147-unit seasonal peak.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Looking at the demand history, we saw a significant seasonal peak in May (Periods 14-16) where demand averaged 147 units. Since then, demand has stabilized at a lower but still high level compared to the initial baseline. The average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P17-P20) is 98.5 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory costs and profit are equal ($1/unit), which suggests the OR backend will aim for a roughly 50% service level by default (z=0) if my mu_hat is accurate. To capture the current stabilized demand regime post-peak while ignoring the legacy low-demand data from early 2019, I will use a recent_N calculation for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4. This focuses on the most representative data (98.5 mean) and the recent volatility observed in June.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-peak: Period 17-20 average demand is 98.5 units, significantly higher than the pre-peak average of 43, but lower than the May peak of 147.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for this push-up bra SKU hit a seasonal peak in May (Avg P14-P16: 147.7 units) and has since stabilized at a lower but still significant level compared to the pre-peak baseline. Over the last five periods (P17-P21), demand has been 105, 80, 120, 89, and 70 (Average: 92.8). The most recent demand of 70 shows a slight cooling trend. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (P1 through P21) consistently show that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time = 0). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00 each), the target service level q is 0.5 (q = 1 / (1+1)), meaning the inventory policy targets the median of the demand distribution per period. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 0-period lead time and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current stable-but-elevated demand regime (avg ~93 units) while avoiding the distortion of the May peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: P17-P21 average demand is 92.8, demonstrating a 37% reduction from the May peak of 147.7, yet remaining significantly above the initial 43-unit baseline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Push-up bra) showed a significant seasonal peak in May (avg ~147 units) and has since stabilized into a high-level post-peak regime. Specifically, the demand from Period 17 to Period 22 has averaged 91.5 units (105, 80, 120, 89, 70, 85). Period 22 demand was 85 units, and on-hand inventory is low at 8 units. All historical orders show an actual lead time of 0 periods, consistent with the promised lead time. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the stabilized demand regime observed since Period 17 (averaging ~91.5 units). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current volatility in this stabilized phase, ensuring the OR backend can maintain a sufficient service level given the equal cost of profit and holding.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. This product (Push-up Bra) had a significant seasonal peak in May (Periods 14-16), and demand has since stabilized at a higher level than the initial February baseline. Over the last 7 periods (P17-P23), demand has fluctuated between 70 and 120 units, with an average of approximately 90.3 units. The last three periods (P21-P23) show demand of 70, 85, and 83, suggesting a relatively stable post-peak regime. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To balance the relatively high holding cost (equal to profit), I will use the most recent 7 periods to capture this post-peak behavior while ignoring the extreme May spikes. This ensures \u03bc\u0302 reflects the current average demand level (~90 units per period) and \u03c3\u0302 reflects the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization continues: P17-P23 average demand is 90.3 units, approximately 110% higher than the pre-April baseline (~43 units) but significantly lower than the May peak (~148 units).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 253448003 (Push-up bra) is currently in a stabilized post-peak demand regime. After a significant seasonal spike in May (reaching 163 units), demand has settled into a range between 70 and 120 units. For the most recent 8 periods (P17-P24), the average demand is 91.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5 units. The most recent demand (P24) was 101, occurring on 2019-07-22, indicating sustained demand as we enter August. There are no missing shipments, and the actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this stabilized post-peak regime while excluding the extreme May volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current ~92 unit/period mean plus a safety buffer for the moderate volatility observed.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal peak in May (avg ~147 units) followed by stabilization. Recent demand (P17-P25) has averaged approximately 90.1 units per period. The standard deviation for the same post-peak period is approximately 15.3. As we are moving into August, there is no evidence of a further trend shift, so I will continue to weight the post-peak regime (last 9 periods). The Lead Time remains 0 periods as observed consistently. Setting N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the stable post-peak volatility and mean demand effectively.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 253448003 (Push-up bra) is currently in Period 27 (mid-August). Demand analysis shows: 1) An initial baseline of ~43 units; 2) A massive seasonal peak in May (P14-P16) averaging ~147 units; 3) A post-peak stabilized regime from P17 to P26. Over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), demand has averaged 91.3 units. Period 26 saw a high demand of 124 units, causing a stock-out (on-hand 0). Despite volatility, the average has remained consistent around 90-95 units for several weeks. I will use N=10 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized post-peak regime and N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the sustained volatility (std dev remains significant). Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period in history.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (mid-June to mid-August) stabilized: P17-P26 average demand is 91.3 units (range 70-124). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The demand for product 253448003 (Push-up bra) has been in a stabilized post-peak regime since approximately Period 17 (early June). In the most recent periods (P24-P27), demand has shown a slight uptick (101, 76, 124, 110), with the 4-period average rising to 102.75 units, compared to the broader P17-P23 average of roughly 90 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods as verified by 'Period 27 conclude' showing the P27 order arrived in the same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to stock-outs in P26 and P27, I will use a recent_N approach (N=11, covering the stabilized period since P17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock captures the current volume and volatility while reacting to the recent demand strength. This N=11 encapsulates the period from early June to mid-August, providing a robust statistical baseline for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P17-P27 (post-May peak) stabilized with an average of 95.8 units; however, the most recent 4 periods (P24-P27) show a localized increase to 102.75 units, suggesting late-summer demand resilience.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Historical data confirms a stable post-May-peak demand regime starting around Period 17 (June), with an average demand of approximately 92.5 units. However, looking at the most recent four periods (P25-P28: 76, 124, 110, 103), the average has increased to 103.25 units, indicating a late-summer resilience or a minor upward shift as we enter late August. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this recent slight uptick while remaining responsive to volatility (\u03c3 is significant with recent peaks of 124), I am selecting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current 100+ unit demand level better than a longer-term average, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to prevent the frequent stock-outs observed in recent periods (P24, P26, P27, P28 all ended with 0 inventory). L is set to calculate as the observed lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P25-P28 shows a slight uptick to an average of 103 units, compared to the P17-P24 average of 91 units (+13%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Push-up bra' shows a significant seasonal peak in May, followed by a stabilized but volatile post-peak regime. The demand average from Period 24 to 29 is approximately 102 units (101, 76, 124, 110, 103, 98), which is higher than the earlier mid-summer average of ~91 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. On-hand inventory is very low (6 units) after Period 29's demand was resolved. To capture the current stabilized demand levels while accounting for the recent slight upward volatility since late July (Period 24 onwards), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (Periods 24-29). This covers the most recent regime shift identified in the carry-over insights and ensures the parameters reflect current late-summer/early-fall consumption patterns.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P24-P29 has stabilized at a higher level than mid-summer, averaging ~102 units (+12% vs P17-P23).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending Sep 2nd (P30) dropped significantly to 61 units, compared to the previously stabilized avg of ~102 units (P24-P29). This drop might signal a post-summer seasonal decline or simply high volatility. The product is a push-up bra, which often shows seasonal peaks in spring/summer and early autumn. Given the current date is Sep 9th, we are entering the mid-September period where seasonality may start to taper off. However, one data point (61) is not enough to confirm a new regime. I will use a balanced lookback window (recent_N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime (P24-P29) while incorporating the P30 dip. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (ordered and arrived P30). The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the current on-hand inventory (41 units) and the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Temporary demand drop observed in Period 30 (61 units) vs previous 6-period average of 102 units (-40%). Needs 2 more periods to confirm if this is a seasonal shift or volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448003 has shown a significant downward shift over the last two periods (P30: 61, P31: 47) from the previous summer regime which averaged ~102 units. This decline matches a likely seasonal transition as we enter mid-September. The 2-period average is now 54 units, which is much closer to the original baseline of ~43 than the summer peak. Because profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making mu_hat the primary driver for the order. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this transition quickly while including the last high-demand period to prevent under-ordering if the drop was just volatility. Sigma_hat is set to a 5-period window to capture the increased volatility seen during this regime change. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 30: 2-period average demand (P30-P31) dropped to 54 units, a 47% decrease from the P24-P29 late-summer average of 102 units, signaling the end of the seasonal peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downward following the end of the summer seasonal peak. Period 30-31 previously showed signs of decline, and Period 32 (demand=40) confirms this trend. The last 3 periods (P30-P32) have an average demand of 49.3 units, compared to the P24-P29 average of 102 units. This is a significant decrease (>50%). Given the date (late September), we are entering a lower-demand autumn regime. I am setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this new lower baseline while maintaining a safety buffer in case of volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 30: 3-period average demand (P30-P32) is 49.3 units, representing a 52% decrease from the late-summer (P24-P29) average of 102 units. Demand has returned to levels similar to the pre-peak Feb-March period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted again. Following the seasonal peak from May to August, demand dropped sharply starting Period 30, but Period 33 showed a unexpected spike back up to 84 units after three periods of low demand (avg ~49). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To handle this recent volatility and the end-of-season transition, I will use a recent window (N=4, covering P30-P33) to capture the current lower, yet fluctuating, demand level (average ~58 units). This allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock down from the ~100 unit summer levels while maintaining enough buffer for spikes like Period 33. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same N=4 window to account for the increased volatility during this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased during seasonal transition: P30-P33 demand sequence is 61, 47, 40, 84. The 4-period average is 58 units, confirms shift away from summer average (~100) but highlights significant variance.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We have observed a confirmed demand regime shift starting around Period 30, following the end of the summer peak. The demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) has been 61, 47, 40, 84, and 47, averaging 55.8 units. The spike to 84 in Period 33 appears to be localized volatility within a generally lower autumn demand level. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the service level (0.5) targets the median demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this post-peak regime's mean and volatility while smoothing the recent fluctuation. On-hand is 11, and with an expected median around 55-60, an order will be triggered to cover the current period's demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448003 has transitioned out of the summer peak into a lower-volume autumn regime. Period 35 demand was 27 units, continuing the downward trend observed since Period 30 (averaging ~51 units over P30-P35 compared to ~100 in late summer). The uptick in Period 33 (84 units) appears to have been an outlier or a temporary promotion rather than a sustained shift, as subsequent demand has settled at 47 and 27 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 29 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the objective is to maintain just enough stock for the current period's demand while avoiding high holding costs (which are equal to profit). I will use a 6-period window (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat starting from the regime shift at P30 to capture this lower, more volatile baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 30: 6-period average demand (P30-P35) has stabilized at 51 units (range 27-84), down approximately 50% from the summer average of 102 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 30 is well-established, with the most recent 7 periods (P30-P36) averaging 47.9 units. This represents a return to baseline levels after the summer peak. The product is a microfibre push-up bra, which aligns with year-round utility rather than a specific seasonal peak, though summer spikes were observed. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 22 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. I will use N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-peak regime while smoothing out the high volatility seen in P33 (84 units). Setting L to default (0).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has definitively shifted downward from the summer peak (avg ~100 units) to a stabilized lower level (avg ~50 units) starting around Period 30. The most recent 8 periods (P30-P37) show demand values: 61, 47, 40, 84, 47, 27, 29, 33. Excluding the P33 outlier of 84, the average is approx 41.8 units. The current date is late October, moving into November. Given the 'Push-up bra' product category, we expect relatively stable demand now that the summer peak is over, until potential holiday-related shifts. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage costs while maintaining service levels, I will use a recent window (N=8) to capture this lower volume and the associated volatility (range 27-84), which ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent P33 spike without over-ordering based on the summer history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P30-P37 has stabilized at a lower baseline (avg ~51 units, excluding P33 spike avg ~42 units), returning to pre-summer levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Historical demand shows a return to a lower baseline (avg ~46 units) since early September (Period 30), after the May-August summer peak. The most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) demand values are [47, 27, 29, 33, 26], averaging 32.4 units. This is a further decrease from the Period 30-33 average of 58 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am setting N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to cover the period since October, capturing the most recent stable low-demand regime while allowing for some of the volatility observed in September to inform the safety stock. The inventory is currently at 20 units on-hand; with Profit=Holding=$1.0, the OR engine will target a 50% service level (z=0), aiming to keep units on-hand equal to the expected demand for the next period.

Carry-over insight: Demand has settled into a late-autumn baseline since Period 35, averaging ~30 units (P35-P38), which is significantly lower than the previous autumn stabilization (P30-P34 avg ~58) and the summer peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a late-autumn baseline. Since Period 35, demand values have been 27, 29, 33, 26, and 25, yielding a 5-period average of 28.0 units. This is significantly lower than the summer peak (~148) and the mid-summer average (~95). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N). To capture this stabilized low-demand regime and avoid overstocking during this period, I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This aligns the ordering policy with the most recent consumption pattern while maintaining the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime stabilized: P35-P39 average demand is 28.0 units (range 25-33), significantly lower than the initial baseline (43) and previous seasonal peaks.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 253448003 (Push-up bra) has stabilized into a late-autumn/early-winter low-demand regime since Period 35. The demand over the last 6 periods (P35-P40) is 27, 29, 33, 26, 25, 31, averaging 28.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 following a small stock-out in Period 40 where demand (31) slightly exceeded the starting on-hand (28). The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations confirm actual lead time remains 0. I will set L to 'default' (0), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this stabilized low-demand regime (Period 35-40), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to appropriately model the current low volatility. This configuration ensures the base stock calculation reflects the contemporary baseline of ~29 units, minimizing holding costs while maintaining sufficient service levels for the steady but lower demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending November 18 (P41) was 27 units, continuing the late-autumn regime identified in Period 40 (averaging ~28 units). We are now entering late November (P42, 2019/11/25), which precedes the Black Friday and December holiday shopping season. Given the product is women's lingerie (Push-up bra), a significant seasonal spike is expected as gift-buying and holiday shopping intensify. Historical data from early in the year (Feb-March) showed a baseline of ~43, and May saw a peak of ~147. While mid-autumn was low (~28), I anticipate a regime shift upward starting this period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the recent low baseline while allowing the OR engine to start scaling up, but I will transition to an 'explicit' mu_hat to proactively account for the imminent holiday surge, setting it to 55 units (roughly 2x the recent average, aligning more with pre-peak baselines) to ensure sufficient stock for the transition. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Anticipated seasonal demand increase for late November/December holiday period; setting parameters to transition from late-autumn baseline (~28) to higher holiday levels.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43), entering the peak holiday shopping season for lingerie. Historical demand analysis shows a late-autumn baseline (P35-P41) of approximately 28 units. However, Period 42 showed a jump to 42 units (+50% over the baseline), signaling the start of the holiday uplift. During the previous seasonal peak in May, demand tripled relative to the baseline. Based on this, I anticipate demand will continue to scale up through December. I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value of 60 to frontload inventory for this surge, as the transition is rapid and legacy data from the low-demand October/November period would otherwise cause stock-outs. sigma_hat is set to 15 to account for high seasonal volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand uplift confirmed: Period 42 demand increased to 42 units, a 50% increase over the P35-P41 baseline of 28 units.

=== Period 43 Summary ===
253448003: ordered=47, arrived=47 units (ordered on Period 43, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=60, demand=17, sold=17, ending on-hand inventory=43

Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand history shows a late-autumn baseline of ~28 units (P35-P41), followed by a holiday-related spike to 42 units in P42, then a sharp drop to 17 units in P43. While P43 was low, we are entering the peak holiday shopping period (mid-December). Given the product is a push-up bra, it likely sees elevated demand for holiday gifts and events. For Period 44, I will set mu_hat to capture the expected holiday elevation rather than the single-period drop in P43. I'll use recent_N with N=3 (P41-P43) which averages ~28.7 units, and then use the OR backend's service level logic to handle the volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Mixed holiday signals; P42 showed +50% uplift (42 units) while P43 dropped to 17 units. Transitioning into peak holiday weeks (mid-December).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (Dec 16), which is a peak holiday shopping week. Previous periods (P42-P44) showed mixed signals with demands of 42, 17, and 19 units. However, looking at the product category (push-up bra) and the current date (one week before Christmas), a significant spike in demand is highly probable as shoppers finalize gift or personal holiday purchases. The current on-hand inventory is 24 units. To avoid stock-outs during this critical week, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit method to anticipate a demand jump to 50 units (matching the holiday uplift trend observed in P42). The lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the entire history of concluded orders. This setting ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected holiday surge while accounting for potential volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23, which is the peak holiday week (Christmas). While Historical Data from late November/early December showed mixed signals (P42: 42 units, P43: 17 units, P44: 19 units, P45: 27 units), demand usually spikes significantly in the final week before Christmas for intimate apparel and gifts. The current on-hand inventory is 23 units. With a promised and historical lead time of 0 periods, I need to ensure base stock covers the immediate Christmas/Boxing Day demand spike. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a target base stock of 60 units (reflecting an expectation of ~60 units for the holiday peak week, which is roughly double the recent non-peak average of ~28), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=11 (capturing the volatility seen from P35 onwards) to manage the risk of stock-outs during this high-stakes period.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Entering peak holiday week (Christmas). Recent demand (P42-P45) has been volatile (avg ~26) but is expected to spike for the 12/23-12/30 period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30, marking the end of the peak Christmas/New Year week. Historically, demand for this SKU showed a dramatic increase starting in April/May (summer season) and a significant drop in September. Recent holiday demand (P42-P46) has been lower than expected, averaging 25 units per period, which is similar to the late-autumn baseline of 28 units. Since the peak holiday week (Dec 23-30) just concluded with a demand of 20, I anticipate demand will remain at this lower baseline or decrease further as the post-holiday lull begins. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized post-holiday baseline (avg ~25) and sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand (Nov-Dec 2019) stabilized at a lower baseline than summer peaks, averaging ~25 units (P42-P46), comparable to the late-autumn baseline of 28 units.
