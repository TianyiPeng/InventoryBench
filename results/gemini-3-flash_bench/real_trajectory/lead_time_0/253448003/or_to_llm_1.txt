The mean demand is approximately 43.6 units per week with a standard deviation of about 9.4. The OR recommendation is 44 units, which aligns closely with the historical mean. Since the lead time is promised at 0, the base stock needs to cover the current period's demand. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the critical fractile (q) is 0.5, suggesting a target service level of 50% (ordering roughly the mean). However, the dates represent the period leading up to and including Valentine's Day (Feb 14). Demand for lingerie often spikes around this holiday. While P4 (Jan 28) and P5 (Feb 4) didn't show a massive surge yet, Period 1 (starting Feb 11) is the peak week for Valentine's shopping.

The product is a push-up bra, which typically has steady year-round demand but can see slight increases during mid-February (Valentine's Day period).

The OR recommendation of 25 units plus current on-hand of 18 equals 43 units. This aligns closely with the historical mean of 42.5.

Historical demand samples (including P2 and P3) show a consistent range between 35 and 55 units.

OR Feedback: The OR recommendation of 46 units is based on this mean. however, it likely underestimates demand because the last two periods were capped by the stock level (50 and 55), suggesting true demand might be higher. 4. Final Strategy: To avoid another stockout while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $1.0 profit, indicating a 50% critical fractile), I will order 55 units.

A demand of 41-43 is the typical baseline. If I order only 12 units, I will have 46 total (34+12), which just covers the baseline demand but leaves zero buffer for the volatility seen in Period 8. However, because holding costs are equal to profit ($1), overstocking is as penalizing as stocking out. \n5. **Adjustment**: I will increase the OR recommendation to ensure I have at least 60 units available (the approximate average of recent periods 8 and 9 is 62).

Strategy: I need to cover Period 12 demand completely to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 8 and 11.

However, with an on-hand inventory of 39, we need to decide how much to order for Period 38. If demand continues at ~30-40, current inventory covers one week. To maintain a safety buffer and prevent stockouts while accounting for the low holding cost ($1) and the same-period arrival, I will follow the OR recommendation of 32 units.

Over the last four periods (P35-P38), demand has further stabilized at a lower level, averaging 28.75 units per period. The inferred lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Given that the current average demand is under 30 units and we already have 45 units on hand (nearly 1.5 periods of coverage for a 0-period lead time product), ordering 25 units would likely result in excess inventory and unnecessary holding costs.
