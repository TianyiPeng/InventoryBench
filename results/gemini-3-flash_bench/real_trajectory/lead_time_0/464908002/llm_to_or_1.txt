Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 464908002 (Women's Thong 3pk). The historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows a downward trend: 83, 59, 64, 50, 36. The average of all samples is 58.4, but the most recent sample is significantly lower. Given the product category and the date (mid-February), we are just past the Valentine's Day peak/purchasing window, which explains the high demand in January and early February followed by the recent drop. Since the promised lead time (L) is 0, the backend will calculate base stock as (1+L)*demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the full recent profile while acknowledging the downward trend, and 'default' for lead time and sigma.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 3-pack of women's thong briefs. Historical demand shows a declining trend: 83, 59, 64, 50, 36, and most recently 32 in Period 1. There is a clear downward regime shift from the early January peak. In Period 1, we ordered 59 units with an actual lead time of 0 (arrived same period), leaving 27 units on-hand. The promised lead time is 0. Given the consistent decline in demand over the last few weeks, the mean of all samples is too high. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (averaging 36, 32, and the prior 50) to capture this lower demand state (approx 39.3 units/period). Since L=0 and arrivals are immediate, we need to cover only the current period's demand. Holding cost and profit are equal ($1), implying a 50% target service level (q=0.5, z=0), which the OR engine will handle based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Demand has declined from ~65 in Jan to ~34 in Feb (avg of last 3 periods: 39.3; last 2: 34). Actual lead time confirmed as 0 in Period 1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, right after Valentine's Day. We have observed a demand shift in February: demand peaked around the Jan 7th-Jan 21st window (avg ~69) and has consistently dropped since (Jan 28: 50, Feb 4: 36, Feb 11: 32, Feb 18: 40). The average for the last three periods is 36. This aligns with post-Valentine's seasonal cooling for lingerie. Lead time is confirmed as 0 based on Period 1 and Period 2 concludes. Inventory is currently 0, necessitating an order. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (avg ~36) without overstocking, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%.

Carry-over insight: Post-Valentine demand regime confirmed (Periods 1-2): average demand dropped to ~36 units/week compared to the Jan average of ~69.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/3/4. We are looking at women's lingerie (thongs), a category that typically sees a demand spike leading up to Valentine's Day (Period 1) and a subsquent cooling off period. Historical demand confirms this: Jan avg was ~64, dropping to ~36 in Feb. Current on-hand is 0, and we experienced a small stockout in Period 3 (demand 42 vs. 36 available). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set L=0 explicitly to match observed performance. For demand (mu_hat), the last 3 periods (Feb) averaged 38 units. Given the stockout in P3, a slight upward adjustment from the recent average is prudent to capture potential missed demand, so I will use recent_N with N=3 to stabilize around the new lower regime while accounting for the recent demand of 42. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 5 (2019-03-11), we are managing a thong 3pk. Historical data showed a downward trend from January (~69 units) into February (~39 units). However, the last two periods (P3 and P4) showed a stabilization and slight recovery in demand (42 and 40 units respectively), both resulting in stockouts (sold 36/42 and 38/40). This suggests the current 'recent_N' approach might be under-ordering due to the previous downtrend. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while demand appears to have stabilized around 40 units, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stable February-March period (mean \u2248 38.5) and allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for this stable demand plus safety stock. Given profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the target service level is 50%, making mu_hat the primary driver.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in Period 3-4 around 40 units/week following the post-Valentine drop; stockouts in P3 and P4 indicate the previous downward-biased forecast was too low.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/03/18. Reviewing the product (Womens Lingerie) and the historical demand, we've moved past the Valentine's Day peak (Jan/early Feb). Since Period 1, demand has settled into a lower regime, with the last 5 periods showing demands of 32, 40, 42, 40, and 24. While Periods 3 and 4 were stockouts (selling all 36 and 38 units ordered), Period 5 saw a dip to 24 units, resulting in an ending inventory of 15. The average demand across these 5 post-peak periods is 35.6 units. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (same-day arrival). For Period 6, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this post-peak baseline, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~36 units while accounting for the 15 units already on hand. This will prevent overstocking given the current holding cost equals the profit margin (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Valentine's Day: Avg demand for Periods 1-5 is 35.6 units/week, down from Jan avg of ~64. Actual lead time consistently 0 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/03/25. Looking at the demand history for SKU 464908002 (Liza Thong Low), we see a distinct shift after January. January had very high demand (mean ~64), likely driven by pre-Valentine's Day shopping. Since Period 1 (late Feb), the demand has settled into a lower, more stable regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). In the last 6 periods, demand has been: 32, 40, 42, 40, 24, 33 (Mean = 35.1, Std Dev = 6.7). The dips in Periods 3 and 4 were stockouts where demand exceeded arrival, suggesting the true demand was slightly higher than recorded 'sold' units. Transitioning to 'recent_N' for N=6 captures this post-Jan regime effectively without being skewed by the high Jan volumes. Lead time remains 'calculate' because 0-period arrivals are stable.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the SKU 464908002 (Liza Thong Low) shows a stabilized demand pattern following the post-Valentine's Day drop. Recent demand figures for Periods 3-7 are 42, 40, 24, 33, and 38 (average ~35.4). We observed another stockout in Period 7 (demand 38, sold 36), indicating that the inventory levels are still slightly too tight to handle variability. The actual lead time is consistently 0. I will set L to 'calculate' (which returns 0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this stable post-transition demand of ~35.4 units per period (multiplied by 1+L). I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to better reflect the current volatility and avoid under-stocking, as evidenced by the repeated stockouts.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a fundamental lingerie item (Thong 3pk). Historical demand has been consistently higher than my previous order quantities, leading to three stockouts in the last six periods (Periods 3, 4, 7, and 8). The average demand since Period 1 (post-Jan peak) is approximately 36.6 units per week. However, the last two periods (P7 and P8) saw demand of 38 and 44, suggesting a slight upward trend or that my previous stock-out constrained observations were masking true demand. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (the entire active game history) to capture the post-January average, and use a recent_N sigma calculation to handle the recent volatility. Because holding cost equals profit ($1/$1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level; I must ensure mu_hat is high enough to prevent chronic stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains resilient despite post-holiday expectations, with stockouts in P7 and P8 indicating demand levels are likely closer to 40+ units rather than the 35 average previously estimated.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of thong briefs, a staple item. We are currently in mid-April (2019/4/15). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all sessions. Recent demand shows a significant upward trend: the last three periods (P7-P9) had demands of 38, 44, and 49 respectively, with stockouts occurring in each period. The average demand of the last 3 periods is ~43.7, but the most recent pulse (P9) was 49. Because we have zero on-hand inventory and the OR backend uses a capped policy, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this clear upward momentum and the persistent stockouts. I will use a forecast of 50 units (the next logical step in the weekly growth observed: 38->44->49). Since L=0, mu_hat represents one period of demand. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 (covering the stable-to-growth transition) to capture the increased volatility associated with this demand rise.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Periods 7-9 show demand increasing from 38 to 49, resulting in three consecutive stockouts. The demand regime has shifted from the post-Valentine average of ~36 to a level likely exceeding 45 units/week.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464908002 is currently experiencing a sustained period of under-forecasting and inventory stockouts. We have seen four consecutive periods of 100% sell-through (Periods 7-10), with demand significantly outstripping the orders placed (Orders of 33, 36, 37, 50 vs. Demands of 38, 44, 49, 53). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The date is late April (2019/04/22), indicating a clear upward spring demand trend for lingerie/thongs following the post-Valentine's dip. Historical demand in the most recent 10-period history has moved from a mean of ~35 to ~45+. Period 10 demand was 53. To break the cycle of stockouts and capture this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 55 units (slightly above the last observed demand of 53 to allow for growth and safety) and using a high sigma_hat of 10 to protect against further volatility. Lead time remains confirmed as 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: In Periods 7-10, demand increased from 38 to 53, resulting in four consecutive stockouts. The current demand regime has shifted to 50+ units/week, up from the March average of ~33.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a strong and sustained upward trend: Period 8 (44), Period 9 (49), Period 10 (53), and Period 11 (60). We have faced five consecutive stockouts because demand consistently exceeds our previous orders. With the current date of 2019/04/29, we are moving into a higher demand phase for this product category (thong briefs). The average demand over the last 3 periods is approx 54, but since it is trending upward rapidly, an explicit mu_hat of 65 is set to cover the (L+1) period (where L=0) and finally break the stockout cycle. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. A sigma_hat of 10 is chosen to provide a safety buffer against the high volatility observed during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend intensified: demand increased from 38 (P7) to 60 (P11), leading to 5 consecutive stockouts. The current demand level is confirmed to be at least 60 units/week.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a strong growth phase, likely driven by spring seasonality for lingerie. Period 12 demand reached 81 units, significantly exceeding the order of 65 and resulting in the 6th consecutive stockout. Demand has grown steadily from 38 (P7) to 81 (P12). The last four demand observations (P9-P12) are 49, 53, 60, and 81. I need to capture this accelerating trend. Setting mu_hat to explicitly account for a demand level around 85 units to finally break the cycle of stockouts, as recent_N methods might still lag behind this rapid upward shift. Sigma_hat is increased to reflect the higher volatility observed as volume increases. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly in May: Period 12 demand hit 81, representing a 35% increase over Period 11 (60). This marks 6 consecutive periods of stockouts since P7, confirming the demand regime has moved from ~50 to 80+ units/week.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend for SKU 464908002 showed a significant upward climb peaking at a demand of 81 in Period 12, followed by a sharp drop to 43 in Period 13 (Date: 2019/5/6). This drop follows seven consecutive periods of growth and stockouts (P7-P12). The date (early May) suggests we may have passed a localized peak or are entering a stabilization phase. Given the high volatility (demand jump from 60 to 81 and back to 43), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the elevated average (approx 59.25) across this peak-and-drop window. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for this increased volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer despite the drop in P13. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 13 concluded periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike in May: Demand dropped from a peak of 81 (P12) to 43 (P13), ending a 6-period streak of stockouts.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Liza Thong Low (Malva)' has shown high volatility in May. Following a peak of 81 (P12) and a sudden drop to 43 (P13), Period 14 saw a recovery to 55 units. This suggests the market is stabilizing at a higher level than the previous spring average of ~36, but lower than the anomalous peak of 81. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P11-P14) is 59.75 units. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Given Profit = Holding Cost = $1.0, the Critical Ratio is exactly 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current regime which averages ~60 units, and use a recent_N sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed in the last month.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in May: After a peak of 81 (P12) and a drop to 43 (P13), Period 14 (55) suggests a stabilized regime around ~60 units/week.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for item 464908002 (undergarments) surged significantly throughout April and peaked at 81 in Period 12 (late April), likely due to seasonal spring/early summer trends. In the last three periods (P13-P15), demand has stabilized somewhat following that volatility, recording 43, 55, and 52 units respectively. The average demand for these last three stable periods is 50.0. Observed lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. Based on the stabilization of demand after the late April spike, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the current post-spike regime (~50 units). Sigma_hat will also be set to N=3 to capture recent volatility while avoiding the extreme outlier of P12 (81 units). Setting L to 0 based on consistent historical performance and 100% service level requirements.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/03. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by history (ordered and arrived same period). Demand in the most recent period (P16) was 54, with the inventory running out (sold 50/demand 54). Looking at the last four periods (P13-P16), demand has been 43, 55, 52, and 54, averaging 51 units/week. This suggests stabilization following the May volatility (which saw a peak of 81). I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this stabilized level (~51), and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the current post-spike volatility. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level; however, given the recent stockout in P16 and the fact that we are entering early summer (potentially affecting lingerie/underwear demand), I will monitor for further increases.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May/early June: Average demand for Periods 13-16 is 51 units/week, following the May peak of 81.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019/06/03 (Period 17) spiked to 106 units, drastically exceeding the previous five-period average of approximately 57 units and resulting in a stockout. This surge coincides with early June, likely influenced by the lead-up to summer or specific retail events. Given this significant and sudden increase, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 100 to capture this new elevated demand level, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock. Sigma_hat is also set explicitly to 25 to account for the increased volatility observed between Period 13 and Period 17 (range 43-106). Lead time (L) remains consistent at 0 periods based on the historical pattern of same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in early June: Period 17 demand hit 106, nearly double the previous 4-period average (~51), indicating a potential seasonal summer surge.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464908002 (Liza Thong Low) is currently experiencing a significant seasonal demand surge as we enter mid-June. Demand has spiked dramatically: Period 17 saw 106 units and Period 18 saw 139 units, resulting in consecutive stockouts despite aggressive ordering. The previous demand regime (late May) was around 50-60 units, but the current two-week average is 122.5 units. Given the seasonal nature of womens lingerie/thongs in summer, I am forecasting a 'mu_hat' of 140 units to reflect this upward trajectory and prevent further stockouts. I am using 'recent_N' with N=2 for 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' to capture this sudden regime shift. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history.

Carry-over insight: Significant summer seasonal surge confirmed: Demand escalated from ~54 (P16) to 106 (P17) and 139 (P18), a 150% increase over the late May average. Stockouts continue despite higher orders.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464908002 (Liza Thong Low) is currently experiencing a significant summer seasonal surge. After a dramatic peak in Periods 17 and 18 where demand hit 106 and 139, Period 19 demand settled at 84. This remains much higher than the late May average of ~51. The current date (late June) is peak season for summer lingerie/underwear. Although Period 19 showed a drop from Period 18, it still represents a high-demand regime. Using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat captures this specific surge (average demand P17-P19 is ~110). Given the high volatility (139 vs 84), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this variance and avoids the stockouts seen in Periods 17 and 18. Actual lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal surge confirmed: Period 17-19 average demand is 110 units/week, a ~115% increase over the May average of 51. Volatility has also increased significantly during this surge.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer seasonal surge for item 464908002 (Womens Lingerie/Thongs). The demand over the last four periods (P17-P20) has been 106, 139, 84, and 98, yielding an average of 106.75 units per week. This is a significant shift from the May average of ~51. While P19 saw a dip to 84, P20 bounced back to 98, confirming that demand remains elevated near the 100+ level. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility observed during this surge, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture this summer regime accurately, and use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance in this period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464908002 (Underwear/Thong) is currently in a sustained summer seasonal surge (since early June, P17). Demand in Period 21 was 112, following a demand sequence of 106, 139, 84, and 98. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 107.8 units/week. In Period 21, the system stocked out slightly (sold 107, demand was 112), and we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the current summer peak, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current average of ~108 units while allowing the OR backend to account for the high variance observed during this period to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime sustained through early July: Average demand (P17-P21) is 107.8 units/week, representing more than double the May average (~51). High volatility is persistent during this surge.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained summer seasonal peak. Historical demand from Period 17 (early June) through Period 22 shows an average demand of approximately 108.8 units per week (106, 139, 84, 98, 112, 114), significantly higher than the May average (~51). The last five weeks (P18-P22) have an average of 109.4 units. Although there was a dip to 84 in P19, the most recent four periods (P19-P22) show a steady recovery and stabilization at high levels (84, 98, 112, 114). The last two periods show demand consistently exceeding 110 units, resulting in stockouts (P21, P22) as the OR engine capped orders slightly below realized demand. Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, but with high volatility (range of 84-139 in this regime), I will use the last 5 samples to capture the summer peak while allowing for the significant variance observed. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Liza Thong Low (Malva) 3pk' remains in a high summer seasonal plateau. Over the last five periods (P19-P23), demand has averaged 103 units (84, 98, 112, 114, 107). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods since the simulation began. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00 each), the OR backend's target service level (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5) effectively sets the base stock at the mean demand (mu_hat). Since we have seen several recent stockouts (P21, P22) even with high orders, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this current summer regime. This ensures the backend uses the most representative mean (~103) and volatility for the current season rather than being diluted by lower spring demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand has plateaued at approximately 103 units/week (average P19-P23), following the initial June surge.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late July/early August. Historically, the summer peak began in mid-June and has plateaued from Period 19 to Period 24 at an average demand of approximately 98.2 units per week (84, 98, 112, 114, 107, 82). While the demand for Period 24 saw a drop to 82, it is too early to confirm a post-summer regime shift, as this could be standard volatility (sigma ~ 12). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this summer plateau average (approx 98) while accounting for the recent high volatility to maintain an appropriate service level. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level plus safety stock for volatility).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). Historical demand data and 'Carry-over Insights' indicate a summer peak regime that began in June (Period 17) and stabilized in July. Demand was 82 in Period 24 and 94 in Period 25. The summer average (P17-P25) is approximately 103 units, but the last two periods suggest a slight softening as we move past the July peak (average ~88). Lead time (L) has remained consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should target the median demand to minimize total costs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the entire summer regime (from P17 to P25) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which provides a balanced forecast of approximately 103 units per period. This covers the potential for demand to remain high while recognizing the volatility observed during the summer surge.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019-08-12). Demand for this SKU (womens thong briefs) saw a significant summer surge that peaked in June/July (averaging ~105 units/week). However, recent data suggests a downward shift as the peak summer season concludes. Demand in Period 26 dropped significantly to 61 units, following an 82-unit performance in Period 24. The average of the last three periods (P24-P26) is 79 units. Given the transition out of peak summer, I am setting mu_hat to 79 (recent_N=3) to avoid overstocking as demand cools. Sigma_hat remains on recent_N=3 to capture current volatility. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed in August: Period 26 demand (61) is significantly lower than July average (~103), suggesting the end of the summer seasonal peak.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data confirms that the summer seasonal peak has concluded. Demand in Period 26 was 61 and Period 27 was 60, both significantly lower than the July average of ~103. This indicates a new, stable demand regime for late August. Given the transition from summer, I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods (N=2) to quickly capture this downward shift and avoid excess holding costs. Sigma_hat is also updated using a short window (N=3) to reflect the current post-peak volatility. Actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed in late August: Periods 26-27 demand averaged 60.5 units, a ~40% decrease from the July peak average (~103).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the thong 3-pack has cooled significantly from the summer peak (July avg ~103) to a stabilized late-August level. The last three periods (P26-P28) show very consistent demand: 61, 60, and 61. This indicates a high-confidence regime change. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all historical data. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to focus exclusively on this post-summer stabilization, preventing the high summer volatility from over-inflating stock levels while protecting against the current 60-unit baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in late August: Periods 26-28 show a consistent regime of ~61 units/week (61, 60, 61), confirming the end of the summer seasonal peak.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464908002 has entered a post-summer stabilization phase. After the June-July peak (average ~103), demand cooled in August. Periods 26 through 28 showed a highly consistent regime of approximately 61 units (demands: 61, 60, 61). Period 29 showed a slight uptick to 71, but the inventory was exhausted, leading to a stockout. Given the transition into September (Period 30), the demand is likely stabilizing around the 60-70 range. Based on the last 4 periods (P26-P29), the average demand is 63.25 units. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new post-summer baseline while accounting for the recent slight increase, and use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in late August/early September: Periods 26-29 show an average demand of 63.25 units/week, following the summer peak of ~103 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464908002 (undergarments) has successfully transitioned from the summer peak (avg ~103) to a stable post-summer regime. For the last 5 periods (P26-P30), demand has been consistently grouped around 63 units/week (61, 60, 61, 71, 61), following the conclusion of the summer seasonal surge. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, allowing for immediate reaction. Given the high stability over the last five weeks, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture this 'cooling' regime precisely. This setting balances the target of ~63 units against the current on-hand inventory of 3 to determine the appropriate order for the upcoming period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464908002 (Liza Thong Low 3pk) has transitioned out of the high-volume summer peak (~103 units/week) into a stabilized late-summer/early-autumn regime. Over the last six periods (P26-P31), the average demand is 59.5 units/week. While P31 showed a dip to 43 units, previous weeks were stable around 60-70. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current regime (approx 60 units/week), which effectively averages out the P31 dip while acknowledging the significant drop from July peaks. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 32 is mid-September, there are no immediate major calendar spikes expected before the end of the game, so a stabilized forecast is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in September: Periods 26-31 average demand is 59.5 units/week, down ~42% from the summer peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period 2019/9/23 (Period 33) is in the post-summer cooling phase. Demand has stabilized over the last month (Periods 26-32) with a mean of 56.5 units/week. However, the most recent values (P31: 43, P32: 38) suggest a further decline as we move into late September. Using a mean of the last 4 periods (61, 61, 43, 38) gives an average of ~51 units. Given the downward trend, I am opting for recent_N with N=4 to capture this deceleration while maintaining enough buffer for variance. The lead time is consistently 0. The system has 22 units on hand, and no units in transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling intensified in late September: Periods 31-32 averaged 40.5 units, compared to the early September average of ~63 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464908002 is currently in a cooling/stabilization phase following the summer peak (approx. 103 units/week in July) and a subsequent late-August level of ~63 units/week. Most recently, Period 31 and 32 showed a drop to ~41 units/week, but Period 33 demand rebounded slightly to 56 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand was 54). The average of the most recent 3 periods (P31-P33) is 45.6 units. Given the transition into October, I expect demand to settle around the 45-50 unit range. I will use recent_N=3 for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture this most recent stabilization level while acknowledging the Period 33 bounce, and recent_N=8 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed during the transition from the August regime to the September regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in September: Following the summer peak and August stabilization (~63), demand has cooled further to an average of ~46 units/week (Periods 31-33).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for the product (undergarments) has moved out of its summer peak and settled into a lower autumn regime. Over the last four periods (P31-P34), demand has been 43, 38, 56 (stockout), and 42, averaging 44.75 units/week. This aligns with the 'Carry-over Insight' observation of a shift to ~46 units/week. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current post-summer stabilization (average ~45), and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current volatility around this new mean. The OR backend with profit and holding cost both at $1.0 will target a 50% service level, which is appropriate for a product with high holding costs relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed for October: Average demand for Periods 31-34 is 44.8 units/week, down from the late-August stable level of ~63 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464908002 remains in a stable post-summer cooling phase. For the last five periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged 46.2 units/week (43, 38, 56, 42, 52), showing slight fluctuations around the mid-40s. While Period 35 demand (52) exceeded the order, the overall regime since late September suggests a stabilized level around ~46 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this post-cooling stabilized average while accounting for the recent slight uptick. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to mirror the current volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. This setting balances the target of meeting demand around 45-50 units while minimizing holding costs for this low-margin product.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464908002 has stabilized into a post-summer/autumn regime. In the last six periods (P31-P36), demand has averaged 44.5 units (43, 38, 56, 42, 52, 36). The most recent observation (P36: 36) is lower than the previous period but remains within the established range for October. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N window of 6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized autumn demand level (~45 units) while filtering out the volatile summer peaks. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~45 units with sufficient safety stock to handle the moderate volatility (std deviation ~7-8 units) observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in October: Periods 31-36 average demand is 44.5 units/week, confirming a steady autumn level significantly below the summer peak but consistent with late September stabilization.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464908002 (Liza Thong Low 3pk) has stabilized in the autumn regime. Since Period 31, demand has averaged 45.0 units/week (43, 38, 56, 42, 52, 36, 48), with standard deviation suggesting moderate volatility around this mean. The summer surge (June/July) and August cooling have concluded. Actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods consistently across all 37 historical samples. For Period 38, I am setting L to the promised 0 periods. Since the demand regime has been stable for 7 periods (P31-P37), I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific autumn level while ignoring the previous summer peak. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the OR backend will target a base stock roughly equal to the mean demand of the lead+review period (1+0 = 1 period).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464908002 remains in a stable autumn regime. Since the cooling from the summer peak in Period 26, demand has fluctuated between 36 and 56 units. The average demand for the most recent regime (Periods 31-38) is approximately 44.75 units/week. While late October demand (P37-P38) averaged 45.5 units, the overall October trend is consistent. I will set mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture this stabilized autumn level (Periods 31-38). Sigma_hat will also use N=8 to reflect current volatility. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history; therefore, L is set to calculated which will effectively use 0.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand has recently softened, with Period 39 recording a low of 29 units, down from the October average of ~44.5. The last three periods (P37-P39) show demand of 48, 43, and 29, averaging 40 units. This decline is typical as we transition away from the autumn stabilization and approach the mid-November period before potential holiday spikes. The observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking during this softening phase while maintaining sufficient coverage for a 0-day lead time environment (where you cover next period's demand now), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the most recent downward shift. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current moderated volatility. This approach balances the stock level against the holding cost, which equals the profit margin (1:1 ratio), targeting a 50% service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening detected in early November: Average demand for Periods 37-39 is 40 units/week, down from the October average of ~44.5 units, with Period 39 specifically dropping to 29 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are observing a demand softening trend in November as previously noted in Period 40. Historical demand for the last four periods (P37-P40) is 48, 43, 29, 25, showing a clear descent towards a stabilized lower regime. The average of these four periods is 36.25, but the last two periods (29 and 25) suggest the level may be closer to ~30 units/week. Lead time is consistently 0. To prevent excess inventory while ensuring availability for this lower demand level, I will set mu_hat to be based on the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the decline, resulting in a mean of ~36.25 per period. Sigma_hat will also use the last 4 periods to reflect the current lower volatility. This approach balances the stockout risk of P37 with the cooling trend seen in P39 and P40.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening confirmed in November: Average demand for Periods 39-40 has dropped to 27 units, compared to the October average of ~44.5 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Thong Low 3pk has entered a significant cooling phase during November. Following a steady October average of ~44.5 units, the last three periods (P39-P41) have shown demand values of 29, 25, and 25 respectively, bringing the recent 3-period average down to 26.3 units. This cooling is likely seasonal as we move away from summer and autumn peaks. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful same-period arrivals. Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50%, making a precise mean estimate crucial to avoid unnecessary holding costs. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 3 samples to capture this most recent downward shift, and use the standard deviation of the last 5 samples for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased but still present local volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling sustained in late November: Periods 39-41 average demand is 26.3 units/week, a ~40% decrease from the October average (~44.5 units).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Recent history shows a demand softening in November (Periods 39-41 averaged ~26.3), followed by a sudden rebound in Period 42 to 38. This rebound likely signals the start of the December holiday shopping season for women's lingerie/underwear, a category typically sensitive to holiday gifting. Historical data shows early January demand was around 50-80 units, and previous major seasonal shifts (like the summer peak) saw demand more than double. Given the stockout in Period 42 (on-hand 0), a conservative step-up in forecast is needed to capture the December ramp-up. I will set mu_hat to 45 (explicit) to account for this anticipated seasonal increase from the November lows, while maintaining the recent volatility estimate (N=4) for sigma_hat to manage the risk of further spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand ramp detected: Period 42 demand increased to 38 from a November average of ~26, signaling the end of the autumn cooling phase and the start of seasonal gifting demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Liza Thong Low' shows strong seasonal sensitivity. Period 42 saw a jump to 38 units marking the start of holiday demand, but Period 43 dropped sharply to 10 units. This drop is likely a one-time anomaly or a brief lull before a final pre-Christmas surge. Historically, this SKU exhibited a massive surge during the summer (peaking at 139) and a Valentine's surge in early February. Given the date is Dec 9th (Period 44), we are in the peak gift-buying window. The previous 'carry_over_insight' correctly identified the holiday ramp-up; the low demand in P43 is treated as an outlier in a generally upward trend for December lingerie sales. I will set a slightly more aggressive mu_hat using explicit to capture a potential holiday peak of ~50-60 units (reflecting P42's momentum rather than P43's drop), while keeping the backend's default risk balancing. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: High holiday demand volatility detected; Period 42 showed a ramp-up to 38, followed by a sharp drop to 10 in Period 43. Expecting recovery in late December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand in the last two periods was very low (10 in P43 and 15 in P44), significantly lower than the ramp-up of 38 seen in P42. This high volatility is common in the weeks leading up to the final holiday surge. With only 3 periods remaining (45, 46, 47), and an on-hand inventory of 40, we need to decide if another order is necessary. While recent demand suggests we are overstocked, history (and common retail patterns) suggests a significant spike often occurs in the week before/during Christmas. Last year's data (Jan samples) showed demand around 50-80. However, current trends are erratic. Given a profit to holding cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, meaning we should aim for the mean. I will set mu_hat to 45 (an 'explicit' estimate reflecting a potential late-month recovery) to ensure we don't stock out if demand returns to October/late-Nov levels, while recognizing the risk of holding costs. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-December demand volatility: Significant drop-off in P43-P44 (avg 12.5) after a P42 ramp-up (38); awaiting final holiday surge evidence.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter late December (Period 46, Dec 23rd), we are in the peak holiday week. Historical demand for this period (464908002) in early 2019 showed high activity (83 units on Jan 7). While November was soft (avg ~26) and early December was volatile (avg ~12.5 in P43-44), Period 45 showed a recovery to 36 units. Given the date, a final holiday surge is expected before the post-Christmas lull. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 70 units to account for this expected holiday spike, which is significantly higher than the recent 3-period average (~20) but aligned with seasonal patterns for women's lingerie during gifting peaks. Sigma_hat is set relatively high (25) to account for the high volatility observed in both the summer surge and recent December data. Actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand recovery detected in P45 (36 units) following mid-December lull (avg 12.5 in P43-44). Expecting peak gifting demand for P46 (Dec 23).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas/pre-New Year). Historical demand for Dec (Periods 42-46) showed a ramp to 38, a dip to 10-15, and a recovery to 36/29. The holiday peak appears to have passed (Dec 23 demand was 29). For the post-holiday week (Period 47), demand is expected to remain stable or soften as the gifting season ends. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is 25.6 units. Given current on-hand inventory is 41 units and actual lead time is consistently 0, the current stock is likely sufficient to cover post-holiday demand without aggressive ordering. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the average holiday-period level while allowing the OR backend to adjust for the high inventory naturally. sigma_hat will use the same window to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization: December demand (P42-46) averaged 25.6 units/week with high volatility (10 to 38 range), ending with a moderate 29 in the Christmas week (P46).
