Historical data shows demand starting at 0 in early January and rising to 23 and 26 units in the most recent two weeks (late Jan/early Feb). This upward trend aligns with the transition from winter to early spring season (pre-spring shopping). Given the date (Feb 11), we anticipate demand will continue to grow as spring approach. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive in this same period to satisfy this period's demand. Current on-hand is 0. I will forecast demand for the upcoming period at approximately 30-35 units based on the recent trend. To ensure a high service level and account for potential lead time variability (as we have no 'conclude' messages yet), I will order 45 units to cover current demand and establish a small buffer.",

The historical data (Jan-Feb) showed low demand (0-26), but we saw a sudden spike in Period 1-2 (54-90 units) which was followed by a sharp decline in Period 3-4 (55 down to 29 units). This suggests the early Feb peak might have been a pre-spring stocking surge or a specific promotion that has now subsided. As of the current date (2019/3/11), we are moving into mid-spring. While everyday basics usually maintain steady demand, the recent trend is downward (90 -> 55 -> 29). Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 81 units. Average demand over the last two weeks is 42 units. Given the declining trend and the relatively high holding cost ($1) compared to profit ($19), it is prudent to drawdown the existing stock.
