Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the Nora T-shirt, a basic women's garment. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend from 0 to 26 units over the last 5 weeks, suggesting a RAM-UP or seasonal growth phase as we approach spring. The promised lead time is 0. With holding cost at $1.0 and profit at $19.0, the target service level is high (~95%). Since demand is clearly increasing (0, 0, 9, 23, 26), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current demand level (averaging ~19.3 units/period) rather than the long-term average which includes many zeros. This ensures mu_hat reflects the current sales velocity. I will use 'default' for L (0) and sigma_hat initially.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 40 units based on initial data (samples), but demand surged to 54. The item is a 'Nora T-shirt', an everyday basic category in jersey material, which typically shows steady or slightly increasing demand as we move closer to spring (February). Historical samples showed low demand (0, 0, 9, 23, 26), but the actual demand in Period 1 (54) suggests a significant upward trend or a shift to a higher demand regime. Given the stock-out in Period 1 (sold 40 with demand of 54), we need to set parameters that capture this higher demand. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat set to 3 to incorporate the recent jump while including the last two sample points (23, 26, 54), resulting in a higher mean than the full history average. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1197.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598047' is a Nora T-shirt, a jersey basic. We are in February (late winter/early spring transition), and the demand has shown a rapid increase from the initial samples (0, 0, 9, 23, 26) to high recent demand (Period 1: 54, Period 2: 90). The actual lead time is 0 periods, as confirmed by both Period 1 and Period 2 conclusions. My previous orders (40 and 63 units) were insufficient to meet demand, leading to stockouts (ending inventory 0). I need to aggressively adjust mu_hat to capture this upward trend. I will use 'recent_2' to calculate the mean from the recent periods (54 and 90, avg = 72) and use this to project for the next period. Since L=0, (1+L) = 1. Therefore, mu_hat should be at least 72, but given the trend from 54 to 90 (+66%), I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat higher to 110 to avoid further stockouts. sigma_hat will be set using recent data to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Demand increased significantly from a pre-game average of 12 to a post-start average of 72 (+500%). Actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598047' (Nora T-shirt) has shown a significant demand shift since the game started. Pre-game demand averaged ~11.6, while the first three periods of play had demands of 54, 90, and 55, averaging ~66.3. The current date (2019-03-04) suggests the beginning of the spring season for women's basics, explaining the high volume. Actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across three observations. Currently, there are 108 units on-hand, which is roughly 1.6 periods of current average demand. To stabilize the inventory level while respecting the detected regime, I will use a recent_N approach for both mean (mu) and volatility (sigma). Given the high variance (std dev ~18.6 in the new regime), maintaining a sufficient buffer is necessary to maximize profit ($19/unit) vs holding cost ($1/unit).

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Nora T-shirt', an everyday basic item. We have concluded 4 periods of the game. Comparing pre-game demand (avg 11.6) to in-game demand (avg 57), there is a clear regime shift. However, demand in Period 3 (55) and Period 4 (29) shows a downward trend from the initial spikes (54, 90). The average demand over the last 4 periods is 57. The current on-hand inventory is 79, which is relatively high compared to the most recent demand observation. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on consistent arrival data from Periods 1-3. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the in-game demand level while reflecting the recent deceleration, rather than the lifetime average which is skewed low by pre-game zeros. L is set to calculated as 0 is well-established.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Nora T-shirt', an everyday basic item. Observations from the first 5 periods show a significant demand regime shift compared to pre-game data (0-26 units). Current demand (Periods 1-5) averages 56.4 units (54, 90, 55, 29, 54). While Period 4 was lower (29), recent Period 5 returned to the mean (54). We are entering late March, which often sees an uptick in Spring basics demand. Actual lead time is confirmed consistent at 0 periods across all orders. With 45 units on hand and 0 in transit, we need to ensure stock for Period 6. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the post-shift average, and default for others to maintain stability. The base stock calculation by the OR backend will target the high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) suitable for this profitable item.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Nora T-shirt' is a 'Womens Everyday Basic', and current dates (mid-March) align with the start of Spring/Summer seasonality. Since the game started (Period 1), demand has consistently averaged around 57.6 units/period (54, 90, 55, 29, 54, 64), which is significantly higher than pre-game history. The drop in Period 4 (29) appears to be an outlier or fluctuation rather than a regime shift. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all deliveries to date. To capture this active demand regime while smoothing out the Period 4 dip, I will use a recent window of N=6 (all periods since game start) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time L will be kept at 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $429.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Nora T-shirt' is a seasonal basic. Current date is April 1st. Historically, demand has stabilized after an initial jump, though it shows some volatility (Period 7 demand dropped to 26). The average demand since Period 1 (excluding pre-game data) is 53.1 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand in the same period. Since on-hand inventory is 65 and average demand is around 53, the current stock is slightly higher than the mean demand but necessary to buffer against the observed volatility (Std Dev \u2248 22). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the demand regime since start of play (avg 53) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to account for the variance noticed in the last few weeks. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been reliably 0.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt, which is a staple item, but subject to seasonal increases as spring progresses. Analysis of the demand history shows a significant shift from pre-game levels (~12) to an average of approximately 58 units per week (Period 1 to Period 8). Period 8 saw a sharp spike in demand to 92 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending on-hand: 0). Given the transition into warmer weather in April, I anticipate demand will remain elevated. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 7 orders placed. I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the post-start demand regime while smoothing the recent spike, and a recent_N approach for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1862.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15th, and we are managing the 'Nora T-shirt', which is a seasonal spring/summer basic. Demand has been volatile but shows an increasing trend as we move into warmer months: demand in the last two periods was 92 and 102, significantly higher than the average of earlier periods. We have stocked out in the last two periods (ending inventory = 0), indicating we are under-forecasting the recent surge. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent upward shift and prevent further lost sales, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to weigh the latest high-demand observations (64, 92, 102) more heavily, resulting in an average of approximately 86 for this period (L=0, so mu_hat is for 1 period). sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current higher volatility. This approach should allow the OR backend to set a base stock that satisfies the current demand regime while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting mid-March: Demand has increased from an early-game average of ~50 to a recent average of ~86 (+72%) peaking at 102 in P9. Frequent stockouts occurring due to rapid seasonal scaling.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2618.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Nora T-shirt', which is seeing a strong seasonal demand increase as we move into late April. Historical demand has trended aggressively upward: Period 8 (92), Period 9 (102), and Period 10 (138). The current mean over the last 3 periods is approximately 110.6. Given the product type and the timing (Spring/Summer transition), demand is expected to remain high or continue growing. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts (which occurred in P8 and P9), I will use an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat to account for this seasonal momentum, setting it slightly above the most recent demand to 145. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the high recent volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for this high-margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) item.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating into late April: demand increased to 138 in P10 (avg of last 3 periods is 110.6, up from previous avg of 86). Seasonal growth for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' is confirmed.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' and the current date is April 29, 2019. We are entering the peak spring/early summer season. Demand history shows a clear upward trend: 92 (P8), 102 (P9), 138 (P10), and 112 (P11). The mean of the last 4 periods is approximately 111. Given the sharp seasonal growth and the product type, demand is expected to stay at this elevated level or continue to rise as temperatures warm up. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed in history). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime. With L=0, mu_hat represents the demand for the current period (1+0=1), and on-hand inventory (73) will be subtracted from the base stock calculated by the OR backend. Using recent data ensures the model covers the current demand level without being pulled down by lower early-game figures.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598047' (Nora T-shirt) is exhibiting a strong seasonal growth trend as we move into May. The last three periods (P10, P11, P12) show demands of 138, 112, and 127 respectively, averaging 125.7 units per week. This is a significant step up from the March/April average (~86). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment, but we must set base stocks high enough to satisfy the within-period demand spike. Current on-hand is low (17 units). I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat (covering P9-P12: 102, 138, 112, 127), which yields an average of ~119.75. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes (std approx 15.3). This ensures the OR backend targets a service level (z-score) based on the high profit/holding cost ratio (19/20 = 0.95 quantile) while reflecting current trend levels.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). The product is a women's jersey T-shirt, which is in peak spring/summer seasonality. Reviewing the demand history: P10 (138), P11 (112), P12 (127), and P13 (96). While P13 showed a slight dip, the four-period average is 118.25 units. The Carry-over insights confirm a sustained upward trend from earlier periods. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%). Using a recent window of N=4 captures the current peak season demand level while acknowledging the slight cooling in P13. L is set to default as 0-period lead time is consistently observed.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Demand peaked in mid-to-late April (P10: 138, P11: 112, P12: 127) and has shown a slight softening in May (P13: 96, P14: 82), which is common as the initial spring surge stabilizes before high summer. However, demand remains significantly higher than the early-game average. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current stabilizing demand level (approx. 111 average over last 5 periods) rather than the long-term historical average. This balances the recent peak with the slightly lower latest observations. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current volatility of this seasonal period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a staple women's T-shirt, which has seen a sustained demand increase since mid-March as it entered the spring/summer season. After a peak of 138 in Period 10, demand has stabilized over the last four periods (Periods 12-15) with an average of 97.5 (127, 96, 82, 85). I will use N=4 for mu_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient responsiveness to the seasonal plateau. The lead time is consistently 100% reliable at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' ordering to minimize holding costs while meeting demand. Predicted demand for Period 16 is expected to remain in the 90-100 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-peak (P12-P15) at an average of 97.5 units per period, following the earlier seasonal surge.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598047' (Nora T-shirt) is a seasonal basic. Current date is June 3, 2019. Demand history shows a peak in mid-April (P10: 138 units) followed by a stabilization period. Over the last 4 periods (P13-P16), demand has averaged 89.75 units (96, 82, 85, 96). There is no strong evidence of a further decline or growth trend entering June; rather, it appears to have settled into a post-peak plateau. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the OR backend policy effectively, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this current stable regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current demand level of ~90 units/period while maintaining a safety buffer based on recent volatility, optimizing for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile = 0.95).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which is entering peak summer demand. Period 17 concluded with a stockout (demand 113, sold 102, ending inventory 0), indicating that demand hasn't purely 'stabilized' at the 97.5 average calculated in Period 16, but is experiencing volatility or a secondary June peak. Demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) has been 96, 82, 85, 96, 113, averaging 94.4 units. To account for the recent stockout and seasonal timing, I will use a recent_N window for demand and volatility calculations. I've chosen N=5 to capture the most recent regime which reflects current summer interest. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Higher sigma settings are necessary to protect against the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) and frequent stockouts.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics) has spiked significantly in the last two periods (P17: 113, P18: 160), following a stable period in May. This aligns with peak summer demand for basic cotton apparel. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P16-P18) is ~123 units, with the most recent observation being 160. Because on-hand inventory is currently 0 and recent demand has consistently resulted in stockouts (P17, P18), a more aggressive demand forecast is required to capture this June peak. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to prioritize these high-demand periods. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Summer Peak): Demand increased significantly in June (P17-P18), averaging 136.5 units, compared to the May average of 97.5 (+40%). Frequent stockouts occurring at mid-June.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598047' (Nora T-shirt) is exhibiting high summer seasonality. Demand has spiked in June, with observations of 113, 160, and 111 in the last three periods (Avg=128). This follows a previous stable period in May (Avg=97.5). Despite the slight dip in Period 19 (demand=111), the trend remains significantly higher than the spring baseline. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for this summer peak and prevent the stockouts seen in P17 and P18, I am targeting a base stock level that reflects the heightened demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent June surge (average ~128 units), and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat (encompassing the high volatility seen in P18) to ensure sufficient safety stock. This strategy aligns with the 'everyday basics' nature of the product, which sees increased velocity during warmer months.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Looking at the history, the 'Summer Peak' identified in the carry-over insights saw demand spikes up to 160 in mid-June (P18). Since then, demand has settled at 111 (P19) and 109 (P20), averaging 110 units over the last two weeks. This suggests a post-peak stabilization typical for basic t-shirts after the initial summer surge. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which sustains high demand throughout summer but may see slight cooling from the peak June levels. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the extreme P18 spike while ensuring sufficient stock for the current 110-unit average, I will use a recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (avg \u2248 126.7 including the P18 spike, protecting against stockouts). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this 3-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand has stabilized post-mid-June; demand for P19-P20 averaged 110 units compared to the P18 peak of 160.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598047 (Nora T-shirt) is currently in the middle of summer (early July). Historical demand shows a significant peak in mid-June (P18: 160) followed by a stabilization phase. Over the last three periods (P19-P21), demand has been 111, 109, and 82, averaging approximately 101 units. Period 21 saw a notable drop to 82, suggesting the intense summer peak may be tapering off or entering a more stable 'everyday basics' demand level for the remainder of the warm season. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (approx. 95%). To capture the most relevant recent behavior while acknowledging the recent dip from peak levels, I will use a window of the last 4 periods (P18-P21) for mean and variance. This includes the end of the peak and the start of the stabilization, providing a robust buffer without over-ordering on a declining trend.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical data for the 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics) shows a clear seasonal peak in June (Periods 17-18, demand avg. 136.5) followed by a significant decline in July. Period 21 recorded a demand of 82, and Period 22 dropped further to 59. This downward trend suggests the peak summer season is concluding for basic jersey t-shirts. My goal is to prevent overstocking as demand softens. I will use a recent window (N=4) to capture this downward shift (avg. 90.25) while remaining cautious of the high variance seen in previous periods. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Post-Summer Peak): July demand has declined significantly from a June peak of 160 to a Period 22 low of 59, averaging ~70 units over the last two weeks as the summer season begins to wind down.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598047 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is showing significant demand volatility as it transitions out of the summer peak. After a low of 59 units in Period 22, demand bounced back to 101 units in Period 23. This suggests that while the peak is over, there is still a substantial 'Everyday Basic' demand floor. The average demand over the last three periods (P21-P23) is 80.6 units, whereas the last two periods (P22-P23) average 80 units. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this post-peak stabilization. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 30), so an order is required to reach the base stock level for Period 24.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598047' (Nora T-shirt) is currently in a high-volatility phase following the summer peak. Period 24 saw a sudden demand spike to 152 after several weeks of decline (Period 21: 82, Period 22: 59), which caused a stockout (ending inventory 0). The product description (short sleeves, jersey basic) and the date (late July) suggest that while the primary summer peak is likely passed, we are seeing secondary spikes (possibly clearance or final summer shopping). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the recent variability (59, 101, 152), using 'recent_N' with N=4 captures the latest decline and rebound (averaging ~98.5 units), which is safer than the long-term average. I will set L to 'calculate' to continue using the 0-period lead time and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to respond to the recent volatility while protecting against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Observed late-July demand volatility (P22: 59, P23: 101, P24: 152) suggests sustained demand variance even after the primary June summer peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' continues to show high volatility following the summer peak. While July saw a downward trend in mid-month (averaging ~70 in P21-P22), late July experienced a sharp, unexpected surge (P24 demand: 152, P25 demand: 93). This suggests that while the primary summer peak is over, residual seasonal demand or possible 'back-to-school' preparation is maintaining high volume. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is 97.4 units. I will use N=5 for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture this recent volatile average while preventing over-reaction to the single spike in P24. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. History confirms L=0 across all concluded periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' (a summer-oriented basic item) has moved past its June peak and stabilized during August. While late-July showed high volatility (up to 152 units), the last two periods (P25 and P26) have settled at 93 and 98 units respectively. This suggests a post-peak plateau. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking as the season eventually turns toward autumn, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current stabilized demand level (average ~108) while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the recent volatility. This window includes the high P24 demand, providing a conservative buffer against sudden late-season spikes while the mean reflects the recent cooling trend.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019 (Period 28). We are in the late-summer/early-autumn transition for a basic jersey t-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant decline in August (P27 demand: 51), following a volatile July. The average demand across P25-P27 is 80.6 units, but the most recent period (P27) saw a drop to 51. Given the cooling trend in demand for summer basics and the current on-hand inventory of 105 units, I am reducing the demand forecast to reflect a likely continued decline. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the downward trend while accounting for recent volatility, and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock against high residual variance observed in July/August.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (End of Summer): August demand (P27) dropped to 51 units, confirming the anticipated seasonal decline from the June/July peaks.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/26 (Period 29). We are in the post-summer decline for the 'Nora T-shirt', which is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' item. Historical demand analysis shows a significant drop-off in August compared to the June/July peak. Period 27 demand was 51 and Period 28 was 63. The carry-over insight from Period 28 correctly identified this shift. Given we are now in late August, demand is expected to consolidate at a lower baseline before any potential autumn shifts. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a declining trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the low-demand August regime (averaging approx 70.6 units). This ensures the base stock reflects current slow-moving conditions while maintaining enough safety stock for minor localized spikes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has confirmed a clear seasonal peak in June/July, followed by a decline in August. The most recent demand samples are: P27: 51, P28: 63, P29: 68. This indicates a stabilization in the post-summer regime at a lower mean compared to the peak season. Since lead time is consistently 0, the target inventory needs to cover only the current period's demand. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (P26-P29) to capture this new 'End of Summer' stabilized state while accounting for the recent slight upward tick in the last two weeks. This avoids over-ordering based on mid-summer highs while maintaining sufficient stock for the stabilized baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late August (P27-P29) at an average of 60.7 units, confirming the completion of the summer seasonal decline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9th, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal decline from the summer peak (June/July), stabilizing in August around an average of 60.7 units. Period 30 saw a further dip to 40 units, suggesting the downward trend into autumn for this 'Everyday Basics T-shirt' is continuing. I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect this most recent regime (P27-P30 average is approx 55 units) while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the stable late-August/early-September demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Autumn Decline): Early September demand (P30) dropped to 40 units, indicating a potential further step down from the August average of 60 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-September, a period characterized by the transition from summer into autumn. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has shown a definitive step-down from summer peaks (160 units) to an average of ~61 units in late August, and a further decline in the last two periods (P30: 40, P31: 32), averaging 36 units. This suggests the autumn decline is materializing. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory as demand cools, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this downward trend (averaging 40.0 units) versus the longer-term averages which would over-order. This responsive setting balances the high service level requirements with the risk of growing holding costs during a contraction phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Autumn Decline): Early September demand (P30-P31) has averaged 36 units, confirming a significant drop from the August average of 61 units (-41%).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for this SKU ('Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt') has entered a clear autumn decline. The average demand over the last three periods (P30-P32) is approximately 33 units (40, 32, 28), confirming a step-down from the August average of ~61. This aligns with the seasonal cooling of a short-sleeved basic t-shirt. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory during this decline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=3 to capture the most recent demand regime (approx 33 units/period). This provides a lean base stock levels appropriate for the current trend while maintaining the 0.95 service level target against the lower volume.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Historical data and Carry-over Insights indicate a sustained decline in demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' as the autumn season progresses. After a summer peak of ~160 units, demand significantly dropped through August and September. The most recent three periods (P31-P33) show demand of 32, 28, and 46 units, averaging 35.3 units per period. This confirms the previously noted 'Autumn Decline'. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this downward trend, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current low-demand regime (Avg: 36.5). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that reflects the lower turnover, balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which has shown a clear seasonal decline since the summer peak. Demand in September (P30-P34) has averaged 33.6 units per period, a 45% drop from the August average. The recent demands (40, 32, 28, 46, 22) show that while variance exists, the mean is stabilizing at a lower level for autumn. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this lower-demand phase while accounting for recent volatility (like the 46 in P33), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this new autumn regime. Sigma_hat will also use the last 5 periods to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the high-variance summer months.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in September (P30-P34) at an average of 33.6 units, reflecting a post-summer seasonal baseline for autumn.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which has passed its summer peak and is now in an autumn baseline. The demand regime has stabilized following a significant decline in September. For periods 30-35, the demand has averaged 31.8 units (40, 32, 28, 46, 22, 23). The most recent 3 periods (P33-P35) show an average of 30.3. Since the autumn baseline is well-established, I will use a window of N=6 (P30-P35) to capture this stable post-summer demand while smoothing recently observed fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 27 units, which is close to the recent average demand, necessitating a replenishment order to maintain a service level consistent with a $19 profit and $1 holding cost (target service level ~95%).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598047' (Nora T-shirt) is a seasonal basic. Current date is October 21, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a post-summer/autumn baseline. Over the last 7 periods (P30-P36), demand has averaged 29.57 units, showing a clear step down from the August average of ~61. The last 3 periods (P34-P36) show even tighter stability with an average demand of 22 units (22, 23, 21). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels are currently adequate (on-hand: 27), and recent sales match demand perfectly. I will use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current autumn regime while providing enough sample size for variance calculation, ensuring the OR backend targets the ~30 unit/period baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in October (P34-P36) at a very consistent average of 22 units per period, further refining the autumn baseline from the September estimate of 33.6.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the late autumn season for the 'Nora T-shirt', which is described as a 'Womens Everyday Basics' item. Demand has stabilized significantly in October. While P37 saw a slight uptick to 34 units, the average for the last 4 periods (P34-P37) is 25 units. The Carry-Over Insight from Period 37 noted a consistent average of 22 units. Given the seasonality of a short-sleeved jersey T-shirt, demand is expected to remain at this low baseline or potentially decline further as winter approaches. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to account for the most recent observation while acknowledging the low autumn baseline, and sigma_hat will be calculated over the same window to capture recent volatility. This maintains a lean inventory in line with high holding costs ($1/unit) and lower seasonal demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for the Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) has remained stable throughout October and into early November, confirming an autumn/early winter baseline. The last 5 periods (P34-P38) show demand levels of 22, 23, 21, 34, 18, averaging 23.6 units per period. The spike in P37 (34 units) appears to be noise rather than a regime shift. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels are close to the mean, with 17 units on hand. To maintain the target service level given the low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19), I will use a recent_N window of 5 periods to capture this stabilized autumn demand regime and maintain sufficient stock for the next period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-November. Demand has stabilized into a late-autumn/early-winter baseline. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 22.8 units (22, 23, 21, 34, 18, 19), which is very consistent with the 'October baseline' identified in Period 37. The spike in P37 (34 units) appears to be an outlier or a minor fluctuation rather than a regime shift. lead_time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this stable late-season behavior while allowing for the slight variance seen in recent weeks. This ensures the OR backend targets a stock level appropriate for the ~23 units/period demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for this SKU ('Nora T-shirt') has stabilized into a consistent late-autumn pattern. Analyzing the most recent data: the average demand from Period 34 to 40 is approximately 21.1 units (22, 23, 21, 34, 18, 19, 10). Period 40 showed a noticeable dip to 10 units, but it is not yet clear if this is a new downward regime or a single-period fluctuation. Given the product type (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt), it has passed its summer peak and is now in its baseline phase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Based on the stabilization identified in Period 37 (averaging 22 units from P34-P36) and the subsequent values, I am setting N=7 for mu_hat to capture this entire stabilized autumn regime (P34-P40), which averages 21.0 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to account for the lowered volatility in this period compared to the high-variance summer peaks. This approach balances the need to minimize holding costs for a low-demand period while maintaining sufficient stock for small variations around the autumn baseline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Since Period 37 (late October), the demand regime has stabilized significantly at a lower autumn baseline. The average demand for the last five periods (P37-P41) is 19.0 units (d: 34, 18, 19, 10, 14), which is fairly consistent with the previous 'Carry-over Insight' of approx 22 units. With the transition into late November, there is a risk of Black Friday/Holiday spikes for basic apparel, though the historical data provided at the start of the game (Jan/Feb 2019) showed very low demand (0-26 units). I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the move to a slightly lower mean (19 vs 22) while maintaining enough buffer for variance. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand regime stabilized in November (P37-P41) at an average of 19 units, slightly down from the October average of 22 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Historically, the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' saw a significant demand peak in summer and has since stabilized to a low autumn/winter baseline. November (P37-P41) averaged 19 units. Period 42 showed a slight uptick to 25 units, possibly due to late November sales events, but demand remains generally low and stable. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level for this staple item while minimizing holding costs at the end of the year, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5), which captures the current winter demand regime (avg ~17.2). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect recent low volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019 (Period 44). We are in the late autumn/early winter regime for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Historically, demand has stabilized at a low baseline since October. Specifically, the November average (P37-P41) was 19 units. The most recent demand samples are P41: 14, P42: 25, and P43: 10, averaging 16.3 units. Given that we are approaching the end of the game (P47) and demand for basic T-shirts typically remains low or flat during the winter months, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 7 (covering roughly the last 7 weeks since late October) to capture this stable, low-demand phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the most recent arrivals. The goal is to maintain a lean inventory to avoid holding costs as we head toward the final periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Historically, demand peaked in June/July (up to 160 units/week) and has been steadily declining through autumn. Over the most recent 8 periods (P37-P44), demand has averaged 17.1 units, with the most recent four periods (P41-P44) showing a further decline to an average of 14 units (14, 25, 10, 7). Given we are in the middle of December, demand for a short-sleeved basic t-shirt is at its seasonal low. Inventory levels (26 units on hand) are currently sufficient to cover almost two weeks of the recent demand average. Since the promised and actual lead times are consistently 0, I will use a conservative recent window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent late-autumn/winter baseline while maintaining enough buffer for minor fluctuations. This corresponds to an average of ~13.2 units per period. Sigma_hat will also use a recent window (N=8) to capture the variability observed during this low-demand phase without being skewed by the much higher summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Demand regime stabilized for December at a low seasonal baseline; demand for P41-P44 averaged 14 units, down from the October/November average of 19-22 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019 (Period 46). We are dealing with 'Womens Everyday Basics Nora T-shirt'. Historically, the demand for this basic item peaked significantly in June/July (up to 160 units) and has steadily declined through autumn. The Carry-over insight for Period 45 suggests a stabilized low seasonal baseline for December, with demand for P41-P44 averaging 14 units. Most recently, Period 45 demand was 13 units. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given that we are at the end of December/Christmas period, demand for basics is likely to remain low or slightly dip further before any potential New Year recovery. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P41-P45) to capture this stable winter baseline (mean \u2248 13.8 units). Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 5 periods to reflect current low volatility.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the final week of the year and transition into January. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has stabilized at a very low winter regime. Over the last 6 periods (P41-P46), demand has averaged 14 units (14, 25, 10, 7, 13, 15), representing the seasonal baseline. Lead time has remained consistent at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the low demand and 0-period lead time, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 6-period average (N=6) to ensure inventory levels decline toward the end of the year to minimize holding costs while protecting against the small baseline demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect the lower volatility observed in this stable baseline period.
