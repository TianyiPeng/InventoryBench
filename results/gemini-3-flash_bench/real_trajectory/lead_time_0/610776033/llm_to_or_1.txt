Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 'Tilly' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) shows a clear upward trend in the initial 5 weeks of historical data: [0, 0, 24, 58, 84]. This suggests a product launch or seasonal ramp-up. The mean of all samples is 33.2, but the most recent sample is 84, and the trend is strongly positive. To avoid immediate stockouts during this growth phase, I will use a recent_N window (N=3: samples 24, 58, 84) to forecast demand. This results in a mean demand of 55.33 per period. Since the promised lead time (L) is 0, the OR backend will calculate mu_hat for (1+0)=1 period. I will use the same window for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility of the ramp-up. No lead time data is available yet, so I will stick with the default (0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 81 units based on a lead time of 0. These arrived immediately and were all sold, along with an additional 48 units of unmet demand (total demand = 129). This suggests the initial demand samples (0, 0, 24, 58, 84) were part of a ramp-up phase and do not reflect the current 'Women's Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt demand in mid-February. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this higher demand level (129) and set L=0 since the actual lead time observed in Period 1 was indeed 0. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility as the sample size is small.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historically, demand was zero in early January, but started rising in late January (24, 58) and early February (84). Since the game start (Period 1 and 2), demand has surged significantly (Period 1: 129, Period 2: 268), indicating a strong upward trend as we move towards Spring. In both periods, we stocked out completely (ending inventory 0), meaning true demand is likely higher than the observed sales. Promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has consistently been 0. To capture this rapid growth and account for censored demand, I will use an explicit mu_hat. Given the jump from 129 to 268, I'll forecast Period 3 demand at ~350 units. With L=0, mu_hat (1+L) needs to be 350. I will set silica_hat explicitly high to ensure we cover the volatility of this growth phase and avoid further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Rapid growth detected in Feb 2019. Demand increased from 84 (pre-game) to 129 (P1) to 268 (P2). Basic jersey items showing strong seasonal ramp-up.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776033' is a basic jersey T-shirt, which is showing a significant demand ramp-up as we move into the spring season (March). Historically, demand rose from 84 (pre-game) to 129 (P1) and 268 (P2), before slightly stabilizing at 233 (P3). The average demand over the first three game periods is approximately 210. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. We currently have 185 units on-hand. To capture the current seasonal strength and avoid stockouts seen in P1 and P2, I will use recent_N (N=3) to estimate demand (mu_hat) based on the active game regime, which averages 210 units/period. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the high variance observed during this growth phase. This strategy ensures the base stock target accounts for the higher sustained demand and provides a buffer for variance.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt', which is seeing a spring seasonal ramp-up. We are currently in Period 5 (March 11). Demand surged early (P1: 129, P2: 268) and has since stabilized/moderated (P3: 233, P4: 174). While P2 was very high, the last two periods show a more sustainable level as the initial spring surge levels off. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all 4 concluded periods. To avoid overreacting to the P2 spike while capturing the seasonal baseline, I'll use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (average of 268, 233, 174 is approx 225) to cover (1+L) periods of demand. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the volatility from this active selling period.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in March after Feb surge: P3-P4 average is 203 vs P2 peak of 268.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019/3/18), the demand for the jersey basic T-shirt has stabilized following the February surge. The most recent demand figures (P3-P5) are 233, 174, and 160, averaging approximately 189 units per period. The earlier peak of 268 in P2 appears to be an outlier during the initial seasonal ramp-up. Evidence shows lead time remains consistently at 0 periods (all orders P1-P5 arrived in the same period they were placed). Currently, on-hand inventory is 105 units. I am setting N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this stabilizer period (P3-P5) and avoid over-ordering based on the February peak, while still maintaining high service levels (profit is $4 vs holding cost $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Mid-March demand (P3-P5) has settled to an average of ~189 units after the February peak of 268.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a stable demand regime following the February surge. The last four periods (P3-P6) show demand of 233, 174, 160, and 207, averaging approximately 193.5 units. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same cycle. On-hand inventory is currently low (15 units) after the higher demand in Period 6. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio q is 0.8, justifying a stock level that covers mean demand plus a moderate safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility (N=4) to capture this stabilized post-peak regime while reacting to the recent slight uptick in Period 6 demand.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (women's jersey basic T-shirt) is exhibiting relatively stable demand following the February ramp-up. The demand values for the last four periods (P4-P7) are 174, 160, 207, and 221, yielding an average of approximately 190.5 units. The actual lead time consistently reflects the promised lead time of 0 periods (order arrives in the same period it is placed). Since current on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit), the goal is to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the upcoming period. Using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) accounts for the current stable-to-slightly-uptrending regime entering April, while recent_N=4 for sigma_hat captures the variability within this stable period. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock target of roughly 191 units plus safety stock, ensuring high service levels for this profitable item.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in late March with a 4-period average of 190.5 units (P4-P7 range: 160-221). No evidence of lead time deviation from promised 0 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Demand for this Jersey Basic T-shirt has shown a recent uptick in the last three periods (P6: 207, P7: 221, P8: 245), indicating a possible spring seasonal ramp-up compared to the March average of ~189. Specifically, the last sample (245) resulted in a stockout (sold 215 of 245 demand), signaling that current inventory levels are insufficient. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, with all orders from P1 to P8 arriving within the same period. To capture the recent accelerating trend while protecting against stockouts, I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat (average 224.3) and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime observed in late March/early April.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptrend detected in late March/early April: demand increased for 3 consecutive periods (207, 221, 245), averaging 224.3 vs the previous March stability level of 189 (+18%).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, demand settled to 187, breaking the three-period uptrend noted in the previous carry-over insight. The demand for the last four periods (P6-P9) has been 207, 221, 245, and 187, averaging 215 units. This suggests a new stable regime rather than a continuous trend. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this latest demand level while allowing for the observed volatility (range 187-245). This balances the need for service level against holding costs for this 'Everyday Basic' item.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in early April: P6-P9 average is 215 units (range 187-245), ending the previous short-term uptrend.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776033 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in Period 11 (Late April). Period 10 demand was 252 units, following 187 in Period 9 and 245 in Period 8. The average demand across the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 222.4 units, indicating a relatively stable but high-volume regime in April. Despite a slight dip in P9, the P10 spike suggests sustained popularity as spring continues. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. With zero on-hand inventory entering Period 11, the goal is to set parameters that cover the expected demand for the current week plus a safety buffer to mitigate the risk of stockouts seen in P8 and P10. Using N=5 for the recent regime captures the current April performance (avg 222, std ~28). Setting L=0 explicitly and targeting the last 5 periods for mu and sigma will align the order with current seasonal trends.

Carry-over insight: April demand regime confirmed: P6-P10 average demand is 222.4 units (range 187-252), showing higher sustained volume compared to the March average of ~189.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776033' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in an April demand regime with a high service level requirement (profit $4 vs holding $1). Historical demand for the last five periods (P7-P11) is 221, 245, 187, 252, and 253, yielding a mean of 231.6. We have stocked out in three of the last four weeks (P8, P10, P11), suggesting the OR backend's default variance or the recent mean estimate is slightly too low to capture the current peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to focus on this late April/early May volume. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since on-hand inventory is 0, the base stock calculation will drive the order to cover expected demand for the immediate period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Late April demand (P8-P11) has stabilized at a higher mean of ~234 units compared to the early April average of ~215, resulting in frequent stockouts when inventory is not aggressively managed.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand was 246, which aligns with the higher demand regime identified in recent weeks. Looking at the last 5 periods (P8-P12), demand values are 245, 187, 252, 253, and 246, resulting in a mean of 236.6. The low demand in Period 9 (187) appears to be an outlier in an otherwise higher-volume April/May period. Given that we are entering May, demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' and 'Jersey Basics' is expected to remain firm or increase with warmer weather. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this current regime (~237 units per period). I will also use N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility. The lead time L remains at the promised value of 0 based on consistent history (confirmed every period).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for Period 13 dropped significantly to 147 units, compared to the previously observed high-demand regime in late April (P8-P11) which averaged ~234. This drop may be due to a post-April peak cooling off or general variance; however, given the 'Womens Everyday Basics' category and the mid-May date, we should be cautious not to overreact to one low data point while acknowledging that the very high peaks seen in P11-P12 (253, 246) might have passed. The average demand across the last 6 periods (P8-P13) is 213 units. By using recent_N with N=6, we capture this recent volatility while protecting against the lower demand seen in Period 13. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Starting on-hand is 114, which covers a significant portion of expected demand, but an order is still necessary to maintain the service level (Target Service Level q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in May; Period 13 showed a significant drop to 147 units after a sustained late-April high-demand regime of ~234 units (P8-P12).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776033' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) has entered a clear downward demand regime in May 2019. Demand dropped from an April average of ~234 units (P8-P12) to 147 (P13) and now 114 (P14). This suggests a transition out of the spring peak. The last two periods (P13-P14) average 130.5 units, which is a ~45% decrease from the late-April peak. Current on-hand inventory is 145 units, which already covers more than one period of the current demand level. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs ($1/unit/period) during this decline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to prioritize the most recent data points (including the last high period P12 to buffer slightly) while acknowledging the downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in May 2019: Significant downward trend confirmed over two periods (P13-P14) with demand dropping from a ~234 unit average to 130.5 units (-45%).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts has clearly shifted into a lower volume regime as of mid-May 2019. After a period of high demand (averaging ~234 units through late April), actual demand in Periods 13, 14, and 15 was 147, 114, and 138 respectively. This yields a three-period average of 133 units, representing an approximate 43% decrease from the previous peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs in this lower demand environment while maintaining a safety stock to cover volatility (standard deviation remains meaningful), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new, lower May demand level.

Carry-over insight: May 2019 demand regime shift confirmed: Demand dropped from a ~234 unit average (P8-P12) to a sustained 133 unit average (P13-P15), a decline of ~43%.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Basic T-shirt' has transitioned into a lower June regime. Initial peaks occurred in February (~268) and late April (~253), but demand has significantly cooled since early May. The last four periods (P13-P16) show demand values of 147, 114, 138, and 125, resulting in a stable four-period average of 131 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as predicted. I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 to capture the current stabilized low-demand level (P13-P16) while ensuring we maintain enough stock for a 130-140 unit average demand. Setting L to default (0) and using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will align the inventory levels with the currently observed May/June seasonal baseline.

Carry-over insight: June 2019 demand regime confirmed: Four-period stable average of 131 units (P13-P16), a 44% reduction from the late-April peak (~234).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand spiked unexpectedly to 219 units, breaking the previously observed stability of ~131 units (P13-P16). While the carry-over insight noted a stable June regime, this latest observation suggests either a shift in the June trend or higher volatility than anticipated for t-shirts as we enter the summer season. Since the product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, it is susceptible to weather-driven demand fluctuations in June. The on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units). To avoid further lost sales while acknowledging the recent spike, I will update mu_hat using a recent_N window of 5 periods (P13-P17) to capture both the low May volume and the high P17 spike, resulting in an average of approximately 148.6 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 and 18 showed a sudden and significant demand spike, returning to levels similar to the late April peak (~240-260 units), even though the previous 5 periods (P13-P17) averaged around 130 units. This suggests a new demand regime shift starting in early June. Specifically, demand in P17 (219) and P18 (262) indicates a return to high volume. Given on-hand inventory is 0 and the actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods, I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for this new higher regime (averaging 240) to prevent further stockouts. sigma_hat is also set explicitly to handle the increased volatility seen in this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in June 2019: Demand spiked from a May average of ~131 units to 219 (P17) and 262 (P18), averaging 240.5 (+83%). This marks a return to high-volume levels similar to the March/April peak.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776033 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a sharp upward demand trend. Demand in June 2019 has increased for three consecutive periods: 219 (P17), 262 (P18), and 371 (P19). The 371-unit demand represents a significant acceleration beyond the late-April peak (~234) and the previous June average (~240). This seasonality aligns with the onset of peak summer. We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand inventory). Lead time remains stable at 0. To capture this growth and minimize lost sales, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this specific June acceleration (average 284 units). Calculating sigma_hat over a slightly wider range (N=5) to account for recent volatility. This aggressive setting targets high service levels during this seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed in late June 2019: demand spiked from a May average of ~131 units to 219 (P17), 262 (P18), and 371 (P19), averaging 284 units over the last 3 periods (+117% from May).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' has entered a significant summer peak. After a period of stagnation and stockouts in P17-P19, the demand reached a new high in P19 (371), slightly easing in P20 (306). The current 3-period average (P18-P20) is 313 units, compared to the May baseline of 131 units. Given the seasonality of basic t-shirts in July, I expect this high-demand regime to persist. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this elevated average (313 units) and sigma_hat with N=3 to account for the increased volatility (std dev approx 54.5). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed for July 2019: P17-P20 average demand is 289.5 units, up from P13-P16 average of 131 (+120%). Demand peaked at 371 units in mid-June.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776033 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a sustained summer peak demand regime. In July 2019, demand has been consistently high: 371 (P19), 306 (P20), and 320 (P21), confirming the shift noted in the Carry-over Insights. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 295.6 units. Given the high demand and the relatively low profit-to-holding-cost ratio (Profit $4, Holding $1, suggesting a service level target of ~80%), I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current high-demand regime while including the recent volatility (range 219-371).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776033 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand summer regime. Over the last six periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged 284.8 units, though Period 22 dropped to 231 units from the P19 peak of 371. This suggests demand remains elevated but may have passed its absolute peak. Actual lead time consistently matches the promised 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while account for recent volatility (range 219-371), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this specific high-volume summer window (P17-P22). This ensures the base stock reflects the current sustained demand level of ~285 units without being overly biased by the significantly lower May/early June figures.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' remains in its summer peak regime (Late-June/July). Recent demand history: P17(219), P18(262), P19(371), P20(306), P21(320), P22(231), P23(272). The 7-period average is 283 units. While P22 and P23 show a slight softening compared to the P19 peak, the volumes are still significantly higher than the May average (~131). Given the current date (July 22), we expect demand to remain high for the rest of summer. I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture this current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history.

Carry-over insight: Summer high-demand regime (July) sustained: P17-P23 average is 283 units, confirming a plateau around ~280-300 units following the mid-June spike.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirts' is currently in a sustained summer high-demand regime. Analysis of Period 17 through Period 24 shows an average demand of 288.75 units. While the most recent three periods (P22-P24) have slightly lower demand (231, 272, 229; avg: 244), the broader July context and previous spikes (up to 371) suggest maintaining a robust stock level. Given the promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable (all orders arrived same-period), I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (covering the start of the summer surge) to capture this higher mean while acknowledging the recent stabilization. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for the volatility seen in this regime (range: 229 to 371).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Women's Everyday Basics T-shirts' is showing a clear deceleration after the July peak. Demand has dropped for four consecutive periods (320 -> 231 -> 272 -> 229 -> 175). Period 25 demand (175) is significantly lower than the July average of ~283. Using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (average 226.75) correctly captures this downward trajectory while providing a safety buffer against the volatility seen in Period 23. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy (146), so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to meet the updated base stock for the next period.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration from summer peak confirmed: Demand has trended downwards in August 2019, with the most recent sample (P25) at 175 units, significantly below the July peak average of ~283.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt (610776033) is clearly in a deceleration phase following the July summer peak (~283 units). The most recent two periods (P25-P26) show demand has settled into a lower range of 171-175 units, a significant drop from the previous sustained high. This seasonal cooling in August is consistent with retail patterns for basic summer gear as the 'Back to School' transition begins. Given this stabilization at a lower level, I am setting \u03bc\u0302 based on the most recent 2 samples (averaging 173 units) to avoid over-ordering and incurring holding costs. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use a larger N for \u03c3\u0302 (N=5) to capture enough volatility from the recent transition while acknowledging the lower mean.

Carry-over insight: August 2019 demand deceleration confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a lower average of ~173 units (P25-P26) compared to the July peak average of ~283 units (-39%).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' continues its post-summer deceleration in August. Demand over the last three periods (P25-P27) has been 175, 171, and 158 units respectively, averaging 168 units. This confirms the downward shift from the July average of ~283 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this local stabilizing trend at a lower volume, while maintaining sigma_hat on the same window to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent history (P27 arrived in P27). This approach reduces the risk of overstocking and high holding costs as we exit the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Late August 2019 demand stabilization confirmed: P25-P27 average demand is 168 units, representing a 41% decrease from the July peak average (~283).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt', which exhibited a significant summer peak in June/July (averaging ~289 units) and has recently decelerated as we enter late August. Period 28 demand (Aug 19) was 194 units, slightly higher than the preceding three-period average of 168 (P25-P27), but still confirmed to be in a lower-demand regime compared to July. The stock ended Period 28 at 0 on-hand with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while respecting the cooling demand, I will use a recent_N window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat covering the transition from August deceleration to the current period (P25-P28), capturing the average demand of approximately 174.5 units per period. This balances the risk of further deceleration with the slight uptick seen in Period 28.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776033 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a post-summer stabilization phase. Demand has settled at a lower level compared to the July peak (avg ~283). Over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), demand has averaged 175.2 units (range 158-194). The most recent demand was 178. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized August/early September regime. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, matching the promised lead time, so I will continue using the default lead time setting. On-hand inventory is low (10 units), so the OR backend will trigger a substantial order to meet the base stock requirements for the current period.

Carry-over insight: Early September 2019 demand stabilization confirmed: P25-P29 average demand is 175 units, reflecting a 38% decrease from the July peak of ~283 units and signaling the end of the summer season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Everyday Basics' T-shirt has entered a low-volume stability phase following the summer peak and August drawdown. Demand in Period 30 dropped to 117 units, the lowest since mid-May and significantly below the late-August average of ~175 units. This suggests a seasonal shift into September. We are moving from a summer regime (~280 units) through a transition phase (~175 units) into a likely lower autumn baseline. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this most recent deceleration (P28-P30 average is 163 units) while recognizing the Period 30 dip. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (P26-P30) would result in a mean of ~163.6, which provides a safe buffer against the recent volatility (194, 178, 117) while preventing excessive overstocking as demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Mid-September 2019 demand shift: Demand dropped to 117 in Period 30, below the previous stability level of ~175 units. P28-P30 average is 163 units, indicating a further ~7% decline from the late-August baseline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' is continuing its post-summer seasonal decline as we move into mid-September. Period 31 demand was 109 units, following Period 30's 117 units. This represents a sustained shift lower than the August average of ~170. The current 3-period average (P29-P31) is 134.7 units, but the most recent two weeks (P30-P31) are even lower at 113 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs in a declining market while maintaining a 5:1 service level (Profit $4, Holding $1), I will use a shorter window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the downward trend without being overly influenced by August's higher volumes. On-hand inventory is 80 units, so the system will order to reach the new calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Mid-September 2019 demand deceleration: Demand has dropped to an average of 113 units over the last two periods (P30-P31), representing a ~35% decrease from the late-August stability level of ~175 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' continues to decline as the summer peak fades and we move into late September. Period 32 demand was 83 units, continuing a downward trend from 117 (P30) and 109 (P31). The average demand over the last three periods (P30-P32) is approximately 103 units, which is a significant drop from the early September/late August stabilization level of ~175 units. This suggests a post-summer regime shift. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs in this declining demand environment, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (targeting the current ~103 unit mean) and adjusting sigma_hat similarly to reflect the reduced volatility at these lower volumes.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift confirmed in late September 2019: Average demand has dropped to 103 units (P30-P32), representing a 41% decrease from the late-August stability level of ~175 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Everyday Basics' Jersey T-shirt has entered a distinct post-summer/early-autumn regime as of late September (starting Period 30). The most recent demand samples are 117, 109, 83, and 117 (P30-P33), which confirms a stabilization at a much lower level than the August average (~175). Specifically, the average of the last 4 periods is 106.5 units. Given that Period 34 (September 30) transitions into October, I expect this stabilized baseline to persist or slightly decline further as it moves away from warmer weather. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To align the OR backend with this lower demand while maintaining a buffer for occasional bounce-backs (like Period 33's 117), I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the current regime's mean (~106.5) and lower volatility compared to the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed: P30-P33 average demand is 106.5 units, down ~40% from the late-August stability level of ~175 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for the 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt'. Historically, demand for this SKU dropped significantly in September. The last five periods (P30-P34) show demand of 117, 109, 83, 117, and 68, averaging 98.8 units. The most recent observation (P34) of 68 units is the lowest recorded in this regime, suggesting a potential further deceleration as we move deeper into autumn. Actual lead time remains consistent with the promised 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs ($1.0/unit) while maintaining a service level for this high-margin item ($4.0 profit), I am using a recent_N approach with N=5 to capture the stabilized post-summer mean (~99 units) and its associated volatility. This N=5 window (P30-P34) specifically covers the September-October transition, filtering out the higher August residuals.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime further decelerated in early October: P30-P34 average is 98.8 units, a ~43% reduction from the late-August level of ~175 units. Period 34 demand (68) is the lowest in this regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776033 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a significant downward trend in October, likely due to the end of the summer season. Period 34 demand was 68 and Period 35 demand was 49, the lowest recorded since the pre-game samples. The 5-period average (P31-P35) is 85.2 units, but the most recent two periods suggest a deeper decline (average 58.5). Given the current on-hand inventory of 69 units and the clear downward trajectory, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this late-season deceleration while preventing over-ordering. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: October 2019 demand deceleration: Demand has dropped significantly in early October, with P34-P35 averaging 58.5 units, a ~40% decrease from the September stabilization level of ~99 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt has entered a significant downward trend as we move into late October. Historically, we saw a peak in July (~283 units) followed by a stabilizing decline. However, October has shown sharp drops: P34 (68), P35 (49), and P36 (31). The last three periods (P34-P36) average 49.3 units, compared to the early October average of ~99. Given the nature of a 'lightweight jersey t-shirt', this decline is consistent with the transition to cooler weather. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this most recent deceleration and avoid overstocking into the winter season, while maintaining safety stock (sigma_hat) based on the volatility of this new low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Late October 2019 demand collapse: Average demand has fallen to 49.3 units (P34-P36), a ~50% drop from the early October level of ~99 units. This suggests the end of the seasonal lifecycle for this lightweight basic item.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776033 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a clear end-of-season decline as of late October. Demand has fallen from a summer peak of ~283 units to a very low level, with the last four periods (P34-P37) recording 68, 49, 31, and 49 units respectively. The average for this terminal regime is approximately 49 units. With 28 units currently on-hand and a promised/actual lead time of 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this low-volume regime. Using recent_N=4 captures the October deceleration while providing enough volume to avoid immediate stockouts if a minor late-season fluctuation occurs. The sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility at this lower mean. The lead time remains at the default of 0, as confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history.

Carry-over insight: Late October 2019 demand floor: Demand has stabilized at a low average of 49.3 units (P34-P37) following the seasonal peak, confirming the end of the high-demand cycle for this item.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which has moved into a clear end-of-season demand floor. Current date is 2019-11-04. The demand has stabilized at a low level following a significant collapse in October. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand values were 68, 49, 31, 49, and 27, yielding an average of 44.8 units. The most recent three periods (P36-P38) average 35.7 units. Given the seasonal nature of the 'lightweight' description and the approaching winter months, I expect demand to remain at this floor or continue a slight decline. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to encompass the stabilization phase, which results in a forecast of approximately 45 units per period. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. This conservative setting aims to satisfy the low remaining demand while minimizing holding costs on excess stock at the end of the item's lifecycle.

Carry-over insight: November 2019 demand floor confirmed: P36-P38 average demand is 35.7 units, indicating a continued low-volume state consistent with winter seasonality for lightweight apparel.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is experiencing a late-autumn/early-winter demand floor. Recent demand (P36-P39) shows a consistent low average of 33.25 units (31, 49, 27, 26). Specifically, the last two periods (P38-P39) averaged 26.5 units. Given the transition into mid-November, I expect demand to remain at this low baseline. The current on-hand inventory is 33 units, which almost covers one full period of expected demand. To maintain a safe but lean stock level and avoid holding costs for an out-of-season item, I will use a 4-period window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the stability of the current low-demand regime (starting around P36) while smoothing out the minor spike seen in P37. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', a basic summer item now entering the late-November winter season. Demand has stabilized at a very low 'floor' regime. Over the last five periods (P36-P40), demand samples are 31, 49, 27, 26, and 25, resulting in a mean of 31.6 units. The most recent three periods (P38-P40) show even tighter stability with a mean of 26 units and very low volatility. Given the current date (2019/11/18) and the product description, I expect this low-volume state to persist until the end of the game (P47). The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) to set the demand mean (mu_hat) while keeping sigma_hat also tied to this recent regime to prevent over-ordering as we approach the game's end. Current on-hand is 18, so another small order will be triggered to maintain the target base stock of approximately 30-35 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor for winter season (Nov 2019) confirmed: P38-P40 average is 26 units, down from the Oct average of ~49 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a deep winter trough. Late November (Period 41/42) demand has reached its lowest recorded levels of 12 units, down from the October/early November floor of ~25-30 units. The 3-period average (P39-P41) is now 21 units, but the most recent sample of 12 indicates a possible further contraction or simply high volatility at low volumes. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), we still aim for a ~80% service level, but we must avoid overstocking a seasonal item nearing year-end. I am setting N=3 for demand and sigma to capture this most recent winter floor (P39-P41: 26, 25, 12). Lead time remains stable at 0. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover the current period's demand (L+1=1).

Carry-over insight: Late November demand floor contraction: Period 41 demand dropped to 12 units, significantly below the previous mid-November stabilization level of ~25 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776033 (Womens T-shirt) is currently in a low-demand winter regime. However, Period 42 showed a significant demand spike to 64 units, which is uncharacteristic for late November (averaging ~26 units in recent periods). This spike resulted in a stockout (on-hand is now 0). While this could be a pre-holiday anomaly or a promotion, the product description ('lightweight jersey') suggests it is not a peak winter item. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (averaging P40-P42: (25+12+64)/3 = 33.6) to bridge the gap between the winter floor and this recent spike, ensuring enough inventory to capture potential holiday demand while minimizing holding cost for a seasonal laggard. L remains 0 based on consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike in late November: Period 42 demand jumped to 64 units from a previous 3-period average of ~21 units.

The SKU 610776033 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is exhibiting a late-year demand spike, likely associated with holiday shopping or early pre-spring stocking. Demand in Period 42 (64 units) and Period 43 (63 units) has significantly exceeded the November floor of ~20 units. This represents a new regime shift. I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to capture this sudden increase (averaging ~46 units including the P41 low of 12) while maintaining lead time L=0 (matching promised and recently observed performance). sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent high volatility compared to the stable November period. This set of parameters balances the need to capture the current upward momentum while acknowledging the historical risk of stockouts during regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in late November/December: Demand increased from a ~21 unit average to 63.5 units (P42-P43) (+200%). This spike breaks the winter floor pattern observed in early November.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776033 (Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a highly volatile demand phase during December 2019. After a sharp demand increase in late November (P42=64, P43=63), demand unexpectedly dropped to 12 in P44. This follows the pattern observed in the 'Carry-over Insights', where late November/December saw a break from the winter floor. Given the date (Dec 16), we are likely seeing pre-holiday volatility. The current on-hand inventory is 60 units. With L=0 confirmed in P44, I will use a conservative recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to average the recent spike and the current drop (avg ~46), and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the high volatility (64, 63, 12). This ensures we remain responsive to another potential pre-holiday spike without overstocking if demand remains low.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776033 (Women's Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in the Christmas/late December period (2019/12/23). Historical data shows a late November/early December spike (P42=64, P43=63) followed by a significant drop in mid-December (P44=12, P45=7). This pattern indicates the 'holiday rush' has ended, and we are entering the post-holiday/winter clearance or low-activity regime. Current on-hand inventory is 62 units, which is high relative to the most recent demand (7 units). Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs profit of $4.0, maintaining high stocks during this low-demand phase is inefficient. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (P43-P45) to capture this recent deceleration while acknowledging the sharp drop. Lead time remains stable at 0. No new orders are likely needed given existing stock levels and the 'min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)' logic, but these parameters will accurately reflect the new lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand collapse confirmed: Demand dropped from a late-November spike of ~63 units to an average of 9.5 units in mid-December (P44-P45), consistent with end-of-season for lightweight jersey basics.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776033 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a post-holiday demand collapse, consistent with late December seasonality for a lightweight jersey item. Demand has dropped dramatically from the late-November spike (average ~63.5) to a very low volume state: Period 44 (12), Period 45 (7), and Period 46 (6). The current average over the last three periods is approximately 8.33 units. On-hand inventory is currently 56 units, which at the current demand rate, covers over 6 periods of supply. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0, the target service level is approximately 80%, but with significantly excess stock relative to the new low-demand regime, the priority is to avoid ordering and allow on-hand inventory to bleed down. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect this collapse and keep L at 0 (consistent with historical data). This will result in a near-zero order from the OR backend since on-hand (56) >> base_stock (calculated from mu_hat ~8.3).
