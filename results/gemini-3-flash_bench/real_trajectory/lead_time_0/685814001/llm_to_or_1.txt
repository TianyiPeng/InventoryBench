Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a Men's Hoodie. Looking at the provided historical data (Jan 7 to Feb 4), the demand has shown a clear upward trend: 61, 41, 106, 145, 133. The average demand across these 5 weeks is 97.2, but the most recent two weeks (145 and 133) suggest a higher regime compared to early January. February demand for hoodies is typically stable or slightly increasing before spring. Given the trend, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the mean of all available history while acknowledging the recent growth. Promised lead time is 0. I will monitor for actual lead-time shifts in the next period. Calculating mu_hat: (1+L) * mean = 1 * 97.2. Calculating sigma_hat: sqrt(1+L) * std \u2248 1 * 44.5.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a basic jersey hoodie for men. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show values: 61, 41, 106, 145, 133. Period 1 actual demand was 91. The average demand across these 6 samples is approximately 96. Period 1 confirmed a lead time of 0 periods (ordered 136, arrived 136). The inventory dropped to 45 units after selling 91 units. Since lead time is 0, the OR backend's default base-stock calculation uses (1+L) * mu. To capture the recent variability and the slight downward trend from the late Jan peak (145, 133 to 91), I will use the last 4 samples (145, 133, 91 and the Jan 21st value of 106) to calculate a more responsive mean, while sticking to the calculated lead time which confirms the promise of 0. Using recent_N for mu and sigma allows the model to stay sensitive to post-holiday normalization.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a basic cotton hoody. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), allowing for highly responsive inventory planning. Demand has shown a significant upward trend recently: 91 units in Period 1 and 151 units in Period 2 (where we stocked out). Comparing this to the pre-game history (avg ~97 for Jan/early Feb), the last two weeks suggest a higher demand regime, likely due to late-winter seasonal preferences for basic hoodies. In Period 2, we exhausted all 140 units on-hand, indicating demand was at least 151. I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to incorporate the recent spike and pre-game data, ensuring the model reacts to the higher volume. Since volatility has also increased with the volume, I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to provide a sufficient safety buffer (z-score for $4 profit/$1 holding cost is ~0.84, which targets roughly a 80% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 1: avg increased from ~97 to ~121+ units/week as of Period 2 conclusion.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th. We are managing a basic jersey hoodie. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 97.2 units/week, but recent performance from Period 1-3 shows an average of 107 units/week with high volatility (79 to 151). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time = 0 for all 3 periods). As we move into March, demand for standard hoodies often remains steady or slightly higher due to transitional weather. The current on-hand inventory is 72. I will use a recent_N calculation for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh recent volatile demand behavior more heavily. Since the lead time is stable at 0, using the default (promised) method is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $150.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a basic hoodie. Historical demand shows a period of high demand (up to 151) followed by a cooling off in the last two periods (79 and 58). With the 'carry_over_insight' noting a previous shift, the most recent four periods (Post-Jan samples) show a mean of 94.75. However, since the Hoodie is a basic item and demand can be volatile, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most current trend (last 4 periods of official game history). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. On-hand inventory is 82, which is sufficient if demand remains low, but given the volatility (high of 151), the OR backend needs to maintain a buffer. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time and use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the post-January behavior most heavily.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th (Period 6). The SKU is a cotton-blend hoodie. Historically, we saw a demand jump in Feb (Periods 1-2) which stabilized somewhat in Periods 3-5 (79, 58, 101). The historical average from the provided training data (early 2019) was 97.2, and including the game history of 5 periods (91, 151, 79, 58, 101), the mean is 96.0. There is no clear evidence of a sustained shift away from the 95-100 range yet, though Period 2 was an outlier high. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all 5 game periods (ordered and arrived in the same period). Given promised lead time is 0, I will use L=0. For mu_hat, considering we are in mid-March, demand for hoodies typically holds steady or begins a slight seasonal decline as spring approaches, but since current on-hand is low (28), I need to ensure the base stock is replenished. I'll use the recent 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current game dynamics (average ~96) over the long-term training historical data which dates back to January. This balances the high demand spikes with recent moderate activity.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is March 25th. We have historical demand data for the last 6 periods plus 5 initial samples. Demand has been volatile: [61, 41, 106, 145, 133, 91, 151, 79, 58, 101, 64]. The mean of all 11 samples is 93.6 units, while the mean of the most recent 6 periods (the current game session) is 90.6 units. A previously noted 'regime shift' in Period 3 was based on a small sample; subsequent data (Periods 3-6) shows demand fluctuating significantly (79, 58, 101, 64), suggesting the 'shift' may just be high variance. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been 100% consistent throughout all 6 concluded periods. Since lead time is 0, the backend base stock formula reduces to \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent demand behavior while maintaining stability against the higher variance observed in earlier weeks.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-04-01. The product is a basic hoodie. Historical demand shows a period of higher demand in February (averaging ~107 over Periods 1-5, following the pre-game samples of ~97.2), but the last two periods (Period 6 and 7) have seen a significant drop to 64 and 59 units respectively. This suggests the earlier 'regime shift' may have been a late winter peak that is now normalizing as spring begins. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 60 units. Given the recent drop in demand, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the most recent 3 periods (Periods 5-7, average 74.6) to avoid overstocking while maintaining a safety buffer. I will use recent_N for both mean and standard deviation to respond to this cooling demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand normalizing from late-winter peak: average demand decreased from ~107 (P1-P5) to ~61 (P6-P7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The inventory status is 48 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. The history shows a clear seasonal shift: early demand (P1-P5) averaged 96.0 units, while recent demand (P6-P8) has dropped to an average of 56.3 units (64, 59, 46). This downward trend aligns with the product being a garment (hoodie with soft brushed inside), which naturally sees lower demand as spring progresses into April. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time 0 observed in all periods). To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in a declining seasonal market, I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand regime. L is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Post-winter demand decline confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~96 (P1-P5) to ~56 (P6-P8), a ~40% reduction as weather warms.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Hoodie) is experiencing a structural decline in demand as the environment shifts into mid-April (spring), moving away from its peak winter performance. The recent demand cycle confirms this: Period 8 (46 units) and Period 9 (26 units). The 'conclude' messages show the lead time remains consistent at 0 periods (same-period arrival). To avoid overstocking while demand is trending downward, I am using recent_N (N=4) to weight the forecast toward the late-March and April performance (avg ~48.75 units), which reflects the warming weather pattern better than the full-history average. On-hand inventory is 39 units, with 0 currently in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend is confirmed bearish as of Period 9: The 2nd derivative of demand is negative (down from ~60 to ~26), marking the end of the sweatshirt season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'RICHIE HOOD' (hoodie), which is highly seasonal. As we move further into spring (late April), demand is consistently dropping. In Period 10, demand reached a new low of 15 units. Historical demand from the start of April (P8-P10) averages 29 units, but the most recent two periods (P9-P10) average only 20.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 49 units, which is more than double the most recent demand. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent excess holding costs as the season ends, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current low-demand environment (approx. 29 units per week), and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower demand regime. This will likely result in a very small or zero order, allowing on-hand inventory to bleed down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: April demand (P8-P10) has dropped to an average of ~29 units/week, down from the ~60 units/week observed in March, signaling the end-of-season for hoodies.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. We are managing a hoodie, a product highly sensitive to warmer spring weather. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm a significant downward trend in demand since March, with April averaging ~29 units/week before a sudden spike to 90 in Period 11, which caused a stockout (on-hand is 0). This spike appears anomalous compared to the multi-period decline (46 -> 26 -> 15 units). Given that the service level target q is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), we need to replenish inventory. However, we must be cautious not to overstock as seasonal demand for heavy hoodies usually finishes by May. For Period 12, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the recent low-demand period while factoring in the Period 11 spike for a balanced safety stock. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustment.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Richie Hood) has shown a surprising resurgence in demand over the last two weeks (90 units in Period 11 and 90 units in Period 12), despite the previous bearish seasonal outlook for May. This demand spike has caused stockouts (ending inventory 0 for two consecutive periods). Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there is nothing in-transit, I must set the OR parameters to capture this renewed demand momentum immediately. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the average of the last three periods ([15, 90, 90] / 3 = 65 units/period), which provides a balanced adjustment between the earlier low and the recent high. I will use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in these recent swings.

Carry-over insight: Counter-seasonal demand spike detected: Late April/Early May demand jumped from ~20 to ~90 units/week despite spring warming, signaling potential clearance sales or a secondary peak.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Men's Hoodie) is experiencing a high-volatility secondary peak in late spring (May). After a dramatic drop to ~20 units/week in early April (P9-10), demand unexpectedly spiked to ~90 units/week (P11-12) and has now settled at 49 units (P13). This transition suggests the previous bearish forecast (Period 11) was premature or interrupted by a promotional event. However, since it is mid-May, the long-term trend for thick hoodies should still be downward. I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this new volatility (averaging ~76 units/period), providing enough stock to cover the recent spike while remaining cautious of the seasonal exit. Sigma_hat is set using a recent_N of 5 to account for the high variance between 15 and 90 units seen recently. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand peak observed in late April/early May (P11-P13 avg: 76) contrasts with early April lows (P9-P10 avg: 20), indicating high late-season volatility for this hoodie.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Richie Hood) is experiencing high late-season volatility. Following a sharp counter-seasonal demand spike in late April/early May (Periods 11-12 demand = 90), demand is now cooling as we approach late May (Period 13=49, Period 14=36). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met. My analysis focuses on capturing this cooling trend after the secondary peak. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to average the spike (90, 90) with the recent drop (49, 36), resulting in a forecast that respects the cooling momentum while maintaining a safety buffer for the high volatility recently observed. I will also use recent_N=4 for volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the increased variance seen during this secondary peak period. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the risk of stockouts during volatility against the cost of carrying excess hoodie inventory into the summer months.

Carry-over insight: Post-secondary peak cooling: Demand has trended down for two consecutive weeks (49, 36) following the late-season spike of 90.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-27. We are deep into the spring/summer season for this 'Richie Hood' sweatshirt. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal decline from the early spring average of ~80 to a recent trend. Although Period 11 and 12 saw a brief secondary spike (90 units), demand has since stabilized and trended lower: 49, 36, and 39 units over the last three weeks. Given the product type and warming weather, I expect demand to remain low. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. With 51 units on hand and 0 in transit, we are well-positioned to meet the current demand of ~41 units/week (average of the last 3 periods). I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent stabilization (N=3) to prevent overstocking as the product enters its off-season, and use recent_N for sigma to account for the late-season volatility observed in May.

Carry-over insight: Demand has settled into a lower late-spring regime following the secondary May spike; P13-P15 average demand is 41 units/week.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. The product is a hoodie (Richie Hood) transitioning into the summer season. Historical demand shows a significant decline from the winter peak (90-150 units) to a more stable late-spring regime. After a brief secondary spike in early May, demand has consistently stabilized. The last three periods (P14-P16) recorded demands of 36, 39, and 27 units, averaging 34 units/week. Given the warming weather in June, demand for sweatshirts is expected to remain low or continue a slow decline. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a service level for the remaining customers, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4, which includes the post-spike stabilization) and sigma_hat similarly to capture the current volatility. This balances the risk of holding costs ($1) against the profit ($4) during a low-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable low into June: Average demand for P14-P16 is 34 units/week, down from the May secondary spike.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for this hoodie has consistently declined as we enter summer. The last three periods (P15-P17) show a clear stabilizing trend at a lower volume, with demand values of 39, 27, and 17 respectively (average of 27.6 units/week). Previous carry-over insights confirmed a regime shift specifically for the June period. Given that June is historically warmer, demand is expected to remain low. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent low-demand regime, as using a longer window (like the May spike) would result in excess inventory and high holding costs. The lead time remains consistently 0, so \u2018calculate\u2019 is appropriate.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a hoodie, entering mid-June (P19, 2019/6/17). Historical data shows a clear seasonal decline from high winter demand (~100+) to a stable, low summer regime. Over the last four periods (P15-P18), demand has been 39, 27, 17, and 20 respectively, averaging 25.75 units/week. This demonstrates that the secondary May spike has fully subsided and demand is stabilizing at a low baseline suitable for the summer months. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0. Inventory on-hand (17 units) is slightly below the recent 4-week average demand, warranting a small replenishment to maintain service levels while minimizing holding costs (which are significant at $1.0 vs $4.0 profit). I will use a recent_N window of 4 to capture this current low-demand summer regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable low for summer: Average demand for P15-P18 is ~26 units/week, reflecting expected seasonal lows for heavy hoodies in June.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are in the middle of summer, which is the seasonal low for hoodies. Demand has consistently declined over the last few weeks: P17 (17), P18 (20), and P19 (9). The 'summer regime' identified in the carry-over insights is holding, with demand staying well below 25 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for highly responsive inventory adjustments. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the very low recent demand, I am using a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the current summer floor (average ~13.75 units). This will prevent overstocking during this low-demand period while maintaining enough stock to cover the expected weekly demand of approximately 10-15 units.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor established: Demand for P17-P19 averaged ~15 units/week, confirming a deep seasonal trough for heavy hoodies in June.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. We are in the middle of summer, which is the seasonal trough for heavy hoodies ('brushed inside sweatshirt fabric'). Historical demand over the last four periods (P17-P20) has been extremely low: 17, 20, 9, 7, averaging ~13 units/period. The Carry-over Insights from Period 19 and 20 confirm this summer floor. Inventory on-hand is 18 units, which already covers more than one week of current average demand. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the target inventory (base stock) should reflect the low summer mean and low variance to avoid unnecessary holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this established summer floor accurately without being skewed by the May secondary spike.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic Hoodie', which is seasonally counter-cyclic for mid-summer. We just exited the June trough where demand averaged ~10-15 units/week. However, Period 21 saw a jump to 29 units, potentially indicating an early 'Back to School' uptick or a one-off fluctuation. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory went to 0 in Period 21 because the stock was intentionally low for the summer trough. To accommodate a potential early-July uptick while respecting the still-warm weather, I will look at the most recent 3 periods (P19-P21) which reflects the transition out of the absolute summer floor. The average demand for these periods is (9+7+29)/3 = 15 units. Given the stockout in P21, demand was 29, so I will slightly increase the mean to ensure we don't stock out if this upward trend continues toward late summer.

Carry-over insight: Exit from summer demand trough: Mid-July (Period 21) demand increased to 29 units after a 4-week average of ~13 units, signaling a potential early start to late-summer/back-to-school demand recovery.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '685814001' (Richie Hood) has shown a clear break from the summer demand trough. After averaging ~13 units/week in June (P17-P20), demand rose to 29 units in P21 and 44 units in P22. This aligns with the 'Back-to-School' shopping season, which typically begins in mid-July. Current on-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time of 0, I must capture this upward shift immediately to avoid further lost sales. I am identifying a new demand regime starting at P21 and using the last 2 weeks (N=2) as the basis for the forecast. While the logic normally suggests N=3, we only have 2 weeks of the recovery trend, and waiting for a third would lead to more missed demand given the current 44-unit peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to adjust the base stock to these higher levels (~36.5 units mean).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected (Back-to-School recovery): Demand increased from ~13 (P17-P20) to ~36.5 units/week in P21-P22 (+180%).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Hoodie) is experiencing a clear seasonal recovery as of late July (Period 24). Historical demand for the last three periods (P21-P23) has been 29, 44, and 41, averaging 38 units/week. This is a significant jump from the summer floor of ~13 units detected in P17-P20, likely driven by back-to-school shopping. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high stockout risk seen in P21 and P22 (sold < demand), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this upward movement while maintaining a buffer with sigma_hat. This targets a high service level appropriate for a product with a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand recovery confirmed: P21-P23 average demand is 38 units/week, up from summer trough of 13 units (+192%).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Richie Hood) is currently in a back-to-school recovery phase. After a summer trough where demand averaged ~13 units (P17-P20), recent demand has increased significantly: P21 (29), P22 (44), P23 (41), and P24 (26). The recent 4-period average is approximately 35 units/week. While Period 24 saw a slight dip to 26, the overall trend from July (moving into August) suggests a higher demand regime than the deep summer. The Lead Time (L) remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current recovery without overreacting to the P24 dip, I'm setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 (covering the recovery period P21-P24). This averages out the volatility of the back-to-school start. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility seen during this transition compared to the summer floor.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Hoodie) is experiencing a clear Back-to-School demand recovery as we enter August. Period 25 demand spiked to 78 units, significantly exceeding recent averages. The trailing 5-period average (P21-P25) is now 43.6 units, compared to the summer trough of ~13 units. This confirms a sustained upward trend. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the recent demand surge. Lead time analysis through Period 25 conclude shows consistent 0-period fulfillment (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N). To capture the accelerating demand and ensure high service levels during this recovery phase, I am selecting recent_N=5 for mu_hat (averaging ~44) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation of ~20). L remains at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed for Back-to-School season: P25 demand reached 78 units; the 5-week average (P21-P25) has risen to ~44 units/week from the summer trough of ~13 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Hoodie) is experiencing a significant demand acceleration consistent with the August 'Back-to-School' season. Demand has been high for three consecutive weeks (P24-P26: 26, 78, 70), indicating that the summer trough is over and we have entered a higher demand regime. The average demand over the last 6 weeks (P21-P26) is 48.0 units/week, but the most recent two weeks average 74 units/week. Given the date (August 12), demand is expected to continue rising as the weather cools and school seasons start. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 26 due to the backend policy capping orders while demand surged. To prevent further stockouts during this growth phase, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend while being responsive to the latest spikes.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime confirmed: P25-P26 average demand is 74 units/week, a substantial increase from the P21-P24 average of 35 units/week.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Hoodie) is experiencing a powerful demand surge corresponding to the late-August Back-to-School season. For Period 27 (2019/8/12), demand hit 130 units, nearly doubling the previous two-week average of ~74 units. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The demand regime has clearly shifted again from the initial recovery (P21-P24 avg: 35) to an accelerated peak (P25: 78, P26: 70, P27: 130). I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat to capture this specific peak acceleration (average ~93 units/week), while using a larger N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility as we enter the height of the fall season. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration peak detected in mid-August: Period 27 demand reached 130 units, a 1.8x increase over the previous two-week average of 74. Back-to-school peak is now fully active.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Men's Hoodie) is currently in a high-demand Back-to-School peak. Demand has surged significantly, with the last two recorded demand cycles (P27, P28) reaching 130 units each. The date is August 26, which aligns with late August retail peaks. Mean demand over the most recent 4 periods (P25-P28) is 102 units/week. Since the last two weeks showed perfectly consistent demand at 130 units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 135 to account for the current strength of the peak and ensure the base stock is high enough to avoid stockouts. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The \u03c3\u0302 is set to match the recent volatility of the surge. The goal is to maximize capture of this high-volume period despite the high target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), as stockout costs during a peak are substantial.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school peak sustained: Demand stabilized at 130 units/week for P27-P28, a significant increase from the P25-P26 average of 74 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Richie Hood) is in the middle of its Back-to-School/Fall peak. Demand in Period 29 dropped significantly to 58 units from the previous two-week level of 130 units. However, looking at the previous year's trend provided in the historical samples (Jan/Feb), demand for hoodies typically fluctuates between 40-145 units during cold weather. The drop to 58 follows two very high demand weeks (130, 130), which might indicate an inventory-constrained demand stabilization or a temporary dip before the consistent Fall cooling sustains higher volume. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since we have 105 units on hand and demand is volatile during this phase, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat (averaging 130, 130, 58 = ~106) and sigma_hat to ensure we capture the high variance of this transition period while maintaining a high service level for the upcoming autumn weeks.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school peak volatility: Demand shifted from 130 units (P27-P28) to 58 units (P29), indicating high variance as the season moves from peak shopping into consistent Fall demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, demand spiked significantly to 242 units, far exceeding the back-to-school peak average of ~130 units and the previous week's dip to 58. This suggests a major promotion or a 'second wave' of fall shopping as temperatures drop in early September. Given the on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we are entering the core fall season for hoodies (September/October), I must aggressively increase base stock levels to avoid stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this current high-volatility regime (P27-P30 average demand is ~115 units), which allows the OR backend to react to the recent spike while maintaining some awareness of the preceding volume. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall transition demand spike: Period 30 demand reached 242 units, a 4x increase over Period 29 (58) and nearly double the previous peak of 130, signaling intense early-September seasonality/promotional activity.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Hoodie) is experiencing an intense autumnal demand surge. Period 30 saw demand of 242 units and Period 31 saw 217 units, significantly exceeding any previous highs. This aligns with the transition into mid-September and cooler weather. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the target service level is high (80%), but the OR backend's inventory cap will naturally temper extreme orders. To capture the current momentum while accounting for the high volatility (130->58->242->217), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to include the start of the September spike (Periods 28-31: 130, 58, 242, 217). This averages to ~161.75 units per period. Using a larger N (e.g., 5 or 10) would dilute the forecast too much with August data, while a smaller N might react too sharply to the spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift confirmed: Period 30-31 average demand is 229.5 units, a 1.7x increase over the late-August average (130 units), marking the primary fall peak.

Demand over the last three periods (P30-P32) has been 242, 217, and 205 respectively, establishing a stabilized high-demand regime with an average of approximately 221 units per week. Although demand decreased slightly from the absolute peak of 242, it remains significantly elevated compared to August levels. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To maintain a high service level during this peak season while accounting for the high volatility observed (std dev is approximately 19 units over the last 3 samples), I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this September plateau. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to focus on current peak-season variance rather than the lower-variance summer months.

Carry-over insight: September demand plateau confirmed: Period 30-32 average demand is ~221 units/week (242, 217, 205), representing a sustained high-demand regime for the Fall peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 demand spiked to 374 units, significantly exceeding the previous plateau of ~221 units (P30-P32). This indicates a further acceleration in the Fall peak as we move into late September. The product (Richie Hood) is a sweatshirt, which is highly seasonal as temperatures drop. Current on-hand is 0, and lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this new, higher demand level and avoid stockouts during this peak, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to a more responsive window. I will use a recent_N of 4 to encompass the entirety of the high-demand September regime (P30: 242, P31: 217, P32: 205, P33: 374), which averages ~260 units. This approach balances the extreme recent spike with the preceding high-demand baseline. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility (std dev) observed during this peak phase.

Carry-over insight: September demand acceleration: Demand increased from a ~221 average (P30-P32) to 374 in P33, marking a potential secondary peak or further intensification of the Fall sweatshirt season.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October (early Fall), where demand for hoodies typically plateaus or increases as weather cools. Period 33 saw a massive demand spike of 374, followed by 259 in Period 34. The demand regime from P30-P34 averages approximately 259.4 units/week ((242+217+205+374+259)/5), which is significantly higher than the August/back-to-school peak of ~130. Lead time remains stable at 0. Despite high inventory holding costs relative to profit ($1 vs $4), the extremely high volatility (standard deviation of ~68 in the recent regime) requires a robust sigma_hat to prevent stockouts during this critical Fall window. I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand Fall regime.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-demand regime stabilized: P30-P34 average demand is 259 units/week, up from the late-August peak of 130.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001 (Men's Hoodie) is currently in its peak Fall season (October), with high sustained demand. Recent demand samples for Period 31-35 are [217, 205, 374, 259, 240], giving an average of 259 units/week. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory currently has 77 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high volatility and volume of this fall regime. Given that demand can still spike given the nature of sweatshirts in mid-October, capturing the recent high variance is critical to maintain service levels and prevent stockouts seen earlier in the season.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-demand regime confirmed: P31-P35 average demand is 259 units/week with significant volatility (high of 374, low of 205).

Daily Reward (R_t): $529.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Richie Hood has transitioned from its peak in September/early October (average ~259 units in P31-P35) to a lower level in mid-October. Period 36 showed a significant drop to 169 units, possibly indicating the start of a post-peak cooling phase as the initial fall shopping surge subsides. However, as it is late October (10/21), demand is expected to remain substantial throughout the colder months. The most recent demand (P36: 169) is lower than the previous 5-period average, suggesting a downward shift in mean. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to bridge the gap between the extreme September peaks and the current softening, while maintaining enough stock to cover ongoing fall demand. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen during the peak periods, ensuring a sufficient safety stock buffer in case of secondary spikes. Lead time consistently remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling from fall peak: Period 36 demand (169) is 35% lower than the P31-P35 average (259), signaling an exit from the primary September/early-October surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $636.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Richie Hoodie reached a significant peak during September and early October (averaging ~259 units/week), but has recently stabilized into a cooler late-October regime. Period 37 demand was 185 units, following Period 36's 169 units. This suggests the primary Fall surge has passed, and we are entering a sustained high-demand but non-peak phase (likely reflecting typical late-Autumn behavior before any potential Winter/Holiday surge). The observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the extreme September spikes while still protecting against the 185-unit demand levels seen in Period 37, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 (Periods 35-37: 240, 169, 185). This yields an average demand of 198 units/week. Given the zero lead time, the OR backend's capped base-stock policy will use these parameters to maintain sufficient on-hand stock for the current period's demand while minimizing holding costs for the non-peak season.

Carry-over insight: Post-fall peak stabilization: Demand for mid-to-late October (P36-P37) has averaged ~177 units, representing a ~30% decline from the September/Early-October average of ~259.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the post-peak fall season for hoodies. Demand has progressively slowed from the September highs (~259 units/week) to an average of ~169 units/week over the last three periods (P36: 169, P37: 185, P38: 152). This indicates a stabilization around the 150-180 range. Given the product fits into the 'Jersey Basic' category, demand is likely to remain steady or slightly decline until the pre-holiday shopping surge in late November. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this recent stabilization at ~169 units, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, which I will reflect by using 'calculate' to rely on historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late October: P36-P38 demand averaged 168.7 units/week, a ~35% reduction from the September peak regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814001, a hoodie, is currently in its peak fall/winter season (mid-November). Following the intense September peak (~220-250 units/week) and a subsequent cooling period in October (~168.7 units/week), demand has stabilized. The last four periods (P36-P39) show demand of 169, 185, 152, and 175, with an average of 170.25 units. This suggests we have entered a steady late-fall regime. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods. Based on the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend targets a service level that covers ~170 units with a buffer for volatility. Given the stability in this regime over the last 4 weeks, I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this post-peak stabilization while maintaining enough inventory for the impending cold weather demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late fall (November) has stabilized: Period 36-39 demand averaged 170.3 units/week, down ~35% from the September peak (~259) but remaining significantly higher than summer levels.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the late fall demand regime for heavy hoodies. Recent demand has stabilized: P36-P40 demand values are 169, 185, 152, 175, and 189. The average over these last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 174 units/week. This represents a significant decline from the September peak (avg ~259), but demand remains firm as we enter the holiday season. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 after a slight stockout in Period 40 (demand 189 vs 182 sold). I will use the recent 5-period average (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized late-fall regime and its associated volatility. This will signal the OR engine to maintain a base stock sufficient to cover the current 174 units/week demand level with an appropriate safety buffer for the 0-period lead time environment.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late November (Period 42), approaching the traditional peak for sweatshirts and hoodies (Black Friday and holiday season). Recent demand shows an upward trend again: Period 41 demand was 213, higher than the Period 36-40 average of ~174 units. This likely signals the start of early holiday shopping. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent acceleration while respecting the stabilized late-fall baseline, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5. This lookback period (P37-P41) covers the stabilization and the most recent uptick, providing a balanced forecast of 178.8 units/week. Given the high criticality of stockouts in this period and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I am relying on the OR backend's service level logic to buffer for potential December spikes.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand ramp detected: Period 41 demand (213) is 22% higher than the preceding 4-week average (174), signaling the start of the late-year peak season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $808.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Nov 25) saw a massive demand spike to 690 units, coinciding with Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. This is more than 3x the previous holiday ramp-up (P41: 213). Despite this huge spike, the current inventory and in-transit are zero, while demand for early December is expected to remain high due to holiday shopping and cold weather. I am setting L to explicit 0 to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit value of 450 to balance the extreme Black Friday peak (690) with the preceding ramp (213), as demand typically stays elevated but slightly lower than the single peak week during the rest of December. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for the extreme volatility observed in the transition from November to December.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 690 units (+224% vs Period 41), marking the primary Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact for the hoodie category.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Black Friday week), demand peaked at 690 units, causing a stockout. My aggressive order of 661 units in Period 43 arrived (L=0 confirmed) and successfully met the post-peak demand of 156 units, leaving 505 units on hand. We are now in Period 44 (Dec 9), which is typically a high-demand period for hoodies due to holiday gifting, but slightly less intense than the Black Friday spike. Historical data shows that demand often 'levels off' at a high plateau between Black Friday and Christmas. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P41-P43) is 353 units, which is skewed by the 690 spike. The immediate post-peak demand was 156. I expect Period 44 demand to land between the 'normal' late-fall level (~170) and the high-demand level (~250-300) as holiday shopping concludes. Setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods average (~312 units/week) to capture the seasonal elevation while the OR backend's base-stock calculation (at 80% service level) will account for the high sigma seen recently. With 505 units on-hand and L=0, I am well-positioned, but must maintain stock for the final two weeks of December.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday peak stabilization: Following the P42 Black Friday spike (690), demand settled to 156 in P43, suggesting a return to a high-seasonal plateau of ~150-250 units/week through December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday shopping period (Dec 16). After the massive Black Friday spike in Period 42 (690 units), demand has settled into a high-seasonal December plateau. Periods 43 and 44 saw demands of 156 and 249 respectively. Given the 'December' context and the product (Hoodie), we expect sustained high demand through the end of the year, likely staying in the 150-250 range before the post-holiday drop-off. On-hand inventory is currently high (276 units) because of the large order placed in Period 43. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To set parameters, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to focus on the post-spike December regime (P42-P44), which averages 365 units including the spike. This is slightly aggressive given P43-P44 average is ~202, but the OR backend's capping mechanism and our current on-hand of 276 units will naturally moderate the actual order. Using N=3 for sigma_hat reflects the high volatility seen during the holiday transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday December demand regime: Following the Black Friday spike, demand has stabilized at a high-seasonal level of ~200 units/week (P43: 156, P44: 249).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late December (Period 46, Dec 23), following the major holiday peak (Period 42/43) and subsequent high-plateau demand in December (averaging ~250 units in P44-P45). The current on-hand inventory is 349 units. Historical data from early 2019 (P1-P3) suggests demand typically remains high through January and February (avg ~100-120) before declining in the spring. Given we are at the transition from Christmas/New Year into the early Q1 period, demand is likely to stay robust but cool slightly from the December peak of ~250. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most recent December trend (avg ~220 units) as the basis for mu_hat, while ensuring sigma_hat reflects the high recent volatility seen during the holiday surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the transition from the end of the year into the new year. Historically (from the provided 2019-01 data), demand in January starts around 61-106 units, which is lower than the December peak (~200) but higher than summer lows. Period 46 demand was 158, continuing a downward trend from the early December plateau (~250). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 244 units. Given that Period 43 through 46 demand was 156, 249, 257, 158 (average ~205), and we expect a post-holiday cooling toward the January baseline (mean ~97), the existing 244 units on hand are likely sufficient or close to sufficient for the immediate period. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) captures the end-of-year levels, while the OR engine's base-stock calculation will account for the high on-hand inventory to prevent over-ordering during this seasonal descent.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling detected: Period 46 demand (158) is a 38% decrease from the P44-P45 average (~253), signaling a return to winter baseline levels.
