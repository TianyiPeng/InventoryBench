Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 717490002, a 'Cat Tee' (soft jersey t-shirt). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a stable regime: 42, 40, 35, 42, 38. The mean demand is 39.4 units per week with a standard deviation of approximately 2.88. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no in-transit units, we need the OR engine to place an initial order to cover the current period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent stable demand period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/2/18 (Period 2). The product is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt). Looking at the historical demand samples (42, 40, 35, 42, 38), the average is approx 39.4 units per week. In Period 1, the observed demand was 32, which is slightly below the prior average but within a normal range. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirm an actual lead time of 0 (order arrived same period). Inventory is low (8 units on-hand) after Period 1 demand. I will use the 'default' lead time (0) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters using N=6 (including Period 1's demand of 32) to capture the base demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is a basic t-shirt. Historical data (Jan-Feb) shows demand between 35-42 units. In Period 1, demand was 32. In Period 2 (late Feb), demand spiked to 51, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time is 0. Since we are entering late February/early March, demand may be stabilizing at a higher level or exhibiting higher volatility. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent spike while including pre-spike levels (P1=32, P2=51, plus historical samples). For L, 'calculate' is used as the lead time of 0 is consistently observed. For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=5 will better reflect the recent increase in volatility compared to the full history.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490002 is a soft jersey T-shirt (Divided Basics), a product likely to experience a demand increase as we transition from winter to spring (early March). Looking at the history, demand has risen steadily from 32 (P1) to 51 (P2) and 61 (P3). Stockouts occurred in Period 2 and 3, indicating the backend OR engine's default settings (based on low winter history of ~35-42) are under-forecasting current spring demand and failing to account for lost sales. Lead time is consistently 0. I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the upward trend and setting a slightly higher explicit sigma_hat to provide a buffer against the high volatility observed in the last two weeks, ensuring the base stock calculation targets a higher service level to prevent further stockouts during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from P1 to P3: demand increased from 32 to 61 (+90%) as spring approaches. Default historical mean (~39) is now insufficient.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490002 (Cat Tee) is entering the spring season (mid-March), which typically triggers higher demand for basic jersey T-shirts. Historical samples from January/early February averaged ~39 units, but the last three periods (P2-P4) have shown a significant shift with demands of 51, 61, and 47 (average ~53). Specifically, P2 and P3 resulted in stockouts (sold < demand), indicating that the previous parameters were too conservative. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (P1-P4 all arrived within 0 periods). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for current spring demand levels (approx 53 units plus safety stock) while mitigating the risk of further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime confirmed (P2-P4): Mean demand increased from ~39 to ~53 (+35%) compared to early year samples. Consistent lead time of 0 periods verified through P4.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490002' (Cat Tee) is currently in a spring demand regime. In Periods 2-5, demand has been significantly higher (avg ~50.75) than the early January samples (~39). Period 5 saw a demand of 44, which is a slight softening from the peak of 61 in Period 3 but still well above the historical baseline. Current on-hand inventory is 9 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), verified from P1 through P5. To capture the current seasonal regime while respecting the recent slight decline, I will use recent_N with N=4 for demand forecasting. For safety stock (sigma), I'll use the last 5 periods (N=5) to better capture the volatility seen during this transition from winter to spring.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 25th (Period 7). The SKU is a 'Cat Tee', which is seasonally relevant for spring. Historical demand has shown a significant upward trend: P1 (32), P2 (51), P3 (61), P4 (47), P5 (44), and P6 (84). A major demand spike occurred in Period 6 (84 units), causing a stockout as starting on-hand (51) was insufficient. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To address the recent volatility and the high demand peak in P6, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher spring mean (~57.4) and increasing sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased variance seen in the recent stockout event. This will help the OR engine set a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late March (Period 6 spike to 84 units); observed mean for P2-P6 is ~57.4, significantly higher than early year baseline (~39).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, and the product is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt). Demand has experienced an extreme spike, jumping from 84 in Period 6 to 150 in Period 7, representing a massive seasonal surge as spring transitions to warmer weather. The on-hand inventory has been depleted in the last two periods (Sold 51/Demand 84 in P6; Sold 58/Demand 150 in P7), resulting in high lost sales. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand spring peak, I must set parameters that reflect the very recent growth and volatility. I will use the last 3 periods (P5-P7) to calculate the mean (approx 92.7) and standard deviation to capture the sudden shift in demand magnitude and variance, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover these new peaks while balancing the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each).

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand surge confirmed: Demand accelerated from ~53 (P2-P5) to 150 (P7) entering April. The spring regime has shifted into a high-volatility peak.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490002' (Cat Tee) is experiencing a powerful seasonal surge as we enter April (Spring/Summer peak for t-shirts). Historical demand since Period 6 has spiked from double digits to triple digits (84, 150, 118). We have stocked out in the last three periods (P6, P7, P8), which means 'sold' is less than actual 'demand', leading to significant lost sales. The current mean demand over the last 3 periods (P6-P8) is 117.3, but the trend suggests it could remain high or grow further. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set L to 0 using the calculate method. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this high-demand regime, and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (std of the last 3 periods is ~33) to ensure the OR backend sets a high enough base stock to prevent further stockouts in this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P6-P8): demand has shifted to a triple-digit baseline (avg 117.3) as of early April. Frequent stockouts observed since P6 indicate current supply levels are lagging significantly behind seasonal demand.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490002 (Cat Tee) is currently in a high-demand spring season. While Period 9 demand dropped to 64 units, the previous three periods (P6-P8) saw an average demand of 117.3, with a peak of 150 units. The drop in Period 9 (64 units) is still higher than the early-year baseline (~39), but suggests the initial 'peak' surge might be stabilizing or showing higher volatility. Given the 'Cat Tee' category and mid-April date, we remain in a high-demand window. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since we have 54 units on hand and 0 in transit, we need to maintain a base stock that covers potential return to ~100+ unit demand. I will use the last 4 periods (P6-P9) to calculate mu_hat, capturing both the extreme peak (150) and the recent dip (64) to create a balanced forecast (Average ~104). Holding cost equals profit ($1.0), so the OR backend will target a 50% service level by default; setting a higher sigma_hat or using a recent regime for volatility is necessary to prevent the frequent stockouts observed between P6 and P8.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a basic Cat Tee (jersey t-shirt) which has experienced a significant seasonal surge starting in late March/early April (Periods 7-8). While demand peaked at 150 in Period 7 and 118 in Period 8, it has since settled into a more moderate but still elevated regime compared to the early-year baseline, with demand of 64 and 66 in Periods 9 and 10 respectively. The average demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10) is 96.4, but the last two periods suggest a stabilization around the mid-60s. To avoid over-ordering after the peak while still capturing the higher spring baseline, I will use a recent window (N=5) to set mu_hat, which balances the high peak against the recent stabilization. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), suggesting a target service level of 50% from the base_stock formula, though the OR backend's cap mechanism will provide additional safety. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect the increased volatility seen in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization observed (P9-P10): Demand has transitioned from a holiday/seasonal peak (150) to a sustained spring baseline of ~65 units. Previous triple-digit averages are likely too aggressive for late April.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (April 29), demand for this jersey t-shirt has transitioned from its early April peak (150 units) to a stable spring baseline. The last three periods (P9-P11) show demand levels of 64, 66, and 76, indicating a consistent mean of approximately 68.7 units. This represents a significant shift from the triple-digit volatility seen in late March/early April, but remains higher than the early-year baseline. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR engine's target service level (q) is 50%, aiming to stock at the median demand. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this stabilized post-peak regime (P9-P11), effectively ignoring the outliers from the seasonal surge to prevent excessive holding costs as we move further into spring. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the late March spike.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (717490002, Cat Tee) is currently in a post-peak spring regime. After a high-volatility surge in early April (reaching 150 units), demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P9-P12) with values of 64, 66, 76, and 76. The average demand for this steady period is 70.5 units. At the start of Period 13 (May 6th), we are out of stock (Ending Inventory P12 = 0) despite ordering 48 units last period, indicating that the 'cap' logic or current parameters are too restrictive for the actual demand speed. Because lead time is consistently 0, we must ensure 'base_stock' (mu_hat + safety stock) covers the immediate demand for the current period. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the stabilized mean of 70.5 and the recent variance, which is higher than the early-year baseline but lower than the April peak. This should signal the OR backend to increase the order to match the observed ~70-80 unit weekly demand floor.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization confirmed (P9-P12): Demand has leveled to a mean of ~70.5 units per period after the April peak. Stockouts in Period 12 suggest current replenishment levels are slightly below this new baseline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is May 13th. The product is a jersey T-shirt (basic), and we are moving into the warmer summer months. Looking at the demand history, we saw a significant peak in April (up to 150 units) followed by a stabilization period. For the last five periods (P9-P13), demand has been: 64, 66, 76, 76, and 39. The most recent demand (39) shows a sudden drop, but the previous four weeks were consistently around 70. This drop in P13 (39) might be a weekly fluctuation or the beginning of a late-spring cooling, but we should not overreact and stock out again as we did in P12. The mean of the last 5 periods is 64.2. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this post-peak stabilization level while acknowledging the recent lower demand point. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain. The profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, targeting a 50% service level via the base stock formula, which is balanced for a basic garment SKU with high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization continues (P9-P13): Recent demand averages ~64 units after the April surge. A significant dip to 39 in P13 warrants monitoring to see if a new lower baseline is forming for May.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Divided Basics Jersey T-shirt) has transitioned from a high-volatility April peak (peak demand 150) into a stabilized late-spring/early-summer regime. Demand over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) has averaged 62.1 units (64, 66, 76, 76, 39, 54). The most recent demand figures (39 and 54) suggest a cooling from the initial stabilization phase. Using a recent group of 6 periods (N=6) captures this post-peak behavior while smoothing out the dip in P13. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. With Profit and Holding Cost equal ($1.00), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, essentially targeting the median demand to minimize total cost. I will use recent_N=6 to align mu_hat and sigma_hat with this current stabilized demand level.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter late May (Period 16, 2019/5/27), the demand for this 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' remains in its post-peak spring/summer regime. Looking at the last 7 periods (P9-P15), we see a stabilization following the early April peak. Demand values were 64, 66, 76, 76, 39, 54, 63. This averages approximately 62.6 units. The most recent demand (P15) was 63 units, which consumed all available inventory, leaving us at 0 on-hand. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to hold consistently, though the 1-period observation delay persists. Given the Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0). To avoid the frequent stockouts observed (P12 and P15), a slightly more robust N for recent demand is warranted to capture the ongoing summer demand baseline. I will use N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak stable period (P9-P15) while filtering out the volatile April surge.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime (P13-P15) shows stabilization at a lower baseline than April, averaging ~52 units compared to the early April peak of 117. T-shirt demand remains steady into late spring.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16 (2019/5/27), we observed a significant demand spike to 108 units, which is a major deviation from the May average of ~52. This spike likely corresponds to the start of the summer season (June) for basic T-shirts. With on-hand inventory currently at 0, we must adjust for this upward shift. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P13-P16) is 66 units, but the most recent 108 signal suggests a higher summer baseline. Setting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 using recent_N (N=4) captures this latest volatility and the trend change better than long-term averages. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand spike observed at P16: demand surged to 108 units (+100% vs May average), signaling a transition from spring stabilization to summer peak for Jersey basic t-shirts.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a summer demand regime for soft jersey T-shirts (June 10). Previous periods P16 and P17 showed significant demand spikes (108 and 84 units respectively), signaling a departure from the May stabilization (avg ~52). Demand in P17 (84) exceeded the current inventory levels, resulting in a stockout. Given the summer seasonality and recent observed demand, I am shifting the forecast baseline to capture this higher mean. The average of the last two periods is 96. To prevent stockouts during this peak season while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (which yields a 50% target service level), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=2 to represent the summer shift. Sigma_hat is set to 3 periods to capture the volatility seen between 108 and 84 units. Actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P16-P17): Mean demand increased to ~96 units as of June, up from May's baseline of ~52. Frequent stockouts return as demand tracks seasonal peaks.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-06-17, entering the peak summer period for a Jersey Basic T-shirt. Historical data confirms a summer regime shift starting around Period 16 (late May), with recent demand figures of 108, 84, and 72 units. While the most recent period (P18) showed a slight dip to 72, the average for the current summer regime (P16-P18) is 88 units, which is significantly higher than the May average of ~52. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand summer phase, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this higher mean (~88). Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to account for the increased volatility observed since the end of May. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current seasonal trend while acknowledging the high service level requirement (profit/holding cost ratio is balanced at 0.5, but stockouts have been frequent).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (late June), the SKU 717490002 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is solidly in a summer demand regime. Historical demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) shows values of 108, 84, 72, and 100, averaging 91 units per period. The stockout in Period 19 (demand 100 vs 88 on-hand) confirms that the current replenishment level (~64 in P19) is lagging behind the June baseline. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this sustained summer shift and prevent further stockouts during what is likely the seasonal peak, I am selecting recent_N = 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the June demand level (~91) rather than the lower May baseline (~52). The OR backend's service level logic (profit=1, holding cost=1) will target a 50% service level, but given the high volatility and stockout trend, focusing on the most recent 4 periods provides the best balance of responsiveness and stability.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P16-P19) sustains a higher baseline, averaging ~91 units per period compared to May's ~52 units. Frequent stockouts through P19 confirm that supply must align with this ~90+ unit baseline for late June and July.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1) finds the 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' in the middle of a sustained summer demand regime. History from P16 through P20 shows demand levels of 108, 84, 72, 100, and 105. The average for this 5-period window (N=5) is exactly 93.8 units. We are currently experiencing frequent stockouts (P16, P17, P19, P20 starting inventory was insufficient), indicating that the OR backend's default parameters or recent-period estimates need to be aligned with this higher seasonal baseline. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' to reflect this empirical stability and use N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent summer volatility and mean demand, which is roughly 80% higher than the May baseline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (starts 2019-07-01), the SKU experienced a massive demand spike to 393 units, likely corresponding to early July/Summer sales peak for basic t-shirts. My previous baseline of ~91 units was completely overwhelmed, resulting in a stockout where only 94 units were sold. This represents a significant demand regime shift. Given this spike, I need to drastically increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume period. I am choosing N=1 for recent_N to immediately pivot to the 393-unit level, but since the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean(last N), and L=0, setting N=1 will project 393 for the coming period. This might be aggressive if the spike was a one-off, but for basic apparel in peak summer, it is safer to aim high to avoid further massive lost sales. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Extremely high summer demand spike observed at P21 (393 units), representing a ~330% increase over the June average (~91). Current supply levels are severely under-aligned with peak summer demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 23 (July 15), the heart of the summer season for 'Jersey Basic t-shirts'. Period 21 saw an extreme demand spike of 393 units, and Period 22 sustained a very high demand of 264 units. This indicates a massive seasonal shift (~330% increase) compared to the previous June average (~91). Although there was a slight decrease from P21 to P22, demand remains exceptionally high. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts during this peak summer period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new high-demand regime using a recent window (N=3) which captures the surge (P20: 105, P21: 393, P22: 264), resulting in a mean of 254 units. This ensures the base stock level is high enough to handle the peak while the OR backend's cap prevents over-ordering if demand begins to mean-revert.

Carry-over insight: Peak summer demand regime confirmed (P21-P22): Demand has surged to a new baseline (avg ~328) compared to the June baseline (~91). This confirms a massive seasonal peak for basic t-shirts in July.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24 (July 22), the demand has sharply localized. After the massive peak in Period 21 (393 units) and Period 22 (264 units), Period 23 saw a significant drop to 74 units. This suggests we are passing the absolute peak of the summer 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt demand. However, historical data for this SKU shows very high volatility (sigma is high relative to mean). The target is a Jersey Basic t-shirt in late July. While the 300+ unit spikes may be over, recent demand regime (P21-P23) still averages ~243 units. Setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) captures this high-demand July window before August cooling. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the extreme variance seen in July (393 down to 74). L is set to default (0 periods) as all arrivals have been instantaneous. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR engine will optimize around given these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Peak summer demand regime (P21-P22) has shown extreme volatility, with a high of 393 units and a quick drop to 74 units by P23 (late July). This indicates the seasonal peak is very sharp and potentially short-lived.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' is currently in a high-volatility summer peak. After an extreme spike in Period 21 (393 units), demand dropped to 74 in P23 and then rose again to 128 in P24. This pattern suggests that while the absolute peak may have passed, demand remains significantly higher and more volatile than the May baseline (~52 units) or the early June baseline (~91 units). The average demand of the last 4 periods (P21-P24) is 214.75 units, but given the significant drop after the initial spike, I will target a more conservative but responsive regime of the last 3 periods (P22-P24, avg = 155.33) to avoid excessive holding costs as we move toward August. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility phase while reacting to the recent downward shift from the extreme July 1st peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak summer volatility observed (P22-P24): Demand remains elevated (avg ~155) compared to June (~91) but has retreated from the 300+ unit extreme spike seen in early July.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Jersey Basic T-shirt is transitioning out of its peak summer spike (July). Period 25 finished with a demand of 99, following a sequence of 393, 264, 74, 128 since early July. This indicates a volatile but generally downward trend from the extreme peak, settling into a late-summer baseline. The current on-hand inventory is 57. Given the 'soft jersey t-shirt' description and the date (August 5), we expect demand to continue moderating but remain steady before the late-summer/back-to-school transition. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (Periods 22-25) to capture this post-peak stabilization, which yields an average demand of approximately 141 ((264+74+128+99)/4). This compensates for the recent high volatility while acknowledging the retreat from the 300+ unit highs. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle the high variance observed during the July peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak summer stabilization confirmed (P22-P25): Demand has retreated from the extreme July peak (300+ units) to a volatile late-summer baseline averaging ~141 units. Demand is expected to continue a gradual descent as August progresses.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is mid-August (2019/8/12). Historically, this SKU (Jersey Basic T-shirt) experienced a massive July peak (extending to 393 units) and has since shown high volatility as it transitions into late summer. Period 26 demand spiked significantly to 227 units, causing a stockout on the starting inventory of 142. Recent demand (P22-P26) has averaged 158.4 units, but with very high variance (ranging from 74 to 264). The latest 3-period average (P24-P26) is 151.3 units. Given the recent stockout and the high volatility observed in August (227 in P26), I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the post-peak mean (~158) while maintaining high sigma_hat (also N=5) to account for recent spikes. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand spike observed at Period 26 (227 units), interrupting the downward trend from the July peak and confirming continued high volatility in August. Average demand from P22-P26 is ~158 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490002' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a late-summer volatile period. After the massive July peak (393 units), demand has fluctuated between 74 and 227 units. The most recent period (P27) saw demand of 91 units, and the average for the last six periods (P22-P27) is approximately 147 units. The carry-over insights correctly identified a post-peak stabilization at a higher-than-normal baseline (~158 units including the P26 spike). Given we are now in mid-to-late August (P28), I expect demand to gradually trend downwards from the summer highs but remain volatile. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (covering the post-peak window from P22-P27) to capture the current volatile baseline while smoothing out the extreme July spikes. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to account for the heightened volatility observed in August (standard deviation of {264, 74, 128, 99, 227, 91} is ~73.6). This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock sufficient for the current 'high-volatility descent' phase.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand (P22-P27) has stabilized at a volatile baseline of ~147 units, a significant retreat from the 300+ July peak but higher than June (~91). High volatility persists into late August.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late August (2019/8/26). Recent demand has shown high volatility as we move away from the July peak. The 'Post-peak summer stabilization' (P22-P28) shows a mean demand of approximately 138 units (samples: 264, 74, 128, 99, 227, 91, 82). However, the last two weeks (P27-P28) show a significant drop to 91 and 82 units respectively, suggesting a transition into a 'Late Summer/Early Autumn' regime where demand for jersey t-shirts naturally cools. To capture this recent deceleration while respecting the high variance observed in August (e.g., the P26 spike to 227), I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (avg ~124) to balance the high P26 value with the recent cooling trend. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=7 (covering the entire post-peak volatility) to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer against potential late-season spikes. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer transition observed (P27-P28): Demand has dropped below 100 units for two consecutive periods (91, 82) following the volatile August peak, indicating a shift away from the mid-summer baseline of ~140-150 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering September (Period 30), which typically marks a transition from summer peaks to a more stable late-summer/early-fall demand regime for basic t-shirts. History shows high volatility: Period 26 saw 227 units, Period 29 spiked to 193 units, while Periods 27-28 were in the 80-90 range. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P22-P29) is approx 145 units, but this includes the extreme July/August spikes. Looking at the last 3 periods specifically (P27-P29), the mean is 122 units, which better reflects the 'volatile descent' mentioned in carry-over insights. Given the stockout in Period 29 (0 on-hand) and the recent spike to 193, I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the average volatility of the late summer (~145 units) while allowing sigma_hat to account for the significant variance observed during these spikes. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer volatility persists into September (P29 spike to 193 units), contradicting the earlier downward trend and suggesting a volatile baseline of ~120-140 units rather than a sub-100 stabilization.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P27-P30) shows extreme volatility as we enter September, with demand values of 91, 82, 193, and 223. The last two periods (P29, P30) indicate a massive spike (+~140% vs the late August baseline), likely representing a final summer clearance surge or back-to-school peak for jersey t-shirts. My previous estimate of a sub-100 stabilization was incorrect; a new high-volatility regime is active. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this current volatile baseline (avg ~147), which also helps account for the recent stockouts in P29 and P30. A higher sigma_hat is necessary to protect against the 200+ unit peaks seen in the last two weeks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed (P29-P30): Demand has spiked to an average of ~208 units, significantly higher than the late-August baseline (~86). This volatility mirrors the sharp peak seen in early July.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits significant seasonality and high volatility. Period 32 (September 16) follows a sharp September demand surge where Period 29-30 averaged ~208 units, followed by a slight retreat to 135 units in Period 31. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 13). Carry-over insights confirm that the late summer/early autumn transition is volatile, mirroring the sharp spikes seen in July. Given the recent demand samples (193, 223, 135) and the 0-period lead time, I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) to capture this latest September regime. This ensures mu_hat is set to the current high-volatility baseline (~184 units/period) rather than the lower long-term average, protecting against stockouts during this potential secondary seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed (P29-P31): Mean demand has shifted to ~184 units, marking a secondary seasonal peak or high-volatility period compared to the late August baseline (~86).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490002' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is exhibiting a secondary seasonal surge in September, with demand over the last four periods (P29-P32) averaging ~163.5 units (193, 223, 135, 103). While demand dropped in P31 and P32 compared to the start of the month, the baseline remains significantly higher than the late-August dip (~86 units). We are entering late September (P33), where autumn transitions might start cooling demand, but the 'Jersey Basic' category often serves as a layering piece, maintaining relevance. To capture this sustained September volatility while acknowledging the two-period downward trend (from 223 to 103), I will use recent_N with N=4 to set mu_hat, reflecting the recent ~164 average. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to account for the high variance (std ~57) observed during this September peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand volatility (P29-P32) averages ~164 units, establishing a secondary peak higher than late-August levels (~86) but lower than the July extreme (393).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490002' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is exhibiting high volatility in September, with demand fluctuations between 103 and 223 units. The most recent period (P33) saw demand of 172 units, leading to a stockout (ending on-hand: 0). The 'September surge' regime (P29-P33) has an average demand of approximately 165 units (193, 223, 135, 103, 172). Despite the promised lead time of 0, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period. Since we are entering October, demand may start to soften as the weather cools, but given the current stockout and the high volatility observed in P33, I must ensure service levels are maintained. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current ~165 unit baseline, and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the significant variance seen in recent weeks. L remains 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 0-period delivery.

Carry-over insight: September demand volatility (P29-P33) averages ~165 units, confirming a secondary peak or high-volatility regime following the mid-summer peak. High stockout risk persists due to sharp demand fluctuations.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490002 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is entering early October. Historically, the demand has been characterized by sharp seasonal peaks (April and July) followed by high-volatility secondary peaks in September. The recent September data (P29-P33) showed a significant average demand of ~165 units. However, P34 showed a retreat to 93 units, echoing the pattern of post-peak stabilization seen in previous months. Given the product's high volatility and the fact that we are moving deeper into autumn, a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 (covering the entirety of the September volatility and the initial October shift) will capture the current mean of ~136 units while allowing the model to naturally adjust if demand continues to drop. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The chosen parameters aim to buffer against remaining early-October volatility while preventing excessive overstock as we likely move toward a lower late-autumn baseline.

Carry-over insight: Post-September peak stabilization observed (P34): Demand dropped to 93 units after a high-volatility September average of ~165. This suggests a transition from the secondary autumn peak toward a lower baseline as October begins.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 14, 2019. We are entering mid-October, and recent demand (P34: 93, P35: 58) confirms a transition away from the high-volatility September peak (avg ~165) toward a lower autumn baseline. This fits the expected seasonal pattern for a basic t-shirt in autumn. Demand has declined for two consecutive periods, with P35 (58 units) returning close to the May baseline (~52 units). To prevent overstocking and excessive holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I am reducing the demand forecast. I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the start of this downward trend (averaging ~75 units) while maintaining enough buffer for the lingering volatility observed throughout the year. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-October stabilization confirmed (P34-P35): Demand has significantly decreased from the September avg of ~165 to a recent mean of ~75 units, signaling the end of the secondary autumn peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 21st, 2019. We are firmly in the post-September peak period. Demand in the last three periods (P34-P36) has been 93, 58, and 35, averaging 62 units. The most recent demand (35) suggests a continued seasonal decline as we move further into autumn. The carry-over insights confirm this stabilization at a lower baseline. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a decent service level for this jersey t-shirt, I will use a short lookback window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will sensitize the OR backend to the recent downward trend (avg ~62). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late October demand decline confirmed (P34-P36): Demand has dropped from a September high-volatility average of ~165 to a recent 3-period average of ~62 units, with P36 hitting a new seasonal low of 35 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Jersey Basic T-shirt is in a clear late-October/early-November decline. Recent demand samples show a downward trend: P34 (93), P35 (58), P36 (35), and P37 (57), resulting in a 4-period average of 60.75 units. This matches the 'Post-peak stabilization' and 'Late October demand decline' carry-over insights. The current on-hand inventory is 16 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to align with this current low-demand regime (~61 units). Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend naturally targets a 50% service level (z=0), making the base stock equal to mu_hat. This will result in an order of approximately 45 units (61 - 16 = 45), which is sufficient to meet current demand trends while minimizing holding costs as the season winds down.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Jersey Basic T-shirt has stabilized following the volatile September peak. In Period 38, demand was 53 units, and the three-period average (P36-P38) is approximately 48.3 units, confirming the shift toward a lower late-autumn baseline of ~50-60 units. Calendar knowledge suggests that demand for basic t-shirts typically decreases or remains flat in November before potential end-of-year activity. On-hand inventory is currently very low (8 units) with zero in-transit, following a period where no order was placed in P37. To prevent stockouts while avoiding excess holding costs (given profit and holding cost are equal at $1.0), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this stabilized ~48-50 unit regime. L remains at the promised 0 periods as arrivals have been consistently same-period.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand stabilization confirmed (P36-P38): Demand has settled into a baseline of ~48 units, down from the September peak. Inventory levels are being recalibrated to this lower volume to balance equal profit and holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490002 has transitioned into a stable late-autumn regime. Following the high-volatility secondary peak in September (averaging ~165 units), demand has settled into a lower baseline significantly below 100 units. For the most recent 4 periods (P36-P39), demand has been 35, 57, 53, and 37, resulting in a mean of 45.5 units. The date is now November 11th, and as a basic Jersey T-shirt, we expect demand to remain at this lower baseline or potentially decrease further as winter approaches. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, aiming to have on-hand inventory roughly equal to the expected demand. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this late-autumn stabilization and avoid the distortion of the earlier September peaks.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490002' (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a late autumn/winter stabilization phase. Period 40 (Nov 11) showed a slight demand increase to 57 units, up from the previous three-period average of ~42 units (P37-P39: 57, 53, 37). While this represents a small uptick, it remains far below the high-volatility peak seen in September. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 40, meaning we entered Period 41 with no on-hand stock. To optimize for a balance between profit and holding costs (equal at $1.0 each), I will set the base stock level to reflect the most recent demand regime (P37-P40), which averages approximately 51 units. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this current stabilization while accounting for the moderate volatility seen in the last month.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41 (mid-November), demand spiked to 110 units, more than double the late-Autumn average of ~48 units previously observed (P36-P39). This suggests a pre-holiday or Black Friday seasonal surge for basic t-shirts. Current inventory is 0, and lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts during this high-demand window, I must shift my forecast away from the stabilized October baseline. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P39-P41) is (37+57+110)/3 = 68 units, but given the 110-unit peak just occurred, a more reactive approach is needed. I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture this upward momentum and ensure the 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' reflect both the higher mean and the increased volatility associated with this spike.

Carry-over insight: Pre-holiday demand surge observed (Period 41): Demand spiked to 110 units from a previous 4-period baseline of 48, representing a 129% increase and signaling likely volatility through late November.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). Demand for this jersey t-shirt has surged significantly over the last two weeks (110 units in P41 and 162 units in P42), confirming a pre-holiday/Black Friday peak. This follows a late autumn baseline of ~48 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Given the rapid increase and the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, we must avoid stockouts by capturing this higher holiday demand while remaining cautious of the sharp post-peak drops seen in previous seasonal cycles (like July and September). I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the transition from the autumn baseline (P40: 57) to the recent surge (P41: 110, P42: 162), which averages ~110 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed (P41-P42): Demand surged from ~48 to an average of 136 units (+180%) in late November. High stockout risk persists as demand tracks the December holiday season.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2), demand dropped to 42 units following a two-week holiday surge (110 and 162 units). However, we are in the peak holiday shopping season (early December). The recent surge (P41-P43) has an average demand of 104.7 units, which is much higher than the late autumn baseline of ~48 units. While P43 was low, retail demand in December for a 'basic t-shirt' is highly volatile and prone to sudden spikes before Christmas. With a Profit/Holding ratio of 1.0, the OR engine seeks a 50% service level (base stock = mean). I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the current holiday regime (Avg ~105) rather than the longer-term average, ensuring we have enough stock to handle another December spike while acknowledging the potential for high variance.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime remains highly volatile (P41-P43): following a surge to 162 units, demand dropped to 42 in P43, but remains significantly above the autumn baseline (~48). Average demand for the last 3 weeks is ~105 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand shows a characteristic holiday peak pattern followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 and 44 (42 and 34 units respectively). While the 'Holiday demand peak' was confirmed in P41-P42, the last two observations suggest the immediate pre-Christmas surge for this specific 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt may be cooling or transitioning to post-peak behavior, possibly due to a shift towards warmer winter garments or completed holiday shopping for basics. The recent average (P41-P44) is approximately 87 units, but the last two periods average only 38 units. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, aiming to match the expected demand exactly. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the volatility of the holiday season while accounting for the recent downward trend. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand cooling observed (P43-P44): Following a late-November spike (avg ~136), demand dropped to an average of ~38 units in early December. This suggests the primary holiday peak for basic jersey t-shirts has passed or is highly volatile.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. We are in the final stages of the December holiday season. Historical data shows demand has cooled down from the late-November peak (162) to a more stable but still volatile baseline. The last three periods (P43-P45) show demands of 42, 34, and 51, averaging 42.3 units. This suggests the primary holiday spike for basic t-shirts has passed, and we are entering a post-holiday stabilization phase similar to the late autumn baseline (~48 units). On-hand inventory is currently 36. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent three-period average (~43 units) using recent_N = 3 to capture the most immediate post-peak demand level. sigma_hat will also use recent_N = 3 to account for the reduction in volatility compared to the high-demand November window, allowing the OR backend to balance the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio appropriately.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday stabilization confirmed (P43-P45): Demand has retreated from the late-November spike (162) to a stable baseline averaging ~42 units as of late December.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' has stabilized post-holiday, confirming a late-December baseline of approximately 42 units (mean of P43-P46: (42+34+51+40)/4 = 41.75). The current date is Dec 30, and the holiday peak (late Nov/early Dec) has clearly subsided. Since Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0), aiming to stock exactly the expected mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the year. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this post-holiday stabilization while filtering out the volatile November spikes.
