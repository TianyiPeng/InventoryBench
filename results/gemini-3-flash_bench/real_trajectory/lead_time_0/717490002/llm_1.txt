  "rationale": "We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a 'Cat Tee' (Divided Basics Jersey T-shirt). Historical demand for the last 5 weeks has been relatively stable, averaging 39.4 units (42, 40, 35, 42, 38). Since the promised lead time is 0 periods, an order placed now should arrive during this period's arrival resolution phase and be available to satisfy this period's demand. On-hand inventory is currently 0. To cover the current period's demand and maintain a small buffer, I will target approximately 45 units. Inventory holding costs are $1.0 per unit/period, which equals the profit per unit, so overstocking is as costly as stockouts. I will order 45 units to meet expected demand of ~40 plus a small safety margin for the start of the game.",

Given the April 1st date, we are entering peak spring shopping season. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the critical ratio for a single-period newsvendor model is 0.5. However, since the cost of understocking (lost profit) and overstocking (holding cost) are balanced, but demand is clearly trending upward, I will target the higher end of recent demand to prevent further lost sales while being mindful of the $1 holding cost.

Historical demand following the Labor Day peak (P29: 193, P30: 223) remained surprisingly strong in P31 (135), but based on seasonal patterns for basic t-shirts, demand typically begins to moderate as fall approaches.

Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. Inventory is currently 0.

  "rationale": "The current date is December 31, 2019. The product is a soft jersey t-shirt (basic apparel). Historically, demand for this SKU has shown significant spikes around major retail events (July 4th, Labor Day, mid-November) followed by sharp drops. Most recently, following the mid-November surge (110-162 units), demand has settled into a lower December range (34-51 units). Period 46 (Christmas week) saw a demand of 40 units. As we move into the first week of January, demand for basic t-shirts typically remains low as holiday shopping concludes, with a slight potential for restocking or new year resolutions-related sales, though the historical data from Jan 2019 suggests demand in the ~40 unit range. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 140 units, which is significantly higher than the expected weekly demand of ~40-50 units. No new order is required to cover the current period's demand, and maintaining high inventory would incur unnecessary holding costs.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-holiday stabilization: Late December demand for SKU 717490002 has settled at ~40-50 units (P43-P46), significantly down from the mid-November peak, matching levels observed in early January 2019.",
