On-hand inventory is 58. Since I am ordering for Period 2 and the arrival happens after the order but before demand, my total available inventory for Period 2 will be (58 + Order Quantity).\n3. **Product & Context**: The item is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' ribbed jersey top. February is usually a stable period for 'Everyday' apparel, but demand can be variable as seasonal transitions approach. Historical demand shows a range of 85-148 units (average ~115).\n4. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 74 units. Adding 74 to the existing 58 on-hand equals 132 units. This covers the historical average (~115) and protects against a moderate spike (up to 132). Given the critical fractile is 0.8 ($4 profit / $5 total cost), a slightly higher buffer is justified to avoid stockouts.\n5. **Final Strategy**: I will follow the OR recommendation of 74 units.

The SKU is a 'Long-sleeved, fitted top' for women. March usually marks a transition to spring fashion, which may explain the sudden surge. The OR recommendation of 263 units is based on historical averages and is likely too conservative given the 509 demand signal in Period 4. To maximize profit and avoid the stockout experienced last period (lost sales ~384 units), I will increase the order quantity.

This is based on a historical average that includes the low-demand periods (1-3) and likely caps the quantity. Given that the last two periods saw demand > 500 units and we are currently stocking out (sold 510 vs 595 demand in P5), 354 is insufficient. \n5.

The OR base-stock calculation is failing to account for the new demand regime. Using a 3-period moving average (approx. 460 units) as a forecast, the required level to cover Period 7 demand is roughly 460-500 units. 4.

OR Analysis: The OR recommendation of 193 units is significantly inflated because it includes the high-demand samples from the March peak in its base-stock calculation.

Historically, demand surged to ~500 in March (spring peak), subsided to ~70 in May, and settled between 13-50 units throughout the summer (Periods 18-28). The most recent demand was 26 units. As we move into late August (Period 29), we expect a secondary seasonal bump for autumn 'back-to-school' and transition weather for long-sleeved items. OR Recommendation: The OR agent recommends 159 units. However, the OR calculation is heavily skewed by the massive March surge (demand of 500+), which is not representative of current late-summer/early-autumn needs. Comparison: While a slight increase from current levels is expected as fall approaches, ordering 159 units would create excessive holding costs (current demand is only ~30). A base stock level of ~100 is more appropriate to cover the expected transition demand (~40-50 units per period) with a safety buffer, especially since the lead time is 0.

Recent demand over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 31 units per period, with a slight uptick in the last few weeks (range 26-51).
