Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Operating at the start of Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top. Historical data for the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows demand counts of 99, 85, 106, 148, and 135. There is a noticeable upward trend in demand starting in late January, potentially reflecting early spring fashion interest. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. The promised lead time is 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand levels (Mean=114.6, Std=26.4) while acknowledging the rising trend. Using recent_N helps the OR engine focus on the current regime rather than a longer historical average.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top. Historical demand shows a general upward trend from ~100 in January to ~140 in early February. Period 1 actual demand was 79, which is lower than the recent 3-week average (~130), potentially indicating a slight post-early-February dip or variance. However, given the product type (long-sleeved) and the mid-February date, we remain in a transition period towards spring. The promised lead time is 0, and our Period 1 observation confirms an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently at 58 units. To ensure coverage for Period 2 demand (which occurs after our decision), I will use a recent demand window to capture the upward shift seen in the pre-game history while accounting for the lower Period 1 realization. N=4 includes the last three pre-game samples (106, 148, 135) and Period 1 (79).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is February 25, 2019. The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 - Feb 4) show a mean of 114.6 units per week. However, the last two concluded periods (Feb 11 and Feb 18) observed demand of 79 and 84, respectively, which is significantly lower than the January average. This suggests a post-winter surge cooling or a mid-season transition. The promised lead time is 0, and observed lead times for Period 1 and 2 were both 0. I will prioritize the most recent data (last 5 samples including Jan-Feb history and actuals) for the demand forecast to adjust for the recent drop. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (80%), so I will use a conservative sigma estimation to prevent stockouts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a women's long-sleeved jersey top. Historical demand data shows a significant increase starting late January (148 and 135 units), followed by a lower, steadier demand in the last three periods (79, 84, 71). The average demand over the last three completed periods is 78 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently healthy at 66 units on-hand. Since current demand (P1-P3) is consistently lower than the pre-period samples (Jan), I will transition to a recent_N strategy to capture this current regime and avoid overstocking based on the Jan spike. I'll use N=3 to stabilize around the current mean (~78) and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 experienced a massive demand spike in Period 4 (509 units), compared to an average of ~78 units in Periods 1-3. The current date is March 11, and the product is a 'Long-sleeved, fitted top', which aligns with spring fashion transitions. Historical data from Jan-Feb shows demand between 85-148, suggesting Period 4's 509 is an extreme outlier or a rapid seasonal shift. Given the inventory is currently 0 (stockout in Period 4), I need to set mu_hat to cover this new level while being cautious of 'bullwhip' over-ordering. I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the Period 4 demand to prevent further lost sales, but I expect the backend 'cap' mechanism to provide some protection against over-ordering if the spike was a one-time event. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 4: demand spiked from ~80 to 509 (+530%), likely due to seasonal spring fashion trends for jersey tops.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2284.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's ribbed jersey top, and demand has surged dramatically starting in March (Period 4: 509 units, Period 5: 595 units), indicating a clear seasonal shift associated with spring fashion. The average demand over the last two periods is 552. With a promised lead time (L) of 0, our inventory position must cover the demand for the current period. We currently have 96 units on hand and 0 in transit. To avoid the stockouts seen in Period 4, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 2 periods of high demand. I will use N=3 (the minimum allowed for recent_N) to capture this regime shift effectively, as it balances the new high demand level with the previous period's transition.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift starting Period 4: Mean demand increased from ~80 to ~550 units (+580%) due to seasonal spring fashion demand for jersey tops.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7 (2019-03-25), the product (women's long-sleeved jersey top) is in the middle of a confirmed spring seasonal demand shift. We saw a massive spike in Periods 4 and 5 (509 and 595 units), followed by a lower but still elevated demand in Period 6 (274 units). The mean demand over the last three periods (since the shift) is 459.3 units. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently verified by history. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the recent dip in demand, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the average of the new regime, while using all available data for sigma to ensure we have a safe buffer to protect against upside spikes like \u0442\u0435\u0445 observed in Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-185.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the demand for the women's jersey top has shown high volatility following a massive spike in Periods 4 and 5 (reaching 595 units). However, demand has since dropped significantly in Period 6 (274) and Period 7 (86). This suggests the initial spring fashion surge may be cooling off or stabilizing. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. With an ending inventory of 529 units (which is significantly higher than the 86 demand units seen last period), the goal is to stabilize the stock levels without over-ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high-demand regime from Period 4 onwards, which includes both the peaks and the recent dip, providing a balanced forecast for the next phase. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on demand of [509, 595, 274, 86], which averages to 366 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed post-Period 4: initial surge to ~550 units followed by a sharp decline to ~86 units in Period 7, indicating a possible short-lived seasonal peak or oscillating spring trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for this jersey top (SKU 615141002) shows a high-amplitude seasonal spike that peak in Period 5 (595 units) and has since rapidly decelerated. Period 7 and Period 8 saw demand of 86 and 112 units respectively, suggesting a return to a lower baseline or the tail end of the spring trend. The Carry-over Insights correctly identified this volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 449 units, which significantly exceeds the current demand levels (last 2 periods average ~99). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods based on the conclusion messages (P1-P8). To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for potential residual demand, I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the downward trend (averaging the spike of 274 in P6 with the lower 86 and 112). I will use recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen during the peak periods, ensuring a safe stock buffer if demand oscillates again.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: After the Period 4-6 spring surge (avg ~460), demand has stabilized at a lower level of ~100 units/period (P7-P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 (Womens Jersey Top) experienced a massive seasonal demand spike between Periods 4 and 6 (avg ~459 units), which has now clearly stabilized back to a baseline level. In the last three periods (P7-P9), demand has been 86, 112, and 81, averaging approximately 93 units. The current date is April 15, moving past the early spring peak into a more stable spring/summer demand phase for this 'Everyday Collection' item. With 368 units currently on-hand and an expected demand of ~93 units, we have over 3 periods of coverage. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this post-spike stabilization and prevent over-ordering based on the outdated March surge data. The backend will calculate base stock using these parameters; given the high inventory, it's likely to result in zero or minimal orders this period, which is optimal for reducing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Post-peak demand (P7-P9) has settled to a mean of 93 units/period, down from the P4-P6 spring peak of ~459 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal peak between Period 4 and Period 6 (March), where demand averaged ~459 units. Since Period 7 (late March/early April), demand has stabilized at a much lower level. Specifically, demand for the last four periods (P7-P10) was 86, 112, 81, and 47, averaging approximately 81.5 units per period. The most recent demand (P10) of 47 suggests the seasonal interest in this ribbed jersey top is tapering off further as the spring peak concludes. With 321 units on hand and a demand forecast around 80-90 units, we are currently overstocked. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this post-peak stabilization level (~81.5), and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the decreased volatility compared to the surge periods. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak (P7-P10) has confirmed stabilization at a lower mean of ~82 units, with a downward trend noted in P10 (47 units).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 615141002 (Jersey Fancy Top) showed a massive seasonal peak between Periods 4-6 (March), peaking at 595 units, followed by a steady decline as the spring fashion cycle progresses. Demand over the last five periods (P7-P11) has been 86, 112, 81, 47, and 30 units, respectively. The most recent three periods (P9-P11) show a clear downward trend (avg ~53 units). On-hand inventory is currently at 291 units with zero in-transit. With a promised lead time (L) of 0, the current stock covers over 5-9 periods of current demand if the downward trend continues. To avoid further holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the most recent local demand stabilization/decline (avg ~53 units). Lead time remains 'calculate' as historical performance consistently shows 0-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand decay confirmed: Following the March spring surge, demand has entered a sustained decline, dropping from an average of ~93 (P7-P9) to ~38 (P10-P11), a 59% reduction in the last two weeks.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which saw a significant seasonal peak in March (Periods 4-6) and has since been in a steady decline as the weather warms into May. The most recent demand samples are: 81, 47, 30, and 48 (Mean = 51.5). The current on-hand inventory is 243 units, which is approximately 4.7 periods of stock based on the recent average. Given the promised lead time of 0 (confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in history), we are currently significantly overstocked relative to the holding cost of $1/unit and a profit of $4/unit. No new orders should be placed until inventory levels drop to match the current demand regime. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the stabilized post-peak demand level (~51.5 per period), ensuring the OR backend target base stock reflects this lower demand and avoids ordering while the excess inventory is liquidated.

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully transitioned to a late-spring/early-summer low-frequency regime: mean demand for P9-P12 is 51.5 units, compared to the peak March mean of 459 units and the P7-P8 transition mean of 99 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal peak in March (Periods 4-6, mean ~460), followed by a clear and sustained decline as we move into late spring/early summer. Over the last five periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged 48.2 units, with the most recent four periods (P10-P13) dropping further to a mean of 40 units. On-hand inventory is currently 208 units, which is a surplus given the current low-demand regime (sufficient for over 5 periods of demand at current rates). Since the promised lead time remains 0 and has been consistently observed as 0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock. To prevent unnecessary ordering while we burn through existing stock, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to reflect the stabilized low-demand regime. This keeps the base stock target low enough to account for the current overstock position.

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully stabilized in a low-frequency summer regime: P10-P13 mean is 40 units/period, down from the P4-P6 peak of 459 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Jersey Top) has fully transitioned into a low-demand summer regime. The early spring peak (March) is over, and demand has been steadily low for the last five periods (P10-P14), ranging between 30 and 48 units. Specifically, the mean demand of the last 4 weeks (P11-P14) is 39 units. Currently, there are 165 units on-hand, which is approximately four weeks' worth of stock at the current run rate. Given that the lead time is consistently 0 periods and the holding cost is $1.0 vs a $4.0 profit, the OR backend logic (base stock calculation) should naturally result in zero orders until inventory levels drop significantly. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand environment, and lead time remains at the default (promised 0).

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand for P11-P14 is 39 units, marking a complete departure from the March peak of 459 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The SKU (Womens Everyday Top) has clearly exited its spring peak (March avg ~459) and settled into a stable, low-demand early-summer regime. Since Period 10, demand has fluctuated between 30 and 53 units. The most recent four periods (P12-P15) show demand of 48, 35, 43, and 53, resulting in a mean of 44.75 units. On-hand inventory is 112 units, which covers approximately 2.5 weeks of current demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the stable post-peak behavior (P10-P15), which averages ~40 units. This will likely result in a base stock level lower than current on-hand, leading the OR engine to place no order until inventory depletes further.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for the SKU 615141002 (Womens Everyday Collection jersey top) remains in a stable low-demand summer regime. Over the last six periods (P11-P16), the demand has averaged approximately 40.8 units (30, 48, 35, 43, 53, 36). The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 76 units, which covers approximately two periods of the current average demand. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer against moderate spikes, I will set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on the most recent 6 periods (the duration of this low-demand stability). A 'recent_N' of 6 accurately captures the mean (~41) and the observed standard deviation in this regime, allowing the OR backend to maintain a lean inventory posture suitable for the high holding cost relative to unit profit (1:4 ratio).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Womens Everyday Collection' jersey top peaked significantly in March (P4-P6) and has since transitioned into a stable, low-demand summer phase. The demand for the last seven periods (P11-P17) has consistently remained low, ranging between 27 and 53 units, with a mean of 38.8 units. The order history confirms that the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0 periods. Currently, there are 49 units on-hand, which covers approximately 1.2 weeks of demand at the current average rate. Given the holding cost of $1.00 relative to a profit of $4.00, it is optimal to maintain lean inventory as demand continues to stay low and stable. I will use recent_N=7 to capture this stabilized low-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculation, and maintain the default lead time setting.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 (Womens Everyday Jersey Top) is currently in a stable low-demand summer regime following its March peak. Historical demand for the most recent 5 periods (P14-P18) has been 43, 53, 36, 27, and 27 units, respectively. The mean of these observations is 37.2 units, with a standard deviation of 11.2, confirming the 'low-frequency summer regime' identified in previous carry-over insights. On-hand inventory is currently at 22 units, which is below the expected demand for the upcoming period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by early game history. To capture the current stable demand while accounting for slight variability and avoiding stockouts in this low-volume phase, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime shift (the stabilization at ~37 units). This approach balances the holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($4.0) by targeting a service level based on the recent low-energy demand profile.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top (Womens Everyday Collection). Demand history shows a massive peak in March (Periods 4-6, mean ~460), followed by a sharp decline and stabilization into a low-frequency summer regime. Over the last 6 periods (P14-P19), demand has been extremely stable, ranging between 27 and 53 units, with a mean of 36.5 units. Period 19 demand was 33 units. On-hand inventory is currently low at 14 units. Given the consistent low-demand summer regime, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 6 periods (n=6) to capture the current mean of ~37 units. Lead time is consistently 0. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 will provide a base stock that covers expected demand while accounting for the low volatility observed in this regime.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 615141002 (Womens Jersey Top) is currently in a stable low-demand summer regime. Since the post-peak transition ended around Period 10, demand has consistently fluctuated between 13 and 53 units. Specifically, for the last 5 periods (P16-P20), the mean demand is 27.2 units (36, 27, 27, 33, 13). Current on-hand inventory is 32 units with 0 in-transit. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been observed consistently across the history whenever orders were placed. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this recent low-frequency behavior and set L to default (0). This strategy ensures we maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover the immediate 27-30 unit demand while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit/period vs $4/unit profit).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The SKU (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) is in a stable low-demand summer phase. Following the significant March peak (average ~459 units), demand transitioned through April/May and has settled into a very consistent regime from June onwards. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P17-P21), the mean demand is 24 units/period (27, 27, 33, 13, 20) with a standard deviation of approximately 7.5. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this current stability while filtering out the high-volatility spring data. This will maintain a lean inventory (On-hand: 15) appropriate for the low summer demand and high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 vs $4.0).

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand regime confirmed for P17-P21: mean demand settled at 24 units/period, down from the P13-P16 mean of 42 units/period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable low-demand summer regime (mid-July). Period 22 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory because demand (34) slightly exceeded the starting on-hand plus arrivals (31). Over the last 6 periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged 25.6 units (27, 27, 33, 13, 20, 34). The most recent jump to 34 units suggests a slight increase in volatility or a minor mid-summer spike, but the overall trend remains low compared to the spring peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure we meet demand while minimizing holding costs in this low-demand phase, I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current summer baseline and recent volatility. This provides a balance between the very low weeks (13-20) and the slightly higher recent demand (34).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is July 22, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is currently in a sustained low-demand summer regime. Recent demand from Period 17 to Period 23 has averaged approximately 25.4 units per period (27, 27, 33, 13, 20, 34, 27). The most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) have an average demand of 25.4 units. On-hand inventory is very low at 6 units with nothing in-transit. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain a lean inventory while preventing stockouts in this low-frequency regime, I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current stable demand variance and mean. This will help the backend set a base stock level that covers the 0-period lead time plus the review period (total 1 period of demand).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Collection Jersey Top) is currently in a sustained summer low-demand regime. Historical demand for the last seven periods (P18-P24) follows a very stable pattern: 27, 33, 13, 20, 34, 27, 21. The mean demand for this recent regime is approximately 25 units per period. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game, allowing for same-period arrival. I will use a recent_N approach for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with N=7 to capture this stabilized low-demand summer baseline while ignoring the massive spring spikes earlier in the year. This ensures we maintain enough inventory to meet demand (avoiding stockouts like in Period 22) without incurring excessive holding costs during the slow season.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand regime confirmed for P18-P24: mean demand remains stable at ~25 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is early August (Period 26). The product is a long-sleeved jersey top. Historically, demand peaked in March (Spring surge) and has since stabilized in a low-demand summer regime. Over the last 8 periods (P18-P25), demand has averaged 27 units (27, 33, 13, 20, 34, 27, 21, 42). Period 25 saw a slight uptick to 42, but overall context suggests we are still in the summer trough. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit, meaning we must order for immediate fulfillment (L=0). I will set mu_hat to cover the immediate demand using the recent N=8 period average, which reflects the current summer regime, and use recent N=8 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while ignoring the massive March spikes.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Collection Top) has been in a sustained low-demand summer regime since roughly Period 17. Over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 32.2 units (34, 27, 21, 42, 37), which is a slight uptick from the previously noted average of ~25. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in transit. Since the promised and actual lead times are consistently 0 periods, I will set L to 0. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the slight recent increase in summer demand while acknowledging the overall lower regime compared to the spring peak. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the immediate demand without overstocking as we move towards late summer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime tracking: P22-P26 mean demand is 32.2 units, a slight increase from the P17-P21 average of 24 units, but still remains within the summer low-demand range.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The SKU 615141002 (Womens Everyday Top) is currently in a stable summer regime, although demand has shown a slight upward trend in the last few periods (P25: 42, P26: 37, P27: 51). The mean demand over the last 6 periods (P22-P27) is approximately 35.3 units, compared to the earlier summer average of ~25 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to stockouts in the last three consecutive periods (P25, P26, P27), where demand exceeded the inventory provided by the backend's capped base-stock policy. To address these stockouts and the slight increase in demand, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the current mean of ~35. This will signal the OR backend to raise the base stock level slightly while maintaining the safety buffer through 'default' sigma_hat (which uses the full history's volatility, protecting against unexpected spikes).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand has stabilized at a slightly higher summer level (P22-P27 mean = 35.3 units) compared to the mid-summer low of ~25 units, leading to stockouts under current settings.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '615141002' (long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) is entering late August (Period 29: 2019/8/26). Historically, we saw a massive surge in demand during March (P4-P6), which represented the spring fashion peak. Following that, demand stabilized in a low-frequency summer regime (~25-35 units). In the most recent period (P28), demand was 26 units, but the previous few weeks (P25-P27) saw a slight uptick (42, 37, 51), likely signaling the transition into early fall demand for 'long-sleeved' items. I have 120 units on hand, which is high compared to current demand but provides a buffer for potential September growth. Observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To manage the current transition without over-ordering while respecting the slight upward volatility of late summer/early fall, I will use a recent window (N=7) for demand and variance to capture the shift from the deep summer low towards the fall build-up.

Carry-over insight: Early fall transition signal: Mean demand for P25-P28 is 39 units, up from the P17-P24 mean of 24 units, indicating a gradual recovery as season shifts toward cooler weather suitable for long-sleeved tops.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved, fitted top in ribbed jersey. Historical data from Period 4 (early March) showed a massive demand spike (+580%) as spring fashion arrived. Given the product description (long-sleeved), we anticipate a similar seasonal uptick as the weather cools for fall. Demand in the last four periods (P26-P29) has averaged 39.75 units, showing a slight recovery from the summer lows of ~25 units. While Period 28 saw a dip to 26 units, Period 29 recovered to 45. To prepare for the fall transition and avoid the stockouts seen during the spring surge, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the early fall recovery signal (avg ~40). I will use a high sigma_hat via explicit value to provide a safety buffer against a potential sharp seasonal spike similar to the early spring behavior, as we enter the peak season for long-sleeved items. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early fall transition confirmed: Mean demand for P26-P29 is 39.75 units, up from the summer low mean of 24 units (+65%), aligning with seasonal demand for long-sleeved garments.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which typically sees increased demand as the season transitions from summer to fall. Analysis of the recent demand (P26-P30) shows values of 37, 51, 26, 45, and 50. Excluding the P28 dip, the mean is approximately 45.75. The 'Carry-over Insights' confirm an early fall transition with mean demand rising to approximately 40 units/period, up from the summer low of 24. To capture this rising trend while protecting against volatility seen in P27 (51 units), I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent regime. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand growth confirmed: Mean demand for P26-P30 is 41.8 units, maintaining the upward trend from the summer low of 24 units (+74%).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 (Womens Everyday Collection, Long-sleeved top) is entering its peak fall demand season as of mid-September (Period 32). In the last period (P31), we saw a significant demand spike to 76 units, which resulted in a stockout (on-hand is 0). This follows a sustained upward trend from the summer low of ~25 units. Historically, we saw a massive surge in March (P4-P6), and given the product is a 'long-sleeved ribbed jersey' top, a similar fall surge is highly probable as temperatures drop. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P28-P31) is 49.25, but the P31 observation of 76 units suggests we are accelerating. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this transition, but adjust for the stockout in P31 by being mindful that actual demand might have been higher. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages. We need to build inventory to prevent further lost sales during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand surge confirmed at Period 31: demand increased to 76 units, causing a stockout. The mean demand for P28-P31 (49.3 units) represents a 100% increase over the summer baseline (24 units), confirming a shift into the peak fall regime for long-sleeved garments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 (Long-sleeved, fitted top) is currently in a sustained fall demand surge. Demand in Period 31 (76 units) and Period 32 (75 units) has significantly exceeded the earlier summer average (~25-35 units), confirming the seasonal shift. The 'Carry-over Insights' correctly identified this growth trend. Current on-hand inventory is 0 after two consecutive weeks of stockouts where demand was ~75. To capture this growth, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the last month of demand (P29-P32: 45, 50, 76, 75), which yields an average of 61.5 units/period. Historically, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 75 units (matching the last two periods) to ensure the base stock is high enough to prevent further lost sales during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand surge sustained: Demand for P31-P32 averaged 75.5 units, representing a 100%+ increase over late-summer levels, confirming a peak regime for long-sleeved garments.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 (Long-sleeved ribbed jersey top) has entered its peak fall demand regime. Period 33 observed a massive demand spike to 186 units, following a trend of ~75 units in Periods 31-32. This aligns with late September seasonal shifts and product attributes. The current lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this significant upward shift and avoid further stockouts (on-hand is 0), I am using an explicit mu_hat based on the most recent demand spike while allowing for continued high volatility (sigma_hat). I'm setting a base demand expectation of approximately 180 units to ensure the base stock formula (z=0.84 for $4 profit/$1 cost) covers the current peak.

Carry-over insight: Fall peak confirmed: Period 33 demand surged to 186 units (+148% from P31-P32 average of 75), indicating a high-intensity seasonal peak for long-sleeved jersey tops.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in the peak fall season for long-sleeved jersey tops. Recent demand has been highly volatile: P31 (76), P32 (75), P33 (186), and P34 (108). The surge to 186 in P33 followed by 108 in P34 indicates we have entered a high-intensity regime. The mean demand over the last 4 weeks (P31-P34) is 111.25 units. Although P34 showed a drop from P33, it remains significantly higher than the mid-summer baseline of ~24-35 units. Given the seasonal nature of the product (long-sleeved, ribbed jersey), demand is expected to remain high during October. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture this new fall regime mean (approx 111 units/period). This provides a balanced base stock to cover current elevated demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand for P31-P34 is 111.25 units, significantly higher than the summer baseline of ~30 units, driven by seasonal demand for long-sleeved jersey tops.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 (long-sleeved jersey top) is currently in a high-demand fall regime. Period 33 saw a significant peak of 186 units, while Periods 34 and 35 have moderated to 108 and 71 units respectively. This suggests we are past the initial autumn surge but still at a mean significantly higher than the summer baseline of ~25-40. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 103.2 units. Given the seasonality of long-sleeved tops in mid-October, demand is expected to remain elevated but potentially volatile. Using recent_N with N=5 for both mean and sigma captures this current fall regime (P31-P35) while excluding the low summer data. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-demand regime for long-sleeved tops confirmed: P31-P35 mean is 103.2 units compared to summer low of ~25-40 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 615141002 (Long-sleeved jersey top) is currently in its autumn high-demand regime, which began around Period 31 (early September). Historical data for this specific seasonal window (P31-P36) shows a mean demand of 101 units, with significant volatility (high of 186 in P33, low of 71 in P35). The most recent period (P36) had a demand of 90 units. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid the frequent stockouts seen in late September (P31-P33), I am using a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture the current seasonal mean of ~101 units while accounting for the high volatility of this period. This will set a base stock level that targets a higher service level during this peak period of the fall season (Date: 2019/10/21).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is currently in its peak fall demand regime (late October). Historical demand for the last seven periods (P31-P37) has shown a significantly higher mean (101.6 units) compared to the summer baseline. Specifically, the last four periods (P34-P37) had demands of 108, 71, 90, and 105, averaging 93.5 units with moderate volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To manage the current fall peak while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit vs $4/unit profit), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current stabilized high-demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to the last 4 periods to capture recent volatility. On-hand inventory is low (33), but with L=0, the OR engine will replenish immediately based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-demand regime for long-sleeved tops stabilized: P34-P37 mean demand is 93.5 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the peak fall regime for long-sleeved tops. Demand in Period 38 was 119 units, which exhausted our inventory and resulted in a stockout. Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), the average demand has been 98.6 units (108, 71, 90, 105, 119). The trend is currently upward, with the last two periods exceeding 100 units. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand seasonal window, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stabilized high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using N=5 to reflect the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-demand regime (P34-P38) mean demand is 98.6 units, showing an upward trend with the most recent demand hitting 119 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The SKU 615141002 (long-sleeved jersey top) is in its peak fall demand regime. For the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 92.2 units. Although demand dropped to 60 units in P39, the overall fall trend (P31-P39) averages 98.9 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts like those seen in P38, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the stabilized fall demand level (approx 92 units), while using N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during this peak (standard deviation approx 47). This ensures a high coverage level for the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-demand regime (P34-P39) mean demand is 92.2 units, showing typical seasonal volatility for long-sleeved jersey tops.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, transitioning into late fall/early winter. Demand for this long-sleeved jersey top remains in a high-demand fall regime but has shown recent signs of cooling off, dropping from a peak mean of ~111 to ~60 units over the last two weeks (P39-P40). Following the 'recent_N' protocol, I will assess the regime from the start of the fall surge at Period 31. The mean demand for P31-P40 is 95.1 units. However, to account for the most recent two-week drop which may indicate the start of a seasonal taper, I will use recent_N=7 (P34-P40) to calculate mu_hat, yielding a mean of 90.6 units. This provides a balance between the high fall average and the immediate downward trend. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same N=7 period to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-demand regime showing initial signs of seasonal taper: mean demand for P39-P40 is 60.5 units, compared to the P34-P38 mean of 98.6 units (-38%).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which saw a peak demand regime starting in mid-September (Period 33). However, demand has noticeably tapered off over the last three periods (P39-P41), averaging 62.3 units compared to the peak fall average (P34-P38) of 98.6 units. This suggests the end of the fall peak and a transition into a late-autumn/early-winter regime. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining a buffer for seasonal volatility, as late November often includes promotional events that could cause minor spikes even if the general trend is downward. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=8 to account for the volatility observed during the peak-to-taper transition.

Carry-over insight: Fall peak demand has tapered: P39-P41 mean demand is 62.3 units, a 37% decrease from the P34-P38 peak average of 98.6 units, signaling a transition to a late-fall regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 615141002 (long-sleeved jersey top) spiked significantly in Period 42 (2019-11-25) to 231 units, causing a stockout. This spike coincided with Black Friday week, a major retail event that historically drives massive demand for apparel. Prior to this, the demand had stabilized around 60-65 units (late-fall regime). Given we are now in Period 43 (early December), demand is expected to remain higher than the late-fall baseline due to holiday shopping and colder weather, though it may not reach the extreme Black Friday peak. To capture this transition and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent spike, I will use a recent_N method. I'll set N=4 to include the Black Friday outlier (231) and the three preceding weeks (60, 61, 66). This reflects a high-demand regime mean of approximately 104.5 units per period. The sigma_hat will also be calculated using N=4 to account for this increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Significant demand spike to 231 units in Period 42 confirmed as a Black Friday/Cyber Monday event impact. Expect sustained elevated demand through the December holiday season compared to the November baseline (~62 units).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019 (Period 44). We are in the post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 231 units due to the holiday event, and Period 43 demand was 62 units. Based on historical patterns for this long-sleeved jersey top, we are in a high-demand fall/winter regime, but the massive 231 spike was an outlier related to the holiday shopping weekend. I expect demand for the remaining December periods to settle between the peak fall mean (~100) and the late-fall mean (~65), likely trending towards 80-100 units due to holiday gift shopping. On-hand inventory is 114 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a sufficient service level for the holiday season while accounting for the recent spike's influence on variance, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the late-fall stabilization and holiday elevation (incorporating the 231 spike and the 62 rebound) and use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during the holiday transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday demand (P43) returned to a late-fall baseline of 62 units. Expecting December holiday demand to fluctuate between 60-100 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday season (Period 45). Recent demand has stabilized significantly after the Black Friday anomaly (P42). Period 43 demand was 62 units and Period 44 was 45 units. The Carry-over insight for Period 44 suggested a range of 60-100 units for December, but the last two weeks suggest a slightly softer trend (~53.5 average). Given the product is a 'Jersey Fancy Long-sleeved top', it remains relevant for winter but may see a slight dip just before the final Christmas rush or a transition into the post-holiday clearance phase. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the post-spike baseline (P42-P44) which averages 112.6 units (heavily weighted by the P42 spike) or N=2 for the immediate post-spike stabilization (P43-P44) which averages 53.5 units. To be safe against a late December pulse, I'll use N=5 (P40-P44) which captures the pre-spike, spike, and post-spike behavior, averaging 93 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Demand has stabilized post-Black Friday at a mean of 53.5 units (P43-P44), confirming the end of the high-fall surge and return to a late-year baseline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), approaching the final week of the year. Demand history shows a post-Black Friday stabilization in a late-year regime (P43-P45 mean = 58.3 units), following the significant spike in Period 42. Since this is a long-sleeved jersey top, we expect consistent but moderate demand through the winter months. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking as we enter the post-holiday period but still protect against typical year-end volatility, I am using a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat based on the post-spike baseline (P43-P45). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent variance (P41-P45) which includes the transitional period and the Black Friday event's aftermath, ensuring we have a sufficient buffer without excessive holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/30, entering the final week of the year and transition into January. Historically, this SKU (long-sleeved jersey top) saw its initial demand around 80 units in early 2019 (P1-P3). Recent demand (P43-P46) has stabilized at a late-year mean of 51.5 units, significantly lower than the fall peak (approx. 100 units) and the Black Friday spike (231 units). Specifically, last period's demand was 31 units, suggesting a year-end lull. However, looking back at the provided historical seed data (Jan 7 to Feb 4), demand was between 85 and 148 units (mean ~115). I expect demand to begin rising again in January as customers transition from holiday wear back to everyday staples like this ribbed jersey top. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current late-December baseline (avg ~51.5), but will rely on the backend's stock-up capability. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand entering year-end lull (P46=31), but historical data for Jan suggests a recovery to ~115 units/period is imminent.
