Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 706016003 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS). Historical demand data for the past 5 weeks shows a declining trend: 752, 477, 500, 430, 384. The average of these 5 samples is 508.6, but the most recent sample is significantly lower (384). Since this is the beginning of transition into spring, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent mean and variance rather than 'default' to avoid over-weighting the high demand from early January. Promised lead time is 0. With Profit=$1.0 and Holding=$1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (z*=0), meaning the base stock will target the mean demand of the lead+review period. Given L=0, the engine will cover (0+1) weeks of demand. I'll stick with recent_N to allow the OR engine to adapt to the recent downward trend while maintaining a buffer for volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the SKU '706016003' (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS), it is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser from the Divided collection. The historical demand data provided (5 samples from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows an average demand of 508.6 units. The demand in Period 1 (2019-02-11) was 246 units, which is significantly lower than the historical average and suggests a potential downward trend or shift in regime. In Period 1, we ordered 509 units with a lead time of 0, all of which arrived and were used to satisfy demand, leaving 263 units on hand. For Period 2, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent lower demand more heavily while still acknowledging historical volatility. Since the promised lead time is 0 and it was confirmed as 0 in Period 1, I will stick with the default lead time setting.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for SKUs 706016003 (high-waisted skinny denim). Historical demand samples from January (752, 477, 500, 430, 384) show a significant downward trend following the post-holiday peak. In Periods 1 and 2, demand was 246 and 296, confirming a lower but stabilizing regime for February. The product is a staple denim item, and February/early March usually sees steady demand before spring spikes. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, on-hand inventory is 58, which is low given recent demand. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=3) to focus on the February stabilization (average ~310) plus the last Jan sample, while using the promised lead time of 0. Sigma will also be based on the recent N samples to capture the lower variance seen recently compared to the early January peak.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-04. The product is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser (Divided Collection), which typically sees steady demand with potential upticks as spring begins. Previous demand samples are [752, 477, 500, 430, 384] and game observations for Periods 1-3 are [246, 296, 222]. The mean demand from all 8 samples is approximately 413, while the mean of the most recent 3 periods (the live game) is approximately 255. There is a clear downward regime shift from the historical pre-game data to the current game execution. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this lower volume and avoid overstocking, as holding costs ($1) are high relative to unit profit ($1.0). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1, 2, and 3.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from historical (~500) to current game (~255) starting Period 1.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5 (2019/3/11), we are observing a consistent demand regime for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' that is significantly lower than the pre-game samples. Since the game started (Period 1 to Period 4), demand has averaged 244 units (246, 296, 222, 212), whereas the January/February historical samples averaged 508. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by four consecutive same-period arrivals. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current lower demand level while excluding the outdated historical data. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/18. Demand over the first 5 periods (246, 296, 222, 212, 180) averages 231.2, which is significantly lower than the historical pre-game average (~509). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple fashion item. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently 64 units on-hand with nothing in transit. Since profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the target service level q = 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower demand regime for both mean and volatility, and keep the lead time at the promised 0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product is a pair of high-waisted skinny denim trousers, which typically sees consistent demand through spring before potentially dipping in late summer. However, the observed demand in the game (Periods 1-6) is significantly lower than the historical samples from Jan-Feb 2019. Historical mean was ~500, whereas the game average is ~222, with the last two periods dropping further to 180 and 178. I will use a recent_N window of 6 to capture the current game's regime while excluding the older, higher historical samples. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all 6 concluded periods, so I will continue using the default (promised L=0). Given the high holding cost relative to profit (1:1), a service level around 50% is natural, and setting N=6 for both mu and sigma will help the OR backend avoid overstocking in this lower-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~220 units per period starting Period 1, significantly lower than Jan/Feb historical data; actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods over 6 consecutive observations.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand from Jan/Feb showed a mean around 500, but game history (Periods 1-7) shows a significant downward trend: Period 1-4 averaged ~244, while Periods 5-7 dipped further to ~162. The most recent demand (Period 7) was 128, suggesting a potential further softening as we move deeper into spring for this denim TRS item. Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods across all 7 historical game periods. Given high holding costs relative to profit (1:1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent lower demand regime (mean ~162) and using recent_N for sigma to account for the volatility in this new range. This helps the OR backend avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening further: Periods 5-7 average ~162 units, down from ~244 in Periods 1-4. Period 7 specifically reached a low of 128.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product (Skinny Denim Trousers) continues a downward demand trend as we move further into spring. Historical January/February demand averaged ~500, but recent game data show a significant decline. Periods 1-4 averaged 244 units, while the most recent three periods (5-7) averaged 162 units. Period 8 demand was 131, which is very close to Period 7's 128, suggesting a new stabilized lower regime. Lead time is consistently 0. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this lower demand level (avg ~154) while maintaining some responsiveness. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower demand regime compared to the early game spikes. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently realized.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level (~130-180) since Period 5, significantly below the P1-P4 average of 244 and historical Jan/Feb levels of ~500.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' SKU shows a clear downward trend from Jan/Feb (~500/week) to March/April (~120-130/week). This aligns with seasonal transitions in retail where heavy denim often peaks in late winter and softens in mid-spring. Since Period 7, weekly demand has stabilized in the 120-131 range (128, 131, 120). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods for 9 consecutive orders, matching the promised lead time. Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1:$1), a lean inventory strategy is necessary. I will use a restricted window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent stable low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering based on older, higher-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully stabilized in a new low-regime for April (Periods 7-9) averaging ~126 units, down from the ~220-250 range in February/March.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand has significantly dropped from the March average (~160) to a very low level in April. Period 10 recorded the lowest demand yet (55 units), significantly lower than the previous April weeks (128, 131, 120). The 4-week average for April (Periods 7-10) is 108.5 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially equal to the expected demand for the period. With 72 units already on hand, and a forecast for the upcoming period around 100-110 units, the system needs to adjust mu_hat downward to avoid overstocking while maintaining enough inventory for the potential variance. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the April slowdown specifically.

Carry-over insight: April demand (Periods 7-10) has reached a new low-regime, averaging 108.5 units, with the most recent Period 10 dipping to 55 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has significantly declined throughout April (Periods 7-11), dropping from the ~220-250 range in early spring to an average of approximately 86 units over the last five periods (P7-P11: 128, 131, 120, 55, 59). Specifically, the two most recent periods (P10 and P11) show demand has stabilized at a very low level (~57 units). This likely reflects a seasonal drop for this specific denim SKU as the weather warms or a change in the 'Divided' collection's focus. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a 50% critical fractile), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the specific April low-regime) to align inventory levels with this significantly reduced demand. The goal is to set the base stock to cover current period demand without overstocking now that demand has floor-dropped.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further collapsed in late April (Periods 10-11) to ~57 units, down from early April average of ~126 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/06. The SKU is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', which is a spring/summer item. In the previous period (Period 12), demand spiked to 121, which caused a stockout (sold 99, ending inventory 0). This follows a period of demand decline throughout April. The spike in late April/early May suggests a transition from spring into summer shopping or a particular seasonal event. Given the previous 3 periods were 121, 59, and 55, the average is 78.3. However, since we just hit a stockout and the most recent demand (121) is significantly higher than the preceding weeks (~57), I will use N=3 to capture this recent upward trend while acknowledging the volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. With Profit=1 and Holding=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=3 ensures we react to the stockout and the recent increase in demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: Demand spiked to 121 after a low April average of ~57, suggesting a potential seasonal recovery for skinny denim in May.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14 (2019/5/13). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) has been highly volatile in recent weeks. After a significant collapse in late April (Periods 10-11) where demand averaged ~57, we saw a sudden spike to 121 in Period 12, followed by a sharp drop to 45 in Period 13. Looking at the broader May context and historical patterns, demand is fluctuating between a low floor (~50) and a potential mid-range recovery ceiling (~120). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50%, the OR backend will aim to carry just enough stock to cover the mean demand. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the volatility of the last month (Avg: 70) while acknowledging the high variance (std: ~37). This prevents overstocking based on the historical Jan/Feb levels (~500) while keeping enough safety stock to handle occasional May spikes.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has significantly declined and stabilized at a lower level compared to its early-year performance. Over the last two periods (P13 and P14), demand was 45 and 46 units respectively, confirming a low-demand regime for May following a brief spike in P12 (121 units, which appears to have been an outlier or a short-lived event). The average demand over the last four periods (P11-P14) is 67.75, but the last two periods are specific to May and average 45.5. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the general April/May level (~68 units per period) while acknowledging the recent softness. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods across all 14 game periods, so L is set to 'calculate'. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, aiming for the median demand to minimize total cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for May has stabilized at approximately 45-50 units per period (P13-P14 average: 45.5), which is considerably lower than the P1-P4 (avg ~244) and P7-P10 (avg ~109) levels.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product (Skinny Denim) has transitioned through several demand regimes: a high start in Feb (~250), a moderate March (~180/130), a low April (~60-120), and now a stabilized low in May. Over the last three periods (P13-P15), demand has been 45, 46, and 59, averaging approximately 50 units. While Period 15 showed a slight uptick to 59, there is no evidence yet of a sustained high-demand shift for early June. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history, confirmed again in Period 15. Given the Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent late-May stabilization while following the 0-day lead time logic. On-hand is currently 9, so the system will likely order around 40-50 units to reach the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late May (P13-P15) has stabilized at approximately 50 units per period (range 45-59), following a broader downward trend from earlier in the year.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is High-waisted skinny denim. Throughout the game, demand has shown a clear downward trend: starting at ~250 in Feb/March, dropping to ~125 in early April, ~55 in late April, and finally stabilizing at approximately 54 units per period across the last month (P13-P16 average: 52). Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period for 16 consecutive weeks), so L is set to 'calculate'. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture the stable late-May/early-June regime (average: 52) which is distinct from the volatile April performance. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N with N=4 to reflect the current low volatility in this regime. Because ending on-hand inventory is 0 and profit equals holding cost, the OR engine will target a 50% service level base stock (the mean), which is appropriate given the symmetric cost of overstocking and understocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May/early June (P13-P16) at an average of 52 units per period (range 45-59).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has settled into a remarkably stable regime. Looking at the last five periods (P13-P17), the weekly demand figures are 45, 46, 59, 58, and 45, averaging 50.6 units. This consistency persists despite earlier fluctuations. Given the product is a staple denim item (High-waisted jeans), demand has likely bottomed out for the early summer period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods (same-day arrival). With Profit ($1.0) equal to Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend OR engine targets a 50% service level (z=0), meaning the base stock will roughly equal the mean demand for the period. To prevent stockouts seen in P12 and P16, I will use a recent_N window (N=5) to capture the current mean (~51) and standard deviation accurately, ensuring we maintain enough inventory to cover this tight demand range without excessive carrying costs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. This product (Jade HW Skinny Denim) has shown a significantly lower demand regime since early May. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), demand has averaged 46.5 units, with the most recent period (P18) dropping to 26 units. The product is likely moving into a summer lows regime, common for 'superstretch skinny legs' denim. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since Period 13, demand has stayed within a range of 26-59 units. To prevent overstocking as demand softens further into mid-June, I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current regime more accurately than the broader history, while maintaining a standard sigma_hat to buffer for occasional small spikes identified in late May.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for June (P17-P18 average: 35.5) shows further softening compared to the May average of ~52, confirming a downward summer trend.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product (Skinny Denim) is in a low-demand summer phase. The demand for the last three periods (P17-P19) has consistently decreased (45, 26, 22), with the most recent two-week average at 24 units. This confirms a significant downward trend entering late June. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will prioritize the most recent 3 periods (P17, P18, P19) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they reflect the current stabilized low-demand summer regime better than the May levels (avg ~52). With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, making base_stock equal to the mean demand. Setting N=3 for demand and volatility parameters will align ordering with this current lower run rate, minimizing holding costs while covering potential minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late June (P18-P19) has stabilized at a new low of approximately 24 units per period, continuing the seasonal decline from early June (~45) and May (~52).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historically, demand for this skinny denim SKU has shown a strong downward trend as we enter the summer months. Demand in June (Periods 18-20) averaged 21 units (26, 22, 15), with a noticeable dip to 15 in the most recent period. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the high parity between profit and holding cost (1:1), which results in a critical ratio of 0.5, the inventory policy should target the median demand (z=0). To prevent overstocking during this seasonal decline while maintaining enough stock to cover the current period's demand, I will use recent_N with N=3 for \u03bc_hat and \u03c3_hat. This focuses on the most recent late-June performance (avg 21) which is the best predictor for early July behavior for this winter/spring-oriented product.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for early July confirmed at a low level; P18-P20 average is 21 units, showing a continued seasonal decline for high-waisted denim into the summer season.

Demand has steadily dropped from ~250 in February to an average of ~19 units over the last three periods (P19-P21). Period 21 saw a demand of 21, and the on-hand inventory is now 0. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all 21 game periods. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50. I will set L to 0 (default) as it is confirmed. I will use the recent 3 periods (P19, P20, P21) to capture the current low-demand summer regime, resulting in a mu_hat of approximately (1+0) * 19.33 = 19.33 units. This allows the system to order enough to meet current demand without accumulating excess holding costs on a declining product.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for early July (P19-P21) has stabilized at a low average of ~19 units per period, continuing the seasonal decline for denim trousers into mid-summer.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has been in a significant seasonal decline throughout the summer, hitting lows between 15-22 units in June and July. However, Period 22 observed a slight uptick to 34 units (though with stockout), which might indicate some mid-summer volatility or a small localized spike. The overall trend remains low (~20-25 units). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across 22 observations. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should essentially target the median. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (P19-P22 average is ~23 units) to capture the current low-demand floor while acknowledging the recent slight increase. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observation for Period 23 (102 units) indicates a significant upward spike, breaking the multi-period downward trend and the established summer low (averaging ~20 units). This suggests a potential early start to 'Back-to-School' shopping or a late-summer seasonal shift for high-waisted denim. Since the product has been frequently stocking out (ending inventory 0 in P21, P22, P23), historical demand data from the current game doesn't fully capture the true demand due to lost sales. I am adjusting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this sharp upward rebound (P21: 21, P22: 34, P23: 102), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the increased volatility caused by this shift. Lead time (L) remains 'default' at 0 periods as arrivals have been consistently same-period throughout the entire history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Demand spiked to 102 (from a previous 3-period average of ~23), likely indicating the start of a late-summer/back-to-school seasonal recovery.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the high-waisted skinny denim has clearly shifted into a back-to-school recovery phase. After a summer low (Periods 19-21 average: ~19), demand spiked to 102 in Period 23 and surged further to 171 in Period 24. This follows the late July timing (2019/7/22) typical for apparel retail recovery. We have stocked out for three consecutive periods, indicating current inventory parameters are significantly under-forecasting. Historical February data showed demand around 250, so we should anticipate demand to continue climbing toward those levels. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 210 (based on a conservative average of the spike and early-year levels) and sigma_hat to 60 to allow for the high volatility seen during seasonal transitions. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant back-to-school demand recovery confirmed: Period 23 (102 units) and Period 24 (171 units) mark a sharp departure from the summer average of ~20. Demand is currently trending upwards towards historical Q1 levels.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for high-waisted denim is experiencing a rapid 'back-to-school' recovery. Period 23 had 102 units, Period 24 had 171 units, and Period 25 reached 246 units. This 246 units exactly matches the demand seen in Period 1 (February), confirming that we are returning to the high-demand regime observed earlier in the year. The current trend suggests demand is likely to stay at or exceed this 240-250 range in the coming weeks of August. To avoid the stockouts seen in the last four periods (P22-P25), I will set mu_hat explicitly to 280 to proactively cover the rising trend and provide a small buffer. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to account for the high volatility seen during these regime shifts. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on the entire game history.

Carry-over insight: Significant back-to-school demand recovery confirmed: Period 25 demand reached 246 units, returning to Period 1 levels. Demand has increased sequentially for 4 periods (34 -> 102 -> 171 -> 246).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016003 (Skinny Denim) has transitioned into a robust back-to-school recovery. Recent demand sequence: P23: 102, P24: 171, P25: 246, P26: 213. This marks a return to the early-year high-demand regime (~200-300 units). Period 26 showed a slight dip from P25 but remains high. Given the date (August 12), we are in the peak back-to-school shopping window. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P24-P26) is 210 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this high-volume regime while acknowledging the slight stabilization seen in Period 26. Since the product is seasonal denim, volatility (sigma_hat) is high during regime shifts; I will use the recent_N=4 standard deviation to account for the sharp jump from 102 to 246. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all history.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand recovery confirmed and stabilized: Period 24-26 average is 210 units, returning the SKU to the high-demand regime observed in February (Period 1-4).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand regime driven by back-to-school seasonality (August). After a peak of 246 in Period 25 and 213 in Period 26, demand for Period 27 was 160. The three-period average for this recovery (P25-P27) is 206 units. Given the transition into late August, I expect demand to remain elevated but potentially stabilize or slightly soften compared to the initial peak. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this new high-demand regime (Periods 25-27), setting the mu_hat forecast around the 206-unit mark. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over these 3 periods to account for the increased volatility in this high-volume stage. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the most recent consecutive observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $207.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak of the back-to-school season (late August). Period 28 saw a massive demand spike to 344 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 3-period average (~206). My stockout in Period 28 (0 ending on-hand) indicates the OR engine's previous parameters were too conservative for this rapid acceleration. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I need to set mu_hat to cover the immediate demand of Period 29. Given the primary driver is seasonality (August demand peaking for school/fall prep), I will use an explicit forecast of 360 units for the next period to capture this upward momentum and prevent further lost sales, while setting sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility (current std of the recovery phase is approx 80).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at Period 28 (344 units) suggests the start of a late-August peak, exceeding the mid-August average of ~200.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016003' (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a high-demand regime driven by the late-summer and back-to-school season. Period 28 saw a significant spike to 344 units, and while Period 29 demand moderated slightly to 264, the overall level remains high compared to the summer lows (~20 units). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is approximately 245 units. Given that we are now entering September (2019/9/2), demand is expected to remain robust but may begin to stabilize as the initial back-to-school peak passes. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime while allowing for the slight moderation observed in the last period. Sigma_hat will also be set based on the last 4 periods to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for early September (Periods 26-29) has stabilized at a high levels averaging 245 units per period, consistently returning to the high-demand regime observed in Q1.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has fully recovered from its summer lows and is now operating in a high-demand regime consistent with late-summer/back-to-school trends. Current demand (Periods 29-30) averaged 218.5 units, following a peak in Period 28 (344 units). The date is September 9th, which usually marks the transition from back-to-school peaks into steady autumn demand. Historically, January/February demand for this SKU was in the 200-300 range (avg ~240). Over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), the average demand is 230.8 units. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to capture this stabilized high regime while accounting for the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 73) relative to the high demand, necessitating a replenishment order to meet the (L+1) period demand coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in a high regime for late-August/early-September (P26-P30) averaging 230.8 units, returning to levels observed in Q1.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime associated with the late-summer/back-to-school peak, though the most recent period (P31) showed a dip to 127 units. Looking at the history, the demand regime from P26 to P31 has averaged approximately 213.5 units (213, 160, 344, 264, 173, 127). The peak observed in P28 (344) appears to have passed, and we are seeing a gradual normalization. Given the high volatility in this peak period (range 127-344), I will use a recent window of 6 periods (P26-P31) to capture this stabilized high-demand state while accounting for the recent softening. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods, the OR engine will target a base stock that covers the expected 200+ unit demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility, ensuring high service levels during this season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for September (P26-P31) has stabilized at an average of 213.5 units, down slightly from the late August peak but significantly higher than summer levels.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September (Period 33). Historically, this follows a significant back-to-school peak (August) and is beginning to show a downward trend in demand as we move deeper into autumn. Demand has decreased over the last three periods (173 -> 127 -> 88). Specifically, the Period 31 and 32 demand levels (127 and 88) are significantly lower than the late-August average of ~200+. I will use a recent demand window to capture this cooling phase while maintaining enough safety stock to handle occasional spikes, as the high-waisted jeans category can remain relevant throughout the fall. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting N=5 for demand (mu_hat) captures the recent deceleration while smoothing out the volatility of the end-of-August peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening post-back-to-school: Periods 30-32 average 129.3 units, compared to the August (P26-P29) average of 245.3 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 experienced a massive demand spike (881 units), which is an extreme outlier compared to the recent post-back-to-school average of ~130. Given the date (Sept 23) and the product (Superstretch skinny jeans), this likely reflects a specific bulk event or a final late-September promotional peak. However, it completely depleted the inventory. I must replenish aggressively but cautiously to avoid overstocking if demand reverts to the softened mean observed in Periods 30-32 (~129). I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to bridge the gap between the extreme outlier and the recent logic, setting it to approximately 300 to ensure the order covers a potential continuation of high demand while recognizing the outlier nature of 881. Lead time remains stable at 0. Sigma is set high to account for the massive variance introduced by Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Demand anomaly at Period 33: Spike to 881 units, representing a 6.8x increase over the previous 3-period average (~129).

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a massive demand surge that began in Period 33 (881 units) and continued into Period 34 (590 units). This follows a 'back-to-school' recovery and likely represents a late-September/early-October peak or promotion, as these levels are far beyond any previous period in the game history or the historical seed data (max ~750). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Given the 'lead_time = 0' consistency across 34 periods, I will continue using L=0. To address the demand spike while the system is stocking out, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the average of the two spike periods (881+590)/2 = 735.5, and an 'explicit' sigma_hat reflecting the high volatility (std dev between 881 and 590 is ~205). This aggressive configuration ensures the base_stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) targets the current high-demand regime, while the OR engine's internal cap will protect against excessive over-ordering if this is a very short-lived anomaly.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike started Period 33: Avg demand jumped from ~130 (P30-32) to ~735 (P33-34), a 5.6x increase. Current regime represents the highest observed demand in the product's history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-60.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing high demand volatility. After an extreme spike in Periods 33-34 (avg 735 units), Period 35 demand dropped to 338 units. While significantly lower than the preceding two weeks, 338 is still roughly 2.5x the pre-spike average (~130). We are likely in a post-peak stabilization phase or a high-demand October regime. Period 35's actual demand (338) is the most relevant anchor for the current week, as the extreme 881 spike appears to have been a transient peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 340 (aligning with the most recent observation) to ensure sufficient stock while avoiding the over-ordering risk associated with the extreme P33-P34 spike. Sigma_hat is set to 230 via recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility of the last three periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high level following the late-September peak: Period 35 demand (338) suggests a return to a high-volume regime (~300-400 range), significantly lower than the P33-34 spike (~735) but much higher than early September (~130).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime following a massive late-September spike (P33-34 avg ~735). Although demand has cooled from those record peaks, Period 36 demand (407 units) indicates the regime has stabilized at a volume higher than the pre-spike level (~130) and the mid-October level (~338). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to selling out in Period 36. Given the Date (2019/10/21) and the product (High-waisted skinny denim), we should expect sustained high demand as we approach the late-autumn and holiday transition. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (Periods 33-36) which includes the spike and the subsequent stabilization, resulting in an average of 554 units. This ensures we carry enough stock to capture high-velocity sales while the OR backward-looking 'cap' prevents excessive over-ordering if demand slightly softens. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for mid-October (P35-36) stabilized at a high level (avg ~372), significantly elevated compared to early September (~130) but tapering from the extreme late-September spike (~735).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a high-volume regime following the extreme volatility of late September. In Period 37 (Oct 21), demand was 470 units, following a Period 36 demand of 407. The average demand across the last three periods (P35-P37) is 405 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the most recent arrivals. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the base stock should target the median demand (mu_hat). Since we are in late October, heading into November, we expect demand to remain seasonally elevated compared to summer lows, though perhaps tapering from the extreme September peak. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (N=3 captures the post-spike stabilization P35-37) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the broader volatility seen since the end of September.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late October (P35-P37) has stabilized at a high level, averaging 405 units per period, following the extreme volatility of September.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early November. Historically, the demand has stabilized at a high level since the extreme spike in late September. Over the last four weeks (Periods 35-38), demand has been 338, 407, 470, and 455, averaging approximately 417 units. This indicates a consistent high-demand regime for the fall season, likely driven by colder weather interest in high-waisted denim. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 38 due to demand (455) exceeding starting on-hand (405). To prevent further stockouts while keeping holding costs balanced (profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, though the backend OR logic uses a higher default safety stock logic), I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this stabilized high-demand regime. Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures the volatility of this specific regime is captured without the noise of the massive Period 33-34 spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late October/early November (P35-P38) has stabilized at a high level, averaging 417.5 units per period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The demand regime for high-waisted skinny denim has been highly elevated since late September, stabilizing at an average of 417.5 units over the last 4 periods (P35-P38). However, the most recent period (P39) shows a drop to 246 units, which may signal a tapering of the autumn peak as we move into mid-November. The actual lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high profit ($1.0) ratio, the balanced service level is 50%, which means the OR engine will target the median demand (base_stock = mu_hat). Since we are seeing a potential softening from the ~400 range towards a more moderate level, I will use recent_N (N=5) to factor in the lower P39 demand while still accounting for the strong October season. This provides a mu_hat of ~383, which balances the risk of overstocking high-holding-cost inventory against the risk of stockouts if the drop was just a one-week fluctuation.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering observed in early November: Period 39 demand fell to 246 units, compared to the Oct (P35-P38) average of 417.5 units, suggesting the end of the late-autumn seasonal peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in Period 41. Historical demand analysis shows that following the late October/early November peak (which averaged ~417 units from P35-P38), demand is now tapering. Period 39 (246 units) and Period 40 (302 units) indicate a transition to a lower demand regime as we move further into November. The product, high-waisted skinny denim, typically sees lower volatility after the autumn peak but before any potential holiday surges. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To account for the recent tapering while maintaining sufficient stock for potential late-November demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P38-P40, avg 334 units) and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the recent variance during the transition out of the peak. This balances the risk of stockouts against high holding costs for this high-volume SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed in mid-November: Period 39-40 average is 274 units, down ~35% from the Oct peak average of 417.5 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (Period 42). Demand has stayed in a lower regime compared to the October peak (avg ~417), specifically averaging 274 units over the last two periods (P40-P41). This suggests a post-peak tapering common for denim products before the holiday season. On-hand inventory is 61 units with nothing in-transit. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent demand regime (last 3 periods: 246, 302, 274, avg ~274) to avoid overstocking while holding cost equals profit ($1). I'll use N=3 to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient responsiveness to the downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in mid-November (Periods 39-41) at an average of 274 units, confirming a ~35% decline from the October peak average of 417.

Period 43 (Dec 2) - Observation of Period 42 conclude: Demand spiked significantly to 627 units, more than double the stabilized average of ~274 observed in Periods 39-41. This correlates with the start of the holiday season (post-Thanksgiving/Black Friday/Cyber Monday timeline), suggesting a massive December seasonal peak for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim'. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the large demand spike in Period 42. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0, I will set L=0. For demand forecasting, the recent stabilized regime of ~274 is now obsolete due to the holiday surge. I will use the most recent 3 periods (P40-P42) to capture the upward trajectory (302, 274, 627), which averages ~401 units. I'll use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to react quickly to this surge while hedging against the volatility of the single-period 627 spike. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the heightened volatility during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed at Period 42: Demand jumped to 627 units (compared to late-November average of ~274), likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday and December seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-December (Period 44). Last period (P43) saw a significant demand drop to 143 units after the late-November spike (627 units in P42, likely Black Friday). This suggests the peak holiday shopping surge has passed its initial extreme and is stabilizing or tapering before the final Christmas rush. The Carry-over insight for Period 43 confirms the surge, but the most recent observation shows a 77% decrease from that peak. Given the current date of Dec 9, I expect demand to remain moderate or slightly increase towards the end of the month, but not return to the extreme levels of P42. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to capture the high-demand period of October/November while tempering it with the recent lower observation from P43. For sigma_hat, I will use N=10 to account for the high volatility seen throughout the entire autumn/winter season (spikes of 600-800 vs 140-200).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday peak tapering: Period 43 demand (143) decreased 77% from the P42 surge (627), suggesting a cooling period in early December before year-end activities.

Daily Reward (R_t): $247.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 45 (Dec 16), demand for High-Waisted Skinny Denim is expected to trend upwards as we approach the end of the year and potential Christmas-week sales. Historically, Period 43 (Dec 2) showed a peak of 627, followed by a drop to 143 (Dec 9), and then a recovery to 283 in Period 44 (Dec 16 conclusion). This recovery suggests demand is stabilizing or increasing for the holiday season. The actual lead time L=0 has been extremely consistent. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the current volatility and trend following the late-November peaks (avg P42-P44: 351). Given the inventory on-hand of 36 units and expected demand higher than the recent 283, a base stock calculated using the last 3 samples will help buffer against a likely end-of-December spike.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility in December: Demand surged to 627 (P42), crashed to 143 (P43), then recovered to 283 (P44). This suggests high sensitivity to holiday shopping events.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). Demand for this SKU has shown significant holiday volatility: P42 (627 units - Black Friday), P43 (143 units), P44 (283 units), and P45 (247 units). The last two periods suggest a stabilization around the mid-200s (average 265) following the initial holiday spikes. Historically, January demand (P1) was 246 units. Given the date is right before Christmas, demand may either see a final surge or begin to taper towards January levels. Choosing recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat (P43-P45) captures the post-Black Friday average (~224) while remaining responsive. Sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) accounts for the recent high volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late December (P44-P45) has cooled to an average of ~265 units after high holiday volatility (P42-P43).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-47.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the final period (Period 47, Dec 30) follows the Christmas/Post-Holiday week. Period 46 saw a significant decline to 89 units from a previous average of ~265 (P44-P45). Given the current on-hand inventory of 136 units, and the established 0-period lead time, the existing stock is more than sufficient to cover the expected lower demand of the last week of the year. Historically, demand in early January (from historical samples: 752, 477, 500) suggests a massive rebound is imminent, but since this is the final period of the game, our objective is to maximize the final total reward R_t by avoiding holding costs for units that won't be sold within this cycle. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent cooling (using the last 3 periods to capture the post-holiday dip) while ensuring the base stock calculation prevents unnecessary ordering.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling confirmed: Period 46 demand (89) reflects a ~66% drop from the mid-December average (~265), signaling the end of the 2019 holiday peak.
