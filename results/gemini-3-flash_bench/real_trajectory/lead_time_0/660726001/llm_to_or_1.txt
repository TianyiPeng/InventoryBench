Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse). Historical demand shows a steep ramp-up: 0, 0, 13, 27, 26 units over the last 5 weeks, suggesting the start of a spring/pre-Easter seasonal trend for blouses. The mean demand of the last 3 samples is approximately 22 units/week. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the recent 3 samples to capture this newer demand level and set L to default (0). Given the sharp increase from zero, recent_N (N=3) is more appropriate than the full history mean.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand of 60 substantially exceeded our initial order of 35, resulting in 25 units of lost sales and 0 ending on-hand inventory. The historical samples (0, 0, 13, 27, 26) suggested a much lower demand than the current actual demand seen in the last three periods (27, 26, 60). We are likely entering a higher demand regime or seasonal peak for women's blouses in mid-February. I will set L to 0 (default), and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward trend (avg demand ~37.6, with the most recent being 60), ensuring our base stock level accounts for the high demand and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1330.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Straight-cut blouse' (Womens Tailoring), which typically sees a seasonal demand increase in Spring. Current observations show a sharp demand regime shift starting in early February: demand jumped from ~26 (Feb 04) to 60 (Feb 11) and then to 146 (Feb 18). This indicates a significant upward trend. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals verify that actual lead time matches this. With on-hand inventory at 0 and cumulative demand significantly exceeding previous stock levels, I need to capture this high-growth regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent surge (146, 60, 26) more heavily than the zero-demand periods in January, ensuring the base stock level targets this higher demand floor while acknowledging high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: Significant move from 20s to 100+ range, likely driven by spring seasonality for women's blouses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1860.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse) has entered a high-demand spring regime since mid-February. Historical demand samples from January (0-27) are no longer relevant. Recent demand in the last three periods has been 60, 146, and 102 (average ~102.7). The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (confirmed by arrivals in P1, P2, and P3 concluding within the same period). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the priority is maximizing service level. I will use the last 3 periods (the duration of the current regime) to calculate mean and standard deviation to ensure the base stock levels remain responsive to the higher demand levels observed in the spring peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1906.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's short-sleeved blouse. Since early February, demand shifted from nearly zero to a high-volume regime (averaging 103 units over the last 4 weeks: 60, 146, 102, 104). The spike to 146 in Period 2 suggests volatility, but the last two weeks have stabilized around 103. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use the recent 4 samples (since the regime shift in Period 1) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current spring seasonal demand while providing a buffer for the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1739.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's straight-cut blouse, which is highly seasonal for spring. Demand transitioned from near-zero in January to a steady high-demand regime starting mid-February (Period 1). Over the last three periods (P3-P5), demand has stabilized with a mean of 100.33 (102, 104, 95) and low volatility. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in all concluded periods. Current on-hand inventory is 66 units. I will set the base stock level to cover the current stable demand regime (approx 100 units per period) with a small buffer for variance. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this stable high-demand period effectively while ignoring the ramp-up phase and the zero-demand January data. This will ensure we maintain service levels for this seasonal item while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a high-demand regime (~100 units/week) for 3 consecutive periods following the initial February surge.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse) is currently in a high-demand regime following a seasonal surge in mid-February. Over the last four periods (Periods 3-6), demand has averaged approximately 95 units (102, 104, 95, 79), showing a slight cooling in the most recent observation but remaining significantly higher than the initial January base. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (30 units on-hand, 0 in-transit). To capture the current regime while acknowledging the recent slight decline, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the ~100 unit/week demand level typical of the current spring season.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which is entering its peak seasonal demand period. Demand has remained consistently high, averaging approximately 105 units over the last 5 periods (P3-P7: 102, 104, 95, 79, 105). Although P6 saw a dip to 79, P7 bounced back to 105. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (9 units), and there is nothing in-transit. To capture the full demand potential and avoid stockouts during this busy season, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods of data (N=5) to reflect the current high-demand regime, and use the default lead time (0).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a women's blouse with short sleeves, which is currently experiencing peak spring seasonality. Historical demand for the last 8 periods (since the regime shift identified in February) has averaged 100.6 units per week (min: 60, max: 146). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit). To maintain a high service level given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend needs to target a base stock level that covers the current period's demand (L=0, so 1+L=1 period of demand coverage). I will use the last 8 samples (N=8) to estimate mean and standard deviation, as this captures the entire high-demand regime during this spring season while excluding the 'zero' demand period from January.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which is entering its peak spring/early summer season. Demand has remained consistently high, averaging approximately 100 units per week over the last 7 periods (Periods 3-9). While Period 9 saw a slight dip to 79, this follows a Period 8 peak of 114. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 63 units with zero in-transit. To ensure high service levels during the active spring season while avoiding excessive holding costs, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the demand regime since the spring surge began (starting Period 3). This provides a stable mean of ~97 units per period and accounts for current volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (women's blouse) has maintained a stable demand regime since late February, following its initial seasonal surge. Since Period 6, demand has fluctuated between 79 and 114 units, with a mean of 92.8 units over the last 5 weeks. The promised lead time of 0 remains reliable, with all orders in the history concluding within the same period (L=0). As we move further into the spring season (late April), demand remains robust. I am setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time is consistently 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=7 (covering Periods 4-10) to capture the stabilized demand level while filtering out the initial volatility of the February surge. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a 95% service level based on the most recent, relevant demand patterns.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

The current date is April 29, 2019. The SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse) is in a high-demand regime that has been stable since mid-February. Over the last 11 periods, the lead time has consistently been 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 7-11) has been 105, 114, 79, 87, and 96, with an average of approximately 96 units and a standard deviation of about 13.5. There are no missing shipments or pipeline inventory (on-hand is 22, in-transit is 0). I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture this current stable demand level while ignoring the initial volatility seen in February. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock target of mu_hat + z*sigma_hat.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (Women's short sleeve blouse) has maintained a stable demand regime since mid-February. Over the last 10 periods (P3 to P12), demand has averaged 91.1 units per week, with a consistent lead time of 0. The most recent demand (P12) was lower at 60 units, but this falls within the typical variance of the established regime. As we move into May, demand for short-sleeved blouses is expected to remain firm or increase with warmer weather. To capture this stabilized high-demand regime, I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the pre-February '0' demand periods and the initial transition spike, focusing on the current seasonal baseline. The lead time remains at the default (0).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse) is exiting its peak spring season as we move into mid-May. Demand has shown a clear decelerating trend over the last three periods, dropping from 96 to 60, and most recently to 40 units in Period 13. Given the current date of May 13th, it is evidenced that the 'high-demand regime' noted in Period 6 (~100 units/week) has concluded and we are entering a lower demand phase. Inventory on-hand is currently 79 units, which covers nearly two weeks of the most recent demand level. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. To reflect this recent slowdown and avoid overstocking in a declining seasonal trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the specific downward trajectory of the last three weeks (averaging ~65 units) rather than the longer-term historical average (~90 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Seasonal decline confirmed as demand dropped from ~100 to 40 units over 3 weeks (May seasonal tapering).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (short-sleeve blouse) is currently in a seasonal decline as we move further into May. Demand has dropped significantly from the previous regime (~100 units/week) to a new lower level. The last three periods (P12-P14) recorded demands of 60, 40, and 32 respectively. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 14 regarding a seasonal tapering. I will set mu_hat to the mean of these last 3 samples (average = 44) to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough stock to avoid stockouts if demand stabilizes. Since actual lead time has consistently been 0, I will use the default setting. The OR engine will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that reflects the current lower demand environment, preventing excessive holding costs as the season winds down.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse) is experiencing a seasonal decline as we move into late May. Demand has dropped significantly from the spring peak (~100 units) to a much lower range (P13: 40, P14: 32, P15: 19). I am setting N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this most recent downward trend, which gives an average of approximately 30 units per period. With a promised lead time of 0 (consistently realized in history) and current on-hand inventory at 62 units, the system already has enough stock to cover over two periods of current demand levels. By using N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that reflects the lower, current traffic, likely resulting in a minimal or zero order to prevent excess holding costs during this tapering phase.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this summer blouse (short sleeves) has continued its seasonal decline following the initial May drop. Demand in the most recent two periods (P15-P16) has settled in the high teens (19 and 18), compared to the ~30-40 range seen in early May. With a current on-hand inventory of 44 units, we are already holding enough stock to cover approximately two weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the promised lead time of 0 and historical lead time consistently being 0 (actual), I will use the last 4 samples (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this new lower-demand regime (averaging ~27 over the last 4 weeks but trending lower). This will likely result in a low order or no order, preventing excessive holding costs as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift further clarified: Post-peak demand has dropped from ~100 to a lower regime, with the last two periods (P15-P16) stabilizing around 18-19 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $255.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse) is clearly in a post-peak seasonal decline as of mid-June. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime over the last three periods (P15: 19, P16: 18, P17: 15), averaging approximately 17.3 units per week. This is a significant drop from the spring peak which averaged ~100 units. On-hand inventory is currently 30 units, which is sufficient to cover nearly two weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the promised lead time of 0 periods (and evidence that actual lead time consistently remains 0), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime. This will prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $19 profit margin.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (straight-cut blouse) is in a clear seasonal decline following its peak in early spring. Demand has steadily decreased from ~100 units/week in April to a low of 11 in the most recent period (Period 18). Specifically, the last four periods show a demand sequence of 19, 18, 15, and 11, indicating a current regime of approximately 15 units per period with low volatility. Since lead time is consistently 0, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this low-demand state and prevent overstocking as the season ends. This helps minimize holding costs which currently outweigh the risk of stockouts given the high level of ending inventory (19 units) relative to recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Seasonal tapering continues, with demand dropping from ~18 units/week to ~13 units/week over the last 4 periods (Period 15-18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $418.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse) is in a clear seasonal decline typical for late June, though Period 19 saw a slight unexpected demand uptick to 26 units. Historical data shows a steady drop from ~100 units in April to ~11-15 in early June. I've detected a stable low-demand regime over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) with a mean of 17.8 units. Although P19 demand was 26, the overall trend is soft. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit margins ($19) relative to holding costs ($1), a stockout is more costly than overstocking, so I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the current low-demand volatility while accounting for the recent small bounce. I will use recent_N=5 for demand and sigma estimation to reflect the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a low level for 5 periods (P15-P19) following the spring peak, averaging ~18 units/week. Lead time consistently observed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $513.00

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 showed a massive, unexpected demand spike to 156 units, occurring on 2019-06-24. This follows a long period of low demand (averaging ~18 units/week) and is likely a mid-summer clearance sale or a final seasonal peak for this short-sleeved blouse. Since on-hand inventory is now 0 and another spike could occur before the season fully ends, I will adjust mu_hat to capture this high-demand signal while acknowledging it may be an outlier. I will use recent_N=6 to include the spike alongside the previous low-demand weeks (P15-P20), which averages approximately 40 units/week. Lead time is stable at 0. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to account for the dramatically increased volatility introduced by the 156-unit demand period.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand spike detected at Period 20 (2019-06-24): Demand jumped from ~20 to 156, indicating potential clearance or late-season peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2546.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime, likely a July clearance or late-summer peak for this sleeveless blouse. Demand jumped to 156 in Period 20 and 238 in Period 21. Last period's order of 134 was insufficient to meet the demand of 238, resulting in a stockout. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this high-demand momentum while ensuring we don't overstock as the season progresses, I will use recent_N=2 for demand mean and standard deviation. This focuses on the two most recent spike periods (P20-P21) where the average demand is 197 ((156+238)/2). Given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend's service level target will be high (95%+), which is appropriate for a spike that might be brief.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand spike verified: Market demand significantly accelerated in periods 20 and 21 (averaging 197 units/week), confirming a high-intensity summer clearing or late-season peak.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '660726001' (Womens Blouse) is currently in a mid-summer high-demand phase, likely driven by clearance or seasonal peak sales. Recent demand history shows a massive surge starting Period 20 (156 units) and Period 21 (238 units), followed by 129 units in Period 22. The average demand over these last three periods is approximately 174 units per week. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. With an ending on-hand inventory of 164 units from Period 22, and the high volatility of this summer peak, parameters must prioritize capturing this volume while acknowledging the potential for a rapid drop-off as seen in previous seasonality shifts. I am selecting N=3 for demand and standard deviation to align with this specific summer regime change.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved blouse, which experienced a significant mid-summer demand spike starting at Period 20 (2019-06-24). Demand appears to have peaked around Period 21 (238 units) and is now beginning to taper off, with Period 22 showing 129 units and Period 23 showing 111 units. This downward trend (238 -> 129 -> 111) suggests we have passed the peak of the clearance or summer spike. We currently have 157 units on hand. I will use the average demand of the last 4 periods (P20-P23: (156+238+129+111)/4 \u2248 158.5) to set mu_hat, but I'll use a slightly more conservative N=4 window to capture the recent highs while acknowledging the drift. In-transit is 0, and lead time has been consistently 0 periods. The goal is to avoid overstocking as we move further into late July/August when demand for short-sleeved blouses typically falls.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak tapering: Demand peaked at Period 21 (238) and has declined for two consecutive periods (129 and 111), suggesting the end of the high-intensity summer sales event.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse) is currently in a state of high demand volatility following a summer peak. After a significant demand spike in Periods 20 and 21 (156, 238), demand moderated but spiked again in Period 24 to 198 (from 129 and 111). This suggests that while we are likely past the absolute peak of the summer season, demand remains elevated and unpredictable around the ~110-200 range. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To manage this recent volatility and prevent stockouts during these late-season fluctuations, I am focusing on the demand pattern from the last 5 periods (P20-P24). The mean demand over these 5 periods is approximately 166 units, which captures the high-intensity phase. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will set a high base stock that reflects this recent intensity while the 0-period lead time allows for responsive replenishments.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly starting Period 20; Period 24 demand (198) contradicts the early tapering signal from Periods 22-23 (129, 111), indicating a secondary peak or sustained late-summer interest.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved blouse, which has shown significant demand volatility throughout the summer. Following a major peak in late June/early July (up to 238 units), demand has fluctuated between 111 and 198 units over the last five periods (P21-P25). The most recent demand (Period 25) was 118, suggesting a return to the lower end of this high-volatility range as summer concludes. Given this volatility, I am using a recent window (N=6, covering the entire summer peak period starting at P20) to capture the current regime's mean and variance. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for potential late-season spikes while acknowledging the current downward trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of high volatility following a late-summer demand surge that started around Period 20 (late June). While there was an initial tapering signal in Periods 22-23, demand has remained robust above 100 units for the last three periods (118, 138, and 198 in P24). The current date is August 12th, which typically marks the final phase of summer sales before the transition to autumn collections. Given the volatility (198, 118, 138), I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7 covers the entire summer surge period) to capture the current high-demand mean (~155 units/week across P20-P26), which provides a more stable baseline than the most recent single data point. Sigma is also calculated over these 7 periods to account for the significantly increased variance observed during this event. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on historical conclusion messages.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime confirmed (P20-P26): Demand mean shifted from ~18 to ~155 units/week with significantly higher volatility. Seasonal tapering has not yet consistently materialized as of P27.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer regime that started around Period 20 (late June). While there have been minor fluctuations, demand has remained significant (99 units in the most recent period, P27). However, looking at the historical trajectory from the spring season (P14-P17), a seasonal decline eventually occurs. The product is a 'short cap sleeve blouse', which is highly seasonal for summer. As we are now in mid-August (P28), we should expect the summer peak to begin tapering off soon. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods. To balance the risk of a sudden seasonal drop against current high demand (average of ~150 since P20), I will use a recent window (N=8) to capture the summer regime while allowing for the most recent lower data points (99, 138, 118) to weigh in and slightly reduce the base stock. This cautious approach prevents excessive overstocking as the season ends.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse) is currently in a late-summer high-demand regime, though showing signs of stabilization or gradual tapering. Demand in the last two periods has been very consistent (99 units in P27, 96 units in P28), following a volatile peak earlier in the summer. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since Period 20, the average demand has been approximately 142 units, but the most recent 4 periods (P25-P28) average 112 units. I will use recent_N=4 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slightly lower, more stable demand level while maintaining sufficient stock to cover the 112-unit average forecast plus safety stock, especially given the current on-hand inventory of 131 units which almost covers the expected base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: After the volatile summer peak (P20-P25), demand has stabilized over the last 4 periods (P25-P28) around an average of 112 units/week, down from the peak average of ~155.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-09-02 (Period 30). We are tracking SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse). Demand has transitioned from a high-intensity summer peak (P20-P25 avg ~155) to a more stable, slightly lower regime over the last five periods (P25-P29). Specifically, demand from P25 to P29 was 118, 138, 99, 96, and 83. This indicates a clear downward trend/tapering as we move into September, with the average of these last five periods being 106.8 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this seasonal decline while maintaining service levels, I will use a recent window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current downward trajectory and the associated volatility of this tapering phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~155 (summer peak) to ~107 over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), indicating the end-of-season transition into autumn.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse) is currently in a seasonal tapering phase following a high-demand summer peak. Demand has consistently stabilized and slightly declined over the last six periods (Periods 25-30), dropping from a volatile summer average of ~155 to a more controlled average of ~102.3 units/week. Specifically, the last three periods show high stability (83, 80 units). Given the date (Sept 9) and the nature of short-sleeve blouses, I expect demand to continue drifting lower as we move further into autumn. Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this post-peak stabilization while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen during this transition. This approach ensures enough stock to meet demand around the 100-unit level while the OR backend's service level logic (based on high profit vs low holding cost) maintains a sufficient buffer.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for this blouse has transitioned from its summer peak (~155 units/week) to an early autumn regime. Over the last 7 periods (P25-P31), the average demand has been approximately 101 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P29-P31) show a tighter cluster around 87 units. Given the carry-over insight that tapering is confirmed, I will use a recent window of N=7 to capture the post-peak mean and volatility while remaining responsive to the gradual decline. No shipment losses or lead time delays have been observed; L remains 0. On-hand inventory is 40 units, and the OR backend will calculate the order based on a 2-period coverage (L+1) using the parameters provided.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P25-P31) shows stabilization at ~101 units/week, down 35% from the summer peak average, confirming seasonal tapering into autumn.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse) is in a post-summer tapering phase. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime following the high-intensity summer peak. Over the last 8 periods (P25-P32), the average demand is approximately 96.5 units/week, which is significantly lower than the summer peak average (~155 units/week). The most recent period (P32) recorded a demand of 59, suggesting a potential further deceleration as we move deeper into autumn (late September). Given the inventory on hand (77 units) and a lead time of 0, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining responsiveness to the recent lower volume. This approach balances the need to satisfy remaining autumn demand while avoiding excessive holding costs for a seasonal item at the end of its cycle. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The product (straight-cut blouse) is in a post-summer tapering phase. Historically, demand peaked in July (P21 at 238 units) and has moved into a more stable but lower autumn regime. Over the last 9 periods (P25-P33), which represents the tapering phase identified in carry-over insights, the average demand has settled at approximately 97.9 units per week. The most recent five periods (P29-P33) show a similar average (85.6 units) but with a recent minor uptick in P33 (107 units). I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this entire post-peak stabilization regime while smoothing out the week-to-week volatility. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. This strategy balances the need to meet the steady but lower autumn demand without overstocking as the season progresses.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (Women's Blouse) is entering October, a period historically associated with a significant downturn for short-sleeve summer/spring items. Previous carry-over insights confirmed a tapering from the summer peak (~155 units) to an autumn stabilize regime (~101 units). However, the most recent period (P34) saw a dramatic drop in demand to 22 units, which is much lower than the previous regime's average. This likely signals a secondary tapering or the final end-of-season clearance phase. The current on-hand inventory is 114 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 5 weeks of demand at the P34 level (22 units). Given the inventory surplus and the seasonal trend heading into late autumn/winter for a short-sleeve blouse, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime shift (N=3 to capture the recent volatility and the sharp drop) and setting L to default (0). This strategy aims to avoid further accumulation of holding costs on a declining seasonal item.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Extreme seasonal tapering detected. Demand dropped to 22 units in P34, roughly 80% below the P25-P31 autumn average (~101). Anticipate continued low demand as winter approaches for this short-sleeve item.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (short-sleeve blouse) is clearly entering a low-demand winter regime. Demand plummeted from an autumn average of ~101 to 22 units in Period 34 and remained low at 27 units in Period 35. This represents an ~80% decline compared to the previous regime. With an on-hand inventory of 106 units and expected demand likely to stay in the 20-30 range, current stock already covers nearly 4 periods of demand. To avoid excessive holding costs during this off-season period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 2 samples (P34-P35) to reflect this collapse accurately. The OR backend will see that on-hand (106) already exceeds the base stock level (around 50-60), resulting in no new order being placed, which is the correct economic decision for a seasonal item at the end of its cycle.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand winter regime confirmed: Demand for Period 34-35 averaged 24.5 units, down significantly from the autumn average of ~101 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (short-sleeve blouse) has entered a low-demand winter regime as of early October. Demand has dropped significantly from the autumn average (~101) to a stable low range: P34 (22), P35 (27), and P36 (20). This averages 23 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 86 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of the current low demand. Since the lead time is consistently 0, and current inventory is high relative to the forecast, I am setting mu_hat to reflect this new low-demand regime using the last 3 periods (N=3) to prevent further overstocking while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat is also updated to N=3 to capture the reduced volatility of this current stage.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The product is a short-sleeve blouse, which is highly seasonal and currently in a low-demand winter regime. Demand has stabilized at a low level over the last 4 periods (P34-P37), with values of 22, 27, 20, and 29, averaging approximately 24.5 units per week. This represents a significant drop from the autumn average of ~101. On-hand inventory is 57 units, which is already more than double the current average weekly demand. Since lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this current low-demand regime using the last 4 periods to avoid overstocking during the off-season. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to reflect the lower volatility in this stabilized low-demand period. No new order is expected to be triggered by the OR engine as on-hand exceeds the required base stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (short-sleeved blouse) is currently in a low-demand winter regime as expected for this product category in November. Since Period 34, demand has consistently stayed within the range of 20-29 units (P34: 22, P35: 27, P36: 20, P37: 29, P38: 28). The average demand over the last 5 periods is 25.2 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 29 units, which closely matches the demand observed in the most recent periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, maintaining a service level that covers this low regime is optimal without overstocking. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this stable winter baseline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved blouse, which is highly seasonal. Demand has entered a sustained low-demand winter regime beginning around Period 34. In the most recent six periods (P34-P39), demand has been 22, 27, 20, 29, 28, and 10, averaging 22.6 units per week. This represents a significant decline from the autumn average of ~101. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a low-demand item during its off-season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to capture this stabilized winter level. The service level provided by the OR backend remains appropriate for balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime stabilized: Demand since P34 (late Sept) has averaged approximately 23 units/week, establishing a consistent floor for the off-season.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (short-sleeve blouse) is currently in a stable low-demand winter regime. Demand from Period 34 to 40 has averaged approximately 20.6 units per week, significantly lower than the autumn average (~100) or summer peak (~155). The most recent two periods (P39-P40) show even lower demand (10 and 8 units), suggesting a potential further dip as we approach late November. However, a regime-based average (N=7, since P34) of ~21 units is a safer base to avoid understocking if demand fluctuates slightly. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Parameters are set using recent_N=7 to capture this established off-season floor while ignoring the high-volume historical data from summer and spring. This strategy maintains enough stock to meet demand while minimizing holding costs for a seasonal item in its off-peak period.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor further refined: Last 7 periods (P34-P40) average 20.6 units/week, with the most recent two periods showing a dip into single/low-double digits (8-10 units).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 42 (2019-11-25). Demand has been in a sustained low-demand winter regime since Period 34 (late September), as the product is a short-sleeve 'Straight-cut blouse' with 'short cap sleeves'. Over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), demand has averaged 19.1 units. More critically, over the last 3 periods (P39-P41), demand has dropped further to an average of 9.0 units (10, 8, 9), signaling a tighter floor for the deep off-season. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level (optimal q \u2248 0.95), I will set the demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) based on the most recent 5 periods (P37-P41) to capture this stabilized low-demand floor (avg ~16.8, which includes the slightly higher late Oct values, but provides enough buffer).

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor confirmed: Last 3 periods (P39-P41) show very low stable demand averaging 9.0 units/week, down from the early-winter average of ~20.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019-11-25 (Period 42) showed a sudden spike to 33 units, following three periods of very low demand (averaging 9 units). However, the preceding 'early winter' regime (P34-P40) averaged approximately 21 units. The single spike to 33 in P42 coincides with late November, likely influenced by 'Black Friday' or early holiday shopping, but for a short-sleeve blouse, it is unlikely to signal a sustained high-demand regime heading into December. I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=4) to encompass both the low floor and the recent spike, providing a balanced forecast for the OR engine while keeping inventory lean to avoid high holding costs for an off-season item.

Carry-over insight: Late November demand spike: Period 42 saw demand rise to 33 units, likely a temporary holiday/promotional event rather than a permanent regime shift for this short-sleeve blouse SKU.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand spike in Period 42 (33 units) appears to be a transitory event, likely linked to late November promotional activities (Black Friday/Cyber Monday), as Period 43 demand returned to the previously established winter floor (9 units). Since P39, demand has been extremely low, averaging 13.8 units/week (10, 8, 9, 33, 9). Given this is a short-sleeve item and we are entering December, I expect demand to remain at this low floor. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this winter regime (including the holiday spike to ensure adequate but conservative safety stock) while ignoring the much higher autumn/summer historical data. Service level remains high due to the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), which the OR backend with default settings will naturally target. Lead time is consistently 0.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 660726001 (short-sleeve blouse) is currently in a low-demand winter regime. Following a brief spike in Period 42 (likely due to Black Friday or early holiday promotions), demand has returned to its off-season floor, with the last two periods showing 9 and 13 units respectively. Since Period 39 (approx. 6 weeks), demand has averaged 13.7 units, with a very low baseline. Current on-hand inventory is 19 units, which covers more than one period of the current mean demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this stabilized winter floor (P39-P44) while ignoring the higher autumn volumes, ensuring we don't overstock during the end-of-year period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant holiday demand spike occurred in Period 45 (2019/12/16), with demand jumping to 115 units, far exceeding the winter baseline of ~9-13 units. This is likely driven by pre-Christmas shopping. Period 46 (2019/12/23) is exactly the week of Christmas, where demand typically remains elevated or peaks as last-minute shopping concludes. The current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand window while acknowledging the imminent post-holiday drop-off, I will set mu_hat to 120 (reflecting the sustained holiday peak) and use a high sigma_hat (50) to account for the extreme volatility observed between the winter floor and this spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 45 demand reached 115 units (approx. 10x winter baseline), indicating a sharp seasonal peak for late December.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '660726001' (short-sleeve blouse) is currently in a high-volatility holiday window. Period 45 saw a demand spike to 115 units, followed by 71 units in Period 46. As the current date is December 30, we are exiting the peak holiday shopping week and entering the post-holiday/New Year clearance period. While demand has slightly tapered from the 115 peak, 71 is still significantly above the 9-13 unit baseline seen in early December. In-transit is 0 and on-hand inventory is 132. Given the short-sleeve nature of the product and the imminent arrival of January, I expect demand to regress toward a lower baseline, though it may remain elevated for one more week due to returns or gift card spending. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture this decelerating but still elevated holiday average (~93 units), and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to account for the high volatility observed throughout December. Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization: Demand for late December (P45-P46) averaged 93 units, a sharp but temporary departure from the winter baseline of ~10-20 units.
