Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11) for 'Band leggings'. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a very stable pattern (100, 92, 103, 104, 99) with a mean of 99.6 and a standard deviation of 4.77. The on-hand inventory is 0. Since the promised lead time is 0, orders placed now arrive in the same period. To satisfy the immediate demand for Period 1, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the available history. I'm choosing N=5 to capture all recent relevant data. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand of approximately 100 units plus a safety buffer for the 1+L (1+0=1) period window.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the observed demand was 92 units, which aligns with the historical average of approximately 100 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods was confirmed as the order of 100 units placed in Period 1 arrived immediately, resulting in 100 units available to meet the demand of 92, leaving 8 units on hand. For Period 2, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the stable demand pattern observed in the 5 historical samples provided (100, 92, 103, 104, 99). The lead time parameter L will remain 'default' as the actual lead time matches the promised 0 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical demand (Jan-Feb) was stable around 100. However, Period 2 saw a spike to 138, which resulted in a stockout (on-hand 0). This spike may be related to late February turnover or early spring shopping for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the last 3 periods (including the spike) to calculate mean and standard deviation to respond to the recent increase in demand and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jersey leggings with wide elastication at the waist', a basic women's item. In Period 1, demand was 92. In Period 2, demand rose to 138 (with a stockout), and in Period 3, demand was 124 (with another stockout). The initial samples (Jan/early Feb) averaged 99.6 units, but the last two periods averaged 131 units, suggesting a demand shift as we move into March. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. To recover from consecutive stockouts and meet the higher observed demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 samples, which captures the recent shift while mitigating the lower initial sample. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility (from 92 to 138).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 2: Avg demand increased from ~100 to ~131 units/period (+31%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings'. Since Period 2 (mid-February), demand has shifted from an initial average of ~100 to an average of ~130 (138, 124, 128). This shift likely represents the start of the spring season for everyday basics. Over the last three periods (P2-P4), we have experienced stockouts every single period because the ordering was too conservative relative to the high realized demand and the zero ending inventory. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been confirmed through P4. To resolve the stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this higher demand regime. With profit and holding costs both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend will target the mean demand. By using the recent high-demand regime, we ensure the 'base_stock' covers the expected 130 units, and since L=0, the order will aim to replenish the full amount needed for next period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Womens Everyday Basics Leggings) showed a significant demand increase from Period 2 to 4 (avg ~130), but Period 5 saw a sharp drop to 71 units. Looking at the calendar (mid-March), this may reflect a temporary cooling before spring shifts, or high volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 59 units and recent demand has been volatile (138, 124, 128, 71), I will use a balanced forecast. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the higher regime while acknowledging the recent dip (avg ~115 per period). Since L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*115. Sigma_hat will also be calculated using N=4 to account for the increased variance seen in the recent drop.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics' (Band leggings). Current date: 2019/3/25. Looking at the history, a significant demand shift was previously noted (avg ~131). However, the last two periods show demand of 71 and 108, which are lower than the Period 2-4 peak (138, 124, 128). This suggests the initial spike might have subsided or settled into a more moderate range. The mean of the 'post-shift' demand (Periods 2-6) is (138+124+128+71+108)/5 = 113.8. Promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm actual lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is currently 8 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the post-initial-spike mean of ~114 units, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma to adjust for the recent volatility (range 71 to 138). This balanced approach ensures we cover the current demand level without over-ordering based on the initial period 2 spike.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product is 'Band leggings', a stable basic. Historical data from P2 onwards shows a demand regime change. Specifically, P2-P7 demand values are: 138, 124, 128, 71, 108, 138. The mean of these 6 periods is 117.8 units, while the mean of the last 3 periods (P5-P7) is 105.7 units. The dip in P5 (71) appears to be an outlier. Given the stockouts in P2, P3, P4, and P7, the 'actual' demand likely exceeds the recorded 'sold' units. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the full regime since the shift, providing a mu_hat based on an average of roughly 118 units per period. Since L=0 has been consistently observed in all 7 periods, I will stick with 'default' Lead Time. Holding cost and profit are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level is 50%; however, the cap mechanism and standard deviation calculation will help protect against the observed volatility (std of recent_N=6 is approx 25.5).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey leggings', a staple item. Since Period 2, demand has consistently exceeded 120 units in 5 out of 7 periods, with recent demand showing a sustained peak at 138 units for the last two periods (Period 7 and 8). The game history shows we have repeatedly sold out (ending inventory 0 in Periods 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8), indicating we are under-ordering. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50%. However, given the frequent stockouts and the trend, I need to capture the higher demand regime. I will use recent_N=7 for demand (covering the regime shift since P2) which averages ~120.7 units/period. The lead time is consistently 0. Setting mu_hat to capture this higher mean ensures the OR engine targets a base stock that prevents constant stockouts while respecting the equal cost of holding vs stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 2 persists: avg demand ~121 units (P2-P8). High stockout frequency (5 out of last 8 periods) suggests demand is likely higher than the 'sold' units indicate.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Band leggings' (Womens Everyday Basics) has shown a demand regime shift since Period 2. Analyzing historical demand from Period 1 to Period 9 reveals that recent demand frequently exceeds stock levels, suggesting latent demand higher than recorded 'sold' units. Specifically, from Period 2 to Period 8, we experienced 5 stockouts. The demand in Period 9 was 119, but demand in previous weeks (P7, P8) hit 138 (likely capped by available stock). Given the 'Everyday Basics' category and the transition into spring (April 15th), demand is expected to remain stable or slightly increase. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To recover from low on-hand inventory (2 units) and account for potential latent demand (around 130-140 units), I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to reflect the higher average demand and sigma_hat with recent_N to handle the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' legging. Historically, demand shifted in Period 2 from ~100 to a higher average. Between P2 and P10, demand has frequently hit the stockout ceiling or remained high, with an average observed demand of approximately 119 units. In the last two periods (P9, P10), demand was 119 and 111 respectively without stockouts, suggesting the peak may have stabilized around this level. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)). To avoid the high frequency of stockouts observed between P2 and P8, I will set mu_hat based on the last 9 samples (since the regime change at P2) to capture the higher mean, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility and ensure we are not under-ordering due to previous global statistics.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Womens Everyday Basics Leggings) is in a steady-to-declining demand regime following a period of high stockouts (Periods 2-8). From Period 9 to 11, demand has stabilized at a slightly lower level (avg 112 units/period) compared to earlier peaks, and on-hand inventory has finally managed to cover full demand. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this most recent stabilization in demand (approx 112 units) and volatility (stdev ~6). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level inherently, but the cap logic protects against over-stocking. Adjusting mu_hat to the recent window prevents over-ordering based on the high but unmet demand from the Period 2-8 regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at avg ~112 units/period (Periods 9-11) following the high volatility/stockout regime of Periods 2-8.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Womens Everyday Basics Leggings) has demonstrated stable demand following a high-volatility period. In the most recent four periods (P9-P12), demand has been 119, 111, 107, and 111, averaging 112 units. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units) and there is no pipeline inventory, I will set parameters to cover the expected demand of approximately 112 units. I will use a N=4 for mu_hat to capture this stable post-stockout regime while setting sigma_hat to the default to account for historical volatility and provide a safety buffer against the stockouts observed between P2 and P8.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May. Historical demand for SKU 608458001 (Women's Jersey Leggings) has transitioned from an initial high-demand period (Feb-March) with frequent stockouts to a more stable period from April onwards. From Period 9 to 13, demand has averaged 109.2 units per period (119, 111, 107, 111, 98), showing a slight downward trend as the weather warms, which is typical for basic jersey leggings. The lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. To account for the stable but slightly decreasing demand and to avoid excessive holding inventory (as the Profit and Holding costs are equal at $1.0), I will use the last 5 periods (Period 9-13) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime and reflects the current trend better than the earlier volatile data.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at avg ~109 units/period (Periods 9-13), showing a slight cooling trend from the peak seen in Feb-March.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' legging. Demand analysis shows a clear regime shift: after a high-demand/stockout period (Periods 2-8, avg demand > 120), the demand stabilized and then began a gradual cooling trend from Period 9 onwards. From Periods 9 to 14, demand has moved from 119 to 95, with an average of approximately 107 units. The last two periods (98 and 95) suggest the current demand level is slightly lower, around 100 units. Since Profit is equal to Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level plus a safety buffer based on variance. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the stable/cooling regime from Period 9 to 14 for mean and variance to ensure the OR backend reacts to the current demand level (approx 107) rather than the volatile earlier history.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~120 (P2-P8) to ~107 (P9-P14), with the most recent two periods below 100 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Band leggings) is experiencing a sustained cooling trend as spring transitions into summer. Historical demand samples (before Period 1) averaged around 100, then spiked to ~121 in Feb-March (P2-P8), before stabilizing and then declining. For the last 7 periods (P9-P15), demand have been: 119, 111, 107, 111, 98, 95, 82. This shows a clear downward trend from the 110s down to the 80s over the last 3 periods. The 'actual lead time' remains 0 as confirmed by the continuous 'arrived=Y (ordered on Period Z, lead_time was 0 periods)' logs. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median. Given the recent trajectory, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the shift from the spring peak to the current late-May levels, and sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect recent lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend finalized: Demand has dropped for three consecutive periods (98, 95, 82), confirming a shift away from the April average of ~112 to a late-May average below 100.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Band leggings' is currently showing a sustained cooling trend in demand as we move into June. Demand for the last four periods has been 98, 95, 82, and 69 units, following a peak in March/April. The historical average for the stabilization period (P9-P16) is approx 99 units, but the most recent four-week average is significantly lower at 86 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 17 occurs in early June, and the demand is showing a clear downward trajectory (likely due to seasonal shifting away from basic jersey leggings), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this localized cooling trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the inventory levels follow the demand drop to avoid high holding costs, while still providing enough base stock given that profit and holding cost are equal (implying a 50% service level target).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend accelerating: June transition shows significant drop; last 4 periods average 86 units vs April average of 112 (-23%).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Band leggings' is currently experiencing a sustained demand decline as we transition into the summer months (June). Demand has dropped from an average of ~112 in April to ~90 in May, and now ~65 over the last two periods (69 and 60). Period 17 conclude shows a demand of 60, following 69 in Period 16, confirming the cooling trend identified in carry-over insights. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning base stock is set at the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory during this decline, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the June/late-May lower demand levels, reflecting the current seasonal shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend entered a new phase in early June: average demand for P16-P17 dropped to ~65 units/period, a ~40% decrease from the April avg (~112).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Women's Jersey Leggings) is currently in a significant downward demand trend as of June 2019. This is consistent with seasonal transitions where 'Everyday Basic' leggings may see reduced demand as summer weather stabilizes. Demand has dropped sequentially over the last three periods: 69, 60, and 38 units. The latest observation (38) is substantially lower than the April peak (~112) and the May average (~90). Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the optimal base stock is approximately the median demand. To prevent inventory bloat during this steep decline, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the current low-demand regime (avg ~56). I will maintain recent_N for sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the increased volatility during this drop, ensuring the backend doesn't over-order based on previous higher-volume periods. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend entered a deep trough in early/mid-June: last 3 periods (P16-P18) averaged 56 units/period, a ~50% decrease from the April average.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 608458001 (Jersey leggings) has entered a clear downward trend as we move further into June. Demand has dropped consistently for 7 consecutive periods: from 111 (P12) down to 30 (P19). This represents a transition from a spring peak into a summer low. The last three periods (P17-P19) had demand values of 60, 38, and 30, averaging 42.6 units/period. Period 19 specifically saw demand of 30. Given the steady decline, using N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 is appropriate to capture the most recent behavior without being overly skewed by the significantly higher May demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since on-hand inventory is 26, and the recent average demand is ~43, the backend will likely order a small quantity to maintain the service level while accounting for the cooling trend to avoid excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend entered a deep trough in late June: last 4 periods (P16-P19) show a steady decline (69, 60, 38, 30), with the average for the most recent 3 periods dropping to ~43 units/period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Band leggings' is currently experiencing a severe downward demand trend, typical of seasonal clearance or the transition out of a peak period as we enter July. Demand has dropped consistently over the last five periods (69, 60, 38, 30, 16), with P20 showing the lowest demand yet. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) is approximately 28 units/period. The current on-hand inventory of 27 units is almost enough to cover one full period of demand at this new lower rate. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in a declining market, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent local average (~28), and sigma_hat with a small N=3 to reflect the high local volatility during this rapid decline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend reached a seasonal low in late June/early July: last 3 periods (P18-P20) average 28 units/period, a ~75% decrease from the April peak.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Band leggings' has been in a sustained downward trend since mid-May (Period 15). The latest observation from Period 21 (Date: 2019/7/1) shows a slight uptick in demand (29 units) compared to the previous period (16 units), but it remains significantly below the April peak (~112 units). The carry-over insights confirm a seasonal low. Demand over the last four periods (P18-P21) has been 38, 30, 16, and 29, averaging 28.25 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower volume accurately. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the reduced volatility at this lower demand level. On-hand inventory is currently 0, so the OR backend will reorder to meet this new lower base stock level. Lead time (L) remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at seasonal low: Average demand for late June/early July (P18-P21) is 28 units/period, representing a stable trough after the spring peak.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Women's Jersey Leggings) has transitioned from a spring peak into a mid-summer trough. Recent demand has stabilized at a low level: Period 22 demand was 32 units, following a three-period average (P19-P21) of ~25 units. The overall average for the late June/early July 'trough' regime (P18-P22) is approximately 29 units. Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the base stock will target the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable seasonal low, as it represents the most consistent recent behavior since the significant cooling trend began in June. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Jersey leggings) has completed a seasonal decline through June and appears to have stabilized at a low trough in July. Demand over the last 6 periods (P18-P23) has been 38, 30, 16, 29, 32, and 27, averaging ~28.7 units/period. The prompt's historical samples (100, 92, 103, 104, 99) represent an earlier time of year (potentially very early 2019 or late 2018) and are not representative of current July demand. I will use a recent window of N=6 to capture this current stable trough. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The holding cost vs. profit ratio is 1:1, implying a 0.5 service level target; however, the backend's default logic remains conservative, and 'recent_N' will align the base stock with this lower demand regime to avoid holding excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at seasonal low: Average demand for late June/early July (P18-P23) is confirmed at ~29 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Band leggings) is currently at a seasonal low demand trough consistent with late July (Period 24, 2019/7/22). Average demand since Period 18 (early June) has been approximately 28.7 units/period. The most recent demand (Period 24) was significantly lower at 12 units, possibly indicating a deeper trough or just high variance at this low level. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since on-hand inventory is 17 units and current demand is low, the OR backend needs to maintain a safety stock that handles this low-demand regime without over-ordering as we persist in the trough. I will use a recent window (N=7, covering Periods 18-24) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized low-demand state (~29 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Seasonal low demand trough persists through July. Average demand for the last 7 periods (P18-P24) is 28.7 units/period, down ~75% from spring peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Band leggings) is currently in a seasonal low demand phase. Since Period 18 (June 10), demand has averaged approximately 25 units per period, down significantly from the spring peak of ~120. The most recent demand (Period 25) was 18 units, following a period of 12. August typically marks the end of the summer trough for women's basic apparel before the 'Back to School' or autumn season starts, but there is no statistical evidence of a demand increase yet. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs ($1.0/unit) while maintaining a high service level for the low-volume period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (P18-P25), which captures the entire stable trough regime (N=8). This results in a mu_hat of ~25 units per period and reflects the current lower volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-August (2019/8/12). Historically, demand for this item (Jersey leggings) reached a high peak in the spring (Mar-Apr) and fell to a trough in late June and July (averaging ~29 units/period). However, the most recent demand samples show stability around the 17-18 unit mark (P25-P26), and we are approaching the 'Back to School' transition period which typically sees a resurgence in basic apparel like leggings. While the Carry-over Insight highlights a trough of ~29, the actual observed demand in the last two weeks has been lower (18, 17). To avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against a potential end-of-summer uptick, I will use a recent_N window of 5 periods (P22-P26) to calculate mu_hat. This window captures the seasonal low (avg 21.2) while maintaining enough sensitivity to the current low levels. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Women's Jersey Leggings) is currently in a stable seasonal low demand trough that began in mid-June (around Period 18). Demand for the last 10 periods (P18-P27) has averaged approximately 23.9 units, significantly lower than the spring peak. The most recent 3 periods (P25-P27) show an even lower average of 15 units (18, 17, 10). Given the date is mid-August, we expect demand to remain low or begin a slow climb toward autumn, but there is no evidence of a rebound yet. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (P21-P27) to capture this established lower-demand regime (avg ~19 units). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances responsiveness to the recent very low numbers while respecting the broader summer trough level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at August low: average demand for P25-P27 is 15 units/period, continuing the seasonal trough identified in June/July.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Band leggings) is currently at its seasonal low in late August. For Period 28, demand spiked to 29 from an average of ~15 in previous weeks, likely driven by back-to-school preparation. However, inventory was insufficient, resulting in a stockout. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and accommodate potential continued back-to-school demand, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent mean increase (averaging ~18.5) while allowing the OR backend's service level logic to adjust for the volatility. N=4 covers the transition from mid-August through the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand spike detected: Period 28 demand rose to 29 units (+93% vs P25-P27 average), ending the deep August trough.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Band leggings) is transitioning from its summer trough into the early autumn/back-to-school season. We observed a significant demand jump in Period 28 (29 units) followed by Period 29 (18 units). The average for these two periods is 23.5, which is a clear departure from the August low (avg ~15). As lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat, I am using the most recent 2 periods (N=2) to capture this upward shift, resulting in (1+0) * 23.5. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=2 to reflect the recent volatility spike while keeping the safety stock responsive to this seasonal pivot.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school recovery confirmed: Late-August demand (P28-P29) averaged 23.5 units, a 57% increase over the early August trough (avg 15).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in the 'Back-to-School' transition period for women's leggings. Demand hit a seasonal low in August (avg ~15) but has rebounded significantly over the last three periods (29, 18, 24), averaging 23.7 units. Historically, January demand was ~100 units, suggesting the potential for a significant upward trend as we move into autumn. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture the recovery without over-ordering during a potentially volatile shift, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P28-P30) which captures the post-trough recovery. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school recovery sustained for 3 periods: Average demand increased from 15 (P25-P27) to 23.7 (P28-P30), a 58% increase signaling the end of the summer trough.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-September (Period 32). Historical analysis and carry-over insights indicate that we have transitioned out of the deep August trough (avg 15) into a back-to-school recovery phase. Over the last four periods (P28-P31), demand has been 29, 18, 24, and 20, averaging 22.75 units/period. Period 31 demand (20) was slightly lower than Period 30 (24), but significantly higher than the early August lows. Given that 'Band leggings' are a foundational 'everyday basic' item, demand typically stabilizes or slightly increases as cooler weather approaches in late September and October. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture this post-trough recovery level (avg ~23), and recent_N of 4 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's jersey leggings, which experienced a seasonal low in August and is currently transitioning into autumn. The carry-over insights correctly identified a 'back-to-school' recovery starting around P28, with mean demand lifting from ~15 units to ~23 units. In the most recent period (P32), demand was lower at 9 units, but this follows a 4-period stretch (P28-P31) where demand averaged ~23 units. Given the transition into late September, I expect demand to stabilize at a higher level than the summer trough but potentially lower than the spring peak. Using a recent_N of 5 (P28-P32) covers the entire post-summer recovery phase, yielding a mean demand of approximately 20 units/period. Lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages in the history.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer recovery stabilized (P28-P32): Average demand is approximately 20 units/period, up from the August trough of 15.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic 'jersey leggings' product. Demand has stabilized following the post-summer 'back-to-school' recovery observed from period 28. For the last 6 periods (P28-P33), average demand is 19.83 units/period. The most recent three periods (P31, P32, P33) show demand of 20, 9, and 19 units respectively, averaging 16 units. However, looking at the full post-summer recovery window (N=6), the average is closer to 20. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the transition into October, the demand regime is expected to remain stable or slightly increase as part of jersey basic autumn layers. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the post-summer stabilization level for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time (0).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 608458001 (Band leggings). Current date is 2019/10/07. Looking at recent history (P28-P34), demand has stabilized after the August trough, averaging approximately 20 units/period (29, 18, 24, 20, 9, 19, 17). The seasonality analysis indicates we are past the summer low and entering the autumn period. Leggings often see a moderate rise in demand as weather cools in October. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 3) following P34. I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-summer recovery average (approx 19.4) and its volatility, which ensures the OR backend targets a slightly higher base stock to cover for the upcoming autumn transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer recovery stabilized (P28-P34): Average demand is approximately 19.4 units/period, showing recovery from the August trough (15 units/period) and entering autumn with stable demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 608458001 (Band leggings), which experienced a significant demand drop over the summer but has stabilized since late August (Period 28). For the last 8 periods (P28-P35), demand has averaged 19.3 units per period. The most recent period (P35) saw a low demand of 7 units, but this follows a relatively stable pattern (18, 24, 20, 9, 19, 17, 7). Given the current on-hand inventory is 13 and the actual lead time is consistently 0 (as confirmed by every concluded period), I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods of the post-summer recovery regime (N=8). This captures the current stable state while ignoring the extreme summer lows. Sigma_hat is also set using this recent regime to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Band leggings) is in a stable autumn demand regime. After a significant summer trough (P25-P27 avg 15), demand recovered in late August/September and has stabilized in October. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P33-P36) show demand of [19, 17, 7, 15], averaging 14.5 units per period. The recent volatility (a dip to 7 in P35 followed by a rise to 15 in P36) suggests keeping a slightly larger window for demand estimation to smooth out minor fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (P28-P36) to capture the entire post-summer stable phase (average ~15.5 units) while filtering out the deep summer lows.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Average demand for P28-P36 is ~15.5 units/period, showing stability after the summer trough and recovery.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Historical data confirms that demand for this SKU (Band leggings) has entered a stable autumn regime. For the period P28-P37 (covering late August through late October), demand has stabilized at an average of 17 units/period (total 170 units over 10 periods). The most recent 5 periods (P33-P37) average 13.6 units, reflecting a slight moderation as we progress through October. Observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To balance the service level without accumulating excess holding cost during this stable phase, I am selecting a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current autumn baseline (P28-P37) while filtering out the volatile summer trough and spring peaks.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Band leggings) is currently experiencing a stabilized autumn demand regime. After a significant summer trough and a brief back-to-school recovery in late August/early September, demand has settled into a lower, stable range. Over the last 11 periods (P28-P38), the average demand is approximately 15.8 units/period. However, focusing on the most recent 6 periods (P33-P38), demand has cooled further to an average of 10.7 units/period (values: 19, 17, 7, 15, 10, 6), with the most recent period reaching a low of 6 units. The observed lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as promised. With an on-hand inventory of 11 units and no units in transit, the current stock covers the immediate expected demand based on recent trends. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent cooling trend within the autumn regime, as using the longer history since P28 would over-forecast given the last two weeks of low performance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand cooling: Average demand for the last 6 periods (P33-P38) has decreased to 10.7 units/period, compared to the early autumn average of ~15.5.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Band leggings) is experiencing a sustained seasonal decline in demand as the environment moves into November. Specifically, demand has plummeted from an early autumn average of ~15.5 units (P28-P36) to a very low average of only 6.7 units over the last three periods (P37 demand=10, P38 demand=6, P39 demand=4). Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the objective is to minimize excess stock while maintaining a sufficient service level for this very low-demand environment. Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this rapid cooling, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent trend (approx 7 units/period) and setting L to default (0). This will result in a base stock that aligns with the current low-demand reality, preventing the accumulation of costly ending inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend reached a seasonal floor in November: Last 3 periods (P37-P39) average 6.7 units/period, down from the early autumn average of ~15.5 (-57%).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Band leggings) is currently experiencing a seasonal demand floor in November. The demand has declined steadily over the last four periods (10, 6, 4, 3), with the average of the last 3 periods (P38-P40) being approximately 4.3 units/period. The Carry-Over Insights confirm this cooling trend reached a seasonal floor. With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). The OR backend will calculate a base stock near the median demand. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. To account for the most recent demand regime (the November floor), I will set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the decline while maintaining enough samples to estimate volatility during this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime reached a seasonal trough in November: last 4 periods (P37-P40) average 5.75 units/period, showing a continued decline from the October average.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Band leggings) has reached a seasonal trough in late November, with the last 4 periods (P38-P41) recording very low demand (6, 4, 3, 4 units). The average demand over this specific window is 4.25 units/period. The current date (2019-11-25) and the 'Everyday Basics' category suggest continued low demand until potential December holiday activity or clearing, but the recent trend remains deeply negative. We set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this floor accurately. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0/unit, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the median demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand spike occurred in Period 42 (69 units), coinciding with late November/early December (likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact for 'Womens Everyday Basics'). This follows a prolonged seasonal trough where demand averaged ~6 units/period. The current date is Dec 2nd, suggesting we are in a high-demand window (Christmas/Holiday shopping). Using a long-term average would severely under-order, while the previous trough data is now irrelevant. I will set mu_hat explicitly to mirror the Period 42 spike (69 units) to ensure sufficient stock for potential holiday demand, using a higher sigma_hat (recent_N=3) to account for the sudden increase in volatility seen in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand rose to 69 units, a 10x increase over the November average of 5.75 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked to 69 units (likely Black Friday). Period 43 (early December) continued this trend with demand hitting 76 units, confirming a significant holiday surge. Prior to this, November demand was very low (avg ~6). The stockout in Period 43 (starting on-hand 69, demand 76) indicates we are under-forecasting current holiday demand. Given we are in the high-demand December window, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 80 to ensure we capture this peak and avoid consecutive stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to 20 to handle the high volatility observed during these spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0 based on Period 43's arrival.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: Period 42-43 demand averaged 72.5 units, a 12x increase over the November average (6 units). Stockouts in both periods suggest true demand likely exceeds 75 units/period for this seasonal peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday season. Period 42-43 showed a massive demand surge (avg 72.5+), which significantly exceeded supply, leading to stockouts. Period 44 (Dec 9) shows a sharp drop to 7 units sold; however, this is likely a post-peak dip or an artifact of the specific week's shopping pattern before the final pre-Christmas push. Historical demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' typically remains elevated through the end of December. While Period 44 was low, we must protect against a secondary holiday spike or consistent end-of-year demand. Given on-hand inventory is 73 units, and the recent peak was ~76, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for a potential bounce-back to a moderate holiday level (approx 45 units/period) rather than reacting fully to the single low data point of P44 or the extreme peaks of P42-43. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak reached in Period 42-43 (avg 72.5+ units). Period 44 (Dec 9) showed a sharp temporary decline to 7 units, suggesting high volatility during the Christmas season.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), following the holiday peaks of late November/early December and a subsequent cool-down in Period 44 (7 units). However, Period 45 showed a significant recovery to 36 units, indicating continued Christmas/gift-giving demand for basics like leggings. History from Period 1 (conducted mid-Feb) shows demand in the ~90-100 range, which aligns with the product being a staple 'Everyday Basic'. I expect demand for this week (Dec 23) and next (Dec 30) to remain elevated relative to the November trough but lower than the Black Friday peak. Given the stockout risk seen in early December and the recent demand of 36, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the post-Black Friday average (~40 units), ensuring we have enough stock for the final year-end sales without overcommitting as we enter January.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: Following the Black Friday/Cyber Monday spike (avg 72.5), demand fluctuated significantly (7 units in P44, 36 units in P45), suggesting high week-to-week variance during the December holiday season.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, following the holiday peak season. Demand in the most recent periods (P44-P46) has shown significant volatility post-Black Friday, with demand values of 7, 36, and 18 units. The average for these three post-spike periods is 20.3 units. Given that it is now late December/early January, we expect a transition away from the holiday surge. We have 22 units on hand and 0 in-transit. Based on the recent stabilization after the high holiday volatility, setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (average ~20) reflects the current post-holiday demand level. Lead time has consistently been 0. We will set L to default (0), mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to capture the post-holiday cooling, and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to account for the heightened holiday variance.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling: After the Black Friday/Cyber Monday spike (avg 72.5), the late December period (P44-P46) shows a marked reduction, averaging ~20 units/period.
