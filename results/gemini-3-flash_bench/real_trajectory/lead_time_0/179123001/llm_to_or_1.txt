Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11/Monday). Based on the historical demand samples (113, 101, 106, 85, 112), the SKU 'Women's Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings' shows stable demand. The mean demand is 103.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 11.26. The promised lead time is 0. Since there is no prior arrival history to suggest deviations, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. For \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent localized demand profile (excluding the oldest historical data if possible, though only 5 samples are provided). The inventory starts at 0, so the backend should trigger an initial order to cover current and lead-time demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's clothing staple. Historical demand samples (Early January to early February) show a mean of 103.4. In Period 1, demand was 125, which is higher than the historical average but within a reasonable range for a seasonal baseline. The promised lead time is 0. In Period 1, we ordered 123 units, all of which arrived in the same period (lead_time = 0), but demand (125) exceeded supply, leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory. Given the product is 'Womens Everyday Basics', demand is likely stable with slight growth as we move into spring. I will use recent_N for both demand mean and sigma, setting N=5 (the full count of historical samples plus Period 1) to capture the recent higher demand point. Since the actual lead time was confirmed as 0, I will stay with the default (0) lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, approaching the transition to Spring. Demand for women's jersey leggings is showing a significant upward trend (125 in P1 to 199 in P2). The external historical samples (Jan/Early Feb) averaged ~103, but the last two periods have averaged 162. Given the item is a basic staple and Spring is a high-volume season for basic layers, I expect demand to remain elevated or continue growing. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this shift. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently 0, with 100% stockouts in both P1 and P2, so I need to set robust parameters to capture the true demand potential.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P2: mean demand jumped from ~103 (pre-P1) to 199 in P2. Probable seasonal uplift for Womens Everyday Basics.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4 (2019-03-04), we are managing a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey legging. The demand pattern shows a significant shift starting in Period 2 (199 units) followed by Period 3 (140 units). The pre-game average was approximately 103 units. The combined mean of the last 2 periods is 169.5, which is notably higher than the historical baseline, suggesting a sustained increase possibly due to spring seasonality. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same-period in P1, P2, and P3). We currently have 83 units on-hand. To capture the higher demand regime while acknowledging the slight dip from P2 to P3, I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR backend on the most recent behavior (mean ~170, high volatility) to ensure we stock enough to meet the 95%+ service level target (based on $19 profit vs $1 holding cost) while accounting for the 0-period lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/11. Historical demand for SKU 179123001 (Women's Everyday Basics Leggings) shows a significant spike in P2 (199 units) followed by a cooling trend in P3 (140 units) and P4 (90 units). The seed data (Jan/Feb) averaged ~103 units. The 'regime shift' noted in Period 3 carry-over seems to have been a short-term volatility or a brief seasonal peak that is now normalizing. In-transit is 0 and on-hand is 144. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across P1-P4. For Period 5, I will use a balanced look-back (last 4 samples: 199, 140, 90, plus the last seed sample 112) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the recent high volatility while acknowledging the downward trend back toward the mean. N=4 is chosen to capture the full trajectory since the P2 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $906.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th (Period 6). Inventory is healthy with 158 units on-hand. Looking at the demand history since the mid-February spike (P2: 199), demand has consistently decreased (P3: 140, P4: 90, P5: 56). This suggests the 'Womens Everyday Basics' seasonal surge has peaked and is now receding as we transition further into spring. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been perfectly consistent across all 5 periods. Because demand is trending downward rapidly, using a full history mean would over-order. I am selecting 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent downward trend (140, 90, 56), resulting in a more responsive local mean than the global average. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this decline. L remains at the default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: The seasonal peak observed in P2 (199) has ended; demand has entered a sustained downward trend over the last 3 periods (P3-P5: 140 -> 90 -> 56).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1815.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Reviewing the demand history: P1: 125, P2: 199, P3: 140, P4: 90, P5: 56, P6: 99. The significant drop observed in P4-P5 appears to have stabilized or slightly rebounded in P6. The product is 'Long Leggings - Womens Everyday Basics', which typically sees a pre-spring surge (P1-P3) followed by normalization. The current on-hand inventory is 66 units. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 6 completed periods. To avoid over-reacting to the P5 low (56) or the P2 peak (199), I will use the last 4 periods (P3-P6) to estimate demand. This covers the post-peak normalization phase. The mean demand over these 4 periods is (140+90+56+99)/4 = 96.25. Setting L=0 (default) and using recent_N=4 will allow the OR backend to set a base stock around this level, accounting for the current inventory of 66.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in Period 6 (99) after a 3-period decline, suggesting the post-seasonal floor for this SKU is approximately 100 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2086.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Long Leggings) has moved past its February/early-March seasonal peak (which reached 199 units) and has stabilized over the last two periods (P6-P7) with demand at 99 and 112 respectively. This confirms the previously identified floor of approximately 100 units. The inventory level on-hand is currently 42, which is below the expected period demand. Since the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (confirmed in history for P1 through P7), the order placed in P8 will arrive during the demand resolution phase of P8. I will use recent_N (N=2) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on this new stable regime (~105 units/period) rather than the volatile peak or the decline phase. This ensures the OR engine targets a base stock corresponding to the current stabilized demand level while avoiding holding excess inventory from the previous high-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2299.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 starts with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. In Period 8, demand (128) exceeded starting inventory (121), confirming that the demand 'floor' identified in Period 7 (approx 100) has held and even trended slightly upwards for three consecutive weeks (99, 112, 128). This segment (P6-P8) suggests a current mean of approximately 113. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilization while acknowledging the recent slight growth, I will use a recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat Calculation. Given the stockout in Period 8, a conservative sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) will provide enough buffer for demand volatility around this new mean. The target service level derived from the critical ratio (19/(19+1) = 0.95) remains high, requiring adequate stock to avoid repeat stockouts.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The SKU is 'Jersey leggings', a staple 'Everyday Basic'. Historical analysis shows a seasonal peak in February (Period 2 demand: 199), followed by a sharp decline in March, and stabilization around 100-110 units in late March/early April. The last four periods (P6-P9) show demands of 99, 112, 128, and 89, confirming the 'floor' identified in the P7 carry-over insight. The average demand of these last four periods is 107. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). On-hand inventory is 69 units, which is below the expected demand for the period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this stable post-peak regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current period's demand while accounting for the recent variability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a staple item (Women's Everyday Basics - Long Leggings). Analyzing the history from Period 6 to Period 10, demand has stabilized following a seasonal peak in early February. The demand values for the last 5 periods are 99, 112, 128, 89, and 87, resulting in a recent mean of approximately 103 units. The 'Period 7' carry-over insight noted a post-seasonal floor of ~100, which is confirmed by the subsequent data. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods across all 10 completed cycles. For Period 11, I will use recent_N=5 to capture this stable post-peak regime for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), and use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time (L) to reflect the consistent 0-period performance.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The SKU 179123001 (Jersey leggings) has exited its high-growth seasonal peak observed in February (P2) and March (P3) and has stabilized into a post-seasonal regime. Over the last 6 periods (P6 to P11), demand has averaged approximately 105 units (99, 112, 128, 89, 87, 115), confirming the floor identified in previous carry-over insights. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as promised. Current on-hand inventory is low (17 units), and there is nothing in-transit. To avoid a stockout in Period 12, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 6 periods to capture this stabilized 'floor' demand level. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same N=6 period window to ensure the OR backend accounts for the current level of volatility (ranging from 87 to 128) while avoiding the noise of the earlier, much higher seasonal peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a staple item (Jersey leggings) which saw a seasonal peak in demand during February and has since stabilized. Analyzing the demand from Period 6 through Period 12 (the last 7 periods), the observations are: 99, 112, 128, 89, 87, 115, 97. This results in a stable mean of approximately 104 units per period with a standard deviation of about 15. The historical lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels have been well-managed, though a small stockout occurred in Period 8. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to capture this post-seasonal stabilization phase while remaining responsive to the current baseline. Lead time is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal demand for Periods 6-12 has stabilized around a mean of 104 units/period with a standard deviation of ~15.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Long Leggings' (Womens Everyday Basics) has shown a stabilized demand regime since Period 6, following a mid-February seasonal spike. Analysis of demand from Period 6 through Period 13 shows a mean of 100.75 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. This supports the previous carry-over insight that demand has flattened. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages for P1-P13. The current on-hand inventory is 50 units. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture the stabilized post-seasonal behavior from Period 6 onwards. This will set a base stock that covers the expected 100-unit demand plus a safety margin based on recent volatility, accounting for the 50 units already on hand.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/20 (Period 15). The SKU 179123001 (Long Leggings) has transitioned from its early-year peak (Feb/Mar) into a stable post-seasonal phase. Over the last 9 periods (P6 to P14), demand has stabilized around a mean of 101.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8, aligning with the Carry-over Insight from Period 13. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they were placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 24 units with nothing in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture this stable post-peak regime (P6-P14) and ensure the OR backend aims for approximately 101 units plus a safety buffer for the upcoming period. Lead time remains set to 'calculate' as it accurately reflects the 0-period performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2413.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Long Leggings' has shown relative stability since Period 6, following a seasonal peak in February. In Period 15, we observed a spike in demand to 145 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests either a new seasonal shift or a high-variance outlier. Given the date is late May (going into summer), this might be a pre-summer peak or a random fluctuation. Historically, the floor demand has been around 100-105 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and protect against potential continued high demand (as seen in P15), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the mid-term average while giving weight to the recent volatility. This keeps \u03bc\u0302 around 105 units. However, to account for the Period 15 spike (145 units) and ensure the OR backend's inventory calculation addresses the stockout, I'll allow the OR engine to use the most recent 10 periods for mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Potential demand volatility or start of a new regime shift (demand peaked at 145, resulting in a stockout), deviating from the 104 units/period average seen in Periods 6-14.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Long Leggings' has shown relative stability since Period 6, typically averaging around 104 units/period. Period 15 showed a significant spike (145), which led to a stockout, but Period 16 returned to a more typical level (109). Given the date is now early June, and this is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' item, there is no immediate strong evidence for a massive summer seasonal shift yet, though the Period 15 spike warrants caution. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (covering Periods 7-16) to capture the stable demand regime while including the recent volatility. This provides a balance between the long-term floor (approx 100) and the recent higher deviation. Lead time has consistently remained at 0, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 18 (2019/06/10). Reviewing history, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows that after a brief spike in Period 15 (145 units), demand returned to the previously established post-seasonal average with a lower value in Period 17 (63 units). Periods 16 and 17 averaged 86 units, suggesting the Period 15 spike was a transient outlier rather than a sustained regime shift. For forecasting, I will use a recent window of 5 periods (P13-P17) to capture both the recent spike and the subsequent cooling, which provides a mean of 100 units/period. This aligns well with the long-term stable mean of 104 identified in Period 13 carry-over. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to stay responsive to current levels while smoothing out the Period 15 variance. Lead time L will remain default (0).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Long Leggings' (Womens Everyday Basics) is currently in Period 19. Historical demand from Period 6 through Period 14 stabilized around 104 units/period. Period 15 saw a significant spike (145), which appears to have been a temporary fluctuation rather than a sustained regime shift, as demand in Periods 16, 17, and 18 returned to or fell below the long-term average (109, 63, and 86 respectively). The mean of the last three periods is approximately 86 units, while the mean of the last 13 periods (since the end of the initial seasonal volatility in P6) is approximately 101 units. All orders have consistently arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, including the most recent Period 18 order. I will continue to use L=0. To account for the recent cooling of demand while maintaining protection against another spike like P15, I will use a recent_N (N=13) to capture the stable post-seasonal distribution, providing more robust statistics than a very short window while excluding the early-year extreme volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2283.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Long Leggings', a basic item with generally stable demand around 104 units/period (observed P6-P14). A brief spike in P15 (145 units) was followed by lower to moderate demand (109, 63, 86, 121), indicating that the P15 event was likely transient volatility rather than a sustained regime shift. The average demand over the last 14 periods (P6-P19) is approximately 100 units with a standard deviation of ~19. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. Based on current on-hand inventory (16 units), I will set lead time to 0 and use a recent_N approach (N=14) for demand and volatility to capture the stability since the initial seasonal peak while accommodating the recent increased variance.

Carry-over insight: P15 demand spike (145) confirmed as transient; demand returned to post-seasonal baseline (mean ~100) in P16-P19.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-07-01. SKU 179123001 (Women's Jersey Leggings) has been in a stable demand regime since Period 6, following a seasonal peak in P2. Carry-over insights confirm a post-seasonal mean of approximately 104 units/period. Recent history (P16-P20) shows demand values of 109, 63, 86, 121, and 49, averaging 85.6 units/period. The P15 spike (145) was transient. Although recent demand is slightly lower, it remains within the expected volatility range for this staple item. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all concluded messages. I will use the last 15 periods (P6-P20) to capture the stable post-seasonal baseline while ignoring the P1-P5 seasonal peak and incorporating the recent standard deviation to set the safety stock appropriately via the OR backend. This N=15 window covers the stable regime identified in the carry-over insights.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings) has returned to its post-seasonal baseline demand. Over the last five periods (P17-P21), demand has averaged 80.2 units per period (63, 86, 121, 49, 82), showing significant volatility but no sustained upward trend. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the transitory spike in P15 and subsequent dip in P20, the regime is stable around the 80-100 unit range. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this most recent stable window (P16-P21) which averages ~85 units. This provides a balance between the high P15-P16 period and the low P20. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend OR will target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate for a 'Basics' SKU.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings'. Demand has remained relatively stable since the post-seasonal floor established in Period 6. Carry-over insights suggest a baseline mean demand of ~104 units with some volatility. Recent demand (Periods 17-22) shows a slight cooling compared to the earlier baseline (63, 86, 121, 49, 82, 66), averaging 78 units per period over the last 6 periods. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use recent_N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this recent softened demand while still protecting against the occasional spike seen in the earlier history (like Period 19's 121). Lead time remains 'default' (0 periods).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Long Leggings' (Womens Everyday Basics) has shown a demand stabilization since Period 6, with a minor transient spike in Period 15. Over the most recent 10 periods (P14-P23), mean demand is 90.4 units/period with a standard deviation of 29.5, though recent demand has trended slightly lower (mean of ~70 units in the last three periods). The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given current on-hand inventory of 40 units and a target to cover (L+1) demand, I will use recent trends (last 8 periods) to capture the current post-seasonal mean and variance while maintaining a high service level due to the high profit/holding cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0). No major calendar events are expected in late July to suggest a spike, though general summer demand maintains the current baseline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a staple item (Women's Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings). Historically, after the initial February/March seasonal peak, demand settled around 104 units (Period 13 insight). However, analyzing the most recent 9 periods (Period 16 to 24), there is a detectable downward drift in mean demand: the average of the last 9 samples is 80.7 units, and the average of the last 5 samples is even lower at 69.6 units (demand: 49, 82, 66, 80, 71). The promised lead time is 0, and all historical orders (P1-P24) have consistently arrived with an actual lead time of 0. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this high-profit SKU ($19 profit vs $1 holding), I will use a conservative window of the last 9 periods (starting after the transient P15 spike) to capture the current lower demand regime (mean ~81). This balances responsiveness to the recent drop with enough data to estimate variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: mean demand has drifted lower from the previous baseline of 104; the average of the last 9 periods (P16-P24) is 81 units, a ~22% decrease.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '179123001' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings) has entered a lower demand regime. As noted in the Period 25 carry-over insight, mean demand shifted from ~104 to ~81 units per period starting around Period 16. Checking the most recent data (P20-P25), demand values are 49, 82, 66, 80, 71, and 66, which averages to 69 units. This suggests the downward drift is continuing or stabilizing at a level significantly lower than the previous post-seasonal floor of 100. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all 'conclude' messages. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume accurately and avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (calculated q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand has further stabilized around 70 units/period (P20-P25 average: 69) compared to the previous baseline of 81.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' leggings has significantly shifted downward. I previously identified a regime shift at Period 25 and confirmed it in Period 26. In the last 7 periods (P20-P26), demand values were [49, 82, 66, 80, 71, 66, 58], averaging approximately 67.5 units per period. This is a substantial decrease from the earlier baseline of ~104. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given this sustained lower demand level, I am using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to align inventory levels with this the current regime and avoid overstocking as we enter August.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Long Leggings' has stabilized at a lower level following a downward trend identified around Period 25. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Over the last 8 periods (P20-P27), demand has averaged 65.5 units (49, 82, 66, 80, 71, 66, 58, 52). Comparing the most recent 3 periods (P25-P27: 66, 58, 52), there is a slight continuing deceleration, with the latest demand at 52 units. I will set the demand forecast using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this lower regime while maintaining enough variance protection. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 0-period lead time. Parameters are designed to maintain a high service level given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~65 units/period starting Period 20, down from the previous baseline of ~80 in Periods 16-24.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. The SKU 'Long Leggings' belongs to the Womens Everyday Basics category. Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 20, where demand stabilized at a lower level compared to early Spring/Summer. Specifically, demand for the last 9 periods (P20-P28) follows a mean of approximately 64 units (49, 82, 66, 80, 71, 66, 58, 52, 50). The most recent three periods (P26-P28) show even tighter stability at roughly 53 units/period (58, 52, 50). This suggests a late-summer seasonal low for this basic item. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current stable demand regime while providing enough variance to maintain service levels, as the inventory position is relatively low (36 units on hand).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~64 units/period during the late-summer period (P20-P28), reflecting a ~20% decrease from the mid-summer plateau (~80 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $895.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Long Leggings' has consistently settled into a lower-volume regime during the late-summer period (late August). Over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), demand has been incredibly stable: 66, 58, 52, 50, and 49 units, respectively. This gives an average of approximately 55 units/period. The trend is slightly downward-facing, moving from ~60 to ~50. Given the date (Sept 2), we are entering the Fall season, where 'Womens Everyday Basics' like leggings typically see stable or slightly increasing demand. However, there is no evidence of a spike yet. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this current ~55 unit floor, which is safer than the longer-term average of 64 or 80. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the very low volatility (std \u2248 7) seen lately, preventing over-ordering. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~55 units/period during the transition from late summer to early fall (P25-P29), down from the previous stabilization point of ~64.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-09-09. We are managing 'Long Leggings' for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Historically, demand for this item has shown multiple downwards shifts as we transitioned from the peak in February (P2: 199 units) through summer. Most recently, demand has stabilized in a lower regime. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is 56.6 units, significantly lower than the P20-P24 average of 69 units. The most recent demand was 65, which is a slight uptick from the 49-52 range seen in P27-P29, but it's too early to confirm a new upward trend. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs for this lower-demand period, I will use a recent_N window of 6 to capture the current stabilization at around 57 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The SKU is 'Long Leggings', a staple 'Everyday Basic' item. Historical analysis shows a clear downward demand trend from the summer plateau (~80 units) to late summer (~64 units), and finally to an early fall stabilization point. Over the last 7 periods (P25-P31), demand has averaged 54.7 units (66, 58, 52, 50, 49, 65, 43). The most recent demand (P31) was 43. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this lower stabilization floor of ~55 units/period. The lead time remains consistently 0, so I will use the 'calculate' method. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 7 periods to account for the reduced volatility in this lower-demand regime. This approach ensures we don't overstock during the seasonal transition while maintaining sufficient service levels for stable basics.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 179123001 (Long Leggings) is entering the fall season (Date: 2019/09/23). Recent history shows a significant demand increase in Period 32 (97 units), following a period of stabilization around 55 units. This likely signals a seasonal shift toward higher demand for leggings as weather cools. During Period 32, we experienced a stockout (sold 69 units against 97 units demand), leaving on-hand inventory at 0. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this upward shift while the OR backend ensures a high service level (due to the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I am moving the mu_hat calculation to a recent window. Using the last 4 periods (P29-P32: 49, 65, 43, 97) captures the recent stabilization and the latest spike, averaging ~64 units. This is more responsive than the long-term average or the previous low-demand regime (~55). I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this transitional period's higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: Fall seasonal increase observed (demand rose to 97 units), ending the late-summer stabilization of ~55 units/period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we observed a significant demand jump to 121 units, following a rise to 97 in Period 32. This confirms a fall seasonal regime shift for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (leggings), likely driven by cooler weather starting in late September. Historically, this SKU has shown mean demand around 100-110 units during non-summer periods (e.g., P7-P14). The last two periods (mean=109) support a return to this baseline. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to back-to-back stockouts. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this upward shift while tempering the volatility of the stockout periods. L remains default as historical lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal demand surge confirmed: Demand increased from ~55 units (P25-P31) to a mean of 109 units over the last two periods (P32-P33), representing a ~100% increase.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Long Leggings' is entering its fall seasonal peak. Demand has significantly increased starting in Period 32. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P32-P34) is approximately 105.33 units, which is nearly double the preceding late-summer baseline (~55 units). Although the demand in Period 34 (98 units) was slightly lower than Period 33 (121 units), the upcoming October dates (starting 2019/10/7) historically align with cooler weather and higher sales for basic leggings. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels during this upward seasonal trend and to prevent stockouts (as seen in P32 and P33), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this new elevated fall demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at its calculated/promised value of 0.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '179123001' (Womens Everyday Basics Leggings) is currently in a transitional demand phase. Following a seasonal fall surge where demand peaked at 121 units (P33), recent periods (P34-P35) have shown a retracement to 98 and 62 units respectively. This suggests a stabilization after the initial fall peak or a more volatile seasonal pattern. The mean demand for the 'fall regime' (P32-P35) is approximately 94.5 units, which is significantly higher than the late-summer floor of ~55 units but lower than the peak surge. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking while maintaining service levels for potential late-fall demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current fall regime's behavior (mean ~95, high variance). Lead time (L) remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal demand regime (P32-P35) mean established at 94.5 units/period, showing significant volatility (range 62-121).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 179123001 (Jersey leggings) is currently in a fall demand regime that began around Period 32 (mid-September). While Periods 32-34 showed a significant surge (averaging ~105 units), the last two periods (P35-P36) have seen demand soften significantly to 62 and 57 units respectively. This suggests the initial fall peak may be stabilizing or transitioning into a lower mid-fall plateau. The mean demand for the entire fall regime (P32-P36) is 87 units with high volatility (standard deviation ~27). Given the current on-hand inventory of 78 units and the recent downward trend in the last two weeks, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this recent fall behavior while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. This approach balances the risk of another spike against the high holding costs if demand continues to soften.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal demand (P32-P36) shows high volatility; after an initial peak of ~105 units (P32-P34), demand softened to ~60 units in P35-P36.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October, a period historically associated with increased demand for basic jersey leggings. While the 'Fall seasonal demand' (P32-P37) initially spiked to ~105 units, the last three periods (P35-P37) have significantly cooled to an average of 61 units (62, 57, 64). This volatility suggests that either the initial surge was a pre-season restocking event or that demand is stabilizing at a lower level before a winter holiday peak. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend's service-level target is high (~95%). I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the entire fall seasonal window (P32-P37), which yields an average demand of 83 units. This balances the recent softening (60s) against the earlier surge (90-120) to ensure protection against stockouts if demand ramps up again in November. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal demand (P32-P37) has settled into a volatile phase; after an initial surge averaging 109 units (P32-P34), demand softened to an average of 61 units in the most recent three weeks (P35-P37).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '179123001' (Womens Everyday Basics Leggings) is currently in a fall/winter seasonal phase. After a significant demand surge in periods 32-34 (peaking at 121), demand has softened and stabilized significantly over the last four periods (P35-P38), with values of 62, 57, 64, and 61. This indicates a move away from the initial fall surge towards a more stable, lower-volume late-fall plateau. The average demand over these last four periods is approximately 61 units with low volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To optimize for the current regime and avoid excess holding costs from the previous higher forecast, I am switching to recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand level (approx. 61 units). The OR engine will use these to set a base stock that covers the expected 61 units of demand for the next period plus a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in Period 38: The fall seasonal surge (P32-P34 avg: 105) has transitioned to a stable late-fall plateau (P35-P38 avg: 61, ~42% reduction).

Daily Reward (R_t): $634.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear step-down from the early-fall peak. After a volatile surge (P32-P34 avg: 105), demand stabilized into a lower plateau (P35-P39 avg: 55.8). Specifically, the last period saw demand drop to 35, the lowest in recent history. As we move further into November (P40), the 'Womens Everyday Basics' leggings are likely leaving the peak fall acquisition season. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) to define the new demand regime. This period (P35-P39) captures the stabilization after the fall peak. The lead time remains zero consistently, so I will stick with the promised L=0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: The late-fall plateau (P35-P39) has lowered the average demand to 56 units/period, down from the early-fall surge of 105 (P32-P34).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings) has transitioned from an early fall surge (P32-P34 avg: 105) to a stable late-fall demand plateau. In the last six periods (P35-P40), the demand has averaged 56.5 units/period (values: 62, 57, 64, 61, 35, 60), which is a significant and sustained reduction from the previous phase. P39's low demand of 35 appears to be the low end of this new regime's volatility rather than a new shift. The on-hand inventory is 16 units, and there is no pipeline inventory because the lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N with N=6 to capture this current late-fall stabilization (~56.5 units/period) and adjust sigma_hat using the same window to reflect the moderate volatility (std dev ~10.8) observed in this period. This will ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the anticipated 56-60 unit demand while avoiding excessive holding costs from the previous higher-demand estimates.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further in Period 40: The late-fall plateau (P35-P40) is confirmed with a mean of 56.5 units/period (down ~46% from the early-fall peak).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Leggings) is in a late-fall demand plateau. Analyzing the most recent period (P35-P41), the demand has stabilized at a lower mean of 54.0 units/period (values: 62, 57, 64, 61, 35, 60, 38) compared to the early-fall surge (P32-P34 avg: 105). Although Black Friday (Nov 29) is approaching later this week, historical data for this 'Basics' SKU in previous transitions (e.g., Spring) didn't show massive holiday-specific spikes that weren't captured by the broad seasonal trend. However, to account for potential late-November promotional activity while respecting the recent lower plateau, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 7 (covering the stable late-fall period P35-P41). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels are healthy (37 on hand), and this approach balances the risk of stockouts during a holiday week against the cost of holding excess basic inventory into winter.

Carry-over insight: Late-fall demand regime (P35-P41) confirmed: mean demand has settled at 54 units/period, a ~48% reduction from the early-fall peak (P32-P34).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand spiked to 208 units, far exceeding the recent 'late-fall plateau' mean of ~54 units. This is a clear signal of Cyber Monday/Black Friday seasonal behavior, which is common for 'Womens Everyday Basics' in late November/early December. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The OR engine needs to compensate for this significant shift. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new high-demand regime. Given the 208 demand and the likelihood of sustained holiday shopping through December, I will set mu_hat (for L=0) to 210. I will keep L at 'calculate' as lead times have consistently been 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Black Friday/Cyber Monday surge confirmed with demand of 208 units, ending the late-fall plateau (~54 units). Expect elevated demand through the December holiday season.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9), reflecting the week following the Black Friday/Cyber Monday (BFCM) surge. As noted in the Period 43 insight, demand peaked at 208 units during BFCM (Period 42) and then dropped significantly to 40 units in Period 43. This pattern is consistent with a post-promotional lull before the secondary peak associated with mid-to-late December holiday shopping. Historically, 'Womens Everyday Basics' (leggings) see a secondary surge leading into Christmas. Period 43 already arrived a large order (293 units), leaving us with 253 units on-hand. This inventory level is sufficient to cover approximately 2-2.5 weeks of high-demand (~100 units/period) or over 4 weeks of baseline demand. Given the stockout in Period 42 and the expected pre-Christmas uplift, I will maintain a mu_hat that anticipates a return to early-fall seasonal levels (approx 100 units/period) rather than the extreme BFCM spike or the immediate post-BFCM lull. I use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the fall seasonal volatility (Periods 32-43) while smoothing the extreme BFCM spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday lull observed (demand 40), following the BFCM surge (demand 208). Anticipating secondary holiday peak in late December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (Dec 16). Historical patterns show a massive spike during Black Friday (P42, demand 208), followed by a lull (P43-P44 average ~41). Based on seasonal knowledge of 'Womens Everyday Basics' and the current date (one week before Christmas), a secondary holiday peak is highly likely in Period 45 or 46. Current on-hand is 210 units. While the recent mean (P43-P44) is low, using a 'recent_N' approach of N=2 would ignore the imminent holiday surge. The Black Friday peak (208) serves as a proxy for the potential Christmas peak. Total demand for the next two periods (P45-P46) could realistically reach 200-250 units combined. With 210 on-hand and L=0, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 140 (reflecting a predicted holiday surge higher than the lull but potentially lower than BFCM) to ensure the base stock calculation (which includes a safety buffer via sigma_hat) maintains sufficient coverage without over-ordering excessively into the post-holiday January slump.

Carry-over insight: Anticipating secondary holiday demand peak for Period 45-46 (mid-to-late December) based on the garment category (Everyday Basics) and the P42 Black Friday benchmark (208 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3359.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (Dec 23) represents the final peak of the Christmas holiday shopping season for Womens Everyday Basics. Historical data shows a massive Black Friday surge (208 units in P42) and a significant pre-Christmas climb (181 units in P45). While P44 saw a lull (43), the proximity to Christmas suggests P46 demand will be high, likely matching or exceeding the P45 level of 181. After this week, demand typically drops sharply as the post-holiday season begins. Current on-hand is 80 units. To minimize stockouts during this critical peak while avoiding excessive leftover inventory for the Jan lull, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 180 (the recent peak level). Sigma_hat is set to 30 to cover the high volatility observed during promotional periods (e.g., jump from 43 to 181). Lead time remains 0 as confirmed by recent history. Base stock will be approximately 180 + 1.28*30 \u2248 218 units, minus 80 on-hand, leading the OR to order ~138 units to satisfy the final holiday rush.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak confirmed: Period 45 demand reached 181 units (similar to Black Friday's 208), confirming a secondary December surge for this SKU.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/30, marking the conclusion of the peak holiday shopping season and the transition into January. Historically, Period 1 (mid-February) had a demand of 125, while Period 2 saw a jump to 199. The most recent two periods (P45-P46) showed strong holiday demand (181 and 155 units). Based on typical retail seasonality for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (leggings), I expect a significant drop in demand as we move into the post-holiday lull, followed by a potential stabilization or slight rise in February. Since the BFCM surge (P42: 208) was followed by a sharp drop (P43: 40), I anticipate a similar sharp decline in P47. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to average the high December demand (40, 43, 181, 155) which results in a mean of ~105. This provides a safe buffer for any lingering holiday demand while acknowledging the likely downturn. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the high volatility seen in December (std dev ~74). Lead time remains at the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand decline expected starting Period 47 (Dec 30), following secondary December peak (P45-P46 mean: 168).
