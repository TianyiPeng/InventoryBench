Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The SKU is a 'Kelly Shirt' (airy cotton blouse), which likely sees increased demand as we move from winter into spring. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 0, 2, 10, 16, 24. This suggests a demand regime shift or strong seasonality. Promised lead time (L) is 0. Since we have no actual lead time observations yet, I will use L=0. For demand forecasting, the last 3 weeks represent the most recent growth (mean ~16.7), whereas the total history mean is lower (~10.4). Given the strong upward momentum (0 to 24), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this growth phase and prepare for the spring season. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover current and lead-time demand (1+0=1 period).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a cotton shirt, which typically sees rising demand as spring approaches in the Northern Hemisphere. Looking at the historical demand (0, 2, 10, 16, 24) and the actual demand from Period 1 (20), we see a clear upward trend. The average demand of the last 3 samples (including Period 1) is (16 + 24 + 20) / 3 = 20. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming that L=0 is currently accurate. Since demand is trending upward, I will use a recent window (N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this growth without being overly influenced by the initial weeks of near-zero demand. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the 1+L (1+0=1) period of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is a 'KELLY SHIRT' (Shirt in airy cotton), which is a spring/summer seasonal item. We are currently in late February (2019-02-25). Historical demand data shows a clear upward trend leading into February: 0 -> 2 -> 10 -> 16 -> 24. Observations in Period 1 (demand=20) and Period 2 (demand=55) confirm this growth. The Period 2 demand of 55 unit is a significant spike, likely indicating the start of the spring fashion season. My goal is to capture this momentum. Current on-hand is 0 with 0 in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' for demand forecasting to prioritize the recent growth trend (N=3 captures the most recent samples including the spike). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain. The sigma_hat will also use recent_N to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 4: demand transitioned from single digits (Jan) to high double digits (Feb 18 demand=55), indicating the start of a seasonal spring trend for cotton shirts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is an airy cotton shirt (SKU 697564010), which is entering its peak spring season. Historical demand has surged from single digits in January to 55 units in Period 2 and 81 units in Period 3. Both recent periods resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), meaning the true potential demand is likely higher than the observed sales. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead time has consistently been 0. For mu_hat, I will use 'explicit' to forecast demand at 110 units (approx. 35% growth over the last observed demand of 81) to account for the accelerating seasonal trend and to recover from back-to-back stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the volatility of this high-growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in late February: Period 2 demand (55) and Period 3 demand (81) both exceeded on-hand inventory, indicating significant unmet demand. Current trend suggests a peak spring regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'KELLY SHIRT' (airy cotton shirt) is experiencing a sharp seasonal demand surge associated with the spring season. Historical demand has climbed rapidly: 20 -> 55 -> 81 -> 144 over the last four periods. In the last three periods, demand exceeded supply (stockouts), meaning true demand is likely higher than the observed sales of 136 in Period 4. I am setting L=0 as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast of 200, which accounts for the current growth trajectory (averaging ~50 units increase per week lately) and the fact that 144 was a censored demand value. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 40 to account for high volatility during this growth phase of the spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand acceleration confirmed: Period 4 demand (144+) indicates a 77% increase over Period 3, exceeding available stock for three consecutive weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $211.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak spring season for the 'Kelly Shirt' (airy cotton shirt), and demand has transitioned from the 81-144 range to 89 in Period 5, though this followed four consecutive periods of stockouts. The Period 5 demand of 89 reflects satisfied demand without a stockout for the first time in weeks. Looking at the growth trend (20 -> 55 -> 81 -> 144 -> 89), the Period 4 peak of 144 might have been an outlier or driven by deferred demand from previous weeks, while Period 5 (89) represents a more stable seasonal mean. I'll set mu_hat to the mean of the last 3 periods (approx. 105 per period) to balance the high P4 and more recent P5. Since promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has consistently been 0, L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a higher seasonal level: after a spike to 144, Period 5 demand was 89, suggesting a new mean regime (~100-110) for the spring season.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of March 25 (Period 7), we are in the middle of the spring season for cotton shirts. Demand in Period 6 spiked to 157, exceeding the high ending inventory of 145 from the previous period. This confirms that demand is still highly volatile and trending upwards, with three of the last five periods showing demand above 80 units (55, 81, 144, 89, 157). The mean demand over the last four periods (Feb 18 to Mar 18) is approximately 118 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand and in-transit inventory is 0, we need a significant restock. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period high-demand regime to ensure we capture the spring peak and use the default sigma to account for the high variance observed (89 to 157).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in high-growth spring phase: Period 6 demand (157) reinforces a structural shift, with a moving average (N=4) now at 117.75 units per period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton shirt) is in a strong seasonal uptrend as we enter April. We have stocked out in 5 of the last 6 periods, indicating demand is consistently exceeding our stock-on-hand. Demand in Period 7 was 184, which is the highest seen so far, and the moving average (N=4) has climbed to 143.5 units. Given the spring seasonality for cotton blouses, I expect demand to remain high or increase further. The lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat to 195 (explicitly) to account for the current demand level plus a slight growth buffer to prevent further stockouts, as lost sales are recurring. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the high volatility seen during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 7 reached a new peak of 184 units. Trend is currently outstripping inventory levels in 71% of active periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a cotton shirt, which is in peak spring demand. Historical demand shows a consistent upward trend: Period 4 (144), Period 5 (89), Period 6 (157), Period 7 (184), and Period 8 (190). The moving average over the last four weeks is 155 units. Given that we have stockouts in many peak periods (Periods 2, 3, 4, 6, 7), the actual demand is likely higher than the observed sales. Demand has now stabilized into a high-volume regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current seasonal level (averaging 155.0 per period) and maintaining sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during this growth phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a high-volume spring regime: last 4 periods (P5-P8) demand averaged 155 units, compared to much lower levels in Jan/Feb.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'KELLY SHIRT' is currently in its peak spring/early summer demand phase (April 15). Demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) has been significantly higher than the early season, with values of 89, 157, 184, 190, and 135. This confirms a high-volume steady state, though with some volatility. The average demand over these last 5 periods is 151 units per week. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true (actual lead time observed in history is 0). I will use recent_N=5 to capture this current high-demand regime for both the mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Setting L=0 as historical lead times are consistent with the promise. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period coverage) while reflecting the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late March/early April: demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) averaged 151 units, confirming a sustained high-volume spring plateau.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for this airy cotton shirt has stabilized following its spring peak. The last 5 periods (P6-P10) show a sustained high-volume regime with demand values of 157, 184, 190, 135, and 141 (mean = 161.4). While demand has softened slightly from the peak of 190, it remains significantly higher than the initial February/March levels. History shows that lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is for base stock to cover the current period's demand (L+1=1). Setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) captures the stable but high-volume spring plateau, while sigma_hat using the same period range will account for the recent volatility (std dev approx 25).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product (cotton shirt) is in its peak spring season. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Demand has stabilized at a high-volume regime; over the last 4 periods (P8-P11), observed demand was 190, 135, 141, and 184 respectively, yielding a mean of 162.5. Note that Period 11 demand (184) exceeded available stock (183), so actual demand was \u2265 184. Given the seasonal peak, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 170 to account for recent stockouts and setting sigma_hat to 25 to cover volatility (std of recent samples is ~27). L is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains robust in late April: average demand over the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is 162.5+ units, with frequent stockouts indicating actual demand is slightly higher than sales.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 13 (May 6, 2019) managing the 'KELLY SHIRT'. Demand history and carry-over insights indicate we are in a high-volume spring fashion regime. The last four periods (P9-P12) show demands of 135, 141, 184, and 205. The mean of these observations is 166.25, and there is clear evidence of upward momentum as we move into May. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The OR engine needs to cover both the current period and the lead-time period. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will set mu_hat to 180 to account for recent growth and potential unmet demand in P11/P12 where we stocked out. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility of this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated into May: demand reached 205 in Period 12, marking a 23% increase over the late-March plateau. Recent stockouts in P11 and P12 confirm actual demand exceeds current supply levels.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (Cotton Shirt) is in its peak spring/early summer season. Period 13 concluded with a demand of 164, following a high of 205 in Period 12. Although demand dropped slightly, the average demand over the last four periods (P10-P13) is 173.5 units. We have consistently seen stockouts or near-zero ending inventory when targeting lower base stocks, suggesting that actual demand often exceeds sales. With a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the optimal service level is 80%. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure we capture the high-volume demand typical of May for airy cotton garments, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the 173.5 average, while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility (std dev ~27 units), which results in an explicit sigma_hat of approximately 30 to prevent lost sales during peak weeks.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product (cotton shirt) is in the middle of its peak spring/summer season. Demand has shown a significant upward trend, with the most recent observed demand reaching 232 units (Period 14), which resulted in a stockout. Previous plateau levels (P8-P10) were around 155 units, but demand has accelerated in May, averaging 200.3 units over the last 3 periods (P12-P14). Because of the consistent stockouts (P11, P12, P14), the actual latent demand is likely higher than the recorded sales. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the current growth and avoid further lost sales during this peak period, I am shifting to an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 240 (representing a slight buffer over the most recent demand spike) and use a recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in May.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly in May: average demand for P12-P14 rose to 200.3 units vs 151 units in early April. Recent peak demand of 232 (P14) confirms a new high-volume regime.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019, which is the peak spring/early summer season for cotton blouses. Demand has shown a consistent and aggressive upward trajectory throughout May, with the most recent demand hitting 268 (P15), which again outstripped supply. The moving average of the last 4 periods (P12-P15) is 217.25, while the last 3 periods (P13-P15) average 221.3. Given lead_time remains consistent at 0, the strategy is to capture this upward momentum to avoid further stockouts. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the May acceleration while smoothing the single-period spike. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility since the transition to high-volume sales. Lead time is consistently 0, so I will continue using the default (promised) setting.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly in late May: Period 15 demand reached 268, confirming a 15% increase over the mid-May peak of 232 and a 77% increase since late March plateau levels.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton shirt) is in a strong upward seasonal climb as we entered June. Since mid-May (Period 13), demand has consistently moved from the 160s into the high 200s, with Period 16 demand reaching 270. We have experienced four consecutive periods of stockouts (P14-P16 seeing sold = starting on-hand), indicating that 'true' demand is likely higher than the sales figures of 232, 265, and 255. The average of the last 3 periods (P14-P16) is 256.67 units. However, given the sustained growth (Period 15: 268, Period 16: 270), I am setting mu_hat for Period 17 to 280 to reflect this upward momentum and prevent further stockouts. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. sigma_hat is set using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained into June: Period 16 demand reached 270, confirming a high-volume summer regime. Inventory has stocked out for 3 consecutive periods (P14-P16), suggesting actual demand exceeds 270.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU achieved positive ending inventory (123 units) for the first time in several periods, as demand dropped to 195 units from its previous peak of ~270. While the product is a cotton shirt suitable for summer, the demand drop suggests a potential stabilization or local cooling after the significant acceleration seen in May. The carry-over insights indicate three consecutive stockouts prior to this period, meaning previous demand samples (P14-P16) were right-censored. However, the drop in P17 (demand 195) provides a clearer look at current demand levels. I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat covering the last 4 periods (P14-P17) to capture both the peak and the recent cooling (avg: ~241). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth cooled in early June: After three consecutive periods of stockouts at demand levels \u2265 270, Period 17 demand (195) suggests the May peak may be subsiding or stabilizing into a summer regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (P17: 195, P18: 180) suggests that the extreme peak observed in late May (P15: 268, P16: 270) has passed, and demand is transitioning into a mid-summer regime. The carry-over insight noted a cooling in Period 17, which is confirmed by Period 18. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking as the seasonal peak subsides, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P15-P18), which averages approximately 228 units per period, effectively weighting the recent decline while still accounting for the possibility of sustained summer demand. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to capture the increased volatility during this regime transition. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy (92 units), so the OR backend will calculate a sufficient replenishment to meet the target base stock for this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime transitioned from a late-May peak (>260) to a summer plateau (approx. 180-200) starting Period 17. Evidence: P17 demand 195, P18 demand 180.

Daily Reward (R_t): $786.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Airy Cotton Shirt (697564010) has transitioned from a late-May peak (270+) into a more stable summer regime. In Period 17 and 18, demand dipped to 195 and 180, but Period 19 saw a return to 211. This suggests a summer plateau mean of approximately 195-200 units. Since late June is typically a high-demand period for cotton shirts before late-summer clearance, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period average (P16-P19: 270, 195, 180, 211) which results in a mean of ~214 units. This captures the recent stabilization while acknowledging the volatility observed in the hand-off from peak spring to summer. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period inventory responsiveness. The on-hand inventory of 58 will be factored into the OR-engine's base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (late June): Demand has stabilized at a higher plateau than early spring, with the last 3 periods (P17-P19) averaging 195 units, though still below the late-May peak of 270.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, marking the transition into mid-summer. Recent demand history shows a shift from a late-May peak (>260 units) to a stabilized summer plateau. Over the last four periods (P17-P20), demand has averaged 180.25 units (195, 180, 211, 135). The most recent demand dip to 135 in Period 20 suggests that the summer high-volume plateau may be starting to taper as we move past the peak summer shopping season. To account for this stabilization and potential softening, I will use a recent_N strategy for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this post-peak regime. N=4 is chosen to prioritize the most recent data since the end of the May peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand plateau (P17-P20) averaging 180.25 units shows signs of tapering, with P20 demand dropping to 135 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is an airy cotton shirt, which is highly seasonal. Analysis of the demand history shows a clear decline from the late-May peak (~270) through the June summer plateau (~195) into a tapering phase in early July. Demand in the last two periods (P20: 135, P21: 103) confirms that we have entered a late-summer slowdown. Since the product is 'airy cotton', demand is expected to continue decreasing as we move deeper into July and towards the end of the summer season. The average demand of the last 3 periods is 124.3, significantly lower than the P17-P19 average of 195. I will use a recent window (N=3) to capture this downward trend for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The promised lead time remains 0, and historical observations consistently show an actual lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in July: significant tapering from summer plateau (~195) to late-summer decline (~124 avg in P19-P21).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the KELLY SHIRT (airy cotton blouse) has confirmed a significant decline as the peak summer season concludes. Historical data shows demand peaked in late May (P15-P16: ~270) and has since steadily decelerated through July. Period 22 demand was only 84 units, the lowest since early March. The current demand regime for July (P20-P22) averages 107 units. Given the seasonal nature of 'airy cotton' clothing, a further decline or low-level stabilization is expected as we move deeper into July. I will set L to 'default' (0) as the actual lead time has consistently remained 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent and relevant downward trend (Periods 20, 21, and 22), where demand values were 135, 103, and 84 respectively. This ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock downward to prevent excess holding costs as the product exits its peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline confirmed in July: demand dropped from a June average of ~195 to a July average of 107 (Periods 20-22), indicating the end of the peak summer retail cycle for cotton shirts.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Airy Cotton Shirt (697564010) is in a significant seasonal decline as the peak summer season concludes. We are now in Period 24 (late July). Historical data shows demand has dropped from a June average of ~195 to a July average of 79 units (P21: 103, P22: 84, P23: 50). This trend mirrors the pre-peak ramp-up observed in February/March but in reverse. Current inventory is 80 units with 0 in-transit. Given the sharp decline (P23 demand was 50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current downward trajectory correctly. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 will target a base stock level aligned with the current ~80 units per period demand, preventing excessive holding costs as the collection likely transitions towards end-of-season.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand collapse confirmed: demand dropped from 103 (P21) to 50 (P23), a 51% reduction in three weeks, indicating the seasonal exit for cotton blouses.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Airy Cotton Shirt (697564010) is in a clear seasonal decline as the summer season ends. Starting from a peak of ~270 in late May, demand has dropped consistently: Period 20 (135), Period 21 (103), Period 22 (84), Period 23 (50), and Period 24 (43). The last three weeks (P22-P24) average 59 units, but the most recent two weeks (P23-P24) show a lower average of 46.5 units. Given this sharp downward trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current low-demand regime (~59 units) while allowing for further tapering. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With on-hand inventory currently at 59 units and demand forecasted below 50, I am lowering parameters to avoid accumulating excess holding costs on a sunsetting seasonal product.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand collapse confirmed for airy cotton shirt: demand dropped from triple digits in early July to an average of 46.5 units over the last 2 weeks (P23-P24).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is an airy cotton shirt, which follows a strong seasonal pattern. Demand peaked in late May (Period 16: 270 units) and has since collapsed as the summer season ends. The last three periods show a consistent decline: P23: 50, P24: 43, P25: 34. This represents a confirmed late-summer regime shift. For Period 26 (August 5), I expect demand to continue tapering or stabilize at a low baseline. Using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) captures this collapse most accurately, providing a mu_hat calculation based on an average demand of approximately 42.3 units. Given the low holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), the OR backend will still maintain sufficient safety stock, but reducing the mu_hat and sigma_hat inputs is necessary to prevent significant overstocking during this terminal phase of the product lifecycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand collapse continues into August: Period 25 demand (34) confirms a 75% reduction from the late-June plateau (~135) and an 87% drop from the May peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'airy cotton shirt' is in a clear seasonal decline as we move into mid-August. Period 26 demand fell to 24 units, continuing the downward trend from the May peak (>260) and the June/July plateau (~180-100). The current on-hand inventory is 26 units, which already covers the most recent period's demand. Given the clear and sustained downward trajectory (P23: 50, P24: 43, P25: 34, P26: 24), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this late-summer decay. This ensures the OR engine doesn't over-order based on previous high-volume regimes while attempting to maintain minimum stock for the remaining low-level demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for mid-August: seasonal decline continues with Period 26 demand (24) showing a ~30% drop from the previous week and a 50% drop from two weeks prior.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (airy cotton shirt) is in a clear end-of-season decline as of mid-August. Recent demand for the last four periods (P24-P27) has been 43, 34, 24, and 22, respectively, indicating a consistent downward trajectory. To prevent excess inventory and minimize holding costs ($1.0/unit), I am tracking this decline using a short window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time (L=0) remains accurate based on the game history where orders consistently arrive in the same period. Since on-hand inventory is 20 and the moving average for demand is approximately 30, a small buffer is appropriate to satisfy remaining late-summer demand while winding down stock.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand decline stabilized in mid-August: demand for P26-P27 averaged 23 units, representing a significant drop from the July average (~70) and a complete exit from the summer peak.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the KELLY SHIRT (airy cotton blouse) has shifted from a high-volume summer plateau (>180 units) to a late-summer seasonal decline. Since late July (Period 23), demand has plummeted and then stabilized at a significantly lower level. Demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) was 24, 22, and 27 units respectively, averaging 24.3 units. This confirms the 'end-of-summer' regime. With on-hand inventory at 12 units and a promised lead time of 0, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this stabilized low-demand floor while avoiding the much higher historical averages from the peak season. Observed lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at low-volume end-of-season floor: P26-P28 demand averaged 24 units, compared to May peaks of 270. No further significant decline observed in the last 3 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Kelly Shirt in airy cotton) is a seasonal spring/summer item currently entering September. We have observed a significant decline from early-summer peaks (>200 units) to a stabilized low-volume end-of-season regime. In the last four periods (P26-P29), demand has averaged 28 units (24, 22, 27, 39). While Period 29 showed a slight uptick to 39, it likely represents minor noise or a small clearance surge rather than a trend reversal. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a promised lead time of 0, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (N=4) to capture this low-volume floor while maintaining enough stock to cover the slight variance observed in P29. The lead time L remains at 0 as shipments consistently arrive within the same period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is an airy cotton shirt, which follows a strong seasonal cycle. We are currently in early September (2019-09-02 to 2019-09-09). Historically, demand collapsed in July/August but has shown a surprising slight uptick in the last two periods (P29 demand: 39, P30 demand: 48). This may indicate back-to-school interest or a minor late-summer clearance demand. However, given the overall seasonal trend for 'airy cotton', I expect this to be a short-lived plateau or a minor correction rather than a return to spring/summer peaks. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent moderate increase from the floor while maintaining a relatively low sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering on what is likely the end-of-season tail. The actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Minor late-season demand uptick detected in September: Period 29 and 30 demand (39, 48) suggests a slight increase from the August floor (~24), possibly due to back-to-school or seasonal clearance.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31 (Sept 9), demand sharply dropped to 9 units after a brief uptick (39, 48) in late August/early September. This suggests the previous uptick was a temporary event (likely back-to-school) rather than a sustained recovery. The current on-hand inventory is 35 units, which is significantly higher than the most recent demand observation. Given that we are in mid-September (Period 32), a long-sleeved 'airy cotton shirt' is moving into deep late-season territory. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent volatility (39, 48, 9), which averages to 32 units. I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the high uncertainty caused by this sudden drop, setting it to 25 to protect against another brief spike while acknowledging the downward trend. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Early September demand uptick (P29-P30 avg: 43.5) was transient; P31 demand (9) indicates a return to a low-volume late-season regime.

After a brief and transient uptick in early September (P29-P30), demand has dropped significantly to 9 units (P31) and 11 units (P32). The historical average for these last two periods is 10 units. Given the 'airy cotton' description and the current date (Sept 23), this aligns with a seasonal transition out of summer/back-to-school items. Lead time remains stable at 0. With 43 units on hand and 0 in transit, the current inventory already covers approximately four weeks of the current demand regime. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining seasonal market, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent two-period average (N=2) and sigma_hat to a narrow window to reflect the reduced volatility of the floor regime. The total current inventory (43) is likely sufficient, so the OR backend will likely order minimal or zero units.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season floor confirmed: demand for P31-P32 averaged 10 units, reversing the transient early-September uptick and signaling the final seasonal exit for airy cotton blouses.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the KELLY SHIRT (airy cotton blouse) has firmly exited its summer peak and stabilized at a low-volume end-of-season floor in late September. After a transient uptick in early September (P29-P30), demand for the last three periods (P31-P33) has dropped significantly, averaging 9.67 units. This matches the product description as a seasonal 'airy cotton' item likely intended for warmer weather. With an on-hand inventory of 34 units and current demand levels near 10 units per period, the current stock covers over 3 periods of demand. Given the promised lead time (L=0) and consistently observed actual lead time (L=0), no further orders are required to maintain a safe service level while minimizing holding costs for a seasonal item nearing its lifecycle end. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this final low-volume regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is an airy cotton shirt (SKU 697564010), which has completed its primary spring/summer lifecycle. Current date is October 7, and demand has reached a definitive end-of-season floor. In the last four periods (P31-P34), demand has consistently been 9, 11, 9, and 9 units respectively. The transient uptick observed in early September (P30: 48 units) has completely dissipated. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. With on-hand inventory at 25 units and a holding cost of $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0, the target service level is 80%. Given the current demand level of ~9 units per week and 25 units already on hand, the existing inventory covers nearly 3 weeks of demand. To avoid unnecessary holding costs as the season closes, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this low-volume floor while allowing L to remain at the default (0).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a clear end-of-season decline for the autumn/winter transition. Demand has consistently fallen from a brief September uptick to a low-volume floor of approximately 7-9 units per week. In Period 35, demand was 7 units. With 18 units currently on-hand and a promised lead time of 0, there is enough inventory to cover the expected demand and a safety buffer for the next 2 periods without additional ordering. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized late-season regime (P32-P35 demand: 11, 9, 9, 7), which should prevent excess ordering and keep holding costs low.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season floor further stabilized in October: demand for P33-P35 averaged 8.3 units, confirming a transition to a very low-volume baseline for the remainder of the year.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (airy cotton shirt) has transitioned into a very low-volume end-of-season regime for October. Demand over the last 4 periods (P33-P36) has been 9, 9, 7, and 6 units, respectively, showing a clear plateauing floor. With a current on-hand inventory of 12 units and a mean demand of approximately 7 units per period, the current stock covers nearly two periods of demand. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the consistent 0-period lead time, maintaining high stock is inefficient. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this stable, low-volume baseline, allowing the OR engine to wind down inventory naturally without placing unnecessary new orders.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton shirt) is in a definitive end-of-season floor regime. Since late September (Period 33), demand has consistently remained in the single digits, with the last five periods (P33-P37) recording demand of 9, 9, 7, 6, and 6. This confirms a very low-volume baseline of approximately 6-9 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 6 units. Given the low demand and 0-period lead time, existing inventory covers immediate needs, and any significant reorder would incur unnecessary holding costs ($1.00/unit/period) which are high relative to the profit ($4.00/unit). I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture this low-volume floor while maintaining a minimal service level for these terminal sales.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is an airy cotton blouse, which is highly seasonal and currently in a deep end-of-season floor phase. Demand has stabilized at a very low volume, averaging approximately 6-7 units per period over the last five weeks (P34-P38). The transient uptick observed in September has completely subsided. Since the product is at its seasonal base and holding costs are relatively high ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am focusing on minimizing unnecessary inventory while maintaining a small safety buffer for this stable, low-demand regime. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 captures the current October/November stabilization period (Periods 34-38) effectively. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is an 'airy cotton shirt', a highly seasonal summer product currently in its late-autumn phase (Nov 11). History confirms a massive collapse from peak May demand (270) to a stable end-of-season floor (avg ~6-8 units) starting in October. Period 39 demand was 8, consistent with the low-volume baseline observed since Period 36. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Given the product's description and current calendar date, there is no expectation of a demand resurgence before the end of the game (Period 47). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) to maintain a lean inventory and avoid holding costs on a declining/stagnant seasonal item.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight cotton blouse (airy cotton), which has clear seasonal demand. We are currently in mid-November (Period 41). Historical data from Period 35 onwards (October-November) shows a very stable, low-volume floor averaging approximately 7.1 units per period (samples: 7, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8). This is a dramatic contrast to the peak summer demand exceeding 200 units. The lead time has consistently resolved as 0 periods across the entire history. Given the low volatility in this end-of-season regime and the high holding cost relative to the unit profit ($1.0 vs $4.0), it is critical to keep inventory lean. I am setting mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this stable floor, and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the low current variance.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season baseline established: Demand for the airy cotton blouse has stabilized at a low-volume floor of ~7 units per period throughout October and November (Periods 35-40).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton blouse) is currently in a stable, low-volume end-of-season regime. The historical data shows a peak in May/June followed by a significant decline throughout July and August. Demand has now settled into a consistent baseline throughout October and November. For the last 7 periods (P35-P41), demand has ranged between 6 and 8 units, with an average of approximately 6.7 units. The current date (Nov 25) is well past the seasonal peak for this item. Given the stability of this floor, I will use a recent_N approach with N=7 to capture this specific late-season regime. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable as evidenced by consistent same-period arrivals in recent history. A tighter window for sigma_hat is appropriate given the very low volatility in this stable baseline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is an airy cotton shirt, which is highly seasonal and currently in its late-autumn/early-winter low-volume regime. The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Demand has stabilized at a floor of approximately 6-8 units per period over the last 8 weeks (Periods 35-42). Specifically, the last four periods show demand of 8, 8, 6, 6. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Since the demand is stable and predictable at this seasonal floor, I am using a recent_N approach (N=7 to cover the established October-November baseline) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will maintain a lean inventory (base stock ~10-12) to minimize holding costs while meeting the current low demand, as there are no imminent seasonal spikes expected for cotton blouses in December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Airy Cotton Blouse is in a stable, low-volume end-of-season floor, as confirmed by insights since Period 35. Over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), the average demand is precisely 7.2 units, matching the 'around 7 units' baseline noted in Period 41. The product is highly seasonal and currently in December, far from its spring/summer peak. Total lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain the 0.8 service level (calculated as 4/(4+1)) while minimizing holding costs for this low-demand phase, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable floor of ~7 units. This ensures we don't over-order based on the high-volume spring/summer history while still covering the immediate requirements.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (airy cotton blouse) is currently in a stable, low-volume off-season baseline. Since Period 35 (early October), demand has consistently fluctuated between 2 and 9 units, with an average of approximately 6.5 units over the last 10 periods. The current date is December 16 (Period 45), which is well outside the product's peak spring/summer seasonality. In the most recent period (P44), demand was specifically low at 2 units. Given the consistent behavior over the last two months, I will use a recent_N approach with N=10 to reflect this established floor regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. This strategy aims to maintain high service levels for the minimal remaining demand while preventing excessive inventory accumulation as the game approaches its final periods (P47).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. The product is an airy cotton blouse, which is highly seasonal. We are currently in the deep winter off-season. Demand has stabilized at a very low baseline; over the last 5 periods (P41-P45), demand was [6, 6, 8, 2, 3], averaging 5.0 units. The most recent two weeks show even lower demand (2.5 units). Inventory is currently 5 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the lack of any holiday spike in this category (airy cotton shirts are not typical winter gifts), I will set the parameters to reflect the recent low-volume regime to avoid unnecessary holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-year floor.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the final week of the year. The product is an airy cotton shirt, which follows a strong seasonal pattern that peaked in May/June and has been in a sustained low-volume baseline since October. Recent demand over the last 6 periods (P41-P46) has been minimal: 6, 6, 8, 2, 3, 1 units. This confirms the 'End-of-season baseline' identified in the Carry-Over Insights. Specifically, the last three weeks show a further softening of demand (average 2.0 units). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Given the extremely low demand and the 7 units currently on-hand, which already covers 3-4 weeks of recent demand, I will set mu_hat to reflect this current floor. Using recent_N (N=6) captures this stable late-season behavior while excluding the higher November volumes.
