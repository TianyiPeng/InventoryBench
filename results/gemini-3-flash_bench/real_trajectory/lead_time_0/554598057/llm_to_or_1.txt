Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics). The SKU has started with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory. Historical demand for the last five weeks shows values: 30, 27, 70, 72, and 56. There is a clearly visible demand shift starting in mid-January where the weekly volume more than doubled (moving from an average of ~28 to ~66). Given it is February and this is an everyday basic T-shirt, we are entering the pre-spring retail season. The promised lead time is 0. I will prioritize the most recent 3 observations (70, 72, 56) to set the demand parameters, as early January data seems unrepresentative of the current sales velocity. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base_stock will primarily track the median demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the historical demand for SKU 554598057 (Nora T-shirt): [30, 27, 70, 72, 56] from Jan to early Feb. In Period 1 (last week), actual demand was 70. This confirms a significant shift from the initial lower demand (avg ~28) to a higher regime (avg ~66 over the last 3 samples). In Period 1, we ordered 66 units with a 0-period lead time, they arrived immediately, but we sold out (demand 70 > on-hand 66), ending with 0 inventory. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt, which typically has stable but moderate demand. Given the stockout and the recent higher demand levels (70, 72, 56, 70), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this current regime (average ~67). I will set L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock to satisfy the current demand level while acknowledging the high holding cost (Ratio 1:1), which requires precise stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from an initial average of ~28 (first 2 weeks) to ~67 (last 4 weeks).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th. We have observed a significant demand spike: demand was ~70 in Period 1 and reached 136 in Period 2. The item (Nora T-shirt) is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' piece. This surge aligns with the lead-up to spring transitions in late February. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), allowing us to be reactive. However, we have stocked out in both Period 1 and Period 2, indicating our base stock level is trailing the actual demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to focus on the high-demand regime of the last two weeks (average ~103) which is more representative than the early January data (avg ~28). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent high-volatility, high-volume period will help the OR backend raise the base stock level to prevent more lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand accelerated significantly in February, moving from ~70 (P1) to 136 (P2), significantly higher than the Jan baseline of ~30. This suggests a seasonal transition for basic apparel.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' experiencing a significant demand surge as we enter March, likely driven by spring seasonality. Historical demand has shifted from ~30 in early January to an average of 105.7 over the last 3 concluded periods (70, 136, 111). We have experienced back-to-back stockouts because orders (limited by the OR backend's internal caps and historical priors) haven't kept pace with this growth. Since the promised and actual lead times are 0, we can react immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the much lower January baseline. This will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the late Feb/early March data, aiming to raise the inventory level to meet the ~110-140 unit demand trend and stop the cycle of selling out instantly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: March entry shows sustained high demand for basics (avg ~106 over last 3 periods), well above Jan baseline of ~30. Constant stockouts indicate the need for higher base stock targets.

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Nora T-shirt' (Women's Everyday Basics) has entered a sustained high-demand regime as we move into March. History shows a clear jump from Jan (~30/week) to the recent Feb-March average (~102 over P1-P4). Total demand in P1-P4 was 70, 136, 111, 92. The mean of these four periods is 102.25. While the promised lead time remains 0, and observed lead times have consistently been 0, previous periods suffered from stockouts because the OR backend's default mean was likely weighted down by the low Jan data. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current active spring demand regime (avg ~102) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the high variance (standard deviation around 27) seen in this period. Using recent data exclusively ensures the base stock calculation targets the current 100+ demand level rather than the historical 30 level.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime for Women's Everyday Basics confirmed: P1-P4 mean demand is 102.25, significantly higher than Jan baseline. This shift justifies prioritizing the last 4 periods for all inventory parameters.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) has settled into a Spring demand regime. After a period of severe stockouts in February (Periods 1-3), inventory levels have stabilized. The demand over the last four periods (P2-P5) has averaged 102.25 units, significantly higher than the January baseline. Notably, demand has moderated slightly from its peak (136 units in P2) to 70 units in P5. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking while maintaining service levels for this high-volume basic, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current Spring mean and volatility, while keeping the lead time at the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late March, managing a basic women's t-shirt. Reviewing history since the demand regime shift in early February (Period 1), the mean demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 94.5 (70, 136, 111, 92, 70, 88). Specifically, the last 3 periods show a slight stabilization with an average of 83.3. However, given the nature of 'Everyday Basics' entering Spring, volatility remains high (CV around 25-30%). The lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to set parameters that provide enough buffer to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 1-3 while acknowledging the recent stabilization around 80-90 units. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the full Spring uplift, and explicit sigma_hat set to approximately 25 to protect against demand spikes, given the backend uses a critical ratio of 0.5 (z=0) which would otherwise result in under-stocking for a SKU with high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime for Women's Everyday Basics (Period 1-6) shows a stable mean of ~95, significantly higher than January's baseline of ~30. Observed lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 marks the start of April for the 'Nora T-shirt', a Women's Everyday Basic. Historical demand from Period 1 to Period 7 shows a sustained high-demand regime (mean ~102) compared to the January baseline (~30). Period 7 experienced a significant spike to 144 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock target will essentially track the median demand. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To account for the recent volatility and the demand jump in Period 7, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the entire Spring regime. Using a broader recent window rather than just the last period helps mitigate over-reacting to a single spike while acknowledging that the baseline has shifted upward significantly. This strategy ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock covering the current period's expected high demand.

Carry-over insight: April entry (Period 8) maintains high-demand regime for Women's Everyday Basics; Period 7 showed a peak of 144 units, confirming sustained volatility within the Spring season.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598057 (Nora T-shirt) is in a high-demand Spring regime. Demand for the last two periods (P7 and P8) was consistently high at 144 units, significantly exceeding the previous average of ~95 units. We have encountered consecutive stockouts, ending P8 with 0 units on hand despite ordering values based on lower historical averages. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by history, we need to adjust our forecast to handle this shift. The last 4 periods (P5-P8) capture the current volatility and the higher peak seen in early April. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this trend, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent surge to minimize future stockouts while acknowledging the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio which suggests a 50% service level target (z=0). Using N=4 balances the older ~70-80 demand weeks with the recent 144 peak.

Carry-over insight: April demand surge confirmed: Period 7 and 8 both experienced a peak demand of 144 units, a 50% increase over the March average (~95). Stockouts have occurred for two consecutive periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak spring demand period for Women's Everyday Basics (Nora T-shirt). History shows a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 7 (April), with demand levels sustained significantly higher than the March average (P7: 144, P8: 144, P9: 136, combined mean = 141.33). We have experienced stockouts in 3 consecutive periods (P7-P9) because the current inventory targets are not accounting for this recent surge and volatility (std dev of P7-P9 is ~4.6). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable (verified in all 9 completed periods). To capture this surge and prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost vs $1 profit (suggesting a 50% service level standard target), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to isolate the April surge regime. This will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based strictly on the latest 140+ unit demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: April demand regime stabilized: Periods 7-9 show a distinct high-demand cluster (avg 141.3, min 136, max 144), significantly higher than the March average of ~93. Stockouts occurred in 8 out of 9 periods, primarily due to underestimating this seasonal peak.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing a sustained seasonal peak in demand as we move deeper into April. In the last four periods (Periods 7-10), demand has consistently ranged between 136 and 147 units, with an average of 142.75. Every one of these periods has resulted in a stockout (sold units = starting on-hand), indicating that the current base stock calculated by the OR engine is insufficient to cover the high demand volatility. Since Period 7, the actual demand has outpaced my previous orders. To address this, I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand April regime (Period 7: 144, Period 8: 144, Period 9: 136, Period 10: 147). Lead time is consistently 0, so I will continue using 'default'. By using N=4, mu_hat will increase significantly to reflect the current peak, and sigma_hat will capture the recent variance, helping the OR engine set a higher inventory target to prevent continuous stockouts in this high-volume period.

Carry-over insight: April demand peak sustained (Period 7-10): mean demand increased to 142.75, resulting in 4 consecutive stockouts. This establishes a high-level regime for spring basics.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Nora T-shirt' is experiencing a major seasonal demand surge as we enter late April and early May. Period 11 saw an all-time high demand of 212 units, significantly exceeding the previous April plateau of ~143 units. This suggests we've moved from a spring baseline into a peak spring/pre-summer regime. The last 5 periods (Periods 7-11) capture this acceleration, with demand numbers of 144, 144, 136, 147, and 212. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures this trend (average ~156) better than the full history, but given the jump to 212 and our zero on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this likely new level. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain. The profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) result in a target service level of 50%, but the OR backend's cap mechanism and seasonal volatility necessitate a robust sigma estimate to prevent further stockouts in this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed Period 11: Demand surged to 212 units, a 48% increase over the previous 4-week average (~143). This signals a transition from 'April Peak' to 'May/Early Summer Peak' for Women's Everyday Basics.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' (Nora T-shirt) is exhibiting strong seasonal growth as we enter May (Early Summer Peak). The demand in Period 11 was 212 and in Period 12 was 188, averaging 200 units over the last two weeks. This is a significant jump from the April average of ~143 and the March average of ~93. We have stocked out in 10 out of 12 periods, indicating our base stock levels are consistently lagging behind actual demand. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met (L=0). To capture this 'May/Early Summer' transition and stop the cycle of stockouts, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 210 (reflecting the most recent peak demand) and sigma_hat to an explicit value of 40 to account for high volatility during seasonal transitions. Using 'recent_N' with a small N (e.g., N=3) would still underestimate the trend because it includes lower values from the previous regime.

Carry-over insight: Early Summer peak confirmed Period 11-12: Mean demand shifted to ~200 units, a 40% increase over the April 'Spring' regime (~143). Stockouts persist for 6 consecutive periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 554598057 (Nora T-shirt) is entering mid-May. After a significant 'Early Summer' peak in Periods 11-12 (demand average ~200), Period 13 saw a drop to 132 units. However, we have experienced 6 consecutive stockouts prior to P13, and the ending inventory of 78 units suggests we are finally catching up to demand. The current regime (Periods 11-13) has a mean demand of 177.3 units. Given that this is a seasonal basic, the drop in P13 might be a temporary fluctuation or a stabilization of the high-demand summer trend. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to account for this higher summer volume while acknowledging the P13 dip. Sigma will also be calculated over the last 3 periods to capture the recent high volatility (ranging from 132 to 212). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019, representing the Mid-Summer peak for the 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics). Analysis of recent demand shows a significant regime shift. Demand in Periods 11-12 averaged ~200, followed by a correction in Periods 13-14 averaging 143 (132 and 154). The 'Early Summer Peak' mentioned in Carry-over insights appears to be stabilizing at a new higher plateau compared to the April 'Spring' regime. To capture this transition while cooling off from the extreme spikes of P11/P12, I am selecting N=4 for mu_hat (Periods 11-14) which yields a mean of 171.5. This allows the OR backend to target a base stock that covers this higher summer baseline while accounting for the recent variance. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with no missed or delayed shipments observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Early Summer demand regime for Women's Everyday Basics (Period 11-14) established a new mean of 171.5, significantly higher (+20%) than the previous April regime (~143).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand early summer regime. Period 15 conclude shows a demand of 193 units, which far exceeded our starting inventory and resulted in a stockout. The demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) has averaged 175.8 units (212, 188, 132, 154, 193), with significant volatility (std dev ~32). This confirms the 'Early Summer' regime identified in the carry-over insights. Since we are entering late May (2019/5/27), we expect these high demand levels for basic jersey items to persist. The observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $1 profit (suggesting a 50% target service level in the base stock formula, though we must buffer for volatility), I will use the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime's higher mean and variance more accurately than the long-term history.

Carry-over insight: Early Summer demand regime (P11-P15) exhibits a mean of 175.8 and higher volatility (\u03c3\u224832), a significant jump from the April peak mean of ~143.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/3), we are entering the peak summer season for the 'Nora T-shirt', a core basic. The game history consistently shows a cycle of stockouts as demand shifts upward: March (~95), April (~143), and now May/June showing a sustained high-demand regime. Specifically, the last six periods (P11-P16) show a mean demand of 183.7 with a standard deviation of 31.8, and the most recent demand (P16) reached 223 units. The current on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero, following another stockout in P16. To break the replenishment lag and capture this peak successfully, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the 'Early Summer' regime and use an explicit sigma_hat of 45. Setting sigma_hat explicitly higher than the recent trailing standard deviation (31.8) is necessary because the stockouts in P15 and P16 imply that the true demand volatility is suppressed in the 'sold' units. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal (q=0.5), the OR backend will target the median demand; increasing sigma_hat prevents the system from being overly lean during this critical seasonal peak. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early Summer peak regime (P11-P16) confirmed for Womens Everyday Basics: mean demand is 183.7 (up from 143 in April), with the most recent observation reaching 223 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-June period (Period 18: 2019/06/10) for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Demand has been in an 'Early Summer' peak regime since Period 11. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), the average demand is 188.5 units. The most recent three periods (P15-P17) show an even higher intensity, with demands of 193, 223, and 218 (average 211.3). Stockouts have occurred in 14 out of 17 periods, including the last three, because the service level target (q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5) resulting from the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0) leads to a base stock targeting only the median demand. To stop the cycle of stockouts during this sustained peak, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat set to 220, reflecting the recent upward trend in the early summer regime. This ensures the OR engine's 'capped policy' provides sufficient inventory to meet these 200+ unit demands. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early Summer peak regime (P11-P17) mean demand increased to 188.5; most recent 3 periods (P15-P17) average 211.3 units, indicating sustained high season demand for basic jersey items.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' (Nora T-shirt) is a classic basic item currently in its high-demand 'Early Summer' season. As noted in the carry-over insights, demand shifted significantly after Period 11 (mid-April to May). Analyzing the most recent regime (P11-P18), mean demand is 182.25 units with a standard deviation of approximately 32 units. The last three periods (P16-P18) show high volatility with observations of 223, 218, and 142 units. Despite the drop to 142 in Period 18, the overall trend for jersey basics remains elevated through mid-June/July. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game. Given that profit (1.0) and holding cost (1.0) are equal, the optimal service level is 50% (q = 0.5), effectively targeting the median of the demand distribution per period. I will use a N=8 window (the length of the Early Summer regime from P11 to P18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Early Summer demand regime (P11-P18) mean demand is 182.3; recent historical volatility (P15-P18) remains high with observations frequently exceeding 210 units before the P18 dip.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' (Nora T-shirt) is currently in an 'Early Summer' high-demand regime. Period 19 demand was 190 units, consistent with the established regime mean of ~183 units (Periods 11-19). Stockouts have occurred in 15 out of 19 periods, indicating that even during the recent high-demand phase, the backend's capped ordering policy and our parameters are struggling to keep up with volatility. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), which suggests a target service level of 50%, theoretically minimizing holding costs. However, the missed sales opportunity cost and the consistent stockouts warrant a robust mu_hat. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the Early Summer regime (starting Period 11), as this aligns with the current seasonal peak for basic jersey T-shirts in June. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. We are managing 'Womens Everyday Basics' (jersey t-shirts), which have been in a high-demand Summer regime since early May. The 'Early Summer' regime (Period 11-20) has shown a mean demand of approximately 174 units. Recent demand (Period 19 and 20) has been stable at 190 units, suggesting the Summer peak is sustained. However, July typically sees high demand for basics before a potential late-August transition. Significant stockouts have occurred repeatedly (15 out of 20 periods) due to inventory levels trailing actual demand. To capture remaining summer demand while accounting for recent stability, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the full Early Summer regime, effectively setting a base stock that covers the 174-190 range. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Summer demand stability (Period 19-20): Demand has leveled at 190 units, confirming the high ceiling of the Summer regime established in Period 11.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' (Period 21) showed a sharp decline to 104 units, compared to the sustained high-summer average of ~190 (Periods 19-20). This likely indicates the beginning of a seasonal shift as we move away from peak early-summer demand in July. Total pipeline inventory is 81 (on-hand). To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for potentially still-volatile demand, I will focus on the most recent regime shift. The 'Summer' regime (P11-P21) has an average of ~178, but the last 3 periods (P19-P21) averaged ~161 due to the recent dip. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the stability of the high-summer period while allowing the recent lower observation to weigh into the forecast. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Summer demand decline: Period 21 saw demand drop to 104 units, a 45% decrease from the 190-unit level held in Periods 19-20, signaling a potential downward regime shift for basic jersey items as mid-summer progresses.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 23 (July 15, 2019). The product is a Women's T-shirt, which typically experiences peak demand during spring and early summer followed by a mid-summer decline. The data confirms this: demand averaged ~185 units from P15-P20 but has dropped significantly in the last two periods (P21: 104, P22: 79). This confirms a downward regime shift as the summer peak fades. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs in this declining phase, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to favor the most recent demand behavior. I will use N=2 for mu_hat to capture the immediate downward trend (average of ~91.5) and N=2 for sigma_hat to reflect lower volatility in this new lower-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Summer demand decline confirmed (Periods 21-22): Demand dropped from a ~185 unit average (P15-P20) to a ~92 unit average (+/- 12.5% decrease from the previous high regime), signaling the end of the seasonal peak for basic jersey T-shirts.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) has definitively shifted into a lower late-summer regime. After peaking at averages near 190 units (P15-P20), demand dropped sharply in P21 (104) and has remained in a lower range for three consecutive weeks (104, 79, 88). The average of these last three periods is approximately 90.3. Lead time has consistently remained at 0, allowing for reactive inventory management. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to stabilize the mu_hat and sigma_hat around this lower demand baseline, preventing excessive holding costs as the seasonal peak concludes. On-hand inventory is currently at 4 units, so the backend will order to reach the calculated base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand decline confirmed (Periods 21-23): Mean demand has stabilized at ~90 units, down ~50% from the Summer peak (~185 units).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) has entered a clear downward regime shift following the summer peak. The current date is late July (2019/7/29). Historical demand over the last 4 periods (P21-P24) has been 104, 79, 88, and 61, resulting in a mean of 83 units. There is a significant drop from the May/June peak average of ~185. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late summer stabilization/decline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 30 units, meaning the OR backend will order approximately (83 - 30) = 53 units, balancing the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each) for a 50% service level target.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand regime stabilized (Periods 21-24): Mean demand is 83 units, confirming a ~55% reduction from the Summer peak (~185 units).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' (Nora T-shirt) is a seasonal basic. Historical data shows a clear peak in demand during May and June (Early Summer), followed by a significant decline starting in Period 21 (July). We are currently in the Late Summer/Pre-Fall transition (August 5). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime over the last 5 periods (P21-P25: 104, 79, 88, 61, 44), with a mean of 75.2 units. The most recent demand (44) is the lowest in months, indicating the seasonal wind-down is accelerating. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the declining trend, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining sufficient stock for the tail end of summer. Holding costs and profits are equal ($1.0), so the OR backend will target a 50% service level for the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand decline accelerating: Recent demand (P25) dropped to 44 units, continuing the downward shift from the Summer peak (~185) to a new late-season average of ~75 units over the last 5 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) has entered a clear late-season decline as of early August (Period 27: 2019/8/12). After a summer peak of ~185 units, demand dropped significantly starting Period 21. Recent observations for Periods 21-26 are: 104, 79, 88, 61, 44, and 66. This suggests the demand has stabilized into a lower regime. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P21-P26) is 73.67. Given the most recent four periods (P23-P26) average 64.75 units and indicate more stabilization after the initial drop, I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this entire lower-demand window while acknowledging the downward trend. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The OR backend will use these revised mean and standard deviation figures to prevent overstocking as the core summer season ends.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand regime for Women's Everyday Basics (Period 21-26) stabilized at a mean of ~74 units, representing a 60% reduction from the Summer peak (~185).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics) is in a clear late-summer decline phase. Current observations for the period (August) confirm a stabilized lower regime compared to the early summer peak. Demand over the last 7 periods (P21-P27) has averaged 70 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P25-P27) show an even lower average of approximately 53 units (44, 66, 50). This suggests the end-of-season tapering is continuing. The on-hand inventory is currently 24. With a lead time of 0, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (reflecting the most current late-season demand) to avoid overstocking as we move further into late August. Sigma_hat is also set to the recent 3 periods to capture current volatility while ignoring the much higher variance seen during the summer peak. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a low base stock suitable for the closing of the season.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand regime for Women's Everyday Basics (P25-P27) has further softened to an average of ~53 units, down from the P21-P26 average of ~74.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598057 (Nora T-shirt) is in a clear late-summer downward regime as of Period 29 (late August). The 'Early Summer' peak (Periods 11-20) saw demand average ~180 units, but since Period 21, demand has structuraly shifted lower. The most recent demand cluster (Periods 25-28) shows observations of 44, 66, 50, and 39 units. This averages 49.75 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight noting a softening to approximately ~53 units. Given the transition into late August/early September, further seasonal decline is expected as the 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey category moves out of peak summer consumption. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand level (~50 units). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for highly responsive ordering.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand regime (P25-P28) confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized at ~50 units (average 49.75), a significant 70%+ reduction from the Summer peak.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) has continued its seasonal decline as we enter September (Period 30). The most recent demand was 18 units, the lowest since early January. Over the last five periods (P25-P29), demand has shifted from an average of ~50 to a more recent average of ~30, with a significant drop to 18 in the most recent observation. Given the product's classification as a jersey basic with short sleeves, demand is expected to continue softening as summer ends. I am resetting the demand regime to the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this downward trend while preventing over-reaction to a single low point (18). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level, essentially aiming for the mean demand. The on-hand inventory is 32, which already covers the most recent demand observation. An order is likely needed to maintain basic stock against the new lower mean (~44). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer/Early Autumn transition (P25-P29): Demand has further dropped to an average of ~44 units, with the most recent observation (P29) reaching a seasonal low of 18 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Women's Everyday Basics' (jersey T-shirt) is in a significant late-seasonal decline. Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), demand has dropped from an average of ~50 to recent lows of 18 (P29) and 16 (P30). As of 2019-09-09, we are entering the Autumn season where short-sleeved jersey basics typically reach their lowest demand. The current on-hand inventory is 28 units, which already covers the most recent demand (16) and is higher than the last two observed demand points. Setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this most recent low-demand cluster (Avg=22.75) while smoothing the transition. Given historical stability in lead time (promised=0, actual=0), I will continue with the default L to minimize holding costs while the item phases out.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand floor established (Period 29-30): Demand for basic jersey T-shirts has hit a low-level plateau of ~17 units, down from the peak Summer levels (~185).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) has reached its minimum seasonal level as we enter mid-September. Historical data from the last three periods (P29-P31) shows demand values of 18, 16, and 3, averaging 12.33 units. This confirms the 'Autumn floor' identified in the carry-over insights. With current on-hand inventory at 28 units and a lead time of 0, we are already overstocked relative to current demand levels. To prevent further accumulation of units and minimize holding costs (which currently equal the profit margin), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this low-demand regime. This will likely result in a near-zero order to allow current inventory to deplete naturally.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a clear Autumn seasonal decline. Demand has transitioned from a Summer peak of ~185 units to a low-level plateau. Over the last 4 periods (P29-P32), demand has been 18, 16, 3, and 7 units respectively, averaging 11 units. The carry-over insights confirm this 'Autumn floor'. Inventory is currently 21 units (on-hand), which is sufficient to cover approximately two periods of current demand levels without ordering more. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this low-demand regime and avoid overstocking during the off-season. This setting balances the low holding cost ($1) and profit ($1) while preventing unnecessary inventory accumulation.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter low-demand regime confirmed (P29-P32): Demand has stabilized at a floor of ~11 units, down from the Late Summer average of ~50 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October (Period 34), which consistently remains in the post-summer low-demand regime for Women's Everyday Basics. Historical demand since Period 29 has dropped significantly from summer peaks, establishing a new floor. Periods 29-33 show demand values of 18, 16, 3, 7, and 22. While Period 33 saw a slight uptick to 22 units, the overall average for the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 13.2 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs in this low-demand phase, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to reflect the current autumn floor (mean ~13, floor ~3). This captures the recent variance (std \u2248 8) to set an appropriate base stock level of approximately 21-25 units, which covers the most recent demand spike while respecting the lower average.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is entering the Autumn/Winter low-demand regime for Women's Everyday Basics (Jersey T-shirts). Demand has drastically decreased from its Summer peak (~185 units) to an average of ~11.4 units over the last 5 periods (P30-P34: 16, 3, 7, 22, 9). Period 33 saw a minor spike in demand (22 units), but the current observation (P34) shows a return to single digits (9 units). With on-hand inventory at 5 units and a stable actual lead time of 0 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this low-volume floor while maintaining a buffer against small fluctuations like that seen in P33. The lead time remains at the promised 0 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, 2019. We are in the depths of the Autumn/Winter low-demand regime for the Nora T-shirt. Historically, this product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) saw a massive summer peak (~185 units) and has progressively declined through late summer and autumn. Recent data (P31-P35) shows demand has settled into a very low and stable range: 3, 7, 22, 9, 6. The mean of these last 5 periods is 9.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 7.5. The 'Spring' or 'Summer' logic is no longer applicable. Given the current low-volume environment and the high relative holding cost (Holding=1.0, Profit=1.0, making the target service level 50%), I will use recent_N=5 to capture this floor regime while maintaining a small safety buffer for the volatility seen in Period 33. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter low-demand regime (P31-P35) mean demand has stabilized at ~9.4 units, representing the seasonal floor for this item.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) has fully settled into a low-volume Autumn/Winter regime. Since Period 31, demand has consistently stayed in the single digits or low teens, with a mean around 9 units. Period 36 reported a demand of 8 units, following a sequence of 3, 7, 22, 9, 6. The peak in Period 33 (22 units) appears to be an outlier in an otherwise stable low-demand floor. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5. To avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining this baseline, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (covering the stable period since Period 31). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in an Autumn/Winter low-demand regime for basic jersey t-shirts. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower floor compared to its summer peak. In Period 37, demand was only 3 units, following a trend of low single-digit to low double-digit demand (P31-P37 mean is approx 8.3 units). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 7 units and the recent demand has been extremely low (3 units in P37), I will use a recent_N approach for mean and standard deviation focusing on the last 7 periods (P31-P37) to capture the current stable floor and prevent over-ordering as we enter late October.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598057 (Nora T-shirt) is currently in a deep Autumn/Winter low-demand regime. Historical demand since Period 31 (September) has consistently stayed in the single digits or low teens, with a mean demand of approximately 7.2 units over the last 8 periods (P31-P38). The most recent period (P38) saw a demand of 8 units, confirming this stable floor. There is no evidence of a lead time shift; 'Period 38 conclude' confirms the order placed in P38 arrived in P38 (lead_time = 0). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the OR backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning it will aim to match the mean demand. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time. To capture the current seasonal floor while smoothing out minor fluctuations, I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8, covering the steady regime since early September.

Current demand is significantly lower than the Summer peak, and holding cost equals profit ($1.00), making the target service level 50% (since q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5). To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining the target service level, I am using a recent_N approach (N=9) to capture the current stable floor. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), the mean demand is 6.86 units with a low standard deviation. The current on-hand inventory is 2 units. This product is highly seasonal, and we are now in the baseline trough. I am selecting recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current low-demand floor and minimize holding costs, as the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00). The lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). Demand for the Nora T-shirt has been in a sustained low-level 'Autumn/Winter' regime (approx. 9-10 units/period) since around Period 31. The most recent demand samples are 8, 3, 8, 7, 7, and 8, confirming very low but stable volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory currently sits at 0 on-hand with no in-transit units. Given the transition into late November, I expect this low-demand baseline to continue. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture this low-level regime accurately without being influenced by the significantly higher summer peak data, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current seasonal trough.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Women's Everyday Basics' T-shirts has transitioned into a stable low-demand Winter regime. After the significant Autumn decline, demand has hit a floor, averaging 7.6 units over the last 10 periods (P33-P42). The most recent demand of 15 units in Period 42 represents a minor spike or potential early signal of holiday/pre-spring movement, but it is still well within the lower bounds compared to summer peaks. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs (which equal profit for this item), I will use a short lookback (N=5) to capture recent mean demand and volatility accurately, adjusting for the slight uptick in the most recent sample.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand regime confirmed (P33-P42): Mean demand has stabilized at a floor of ~7.6 units, reflecting a 95% reduction from Summer peaks.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019. Historical data for the 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics) shows a clear seasonal floor established since Period 33, with mean demand stabilizing around 7.6 units. Period 42 saw a brief spike to 15, but Period 43 returned to the low-demand regime with an observation of 2 units. Given this is a basic jersey item in mid-winter, demand is expected to remain at this floor level. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is 7 units, which is close to the expected weekly demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11, covering the period from P33 to P43) to capture this winter floor while accounting for the small spike in P42. This ensures a lean inventory profile congruent with the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which mathematically targets a 50% service level via the OR backend.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019, targeting the final few periods of the game. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is solidly in its winter low-demand regime, as reflected in the carry-over insights and recent history. Demand has fluctuated between 2 and 15 units over the last 10 periods (P35-P44), with a mean of 6.9 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P41-P44) show demand of 8, 15, 2, and 5 (mean 7.5), confirming that the baseline established around Period 43 remains accurate. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the equality of profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively targeting the median of the demand distribution. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable but slightly volatile winter floor (stabilizing around ~7.5 units) while filtering out the high-volume summer data. N=10 covers the period from Oct 14 to Dec 9.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019 (Period 46). The product is a short-sleeved jersey T-shirt, which is in its seasonal low (Winter regime). Since Period 43, carry-over insights confirmed a stable floor of ~7.6 units per week. Recent demand (P43-P45: 2, 5, 6) averages 4.3 units, indicating even lower activity than the earlier winter average. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently at 1 unit with 0 in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the entire low-demand period since early October (P32), as this provides a stable basis for the current winter floor while balancing the risk of holding costs against a $1 profit margin. Setting L to default (0) as it is reliable and consistent.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019 (Period 47). This product (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a stable winter low-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 7.6 units since Period 33. Recently, demand has reached a seasonal minimum, including 0 units sold in Period 46. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since we are at the end of the year/beginning of the new year, demand is expected to remain low before the Spring increase observed in early February last year (history seeds). I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=14 (covering roughly 3 months of winter data from P33 onwards) to capture the current stable floor while filtering out the high-demand summer noise.
