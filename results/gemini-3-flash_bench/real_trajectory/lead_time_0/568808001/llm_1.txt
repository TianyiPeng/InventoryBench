As we move into mid-February, we are approaching the transition from Winter to Spring/Summer retail seasons. b) Demand Regime: Historical data shows a clear upward trend in the last 5 weeks: 23, 29, 31, 38, 50. This represents a weekly growth rate and indicates increasing seasonal interest as warmer weather is anticipated. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival). I will monitor Period 1's conclusion to verify this. d) Inventory: On-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. With a current demand of 50 in the last recorded week and a growing trend, I expect Period 1 demand to be approximately 55-65 units. e) Order Logic: Since lead time is 0, I want to stock enough to cover Period 1 demand and potentially some buffer for Period 2, as I have 0 starting stock. To satisfy a projected demand of ~60 and avoid stockouts while accounting for the strong growth trend, I will order 80 units.",

In Period 1 (Feb 11), demand was 36. This reflects a slight dip from the Feb 4 high of 50 but confirms a general level significantly higher than early January.

I will assume LT remains 0, but must watch for delays. d) Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 44. e) Order Logic: With an upward trend and moving toward Spring/Summer, demand is likely to stay in the 40-55 range. To cover Period 2 demand and maintain a safety buffer, I want to target an inventory level of approximately 90 (covering roughly 2 periods of forecasted demand + safety stock).

To minimize holding costs while avoiding stockouts (Profit=$1, Holding=$1), I should keep a lean inventory. I expect demand for this period and next to be around 45-50 units each. With 73 units on hand, if I order 0, I likely cover this week with a remainder of ~23 units.

However, the 'Late August resilience' noted in previous insights has carried over into early September, indicating that demand hasn't collapsed yet. Given the L=0 lead time (confirmed consistently), I can afford to react quickly to drops.
