Given it is mid-February, demand for sweatshirts is likely stable or slightly declining as winter transitions to spring, but still significant. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period and be available for this period's demand. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no in-transit units, I must order enough to cover Period 1 demand and maintain a small safety buffer. I will target an inventory level of 60 units (the historical maximum) to ensure high service level while minimizing holding costs given the $1/unit holding cost vs $1/unit profit ratio.",

Period 1 demand was 51. Period 2 demand spiked to 97, which is a significant outlier or potential shift.

Lead Time: Confirmed at 0 periods (Orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current state: 0 on-hand, 0 in-transit. Service level: We stocked out in Period 2 (sold 60, demand 97) because the order of 51 plus carryover of 9 was insufficient for the 97 demand. Decision logic: I need to cover Period 3 demand. Even if the '97' was a spike, I should stock more than the historical average to avoid another stockout while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0/unit).

The date is early March (2019/3/4), which is still seasonal for sweatshirts (late winter/early spring).

Average demand across the 8 data points provided (5 from historical samples + 3 from game history) is approximately 55 units. Given the spike to 97 in Period 2 (potentially idiosyncratic or a forgotten promotion), a safe target inventory level would be around 75-80 units to provide a buffer without incurring excessive holding costs, as holding cost ($1.0) is equal to profit ($1.0).

Post-shift (P10-P14) avg was ~27. P15-P16 saw demand rise to 38 and 44 respectively. This suggests a current volatile demand regime between 25-45 units. (c) Lead Time: Consistently 0 periods.

(e) Order Logic: Given lead time 0, I can satisfy demand with a same-period arrival. To avoid stockouts (like in P12, P15, P16) while respecting the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), I must be precise.
