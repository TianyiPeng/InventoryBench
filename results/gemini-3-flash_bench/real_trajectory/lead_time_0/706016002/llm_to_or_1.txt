Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 706016002 (Skinny Denim Trousers). Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows a rising trend (557, 438, 489, 500, 649). The latest sample (649) is significantly higher than the average, possibly indicating the start of a pre-Spring/Lunar New Year demand shift. Inventory is currently zero. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no observed lead times yet, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat), given the recent upward movement, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent mean (~526) rather than the longer-term average, ensuring the OR engine sets a base stock that covers the current demand level. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect recent volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a seasonal fashion item (high-waisted skinny jeans). Historical demand over the last 6 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 11) shows: 557, 438, 489, 500, 649, 544. There is a slight upward trend, particularly looking at the jump in early February (649), though the most recent week settled at 544. The average demand is 527. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0 (ordered 595, arrived 595 in P1). On-hand inventory is low (51). To maintain high service levels for a $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (target service level ~80%), I will use the mean of the most recent 5 weeks (approx 524) to forecast the next period's demand, adjusted for the observed variance. Since the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0, L is set to default.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th. The product is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser (Divided Collection), typically a staple item but subject to early spring/pre-Easter demand increases. Historical demand shows a slight upward trend in February (samples: 557, 438, 489, 500, 649) followed by observed demand in P1 and P2 (544, 545). The average demand over the last 5 samples (including the most recent two observed in-game) is approximately 545. Promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time for P1 and P2 was confirmed as 0. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this recent stability around 545 and default for lead time as it remains consistent with the promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1656.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/03/04). The product is a SKU of skinny denim trousers. Historic demand samples (pre-period 1) and actual game demand (Periods 1-3) show a relatively stable pattern (557, 438, 489, 500, 649, 544, 545, 451). The mean of the 5 pre-game samples is 526.6, and the mean of the 3 in-game periods is 513.3. There is a slight drop in demand in the most recent period (451), but it's within the normal variance seen (historical low was 438). The Promised Lead Time is 0, and the observed lead time for all 3 periods has been exactly 0. I will maintain a lead time (L) of 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, there is no strong evidence of a sustained demand regime shift yet; however, to be responsive to the recent data while respecting the variability, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and variance to capture the most recent activity without overreacting to the single low point in Period 3. This balances the service level for a high-turnover item while managing holding costs.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS, a staple item (High-waisted jeans) in the Divided Collection. Demand for the last 5 samples (P1-P4 plus historical 2019-02-04) shows: 649, 544, 545, 451, 435. There is a visible downward trend from the early February peak. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all four periods. Current on-hand is 165. The OR engine needs to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. Given the slight cooling of demand, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent trend (avg ~443) and recent_N of 4 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility after the initial spike. L will stay at the promised 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a standard fashion item. Historical demand samples (Pre-game: 557, 438, 489, 500, 649; In-game P1-P5: 544, 545, 451, 435, 464) show relative stability with a slight downward trend in the most recent periods (P3-P5 mean is ~450 compared to the overall mean of ~500). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Current on-hand is 63, and there is no in-transit inventory. Given the 0-period lead time, the inventory risk is low. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent stabilization around 450-500, and N=5 for volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect the recent demand spread. L remains at the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1772.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is a year-round denim staple. Historical samples (Jan-Feb) and game history (Feb-March) show a stable demand regime. Average demand across all 11 available data points (5 historical + 6 game periods) is approximately 504. The most recent 6 periods have a mean of 483, showing a slight decrease compared to the early January/early February peaks (which reached up to 649). Since lead time is consistently 0, we only need to cover the current period's demand (1+L = 1). Using recent_N=6 captures the current spring stabilization while allowing for minor fluctuations. Standard deviation over the full history is roughly 65, which is sufficient for the OR backend to set a base stock that balances the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost (75% service level target). Lead time remains 0 as confirmed by every period reaching 'conclude' within the same period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim, which is a staple fashion item. Historically, demand has been stable but showed a slight uptick in the most recent period (Period 7: 542 units), leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all 7 completed orders, aligning with the promise. Demand samples (including pre-game and game history) are: 557, 438, 489, 500, 649 (pre-game) and 544, 545, 451, 435, 464, 461, 542 (game history). The mean of the last 4 game periods is 475.5, while the overall game mean is 491.7. Given the recent stockout and the start of April (potential spring seasonality), I will use the recent N (N=7) to capture the game-period behavior which is slightly more volatile than pre-game. L is set to 0. mu_hat and sigma_hat will target the recent performance to ensure we satisfy demand without excessive holding costs, as lead time is 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2136.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), demand spiked significantly to 795 units, compared to the previous average of ~490. This date aligns with early April, often associated with Spring fashion refreshes and preparation for Easter. The current period is 2019-04-08, only one week away from Easter (April 21, 2019), suggesting the demand surge may continue or intensify. Historical samples (557, 438, 489, 500, 649) and gameplay history (544, 545, 451, 435, 464, 461, 542) show a baseline mean around 510, but Period 8's 795 (+55% shift) indicates a clear regime change. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the upward trend (542, 795, and the high-end historical 649) while setting L to 'calculate' as the 0-period lead time has been consistent. This approach ensures the base stock elevates rapidly to meet the spring surge while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting Period 7/8 (late March/early April); average demand increased from ~460 to ~670 (+45%) likely due to Spring/Easter seasonality.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. We are managing 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a clothing item. Historically, lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. We experienced a significant demand surge in Period 8 (795 units), followed by a moderate Period 9 (538 units). Period 8's high demand resulted in stockouts, which likely depressed the starting inventory for Period 9. The carry-over insight correctly identified a shift in demand regime starting around Period 7/8, likely due to spring seasonality. To avoid further stockouts during this volatile spring period while accounting for the high demand seen in early April, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 (Periods 7, 8, and 9) to capture the higher mean (~625) and increased volatility. L will remain at default (0) as lead time has been perfectly stable.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 (2019/4/22). The product is a seasonal denim item. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Historical demand data and recent performance show a significant spike in Periods 7 and 8 (542 and 795), followed by a cooling-off period in Periods 9 and 10 (538 and 425). This suggests the 'Easter/Spring surge' mentioned in carry-over insights may have peaked and is now returning to a more stable level. Demand for the last 4 periods (7-10) averaged 575 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to account for this recent elevated but declining trend, ensuring we don't overstock as the season stabilizes. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher volatility seen during the surge.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), the SKU 706016002 (Skinny Denim) shows a cooling period following an early April spike. Demand in Periods 10 and 11 was 425 and 385 respectively, significantly lower than the Period 8 spike of 795 and Period 9's 538. The 'Carry-over Insight' noted a 45% increase, but recent data suggests this peak was transient (likely tied to Easter/Spring break). I am transitioning from the high-demand regime back to a more moderate baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. With 322 units on-hand and declining demand, I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach to capture the current downward trend while still respecting the volatility of the recent surge. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that avoids overstocking as the seasonal peak passes.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled significantly in late April (Periods 10-11) following the early April peak; average demand dropped from ~660 (P8-P9) to ~405 (P10-P11), suggesting the seasonal surge has subsided.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that the demand surge observed in late March and early April (averaging ~660 units) has definitively subsided. Over the last three periods (P10-P12), demand has stabilized at a lower level: 425, 385, and 353 units respectively (average ~388). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by immediate arrivals in every period. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 339 units. Since the demand regime has shifted back to a lower baseline, I am setting N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this post-peak stabilization. This prevents the OR backend from over-ordering based on the high April volumes while ensuring enough stock to cover the current demand level of approximately 400 units per period.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift: after a seasonal peak in early April (Periods 8-9), demand has consistently declined over the last four periods (P10: 425, P11: 385, P12: 353, P13: 280). The average demand of the last 3 periods is approximately 339, which is a significant drop from the earlier April surge and slightly lower than the pre-peak average (~460). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend and stabilize inventory levels, preventing overstocking as the seasonal interest in this item (skinny denim) seems to be Cooling for late Spring.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: demand has dropped for four consecutive periods (P10-P13), reaching a low of 280 in P13 (a ~50% decrease from the April peak average).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded history. Demand analysis shows a significant cooling trend following the April peak (averaging ~660 in P8-P9). In the last five periods (P10-P14), demand has stabilized at a lower level with values of 425, 385, 353, 280, and 389, resulting in a 5-period average of approximately 366. The most recent demand (389) suggests the decline noted in Period 13 (280) may have been the floor rather than a continuing freefall. Given the product description (skinny denim jeans), demand is likely to remain relatively stable in late spring. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this post-peak regime while smoothing out the P13 dip. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect current volatility. L remains at the promised/observed value of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in May: Post-peak average demand (P10-P14) settled at ~366, down from the ~660 April peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is skin denim trousers, which saw a significant demand surge in April (Spring/Easter) followed by a cooling trend in May. However, demand in Period 15 spiked to 471, exceeding our on-hand inventory and resulting in lost sales. This indicates that while the peak has subsided, the floor for demand is higher than the late April lows (~366). With inventory at 0, we must replenish to meet this sustained demand. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the recent slight uptick and stabilization (average of P13-P15 is approx 380), and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6) to capture the increased volatility seen during the transition from the April peak to May stability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/06/03), demand for SKU 706016002 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) has shown a recent uptick in late May. After the post-Spring cooling where demand bottomed at 280 (P13), the last three periods (P14-P16) have seen demand of 389, 471, and 486 respectively. This suggests the demand regime has shifted from the 'stabilized' average of ~366 noted in May back towards a higher level, potentially a summer baseline or pre-summer surge. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we stocked out last period (sold 435 vs 486 demand). Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. To address the current stockout and capture the rising demand trend, I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current 3nd-period upward trajectory (average ~448). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected starting Period 15: Demand increased from a May average of ~366 to a late-May/early-June average of ~448 (+22%) over the last three periods (P14-P16).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' SKU shows distinct regimes: a spring surge (April), a post-surge slump (May), and a recent moderate recovery starting in Period 15. Over the last three periods (P15-P17), demand has averaged 462 (471, 486, 429), which is higher than the May average of ~366. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this latest demand stabilization/slight increase moving into June. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods (same-period arrival), aligning with the promised lead time, so L is set to 'default'. On-hand inventory is currently low (64 units), and with demand trending above 400, a significant order is needed to meet Period 18 demand and maintain a safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1593.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' SKU showed a significant spring peak in April, followed by a downturn in May, and a recent stabilization/slight recovery in the last four periods (P15-P18). Specifically, demand for P15-P18 has been 471, 486, 429, and 416, averaging approximately 450 units. This is higher than the early May average of ~366 noted in previous insights (a ~23% increase), suggesting the demand regime has shifted to a 'early summer' plateau. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. To prevent stockouts seen in P15 and P16 when demand exceeded 470 units, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new stable level. Sigma_hat is also set using the recent 4 periods to focus on the current volatility. This approach balances the risk of service loss against holding costs by focusing on the current demand regime rather than including the volatile April peak or the May trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift consolidated: Late May/June demand (P15-P18) has stabilized around an average of 450 units, up from the post-April dip average of ~366.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Historical data confirms the lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods. Since the early April peak, demand went through a significant dip in May but has stabilized in June. Over the last five periods (P15-P19), demand has averaged 436.6 units (471, 486, 429, 416, 381). While the demand in P19 (381) shows a slight cooling compared to late May, the overall June regime (P17-P19) is centered around 410 units. I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture this stabilized post-May recovery level while allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the observed volatility (approx. 43 units std dev in the recent window). This ensures we maintain a healthy service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overstocking as we exit the spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand regime for June (P17-P19) has stabilized around an average of 410 units, slightly lower than the late-May peak but significantly higher than the early May dip (avg ~366).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 21 (2019/07/01), the SKU 706016002 (skinny denim) has entered a low-point in its current demand cycle. Demand in Period 20 dropped to 274, the lowest since early May. The late-June average (P17-P20) is approximately 375 units, a decrease from the mid-June average of ~410 units. This suggests a mid-summer slowdown for this specific trouser item. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' style replenishment. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this most recent downward trend in demand, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the localized mean of ~375 and current volatility, rather than the higher May/June peaks. This prevents excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling in late June/early July: Average demand decreased from ~410 (P17-P19) to ~375 (P17-P20), with P20 recording a seasonal low of 274.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016002 (Skinny Denim Trousers) has transitioned from a June average demand of ~410 to a lower July demand level. Recent demand observations for the last three periods (P19-P21) are 381, 274, and 332, resulting in a three-period average of 329 units. This confirms the 'cooling trend' noted in previous insights as we move further into the summer season. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by last period's arrival. I am setting the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N with N=3 to capture this most recent stabilization around the ~330 level, while maintaining sigma_hat on the same window to adjust for the recent volatility seen in the 274-332 range. This configuration helps the OR backend avoid overstocking during the seasonal downturn while maintaining a sufficient service level for the current 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level for early July: Average demand for P19-P21 is ~329 units, down from the June average of ~410 (-20%).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical demand for the last few weeks has stabilized at a lower level compared to the June peak. Specifically, demand in Period 20 was 274, Period 21 was 332, and Period 22 was 329. This validates a new demand regime where the average is approximately 312 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level q is 0.8. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this recent stabilization at a lower demand level (P20-P22) and avoid over-ordering based on the higher June demand levels. Lead time L is set to 'default' as documented actual lead times match the promised 0 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016002 is a denim trouser item. Historical demand analysis shows a stabilization in July following a decline from the April/June peaks. The demand for the last three periods (P21-P23) has been very consistent (332, 329, 323), averaging 328 units. This indicates a stable summer regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use N=3 to capture this most recent stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the OR backend to target a base stock levels that reflect the current demand run-rate of approximately 328 units per week, while maintaining enough safety stock for the minor observed volatility (std of ~4.5 units in the last three periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in July: Average demand for P21-P23 is ~328 units with very low volatility (range 323-332), confirming a shift away from June's higher average (~410).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' in late July (Period 24) showed a significant drop to 178 units, down from the stable July average of ~328 units (Periods 21-23). This 45% decrease suggests a potential shift as we approach the end of July. Analyzing the last 4 periods (P21-P24), the average is approximately 290 units. Given the recent drop, I will shift the demand regime calculation to focus on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this cooling trend while still accounting for the previous stability. Lead time consistently remains 0 as confirmed by all concluded periods. The parameters are designed to protect against demand variability while avoiding excess inventory during this apparent slowdown.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling at the end of July: Period 24 demand dropped to 178 units, a significant decrease from the early-July stable average of ~328.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a demand cooling phase as of late July/early August. Period 24 saw a significant drop to 178 units, followed by a slight recovery to 236 units in Period 25. The previous stable July average of ~328 has clearly shifted. Looking at the last two weeks (P24-P25), the average demand is 207 units. However, to avoid over-reacting to a single low outlier (P24) while acknowledging the cooling trend, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (averaging 178, 236, and 323 = 245.6) to provide a safe buffer. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The \u03c3\u0302 will also use a recent_N of 3 to capture the increased volatility during this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed for late July/early August: Average demand for P24-P25 dropped to ~207 units compared to the early July average of ~328 (-37%).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has significantly cooled as we move into mid-August. The early July peak of ~330 units has shifted to a lower regime. Demand levels for the last three periods (P24-P26) are 178, 236, and 260 units respectively, averaging approximately 225 units. This represents a ~30% decrease from the July average. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with all historical observations. Given the cooling trend and the shift to late summer/early fall, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (P24, P25, P26) to react to this lower demand floor and prevent excess inventory buildup as holding costs are $1/unit. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in August: Average demand for P24-P26 is ~225 units, down from the July stable average of ~328 (-31%).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-August (2019-08-19). Based on the Period 27 conclude message, there was a sudden and significant demand spike to 415 units, following a period of low demand (August avg ~225). This surge resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Historically, 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' had a demand peak in April (Easter/Spring) and another smaller lift in June. A mid-August spike could indicate 'Back-to-School' shopping, which is highly relevant for denim products. Because demand jumped from ~225 to 415 (+84%), I am opting for the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this sudden upward movement while bridging the recent low-demand regime and the new spike. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all 27 concluded periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand spike detected: Period 27 demand jumped to 415, significantly higher than the previous 3-period average of ~225 (+84%).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016002 is currently in a 'Back-to-School' (BTS) transition phase in late August. Period 27 saw a massive demand spike to 415 (+84% vs prior average), and Period 28 continued at a high level (348). This suggests a new sustained demand regime for late August/September compared to the July/early-August lows. Based on the date (2019/8/26), we are entering the peak school return season for many regions. The previous 2-period average (P27-P28) is ~382. To avoid stockouts seen in Period 27 and capture the remaining BTS momentum, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the shift from the low period into the current high period. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand regime confirmed (late August): Average demand for P27-P28 is ~382, a 70% increase from the early August average of ~225.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. We are in the post 'Back-to-School' (BTS) period. Historically, the SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' saw a significant demand jump in late August (P27: 415, P28: 348), but demand softened to 302 in P29. This suggests the peak of BTS has passed and demand is beginning to descend to a sustainable autumn level, possibly around the 300-350 range. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P27-P29) is 355 units. Given that autumn is a strong season for denim, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the elevated but cooling trend. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain. This strategy balances the need to satisfy the current demand regime while preventing excessive holding costs as the seasonal peak tapers off.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand cooling: Demand peaked at 415 (P27) and has decreased for two consecutive periods to 302 (P29), suggesting a stabilization around the mid-300s for September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016002) jumped significantly in Period 30 (526 units) compared to the late-August/early-September average of ~325. This likely represents a secondary spike in the Back-to-School season or a new September demand regime. Specifically, the last three periods (P28-P30) have seen demands of 348, 302, and 526, averaging 392 units. However, given the most recent jump of +74% over Period 29, being too conservative with old data will lead to stockouts (as seen in Period 30 where ending inventory was 0). I will prioritize recent data to capture this shift. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the sudden volatility and volume increase observed in the last three weeks.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge detected: Period 30 demand (526) reached its highest level since the April peak, significantly exceeding the August average of ~330 (+60%).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016002' (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently experiencing a sustained September demand surge. After the Back-to-School spike in late August (P27), demand has hit 526 (P30) and 540 (P31), indicating a new regime significantly higher than the August average of ~330. As of Period 32 (Sept 16), we are firmly in a high-demand September/early-Fall window. Inventory is currently 0, and the previous period's order was fully sold out, resulting in stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time = 0). To capture the current momentum and avoid further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 2 periods (P30-P31) where demand averaged 533 units. Using N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR backend on this immediate high-demand peak while the 'recent_N' logic handles the base stock calculation (1+L).

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: Average demand for P30-P31 is 533 units, a 60% increase over the August average (~330), marking the highest levels since the April seasonal peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1713.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016002 is currently in a sustained high-demand regime, which started in early September. The demand samples for the last three periods (P30-P32) are 526, 540, and 451, resulting in an average of 505.7 units. This level is significantly higher than the August 'Back-to-School' average and mirrors the spring seasonal peak. Given the date (September 23rd), we are likely seeing a shift into fall fashion demand. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game history. To capture this recent high-demand regime while accounting for the slight dip in P32, I will use a recent_N method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a service level geared towards the profit to holding cost ratio (4:1), ensuring enough stock to cover the current 500+ unit demand levels while minimizing holding costs as the regime stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift: Average demand for P30-P32 is ~506 units, a 53% increase over the August average (~330), indicating a sustained move into a high-demand fall season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2184.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand surged to 781, the highest in the history of this SKU, confirming a strong seasonal peak in late September/early October (Autumn/Fall season for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS'). This follows a high September average (~506) and shows increasing volatility. The 'conclude' message for Period 33 shows the order arrived with lead_time=0. To capture this significant upward shift and high volatility while avoiding stockouts during this peak, I am using recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the high-demand September/late-September regime (P30-P33: 526, 540, 451, 781) where the average is 574.5 units per period. The lead time remains at the default (promised 0) as consistent with observations.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand Fall regime confirmed in late September: Period 33 recorded a record high demand of 781; the average for late September (P30-P33) has risen to ~574, a 74% increase over the August average (~330).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 35 (early October). The current date is 2019/10/07. Looking at the history, the 'sustained high-demand Fall regime' identified in the carry-over insights remains the dominant pattern. Demand in September (P30-P33) averaged ~574, with a peak of 781. Period 34 saw a slight cooling to 472, but this is still significantly higher than the August baseline. Given the product (skinny denim jeans) and the October timeframe, we are entering the core Fall/Winter season for trousers. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the high-demand shift from P30-P34 (mean ~554). This N balances the high September surge with the most recent Period 34 observation. The lead time (L) consistently resolves at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' logic. The backend OR q-ratio is 0.8 (4/5), so parameters will target a high service level to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 30, 31, and 33.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime onset: Following a high September average (~574), early October demand (P34) remains elevated compared to summer levels, confirming a seasonal baseline shift for the Fall trousers category.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1079.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016002 is currently in a high-demand Fall regime (September-October). Recent history shows a significant peak in Period 33 (781 units) followed by a cooling trend in Periods 34-35 (472 and 349 units respectively). The average demand over the last four periods (P32-P35) is 513 units. Using a 4-period window (recent_N=4) for mu_hat correctly captures this elevated Fall baseline while dampening the extreme volatility seen in September. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the high but stabilizing volatility of the current season. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for sustained Fall demand without overreacting to the single highest peak or the most recent dip.

Carry-over insight: October demand cooling: After a record peak in late September (P33: 781), demand has decreased for two consecutive periods (P34: 472, P35: 349), suggesting the Fall peak has passed and demand is settling into a mid-level baseline for October.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 37 (Oct 21). Historical analysis confirms a high-demand fall regime that peaked in late September (P33: 781) and has since cooled. The last three periods (P34-P36) show a descending trend: 472, 349, and 325, with an average of 382 units. This indicates the market is stabilizing at a mid-level baseline for October, moving away from the peak surge. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for this 'High-waisted skinny denim' product, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to focus on this new stabilized post-peak baseline. Lead time remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Fall demand has stabilized at a lower mid-level regime following the late-September peak; average demand for P34-P36 is ~382, down from the September surge average of ~574 (-33%).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28. We are in the post-September peak period for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a Fall-relevant product. Demand has stabilized at a lower mid-level regime since mid-October. The last four periods (P34-P37) show demand of 472, 349, 325, and 341. The average for the most recent three periods (P35-P37) is 338.33, confirming the stabilization noted in the carry-over insights. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for this stable regime, I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current October stability (approx. 370 units/period) rather than the high-volatility September surge. N=4 includes the transition from the end of September to the current October levels.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed stable: Average demand for P34-P37 is ~372 units, indicating a consistent mid-level baseline following the September peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016002 (High-waisted jeans) is currently in a stable mid-level demand regime following a significant peak in September. The date is early November (2019/11/4). Analysis of the last five periods (P34-P38) shows demand levels of 472, 349, 325, 341, and 304, yielding an average of approximately 358 units. This is a consistent baseline compared to the late September surge. The lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the stability of the current October/early-November regime, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility while excluding the outlier peak from September. The service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80, which the OR backend will use to calculate the safety stock based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime: Demand has stabilized at a mid-level baseline following the September peak, with an average of ~358 units over the last five periods (P34-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand has been on a cooling trend since the high peaks in late September (P33: 781). Over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), demand has been 349, 325, 341, 304, and 257. This reflects a shift from the October average of ~372 to a lower November baseline. Specifically, the last three periods (P37-P39) average ~301 units, a 16% decrease from the previous October average. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this cooling phase while maintaining a service level for the skinny denim SKU, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent downward shift in demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed for November: Average demand for P37-P39 dropped to ~301 units, down from the October average of ~372 (-19%).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 41 (2019/11/18), the inventory context is low with only 24 units on-hand and zero in-transit. Historical demand over the last four periods (P37-P40) has been 341, 304, 257, and 308, averaging 302.5 units. This represents a significant and sustained step-down from the October average of ~372, as noted in the carry-over insights. As we are now in mid-to-late November, I am setting the demand parameters to reflect this cooler regime. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current ~300-unit baseline. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, which I will reflect by using the 'calculate' method. These parameters aim to maintain a service level appropriate for the profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding excessive inventory as demand trends downward into late November.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has been in a sustained cooling phase following the September/October peaks. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 277.2 units, a significant decrease from the early October average (~372). The most recent period (P41) saw demand of 276. We are now entering late November, which typically precedes Black Friday and the December holiday season for apparel. While demand has cooled to a baseline of ~280, there is a possibility of a holiday uptick. To capture this stabilization while remaining lean, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current post-peak regime (P37-P41: 341, 304, 257, 308, 276). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late November demand stabilization (P37-P41): Demand has settled into a baseline of ~280 units, reflecting the end of the Fall peak and the start of the pre-holiday period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Date: 2019/11/25), there was a massive demand spike of 1366 units, which is over 4x the recent average of ~300. This is almost certainly due to Black Friday (Nov 29, 2019), which fits the garment/denim trousers category perfectly. Since Black Friday occurred during Period 42, we are now entering Period 43 (Dec 2), which encompasses Cyber Monday and the start of the holiday shopping season. Historical data from earlier this year showed a post-peak cooling (after Easter and late-September peaks), but December demand for denim usually maintains a higher baseline than mid-November but lower than the Black Friday peak itself. I will set mu_hat using an explicit value that accounts for a 'Cyber Monday' residual effect and holiday baseline, estimated at approximately 600 units (roughly double the pre-peak baseline but less than half the Black Friday peak). Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to account for the extreme volatility observed in the last period. Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Extreme Black Friday demand spike confirmed in Period 42 (1366 units, +380% vs baseline). Anticipating holiday season baseline shift for December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 is underway (Dec 9), following the massive Black Friday spike (P42 demand: 1366) and the subsequent post-spike correction (P43 demand: 306). We are now entering the peak December holiday shopping window. Historical demand for these trousers shows significant volatility around major events (Spring, Back-to-School, Fall surge, Black Friday). Given the product (skinny denim trousers) is a staple but highly reactive to sales events, I need to set a base stock that handles the holiday baseline without overstocking against another outlier like Black Friday. In P43, we ordered 853 to recover from the stockout; on-hand is now 547. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 450 to represent the expected December weekly baseline (higher than the Nov/early-Dec drop but lower than the 1k+ outlier) and a higher sigma_hat (150) to account for the uncertainty inherent in the pre-Christmas period. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Holiday regime onset. After the Black Friday spike (P42) and immediate cooling (P43), demand is expected to stabilize at a higher-than-November baseline (~450) for the mid-December window.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has transitioned from the massive Black Friday spike (P42: 1366) to a post-spike cooling phase. Demand in P43 was 306 and P44 was 351. Historically, late-December demand for trousers/jeans often sees a secondary 'Holiday Season' lift as consumers shop for gifts or winter apparel. The average demand for the last two post-Black-Friday periods (P43-P44) is ~329 units. However, given the proximity to Christmas and the carry-over insight suggesting a shift toward a higher-than-November baseline (~450), I will set mu_hat conservatively higher than the immediate two-period average but lower than the Black-Friday-influenced long-term mean. I'll use an explicit mu_hat of 450 (which matches the carry-over insight's expectation for the mid-December window) and an explicit sigma_hat of 100 to account for potential holiday volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $790.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the pre-Christmas week (Dec 23). Historical demand for the last three periods (P43-P45) has been lower than expected for a 'holiday regime' (306, 351, 265), averaging ~307 units. This suggests that the major demand spike occurred at Black Friday (P42) and has not yet re-materialized for late December. However, typical retail patterns for 'Divided Collection' denim expect a final pre-Christmas or post-Christmas clearance surge. Given the current on-hand inventory of 270 and recent average demand of ~307, the OR backend needs to maintain enough stock for a potential small year-end uptick without overstocking and incurring holding costs in Jan. Setting \u03bc\u0302 to roughly 450 (using an explicit value) to slightly buffer against Christmas/New Year demand while recognizing the recent dip. L remains at 0 (confirmed by continuous arrivals).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Late December stabilization. Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P45) settled at an average of ~307 units, lower than the previously anticipated holiday baseline shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $302.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, right at the end of the holiday season and the calendar year. Consistent with the 'Late December stabilization' carry-over, demand has continued to cool (P46: 231) following the Black Friday peak and early December activity. Current on-hand inventory is 622 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand (P44-P46 avg: 282). Historically, early January (P1-P5) demand for this skinny denim SKU hovered around 450-550 units. Therefore, I anticipate a post-holiday baseline that is higher than the current dip but moderate. With a confirmed lead time (L) of 0, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P44-P46) which captures the post-peak cooling, while maintaining a standard sigma_hat. The high on-hand inventory should naturally limit the new order size via the backend's base-stock logic.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday cooling confirmed: Demand in late December (P45-P46) averaged ~248 units, a significant drop from the mid-December average (~350) and Black Friday peak.
