Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the IZZY TEE SKU. Historical data shows demand samples: 289, 161, 122, 154, 201 (mean: 185.4, std: 64.9). The product is a sports tee, and we are entering mid-February, which typically sees a post-New Year fitness plateau before spring seasonality kicks in. Promised lead time is 0. Since we have no on-hand inventory and no in-transit units, we need a base stock level that covers Period 1 demand immediately. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 (median). I will use all 5 historical samples to estimate demand parameters. Since the target service level is 0.5, the z-score is 0, meaning base_stock will essentially target the mean demand. Given the high holding cost relative to profit, a conservative 'default' approach using all available history is appropriate to avoid overstocking while we establish the lead time behavior.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a sports tee (Izzy Tee). Historical demand from the early Jan/Feb samples (289, 161, 122, 154, 201) and Period 1 demand (136) show an average of roughly 177 units per week. There is a slight downward trend from the early January peak, which might have been a New Year's fitness resolution spike. Period 1's lead time was confirmed as 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the last 5 samples (P1 + previous 4) to estimate mean demand, as the very first high sample (289) seems like an outlier or a different regime. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 1/(1+1)=0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median. I will set L to default (0).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for SKUs 678696001. Historical demand samples (Early Jan/Feb) showed a mean of 185.Recent observed demand in Period 1 (136) and Period 2 (143) is slightly lower than the early Jan/Feb average. The product is a 'fast-drying functional fabric' T-shirt (sportswear), which usually sees steady demand in late winter/early spring as fitness activity increases. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived same-period). Total on-hand is low (12). Given the stability, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the recent trend which includes the 2 observed game periods and the 3 most recent historical samples (Jan 28, Feb 4, and the game history). This provides a balanced forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat while maintaining L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a functional sports T-shirt. Historically, demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 averaged 185.4 units per week. Since Feb 11 (Period 1), demand has softened to an average of 124 units (136, 143, 93), likely reflecting a post-New Year resolution dip or mid-winter seasonality for sports apparel. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 59 units with zero in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~124), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This prevents over-ordering based on the higher January peaks while maintaining a service level consistent with a $1 profit/$1 holding cost profile (target cycle service level ~50%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1: demand decreased from a pre-period average of 185 to 124 (-33%) over the last 3 weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Wide sports top in fast-drying functional fabric', typically associated with activewear. Historically, the demand mean for the last four recorded periods (136, 143, 93, 158) is approximately 132.5. Period 4 saw a stockout because the starting inventory (124) was lower than the demand (158), resulting in lost sales. The current date is March 11, which is early spring\u2014a period where demand for lightweight athletic tops/T-shirts often increases as customers prepare for warmer weather and increased outdoor activity. Although Period 3 showed a dip (93), Period 4's spike (158) suggests a potential upward trend or volatility that caught the OR backend off guard due to the previous conservative parameters. The inferred lead time remains stable at 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level of ~133/period (Total mu_hat = (1+0)*133). I will use explicit for sigma_hat, setting it higher (40) to better handle the observed volatility (range 93-158) and prevent further stockouts during this transition season.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'fast-drying functional fabric' sports top, which typically sees increased demand as spring progresses (March). Recent demand history shows a significant uptick: Period 4 (158) and Period 5 (191) both exceeded available stock, resulting in lost sales and ending on-hand inventory of 0. The Carry-over insight regarding a 'decreased regime' is now outdated by this recent surge. Promised lead time is 0, and all history confirms actual lead time is 0. With an critical inventory level of 0 and demand trending upwards (avg last 2 weeks = 174.5), I will use an explicit mu_hat forecast of 200 units to account for the stockouts in P4 and P5, and provide a buffer for the seasonal trend. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for the volatility seen in the shift from ~100 to ~190 demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 4: Demand increased from an average of ~125 to >175 units, coinciding with spring seasonality for sports apparel.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU is a 'Wide sports top', and historical data plus recent game history confirm a seasonal uplift as we transition into spring. While the initial pre-game average was around 185, we saw a slump (periods 1-3 avg: 124) followed by a recovery (periods 4-6 avg: 167). The most recent period (P6) had a demand of 152, but P5 was 191. Since this is a sports t-shirt, demand is likely to remain elevated or increase further as weather warms. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (base_stock at the median). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the 'spring' regime (P4-P6 mean: 167) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Note that in P4 and P5 we had stockouts, meaning true demand was likely higher than the 'sold' amount, justifying a focus on the most recent high-demand samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a ladies' sports t-shirt, currently in the spring season (April 1st). Demand has been trending upwards as confirmed by carry-over insights and recent history. Specifically, the last four periods (P4-P7) show demand values of 158, 191, 152, and 211, resulting in a mean of 178 units. The 'In-transit' and 'On-hand' balances are both zero, indicating we stocked out in Period 7 (211 demand vs 167 available). History confirms a reliable lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). Given the stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods, I will use recent_N=4 to capture this elevated spring demand regime while maintaining a high service level through the OR backend's safety stock calculation. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the current volatility in this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 4-7 average demand is 178 units, significantly higher than the early-period average of 124 units. Frequent stockouts suggest demand regularly exceeds supply at current order levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Wide sports top', and current dates (early April) align with spring fitness/sports activity, driving a sustained high-demand regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (Period 4-8) has averaged 186.2 units (158, 191, 152, 211, 219), with multiple stockouts occurring because starting on-hand inventory was lower than actual demand in Periods 4, 5, 7, and 8. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To recover from back-to-back stockouts (ending Period 8 with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit) and meet the rising demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods of data (N=5). This captures the spring regime shift more accurately than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility (standard deviation ~28.5) seen during this peak period, ensuring the base-stock level is high enough to prevent further lost sales given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level offset by the safety factor in the OR logic).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from P4-P8: average demand increased to 186.2 units (+50% vs P1-P3). This period coincides with peak spring demand for sports apparel.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a sports T-shirt (Ladies H&M Sport), and the current date (April 15) falls within the peak spring/early summer demand window for activewear. Analysis of periods 4-9 shows a sustained high-demand regime with an average demand of 181.6 units, compared to the early-period (P1-P3) average of 124 units. We have experienced four stockouts in the last six periods (P4, P5, P7, P8), indicating that supply is not consistently meeting demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To better capture this high-demand regime and minimize stockouts during this seasonal peak, I will use a recent_N strategy for both mu_hat and sigma_hat focused on the last 6 periods (the start of the spring regime). This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level relative to the historical average, which is currently skewed lower by the initial three periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a distinct high-demand regime starting from Period 4, likely driven by spring seasonality for the 'Wide sports top' (IZZY TEE). From Period 4 to Period 10, demand has averaged approximately 173 units, with several instances where demand exceeded on-hand inventory (Periods 4, 5, 7, and 8). Although demand in the last two periods (P9: 159, P10: 125) was slightly lower, the overall spring season remains active. My target is to satisfy this higher demand while accounting for the historical volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current high-demand regime without being overly influenced by the initial low-demand period (P1-P3) or the single lowest recent observation in P10, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat (covering the regime from P4 onwards) and recent_N with N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this specific period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678696001 (Sport T-shirt) is currently in Period 12 (April 29). Demand history shows a distinct peak from Periods 4 through 9 (average demand ~182), which corresponds with spring sports apparel seasonality. However, the last two periods (P10 and P11) have seen a decrease in demand (125 and 120 units respectively), suggesting the peak may be tapering off. Despite these lower realizations, the overall demand since Period 4 remains significantly higher than the initial baseline (approx. 165 avg vs 124). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since Period 11 demand dropped to 120, I will use a window of the last 8 periods (Period 4 through 11) for mu_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime while allowing the recent softening to influence the average. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=8 to account for the high volatility observed in this demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed from Period 10: mean demand dropped to ~123 units from the P4-P9 peak of ~182 units, suggesting a potential end to the peak spring seasonality.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678696001' (Izzy Tee, a sports top) exhibits clear seasonal shifts. Following the peak spring demand period (P4-P9 average demand ~182), we are now in a post-peak softening regime. Observed demand for the last three periods (P10-P12) has been 125, 120, and 115 respectively, averaging 120 units. This decline suggests that the peak seasonality has concluded and demand is stabilizing at a lower level for May. All historic orders (P1-P12) have arrived within the same period (lead_time = 0), so I will continue to assume L=0. I will transition the \u03bc\u0302 forecast to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this most recent post-peak trend (120 units/period) and avoid over-ordering based on the April surge. \u03c3\u0302 will also be set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand softening confirmed from Period 10: demand decreased from a peak average of 182 to a 3-week average of 120 (-34%), indicating end of spring seasonality.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Ladies H&M Sport' T-shirt. Historical demand shows a clear peak from Period 4 through Period 9 (averaging ~182 units) followed by a significant softening starting Period 10. The most recent four periods (P10-P13) have seen demand levels of 125, 120, 115, and 82, averaging ~110 units. The Period 13 demand (82) is the lowest recorded, confirming the end of the spring sports apparel rush as we move into mid-May. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding cost (which equals profit per unit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime. This will allow the OR backend to right-size inventory for the post-peak season while maintaining a balanced service level.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678696001' (Ladies H&M Sport T-shirt) has entered a post-peak demand regime following the spring seasonality. As of Period 15 (May 20), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the March/April peak. Analysis of the last five periods (P10-P14) shows demands of 125, 120, 115, 82, and 81, with a 5-period average of 104.6 and a further drop in the most recent two weeks to ~81. To avoid excess inventory costs given that holding cost equals profit ($1/unit), I am utilizing the recent_N method with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the downward trend while smoothing for the recent drop. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. This strategy ensures we maintain a base stock level that covers the current demand profile while accounting for the lower volatility observed since the peak period ended.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: demand has transitioned from the P10-P12 softening phase (~120 units) to a new lower baseline of ~82 units over the two most recent periods (P13-P14).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678696001 (Sport T-shirt) has entered a clear post-peak demand regime following the spring season. Demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P13: 82, P14: 81, P15: 79), showing very low variance and a mean of approximately 80.7. This is a significant drop from the P4-P9 peak (avg ~186) and the P10-P12 transition (avg ~120). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. Given the high parity between profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should align closely with the expected demand for the next period. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand baseline and minimize ending inventory costs while meeting demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~80 units starting Period 13 (P13-P15 average: 80.7, std: 1.5). This represents a 33% reduction from the previous transitionary period (P10-P12) and a 57% reduction from the peak seasonal demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678696001 (sports T-shirt) has entered a post-peak seasonal phase. Based on history and carry-over insights, the demand has stabilized at a lower mean starting around Period 13. Demand for the last four periods (P13-P16) has been: 82, 81, 79, 73. This averages 78.75 units with very low volatility (std \u2248 4). The current date is June 3rd, transitioning into summer; historically, the spring peak for this functional sports top occurs between March and May. Since the lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period), I will set L=0. I am using recent_N=4 to capture the stabilized lower demand regime precisely. The critical service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand (approximately \u03bc\u0302). Setting N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend uses the current stable regime (~79 units) rather than the heavy spring peaks of >180 units, preventing costly overstocking while maintaining adequate service for the current trend.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678696001' (Ladies H&M Sport T-shirt) has entered a post-peak summer stabilization phase. Recent demand data shows a clear downward trend from the spring peak: P13-P15 averaged ~80 units, and P16-P17 averaged ~62.5 units (73 and 52 respectively). The most recent demand of 52 units suggests the regime is still softening or stabilizing at a lower level for mid-summer. Since lead time is consistently 0 periods, I am focusing on capturing the most recent demand regime. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak environment (P13-P17) while smoothing the volatility of the most recent low reading (52). This provides a baseline of ~73 units per period. With Profit ($1) equal to Holding Cost ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (the median demand), which is appropriate for a basic staple in a non-peak season to minimize excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand transitioned to a lower summer regime starting Period 16: P16-P17 average is 62.5 units, down from the P13-P15 average of 80.7 units (-22%).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678696001 (Wide sports top) is experiencing a transition into a late-spring/early-summer demand regime. Observation of the history shows a clear decline from the spring peak (P4-P9, avg ~182) to a stabilization period (P13-P15, avg ~80), and now a further descent into a lower summer regime starting Period 16. Demand for the last three periods (P16, P17, P18) was 73, 52, and 51 respectively. This indicates the most recent two weeks have stabilized around a mean of ~51.5 units. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level (q = profit / (profit + holding_cost)) is 0.5. To avoid excessive inventory while accommodating the recent drop, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the shift toward ~50-60 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed starting Period 17: demand has stabilized at an average of 51.5 units (P17-P18), representing a ~36% decrease from the P13-P15 average of 80.7 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678696001 (IZZY TEE) is currently in a summer demand regime. Historical demand shows a clear peak in spring (P4-P9 average ~186), followed by a transition in May, and a significant drop as we entered June. In the most recent three periods (P17-P19), demand has recorded 52, 51, and 43 units respectively (mean = 48.7). Current date is June 24th, confirming mid-summer seasonality where demand for this specific 'Wide sports top' has stabilized at a lower level compared to the spring peak. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit at $1.0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this lower summer baseline. This will prevent over-ordering based on the higher historical averages from the spring sales spike.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime further softened and stabilized in June: P17-P19 average demand is 48.7 units, a decrease from the P13-P16 average of ~79 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the IZZY TEE (sports top) has shown a significant downward trend as we move into July, likely due to the end of the peak spring/early summer activewear season. Over the last four periods (P17-P20), demand has dropped from 52 to 19 units, with the most recent observation in Period 20 being a sharp decline to 19 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P18-P20) is 37.7 units, but the most recent figure suggests a deeper softening. To avoid over-ordering during this clear contraction phase, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent decline while acknowledging the P20 outlier. Given the high stockout risk earlier in the year was replaced by a potential excess inventory risk (ending on-hand is currently 30), a slightly conservative mu_hat is appropriate to balance the equal profit and holding costs ($1.0 each). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a new low in Period 20 (19 units), confirming a continued softening of the summer regime compared to the P17-P19 average of 48.7 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678696001' (Ladies H&M Sport T-shirt) is in a clear summer demand decline phase. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 36 units, but the last two periods (P20-P21) have seen a further drop to an average of 17 units (19 and 15 respectively), indicating significant softening in July. Given that the current on-hand inventory is 23 units, it already covers more than the most recent period's demand. I will reflect this updated low-demand regime by using a recent_N method with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, which includes the significant drop to the 15-20 range. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime shift confirmed in Period 21: Demand has dropped significantly to an average of 17 units over P20-P21, down from the early-June average of ~50 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'IZZY TEE' (a sports T-shirt) is experiencing a sharp decline in demand as the summer progresses. Recent demand history shows 43 units (P19), 19 units (P20), 15 units (P21), and 9 units (P22). This confirms a mid-summer demand regime shift where demand has stabilized at a much lower level. The average demand over the last three periods (P20-P22) is approximately 14.3 units. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the low demand and equal profit/holding costs ($1.0), the backend needs to target a base stock roughly equal to the expected demand for the next period plus some variance buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime shift finalized: Average demand stabilized at 14.3 units (P20-P22), representing a significant drop from the early June baseline of ~50 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for the 'Wide sports top' has entered a late-summer terminal decline. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. The demand in the most recent periods shows a clear downward trend: 19 (P20), 15 (P21), 9 (P22), and finally 2 (P23). This represents a shift to a near-zero demand regime as the product likely reaches the end of its seasonal relevance. With 15 units currently on-hand and an expected demand of less than 5 units for the upcoming period, we already have sufficient inventory to cover the target service level (q=0.5). To ensure the OR backend reflects this new regime and avoids over-ordering, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent sharp drop, while maintaining L=0.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer terminal decline confirmed: demand dropped to 2 units in Period 23, following a steady decrease through July (P20-P23 avg: 11.25).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'IZZY TEE' (sports top) has reached its terminal lifecycle phase in late July. Demand has plummeted from a peak of ~180 units in April/May to just 2 units per week over the last two periods (P23-P24). Current on-hand inventory is 13 units, which already covers 6.5 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), and the demand trend is clearly negligible as we approach the end of the summer season, I am setting parameters to cease ordering to minimize further holding costs. Using recent_N=2 for mu_hat captures the 2-unit average, and sigma_hat is set to its minimum (recent_N=2) to reflect low volatility at this low baseline. Lead time remains at the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Terminal demand regime confirmed in late July: demand has bottomed out at 2 units/week (P23-P24). On-hand inventory now significantly exceeds current demand requirements.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a late-summer terminal demand regime. Following the peak spring/early summer season, demand has dropped significantly and stabilized at very low levels. Over the last three periods (P23-P25), demand has been 2, 2, and 4 units respectively (average 2.67). Current on-hand inventory is 9 units, which covers more than three weeks of current average demand. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), it is optimal to maintain minimal inventory to avoid excessive holding costs as the product likely nears the end of its seasonal lifecycle. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this terminal floor, and keeping lead time at the promised 0 periods since all historical orders have arrived within the same period.

Carry-over insight: Terminal demand regime confirmed for August: Period 23-25 average demand is 2.7 units, indicating the product has reached its seasonal floor.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Ladies sport t-shirt) has entered a terminal-low demand phase in August. Demand over the last four periods (P23-P26) has been: 2, 2, 4, 0 (Average: 2.0). On-hand inventory is currently 9 units, which covers more than four weeks of current average demand. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), carrying excess stock is highly detrimental to the total reward. The goal is to avoid any new orders until inventory levels naturally deplete. I will set the lead time to the promised 0 periods and use the most recent 4 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current seasonal floor. The OR backend will see that on-hand inventory (9) already exceeds the base stock level calculated from this low demand, resulting in an order quantity of 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-August demand confirms seasonal floor reached: Period 23-26 average demand is 2.0 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Ladies sport t-shirt) has entered a terminal seasonal decline as we move through late August. Historical demand for the last five periods (P23-P27) has been extremely low: 2, 2, 4, 0, 5 units respectively, yielding a mean of 2.6 units. On-hand inventory is currently 4 units, which actually exceeds the recent weekly average. Given that the promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has consistently been 0, there is no need for large safety stocks. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current seasonal floor. sigma_hat will also be calculated over these 5 periods to capture the low volatility of this terminal phase. This strategy minimizes holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current low-demand environment.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Ladies Sport T-shirt) is in a terminal demand phase as of late August. Historical demand over the last 6 periods has been extremely low: 2, 2, 4, 0, 5, 6 (average ~3.2 units). In Period 28, demand was 6 units but we only had 4 on-hand, leading to a stockout. However, given the seasonal floor and very low volume, we should maintain a minimal base stock. The actual lead time remains 0 based on history. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture this seasonal floor (~3.2 units per period) and sigma_hat using the same window to provide a small buffer for the slight uptick seen in the last two weeks (5 and 6 units).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (IZZY TEE) is currently in a terminal demand phase at the end of the summer season (early September). Since Period 23, demand has consistently been in the single digits, with the Period 23-29 average being 3.0 units. In Period 28, a minor stockout occurred (demand 6, sold 4), and Period 29 demand returned to 2 units. The current on-hand inventory is 2 units. Given the seasonal floor has been reached and the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0) suggests a critical ratio of 0.5, the inventory policy should be conservative to avoid excess holding costs. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this low demand baseline (average ~3 units). L remains at the promised 0 periods as arrivals have been consistently same-period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Ladies H&M Sport T-shirt) is in a terminal late-summer demand phase. Since Period 23 (mid-July), demand has consistently remained below 10 units, with a 4-week average (P27-P30) of 4.5 units. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 following a small stockout in Period 30. Given the consistent seasonal decline confirmed in the carry-over insights, I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect this low-volume floor. Using recent_N=5 captures the behavior of the last 5 weeks (approx. 4 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 0. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*forecast, which is 1 * 4 = 4. sigma_hat is set using recent_N to account for the low volatility in this terminal phase, though the OR backend will apply a base stock logic based on the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (z=0).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Ladies H&M Sport T-shirt) is currently in a stable terminal/low-season demand regime as of mid-September. Recent demand (P28-P31: 6, 2, 5, 6) confirms a slightly higher floor than the late-July/August low of ~2 units, now averaging around 4.75 units per week. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistently reliable. With current on-hand inventory at 0, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this slight uptick in late-season demand while maintaining a low profile to prevent excess holding costs as the season concludes. Sigma_hat is also set using N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer floor confirmation: Demand has stabilized at a slightly higher baseline of ~5 units per week (P28-P31 average: 4.75) compared to the mid-August floor of 2 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Ladies' H&M Sport Jersey Fancy T-shirt) is in a post-summer demand regime. Demand has stabilized at a low baseline of approximately 5 units per week since late August (Period 28-32 average demand: 4.6 units). The seasonal peaks seen in Spring (P4-P9) and stabilization in early Summer (P13-P16) are long past. Current on-hand inventory is 1 unit. Consistent lead time of 0 periods continues to be observed. I will set L to default (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the period from P28 to P32) to capture this stable post-summer demand floor and avoid over-ordering based on historical seasonal highs. This ensures a high service level for the current low-volume period while minimizing holding costs.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a ladies' sports tee, currently in the post-summer/early fall season (September 30). Demand has stabilized at a low baseline relative to the spring peak. Over the last 6 periods (P28-P33), weekly demand has averaged 5.0 units (6, 2, 5, 6, 4, 7). Recent stockouts in Periods 30, 31, and 33 indicate that inventory levels are slightly too lean to cover the small but consistent demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To ensure availability while demand maintains this new low baseline, I will use a recent_N=6 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the stabilization observed since late August while discarding the terminal summer floor (2 units).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is the 'IZZY TEE', a sports t-shirt. After a significant summer seasonal decline where demand bottomed out at 2 units/week in August, we have observed a slight but stable post-summer demand floor. Since Period 28 (late August), demand has stabilized at an average of 4.6 units per week (P28-P34: 6, 2, 5, 6, 4, 7, 2). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods. Given the unit profit equals the unit holding cost ($1.00), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.50, meaning we aim to carry inventory roughly equal to the mean demand. I will use recent_N=7 to capture this post-summer floor (approx. 4.6 units) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed starting Period 28: Demand has stabilized at a new low baseline average of 4.6 units per week (P28-P34), up slightly from the mid-August floor of 2 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Ladies Sport T-shirt) is in a stable post-summer demand regime. Current date is mid-October. Since Period 28, demand has consistently averaged around 4.6 units per week (P28-P35: 6, 2, 5, 6, 4, 7, 2, 3). On-hand inventory is 2 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To maintain the service level for this low-volume, low-margin/high-holding cost product (Profit=1, Holding=1), I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the stabilized demand since the post-summer shift began, which provides a mean of 4.375 units and a standard deviation of 1.9. This allows the OR backend to compute a safety stock that accommodates the slight volatility observed in this low-demand state.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (IZZY TEE) is currently in a stable post-summer low-demand phase. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 4.6 units since Period 28 (P28-P36 range: 2-7 units). The current period is mid-October (2019-10-21). Historically, spring (March-April) saw peak demand (>180 units), while summer (June-July) saw a steady decline to a floor of ~2 units in August. The recent 9-period stretch (P28-P36) shows consistent low-level activity. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of the current regime, I am using a N=9 lookback window (from Period 28 to present) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the entirety of the post-summer stabilization period while excluding the terminal summer decline. Setting L to default (0 periods) as all historical orders have arrived in the same period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678696001' (Ladies Sport T-shirt) is currently in a stable, late-season low-demand regime. Since Period 28, demand has fluctuated between 2 and 7 units, with a mean of approximately 4.5 units per week. The most recent three periods (P35-P37) show consistent demand of 3, 2, and 3 units (average 2.67). Current on-hand inventory is 2 units. Given the holding cost and profit both equal $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which generally suggests keeping just enough stock to cover the expected demand and a small buffer. Based on the stabilization starting at Period 28 (10 periods ago), I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this post-summer baseline. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 4, 2019. Historical data and carry-over insights indicate this product (IZZY TEE) has concluded its peak spring/summer seasonality and settled into a low, stable demand floor. Over the last 11 periods (P28-P38), demand has averaged 4.1 units per week (ranging from 1 to 7). The most recent 3 periods (P36-P38) show even lower demand (2, 3, 1), averaging 2.0 units per week. Given the on-hand inventory of 3 and a promised lead time of 0, current stock covers the expected immediate demand. I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-summer regime. Standard lead time remains 0 as orders consistently arrive in the same period.

The product is in a stable post-summer demand regime. Since Period 28 (Aug 19), demand has consistently hovered at a low baseline. Specifically, over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), average demand is 3.5 units. Recent demand (P35-P39) has further stabilized at an average of 2.2 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 2 units, which nearly covers the current average weekly demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current stable low-demand environment while providing a small buffer for potential minor fluctuations as we move into November.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a stable late-autumn low-demand phase. For SKU 678696001 (Sport T-shirt), demand has remained consistently low since Period 28. Over the last 13 periods (P28-P40), the average demand is 3.5 units. The most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) show an even lower and more stable average of 2.2 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since on-hand inventory is 1 unit and current weekly demand is approximately 2.2 units, the OR backend needs updated parameters to maintain a small buffer without over-ordering. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to reflect this stabilized low demand, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to accurately capture the low volatility of this regime.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn stabilization confirmed: Demand has averaged 2.2 units over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), significantly lower than the early-autumn average of 4.6 units.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678696001' (Izzy Tee) is currently in a late-autumn/winter low-demand regime. Analysis of the most recent demand (P36-P41) shows a stable average of 1.83 units per week (demands: 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 0). The most recent observation (P41) was 0, but maintaining a baseline to cover small spikes is necessary given the high service level requirement. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use the recent_N method with N=6 to capture the current stabilized low-demand regime (P36-P41), ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a small safety buffer, while avoiding excess inventory costs which are significant (Profit=1.0, Holding=1.0).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a sports t-shirt currently in early December (Period 43, 2019/12/2). Historically, this SKU experienced significant seasonality, peaking in spring (P4-P9) with demand ~180 units/week, transitioning through summer to a low baseline. Since Period 41, demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 2.2 units. The most recent demand (P42) was 4 units, but the 3-period average (P40-P42) is 2.33. Stock is currently at 0. Given the low holding cost ($1) and high margin ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To manage terminal season demand while avoiding stockouts on small spikes, I will use a short recent_N window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (approx. 2.3 units per period), and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This ensures we hold just enough stock for the current minimal demand levels.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678696001 (Sport T-shirt) is currently in a very low seasonal demand regime as we approach mid-December. Since Period 36 (past 8 weeks), demand has stabilized at a low floor, averaging 2.0 units per week (total demand 16 units over 8 periods). Specifically, the last 4 periods have seen demands of 0, 4, 1, and 3. The current on-hand inventory is 2 units. With a promised lead time of 0 (consistently held in history), the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover the current period. Given the parity between profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the base stock will target the median demand. I am setting L to 'default' (0) and using 'recent_N' with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-autumn/winter stabilization period (P36-P43), which provides a stable mean of ~2.0 and accounts for the low-volume volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (sports T-shirt) is in a late-autumn/winter low-demand phase. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 1.4 units over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). Given the current date (Dec 16), there is no evidence of a pre-holiday spike for this specific item. On-hand inventory is 1 unit, and lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain a lean inventory and minimize holding costs while covering the expected small demand, \u03bc\u0302 is set based on the most recent 10-period regime (P35-P44), which averages 1.7 units. This provides enough buffer for the base-stock calculation without over-ordering as we approach the end of the year.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a ladies' sports top currently in the late holiday/winter season (Dec 23). Historical data shows demand is highly seasonal, peaking in spring/summer and significantly dropping in autumn/winter. Currently, the SKU is in a very low-demand regime, averaging 1.0 unit from P42-P44, with a slight spike to 8 in P45 (likely due to holiday clearance or last-minute shopping). However, the overall trend since P41 remains extremely low. On-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time of 0, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (P41-P45) which includes the recent spike, providing a conservative buffer. Sigma_hat is also set using recent data to account for the holiday period's higher volatility (std of {0, 4, 1, 1, 8}). Since L=0 is consistently observed, I will stick with the default lead time.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike observed in Period 45 (demand = 8), though the 5-period trailing average (P41-P45) remains low at 2.8 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a ladies' sports top (IZZY TEE). We are currently in Period 47 (Late December/New Year's Eve context). Historical demand data shows this is a highly seasonal product, with peak demand in the spring (reaching ~180+ units/week) and a steady decline into a summer floor. Recent weeks (P42-P46) show demand fluctuations between 1 and 8 units, with the most recent two weeks (P45=8, P46=7) suggesting a potential early 'New Year, New Me' fitness-related spike or holiday clearance activity. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a promised lead time of 0 periods, I need to ensure the base stock covers the anticipated immediate demand. Using recent_N (N=5) for demand captures the current volatility (avg ~4.2 units) better than long-term averages. Lead time has consistently been 0, so \u2018calculate\u2019 is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Early fitness-related demand spike observed in late December: demand increased to an average of 7.5 units over P45-P46, up from the prior 3-week average of 2.0 units.
