Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical data shows a clear upward trend in demand: 0, 0, 14, 47, 29 (mean of non-zero weeks \u2248 30). The product is an 'Everyday Collection' V-neck blouse, which typically sees steady demand but can benefit from maintaining safety stock during the spring transition. Promised lead time (L) is 0. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to tune the forecast to the most recent demand level (averaging 30 units/week) rather than the trailing zeros from January. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the immediate demand of ~30 units with appropriate protection against volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 0, 0, 14, 47, 29 (mean of non-zero weeks is ~30). In Period 1, actual demand was 16. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order of 44 units arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the 0-period lead time for now. On-hand inventory is 28. Given the product category (blouses) and the date (mid-February), we are entering the spring fashion season where demand for 'airy weave' V-neck blouses typically increases. I will use recent_N=3 to capture the recent activity (14, 47, 29) to set the demand forecast, which averages 30. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect demand for (1+0)=1 period. Recent volatility is high, so I'll also use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's V-neck blouse (everyday collection). Current date is 2019-02-25. Observed demand samples are: 0, 0, 14, 47, 29 (pre-game) and 16, 23 (game history). There is a clear demand regime shift starting around 2019-01-21, moving from essentially zero to an average of roughly 25.8 units per week (average of the last 5 active weeks). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods for the first two game rounds, matching the promised lead time. Since the demand has stabilized at a higher level than the early-January zero-demand period, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the active demand period while excluding the initial trailing zeros. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock that covers the current weekly demand plus safety stock for the lead time (L=0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Product transitioned from zero demand (pre-Jan 21) to an active phase averaging ~26 units/week.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'V-neck blouse' is in an active demand phase. Current date is March 4, which is the start of the spring fashion season. Historical demand shows a transition from zero to a mean of approximately 25.8 units over the last 5 weeks (14, 47, 29, 16, 23, 12). However, looking specifically at the game history periods (P1-P3), demand has been 16, 23, and 12, averaging 17. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent_N approach to focus on this active demand behavior rather than the early zero-demand weeks. I'll set N=3 for the mean to capture the most recent realized demand in the environment (17.0) and N=3 for sigma to account for the recent volatility. Setting L to default (0) as evidenced by the perfect arrival history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's v-neck blouse. Current inventory reached 0 in Period 4 after experiencing a demand surge (42 units vs historical average of ~24), resulting in lost sales. Analyzing the demand history (14, 47, 29, 16, 23, 12, 42), there's a recent uptick as we move into March, likely corresponding to Spring season demand for 'airy weave' blouses. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 (capturing the active regime) to set the base stock high enough to account for the recent demand volatility and prevent stockouts. mu_hat will be calculated by the backend as (1+0) * mean of last 5 periods (mean ~23), and sigma_hat will capture the high variance (std ~12) ensuring a protective safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in Mar Period 4: sudden spike to 42 units caused stockout; regime remains active with high variance (mean ~23, std ~12).

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '739953002' (V-neck blouse) is in an active growth phase or high-demand volatility period as we move into March. History shows back-to-back stockouts in Period 4 and Period 5 with demand reaching 42 and 45 units respectively. The average demand across all active periods (starting Period 1) is approximately 28 units, but the last two periods averaged 43.5 units. Given the transition into Spring (late March), I expect this higher demand level to persist or slightly increase. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent jump (averaging ~33 units per week). With L=0, (1+L)mu translates to a base stock targeting this higher tier. On-hand is currently 0, so the OR backend will order to meet this requirement. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility (std of 12, 42, 45 is high), ensuring a sufficient safety stock buffer against ongoing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensified in March: Periods 4 and 5 demand (42, 45) significantly exceeded previous active average (~17), confirming a shift to a higher-velocity regime (avg ~43 recently).

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's blouse, which is entering a peak spring demand period (late March). Historical demand samples from Period 1 to Period 6 show a clear regime shift: initial demand was ~17 units/period, but has spiked to an average of ~43.7 units over the last three weeks (42, 45, 44 units). The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true across all successful arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (5 units), and there are no units in transit. To prevent further stockouts like those seen in Periods 4 and 5, I am setting mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (N=3) to reflect the shift to ~44 units/period. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 periods to capture the volatility of this active spring phase. The chosen parameters aim to maintain a high service level given the $4 profit margin vs $1 holding cost, which justifies holding safe stock during this seasonal peak.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a v-neck blouse (Womens Everyday Collection). Current date is April 1st, entering the spring season where demand for airy blouses typically increases. History confirms a significant demand escalation: Feb avg ~17 units, Mar avg ~47 units. The last period (Period 7) saw the highest demand yet at 56 units, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time is consistently 0. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher March/April demand regime (averaging approx 47 units/week) while setting L=0 as promised. This ensures the base stock covers current weekly demand plus safety stock for the high volatility observed (std is rising). Holding cost is $1 vs $4 profit, justifying a relatively aggressive service level (80%) computed by the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed into April: Demand has consistently risen throughout March, moving from an avg of ~17 in Feb to ~47 in Mar/early April (+175% increase).

Daily Reward (R_t): $212.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 739953002 is experiencing a significant demand surge as we enter April. In Period 8, demand reached a high of 81 units, which led to another stockout as it exceeded the 53 units ordered. This confirms a continuing upward trend (Period 6: 44, Period 7: 56, Period 8: 81). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle the high growth and prevent further stockouts, I am switching to an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat. Given the recent demand was 81 and the trend is clearly accelerating, I will forecast 90 units for the next period. This ensures that the base stock level (target on-hand) is high enough to meet this rising demand while acknowledging the risk of high variance evidenced by the standard deviation in the active regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Period 8 demand hit 81 units, representing a ~45% increase over the previous high in Period 7 (56 units). The product is in a high-growth phase coinciding with mid-Spring.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Women's V-neck blouse) is in the middle of April, which has shown significantly higher demand than February/March. After a extreme peak of 81 units in Period 8, Period 9 saw a cooling to 41 units. However, we must remain prepared for Spring demand spikes. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods as observed in all historical 'conclude' messages. To avoid over-correcting to the extreme outlier of 81 while still capturing the recent growth (March/April average), I will use the mean of the last 4 periods (Periods 6-9: 44, 56, 81, 41) for mu_hat, which equals 55.5 units per period. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the forecast for the review period (1+L=1). Volatility is high due to the recent demand swings, so I will use the standard deviation of the last 4 active periods to provide an appropriate safety stock buffer through sigma_hat.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Women's V-neck blouse) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime as we move into late April. Since Period 6, demand has been significantly higher than the early-year baseline, ranging between 40 and 81 units. The surge observed in Period 8 (81 units) was followed by a stabilization in Period 9 (41 units) and Period 10 (40 units), suggesting a current regime mean of approximately 54 units (average of periods 6-10). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. On-hand inventory is 31 units. To ensure we cover the current week's demand while accounting for the recent high volatility (std dev ~17.5 in this active regime), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stabilized high-demand level, and sigma_hat similarly to handle the variance of this specific period. This will signal the OR backend to maintain a base stock that prevents the frequent stockouts seen in March/April, balanced against a holding cost logic where profit is 4x the holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late April: Following the Period 8 peak of 81 units, the last two periods (9 and 10) have settled around 40-41 units, bringing the 5-period average to ~52 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand for this v-neck blouse shows a peak in early April (81 units) followed by a cooling trend in the last three periods (41, 40, 28). This suggests the late-Spring surge is beginning to taper off. I am transitioning the forecast from the high-growth phase to a more stable, slightly lower regime. The last 3 periods average ~36 units, but given the recent drop to 28, I will use a recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend of 40-50 units while acknowledging the slowdown. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory of 39 is sufficient to cover about one week of current demand. I will set mu_hat using the 4 most recent samples (yielding an average of ~47.5 per period) to ensure enough stock is ordered if demand rebounces slightly or stabilizes, while sigma_hat will reflect the recent variability to maintain a reasonable safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering observed in late April: Post-peak demand has decreased from ~54 (P7-P9) to ~34 (P10-P11), indicating the Spring peak has passed.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Historical demand for this blouse showed a significant peak in April (Period 8, 81 units) and has since settled into a lower, more stable regime. The last three periods of demand (Periods 10, 11, and 12) were 40, 28, and 43 respectively, averaging approximately 37 units. This indicates that while the high-spring surge has passed, demand remains robust. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the post-peak mean (currently averaging ~46 over the last 5 periods) to balance the risk of another spike against the holding costs. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current moderated volatility compared to the high-growth period.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-April peak (P8) has stabilized: Period 10-12 average is ~37 units, down from the P7-P9 average of ~59 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. We are managing a women's V-neck blouse, which saw a peak in demand during the spring (late March/early April, reaching 81 units). Since Period 10 (mid-April), demand has stabilized significantly. The last four periods (P10-P13) have recorded demands of 40, 28, 43, and 42. This indicates a stable post-peak regime with a four-period average of 38.25 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. mu_hat will be set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this stabilized May demand level (~38 units per period). sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current volatility (std ~6.8). This configuration ensures we maintain sufficient stock for the current 40-unit demand level while avoiding excessive inventory as the spring season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in May: Period 10-13 demand averages 38.25 units (range 28-43), confirming the end of the high-growth April phase.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's blouse, which has transitioned from a high-growth April peak (peaking at 81 units in Period 8) into a stabilized late-Spring regime. In the most recent four periods (P11-P14), demand has been 28, 43, 42, and 47, demonstrating a stable mean of approximately 40 units per week. The ending inventory for Period 14 was 0, meaning there was a slight stockout (demand 47 vs supply 45). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed). I will use a N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to capture this stable post-peak regime (P10-P14), which averages 40 units per week. Using recent_N captures the stabilization better than the full history, which includes zero-demand weeks and the extreme April spike.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '739953002' (V-neck blouse) is currently in a steady-to-rising demand phase during late May. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Analyzing recent demand: Period 14 (47 units) and Period 15 (52 units) show an uptick compared to the Period 10-13 average of ~38 units. Demand has outstripped inventory for the last two periods, resulting in stockouts. To prevent further lost sales while managing a relatively high holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($4/unit), I will adjust mu_hat to capture the most recent 4-period window (P12-P15) which reflects this May growth (avg ~46 units). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility (range 42-52) observed during this phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-velocity phase through late May (P14-P15): recent demand average has increased to ~49.5 over the last two weeks, exceeding the early May stabilization level of ~38.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for this V-neck blouse has remained consistently high throughout May, with the last three periods recording demand of 47, 52, and 44 units respectively. This indicates a sustained high-velocity regime with a 3-period average of 47.7 units. The product frequently stocks out (ending on-hand inventory was 0 or near 0 in 4 out of the last 6 periods), suggesting that current stock levels are barely meeting demand with no safety buffer. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain service levels during this June period and avoid stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand state (~48 units). Using N=3 focuses the OR backend on the most recent May activity where demand intensified compared to early May.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained through May: Average demand for P14-P16 is ~48 units, which is 26% higher than the early May average of ~38 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The latest period (P17) saw a demand of 27 units, which is a significant drop compared to the previous three-week average of ~48 units (P14-P16). This suggests that the high-velocity phase observed throughout May is potentially cooling as we enter June. Over the last four periods (P14-P17), demand was 47, 52, 44, and 27, resulting in a 4-period average of 42.5. Given the sharp drop to 27, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this dampening effect while still acknowledging the recent high volume. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 25 units. Setting mu_hat using N=4 and sigma_hat using N=4 will allow the OR backend to adjust to the lower demand observation while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the high variance (std of recent demand is ~11).

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering observed in early June: Period 17 demand (27) is 44% lower than the P14-P16 average of 48, suggesting the late Spring/May peak is subsiding.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (mid-June). Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and sales. Demand analysis: Period 18 saw demand rebound to 43 units after a dip to 27 in Period 17. Looking at the broader trend since May (P14-P18), demand has been 47, 52, 44, 27, 43, averaging 42.6 units per week. The Carry-over insights suggested a tapering in early June, but P18 data suggests demand remains robust for this V-neck blouse in mid-June. I will set L to 'calculate' (historically 0). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the last 5 weeks) to capture this late-Spring/early-Summer level of ~43 units/week. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current volatility (std dev ~9.3). This ensures we maintain a base stock high enough to service demand in the high 40s while accounting for the recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains active in mid-June: Period 18 demand (43) suggests the early June dip (27) was a single-period outlier rather than a sustained downward trend; 5-period average (P14-P18) is ~43 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Historical demand for the last five periods (P15-P19) has been 52, 44, 27, 43, and 30, averaging 39.2 units. This level of demand suggests that while the late May peak has indeed subsided, the 'summer' steady-state remains around 35-40 units rather than returning to early-year lows. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as seen in all concluded periods. To capture this post-spring stabilization, I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent volatility (27 vs 43) while acknowledging that demand has cooled since the May peaks (49.5 avg in P14-P15). The inventory position (21 on-hand) is currently low relative to one week of expected demand (~39 units), so the OR backend will likely trigger an order to bring stock levels back to the desired base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in June: Post-May peak, demand in P17-P19 (27, 43, 30) indicates a shift to a lower steady-state average of ~33 units compared to the May average of ~48 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Post-spring/early summer peaks, the demand for this airy v-neck blouse (SKU 739953002) has stabilized at a lower level. Over the last four periods (P17-P20), demand has been 27, 43, 30, and 22 units respectively, averaging 30.5 units per week. This aligns with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 20 indicating a shift to a lower steady-state. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this lower-demand regime, I will use a recent window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current June/July run rate of ~30-31 units per week.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late June/early July: Average demand for P17-P20 is ~30.5 units, confirming a sustained 36% decrease from the May average of ~48 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's V-neck blouse (739953002) has stabilized in a lower-velocity regime following its Spring peaks. Historically, the demand peaked in April (P8: 81 units) and again in late May (P15: 52 units). Since Period 17 (early June), demand has settled into a range of 22-43 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21: 27, 43, 30, 22, 25) is 29.4 units, confirming a shift away from the ~48 unit average seen in May. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. With on-hand inventory at 14 units and a current average demand of ~30, the OR backend needs to stock up to cover current demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower-velocity June/July regime accurately while accounting for the moderate volatility observed (std dev of ~8 units).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product (Womens Blouse) has transitioned from its Spring peak (March-May) into a more stable Summer demand regime. Demand over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) has been 27, 43, 30, 22, 25, and 33, averaging 30.0 units. This confirms the previously noted carry-over insight that the demand has stabilized at a lower level (~30-33 units) compared to the high-velocity May phase (~48 units). Actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods as per the history. I will use N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this newer, stabilized Summer regime while discounting the volatile Spring peaks. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+L)*std based on these 6 periods will allow the OR backend to target a service level appropriate for the 4:1 reward-to-cost ratio (75-80% service level) without overstocking based on outdated seasonal data.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's blouse in late July (Period 24). Historical demand shows several distinct regimes: a spring peak in April (avg ~60), a secondary peak in May (avg ~48), and a subsequent stabilization in June/July. The most recent demand (P21-P23) has been 25, 33, and 42, showing a slight upward trend or resurgence from the June stabilization level of ~30. The Period 23 demand (42) resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Given the stockout and the slight upward trend, I will use a recent window of 7 periods (covering the stabilized period from Period 17 onwards) to capture the current mean while allowing the backend to account for the recent volatility. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in July: Period 23 demand (42) is significantly higher than the late June average (~30), necessitating a buffer against stockouts during mid-summer.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Historical lead time for this SKU has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive same-period). The demand regime has stabilized following the May peak, showing fluctuating but generally lower demand in late June and July. Specifically, the last four periods (P21-P24) show demand of 25, 33, 42, and 24, resulting in a mean of 31 units with a standard deviation of approximately 8. This supports the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 21 indicating a shift to a lower steady-state average of ~30.5 units, although Period 23 was a brief volatility event. Given the current on-hand inventory of 15 and the target of covering demand for (L+1)=1 period, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period regime to capture this stabilized summer demand. Sigma_hat is also set to the recent 4 periods to account for the mid-July volatility observed in Period 23 while maintaining a lean inventory level consistent with a $1 holding cost vs $4 profit margin.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early August (Period 26). Historical demand analysis shows a relatively stable but volatile summer regime. July demand (Periods 21-25) was [25, 33, 42, 24, 41], averaging 33 units with significant fluctuation. The most recent demand (P25) was 41, and we ended with 0 on-hand inventory. Given the product is a 'V-neck blouse in an airy weave' (Womens Everyday Collection), it remains seasonally relevant for August. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use a recent_N window of 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current summer volatility and mean (~33 units). This covers the most relevant recent regime length as noted in the carry-over insights for July.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-August (Period 27). Demand has shown a significant upward surge over the last four periods (Periods 23-26: 42, 24, 41, 61), with the most recent demand (61) being the highest since the April peak. This suggests a late-summer/pre-fall transition spike for the feminine blouse category. The previous 'stabilized' regime of ~30 units (June/July) is no longer valid. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat captures this new high-demand trajectory (avg ~42), while recent_N=6 for sigma_hat (including several volatile periods) ensures the OR engine accounts for the high variance (std ~15) to prevent recurring stockouts. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all history 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand surge confirmed in August: Demand increased from a June/July average of ~31 to 61 units by Period 26 (+97% increase), suggesting a seasonal shift or pre-fall ramping.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 739953002 (V-neck blouse) is experiencing a massive late-summer demand surge. Demand in Period 27 hit 118 units, nearly double the previous period's high of 61 and far exceeding the average. This indicates a very strong seasonal shift or promotional event. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent significant stockouts during this high-velocity phase, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use an 'explicit' value of 130 to reflect the current upward trajectory and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering based on older, lower-demand data. Similarly, sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' 40 to account for the heightened volatility observed in August (moving from 41 to 61 to 118). L remains at 'calculate' as lead time is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Major demand surge confirmed in mid-August: Demand skyrocketed from 61 (P26) to 118 (P27), indicating a secondary seasonal peak or significant shift in product velocity.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late August (2019/8/26). Recent history shows a massive demand spike in mid-August (P27: 118 units), followed by a significant drop in Period 28 (39 units). The current on-hand inventory is 125 units. While Period 27 suggested a high-growth phase, Period 28 indicates that demand might be highly volatile or that the spike was a single-event peak. However, given the product description (a long-sleeved blouse), we should expect demand to remain higher than the summer average as we transition into the Fall season. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering after the recent volatility while still protecting against another spike, I will use a recent_N strategy for both demand and volatility. Setting N=3 captures the recent surge and the subsequent cool-down (61, 118, 39), resulting in an average of ~72.6 units. This provides a safe base stock level to satisfy potentially high Fall demand without excessive holding cost, especially since current on-hand is already substantial.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in late August: Period 27 saw a massive spike to 118 units, but Period 28 dropped to 39 units. The new regime (P26-P28) averages ~73 units, reflecting a shift to higher autumnal velocity despite high variance.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (2019/9/2). Recent demand history (P26-P29: 61, 118, 39, 61) shows a significant shift to a high-velocity but highly volatile regime. The 'v-neck blouse' is likely benefiting from a transition into fall fashion. Although demand dropped to 39 in P28, it rebounded to 61 in P29, confirming the regime average is much higher than the summer baseline. The average of the last 4 periods is approximately 70 units. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new mean (~70) and incorporate the high variance (std ~34) to maintain a safety buffer against the massive spikes observed lately (like the 118 units in P27). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0. With 64 units on hand and 0 in transit, the OR backend needs updated parameters to ensure base stock covers the current high-growth phase.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a high-velocity autumn regime (Late August/September). Recent demand (P26-P30) has been 61, 118, 39, 61, and 67, resulting in a 5-period average of 69.2 units per week. Although there were stockouts in P26 and P27, P28-P30 suggest demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to the summer. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this heightened autumnal velocity and volatility, which provides an updated mean of ~69 and accounts for the high variance (std ~29) seen in the last few weeks. This will ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent stockouts during this sustained high-demand phase while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized in September: Average demand for P26-P30 is ~69 units, confirming a sustained shift from the July/August average of ~38 units (+80% increase).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is currently in a high-velocity Autumn regime (September), which historically matches the seasonal description of a 'velvety-smooth finish' blouse consistent with fall fashion cycles. Demand has consistently increased from late August through early September, with the last two periods showing 67 and 80 units respectively. The average demand for the last five periods (P27-P31) is ~73 units with high volatility (standard deviation ~29), driven by a massive spike in P27. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend targets an ~80% service level. To capture the recent upward trend while acknowledging the volatility of the Autumn peak, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach captures the recent surge (avg ~73) without being overly skewed by the single P27 outlier (118) or the low P28 (39). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed in September: Demand in P30-P31 (67, 80) is 90% higher than the July/early August average (~38), following the initial surge in late August.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a sustained high-velocity autumn regime (September). Demand in the last three periods (P30-P32) has been 67, 80, and 60 respectively, resulting in a 3-period average of 69 units. This is consistent with the 'Autumn demand regime' identified in Carry-over Insights from Period 31. The product (V-neck blouse) typically sees continued strength through late autumn. While the previous period (P32) saw a slight dip to 60, it remains significantly above summer levels. Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current autumnal baseline (P28-P32: 39, 61, 67, 80, 60; avg ~61.4), which provides a stable yet high target for the OR backend to maintain service levels during this active phase while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat) seen in late August/September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 739953002 is currently in its autumn peak season. In Period 33, demand spiked significantly to 135 units, which is a new record for the product, far exceeding the recent (P30-P32) average of ~69 units. This spike resulted in a stockout (ending on-hand inventory = 0). Given the date (late September), we are likely at the height of the transition to fall/winter apparel. The target stocking level needs to account for this higher velocity and volatility (135 units is over 2x the standard mean). I will use a conservative recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this upward trend while damping the single-period spike, but I'll increase L to 0 (promised) as arrivals remain consistent. I'm prioritizing a high service level to avoid another costly stockout during this peak phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified in late September: Period 33 demand reached a record 135 units, a 100% increase over the September average (~69), confirming extreme volatility in the current high-velocity regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is currently in a high-velocity autumn regime (September/October). Demand in the last five periods (P30-P34) has been 67, 80, 60, 135, and 70, averaging 82.4 units per week, which is significantly higher than the previous July/August average. Period 33's record demand of 135 units followed by 70 in Period 34 suggests that while the extreme peak might be softening, the baseline remains high. Inventory levels (38 units on-hand) are insufficient to cover even the average weekly demand in this regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts in this high-growth phase, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the autumn mean and standard deviation, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the elevated demand and its inherent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized (P30-P34): average demand is ~82 units, a 115% increase over the July/early August average (~38), despite high weekly variance (range 60-135).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Women's V-neck blouse) is currently in an Autumn high-velocity regime. After an extreme peak in Period 33 (135 units), demand has moderated but remains significantly higher than summer levels, with Period 34 and 35 recording 70 and 57 units respectively. The average demand for the 'Autumn regime' (P30-P35) is approximately 78 units. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory (51) is below the recent average demand and the product displays high volatility (sigma), I will setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods (the duration of the current Autumn regime) to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for these higher seasonal volumes and prevents stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs as demand begins to potentially stabilize post-peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand moderation: Following the P33 peak (135), demand in P34-P35 (70, 57) suggests a stabilization around ~64 units, though still within the high-velocity Autumn regime (P30-P35 avg ~78).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal peak in late September (P33: 135 units), which has since moderated into October (P34-P36 demand: 70, 57, 50). The product is a v-neck blouse (blouse/garment), which typically sees high velocity during seasonal transitions (Autumn/Spring) and stabilizes as seasons set in. The average demand for the last three periods is 59 units, down from the 6-period Autumn average of ~78 units (P30-P35). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the OR backend targets an 80% service level. Setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) captures the recent deceleration from the peak while maintaining sufficient coverage for the current October regime (~54 units/week baseline). Sigma_hat using the same recent window accounts for the high historical variance observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime moderation confirmed in October: Average demand for P34-P36 is ~59 units, compared to the September high-velocity average of ~82 units (-28% decrease).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The product (Womens Blouse) is exiting its high-velocity Autumn regime (Sep-Oct). Demand has systematically moderated over the last four periods (70, 57, 50, 33), with Period 37 showing a significant drop to 33 units. This confirms the 'moderatation' trend identified in the Carry-over Insights for Period 37. To reflect this shift and avoid excessive holding costs as we likely enter a quieter late-Autumn/early-Winter phase, I am selecting a recent_N window of 4 periods for mu_hat (averaging ~52.5) and sigma_hat. This captures the downward trend more effectively than a larger window. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, allowing for 'calculate' or 'default' behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation confirmed through late October: Period 37 demand (33) fell 44% below the P34-P36 average (~59), indicating a transition out of the high-velocity Autumn peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '739953002' (Womens V-neck blouse) is currently in a transitional demand phase. Historically, it experienced an Autumn peak in September (averaging ~82 units/week with a high of 135) and a subsequent moderation in October (averaging ~59 units/week). Period 38 saw a sudden spike in demand to 83 units, contradicting the downward trend seen in the previous three periods (70, 57, 50, 33). This volatility (33 to 83) suggests we cannot yet assume a low-demand winter regime. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' ordering based on the projected base stock. To account for the recent resurgence in demand while acknowledging the broader moderation trend, I will use a recent_N strategy with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the October moderation and the Period 38 spike (P34-P38 demand: 70, 57, 50, 33, 83), resulting in a mean demand estimate of 58.6 units. Given the high profit to holding cost ratio ($4 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level, which is appropriate given the 0 on-hand status.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in late October/early November: After a period of moderation (reaching a low of 33 in P37), Period 38 demand reached 83 units (+150% increase), indicating sustained autumn/winter velocity or a secondary seasonal surge.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P37-P39: 33, 83, 54) shows high weekly volatility as we move into November. The product, a V-neck blouse, is currently in a sustained active regime following its autumn peak. While demand moderated to 33 in P37, it surged back to 83 in P38 and 54 in P39, creating a recent average of approximately 56.6 units (last 3 periods). Given that we are entering mid-November, we must maintain a sufficient base stock to cover the volatility observed in the recent spikes (e.g., P38). I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 to capture the shift from the October moderation into the current November velocity (average ~55 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0, allowing for same-period replenishment. Current inventory (21) is low following the P38/P39 demand, so the OR backend will trigger a meaningful order to restore the base stock level.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product (Womens Blouse) has entered a more stabilized demand phase following the extreme highs of September (avg ~82) and early autumn. Analysis of recent periods shows a stabilized demand regime: Period 39 (54) and Period 40 (42) suggest a mean around 48 units. While Period 38 saw a spike (83), the overall trend from Period 34 to current is moderating. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat (P34-P40) which captures the post-peak autumn performance (mean ~55.5) to ensure we cover potential late November/early December pre-holiday movement without over-stocking based on the single extreme spike in P38. Lead time remains consistently at 0, which is confirmed by every concluded period except the stockout instances where the system could not deliver full demand. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to account for high variance observed during this transition period (range 33-83).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in November: Period 34-40 average demand is ~55.5 units, reflecting a moderate decrease from the high-velocity September peak (~82) but remaining significantly above the summer average (~31).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product (a V-neck blouse) is entering the late autumn/early winter period. Looking at the demand history since the late September peak (P33), we see a stabilization and slight softening. Period 34-41 history shows demand values of 70, 57, 50, 33, 83, 54, 42, 31. This results in an 8-period average of ~52.5. However, there's a visible downward trend in the last three periods (54, 42, 31), which is consistent with the post-autumn peak moderation noted in the carry-over insights. To avoid over-stocking during this tapering phase while respecting the occasional volatility (like the 83 in P38), I will use the last 5 periods (P37-P41) to capture the most recent mean (~48.2) and volatility. The inventory position is currently 39 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Since lead time is consistently 0, the order will arrive this period. Setting parameters based on recent_N=5 captures the late-year shift without being overly influenced by the high September volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed into late November: Period 39-41 demand (54, 42, 31) shows a steady decline following the secondary spike in late October.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand exploded to 315 units, far exceeding any historical peak (previous max was 135). This massive spike (~10x the previous period) likely represents a Black Friday / Cyber Monday event given the date (2019/11/25). Historically, demand for this blouse has shown high volatility with secondary peaks (e.g., Period 33 record of 135 followed by a drop). However, current on-hand inventory is 0. With L=0 confirmed consistently, I need to set parameters to recover from the stockout and prepare for potential holiday sustained demand, even if Period 42 was a single-point anomaly. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this outlier without letting it skew a long-term average too aggressively, while still ensuring the OR 'cap' allows a substantial order to refill the pipeline. I'm setting mu_hat based on a blend of the recent high (315) and the previous regime (~55), while keeping sigma_hat high to reflect the extreme uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Extreme demand spike confirmed in late November (P42): demand hit 315 units (approx. 600% of the previous 7-period average), likely tied to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional activity.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday period (December 9). Period 42 saw a massive spike of 315 units, followed by a sustained high demand of 144 units in Period 43. This high volume is typical for early December holiday shopping for apparel (a V-neck blouse). While demand has decreased from the peak of 315, 144 units still represents a ~200% increase over the November baseline (~50 units). I will use a 3-period average (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture this high-velocity holiday regime (Periods 41-43: (31 + 315 + 144)/3 \u2248 163 per week), which ensures we have enough stock for the remaining peak weeks of December. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the extreme volatility observed during this promotional/seasonal window. On-hand inventory is currently 91 units.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: Period 42-43 demand (315, 144) confirms a high-velocity December regime averaging ~230 units, significantly elevated from the November baseline of ~50 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 739953002 (Womens V-neck blouse) is currently in a highly volatile holiday demand period. Period 42 saw a massive spike of 315 units (Black Friday), followed by 144 units in Period 43. Period 44 demand dropped significantly to 29 units, suggesting the initial holiday surge has cooled or we're seeing post-peak stabilization. However, historical data from similar spring/autumn transitions suggests high variance. Current on-hand inventory is 255. With a lead time (L) of 0, our base stock calculation needs to cover the current period's demand. The recent 3-period average is (315+144+29)/3 \u2248 162.7. Given the sharp drop in P44, using a 5-period average (P40-P44) gives (42+31+315+144+29)/5 = 112.2, which is more balanced. I will set mu_hat to a more conservative level to avoid overstocking while holding a significant buffer. The OR engine's service level logic (profit $4 vs holding $1) inherently targets a high service level (80th percentile), so adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) captures the high-velocity holiday regime while acknowledging the recent drop.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: Period 44 demand dropped to 29 after a two-week surge (P42: 315, P43: 144), indicating the primary promotional peak has passed but maintaining a high-velocity baseline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. We are in the final week before Christmas. Historical demand shows a high-velocity holiday regime: Period 42 (Black Friday) demand was 315, followed by 144, 29, and most recently 196 in Period 45. The drop to 29 in Period 44 appears to be a mid-promotional lull or data artifact, as Period 45 rebounded strongly to 196. Since this is the week of Christmas, I anticipate high demand as shoppers complete holiday purchases, though it may begin to taper immediately after. The average demand for the 'Holiday Surge' (P42-P45) is 171 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this high-velocity regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure sufficient stock for the final holiday push and to buffer against the extreme volatility (315 vs 29) observed this month. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P45) average is 171 units, characterized by extreme volatility (std ~120) and peaks associated with Black Friday and pre-Christmas shopping.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the post-Christmas and pre-New Year's Eve period. Looking at the history, the 'Holiday demand regime' (P42-P46) has shown extreme volatility (std ~120) with demand values of 315, 144, 29, 196, and 71. The average for this holiday period is approximately 151 units per week. However, demand typically drops significantly in the first week of January after the holiday peak. I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=5 (P42-P46) to capture the high-velocity baseline while acknowledging that the OR backend will use the high volatility (sigma_hat) to protect against unexpected leftover holiday demand. On-hand inventory is currently high (200 units), which will naturally lead to a smaller order or no order to avoid high holding costs as we transition out of the holiday season. The lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday demand stabilization: Period 46 demand (71) and Period 44 (29) suggest that while the primary promotional spikes (P42-P43) have passed, the regime remains significantly more volatile than the November baseline.
