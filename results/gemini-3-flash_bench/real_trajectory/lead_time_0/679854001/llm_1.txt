Given the current date (February 11, 2019), we are in the late winter/early spring transition. Historical data from January shows a mean weekly demand of approximately 4.8 units (1, 6, 7, 5, 5). Demand for thin knitwear and cardigans typically remains steady or slightly increases as customers look for layering pieces during the transition to spring. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive in this same period and be available for this period's demand. I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. To satisfy the expected demand of ~5-7 units plus a small safety buffer for potential spring uptick, I will order 8 units. If the lead time is indeed 0, these will cover the current period's demand immediately.",

Historical data from early 2019 (Jan 7 - Feb 4) showed very low demand (avg ~5 units/week). However, once the game started in Feb 11, we saw a massive surge: Period 1 demand was 18 and Period 2 demand was 79. This indicates a significant regime shift, likely due to spring collection launches or marketing activity within the 'Divided' collection. Current on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. The confirmed lead time is 0 periods (same-day arrival). In Period 2, we stocked 18 but demand was 79, resulting in 61 lost sales. Since the lead time is 0, the order I place now will satisfy Period 3 demand. I will forecast demand for Period 3 to be around 80 units based on the Period 2 spike, aiming to capture the full sales potential while being mindful that holding costs ($1.0) and profit ($1.0) are equal, though lost sales are more detrimental to total reward in this high-growth phase.",

The actual demand in P14 was 114, which caught our conservative order of 21 off-guard. With May 20th approaching (Period 15) and entering late spring/early summer, we expect demand to continue its high-variance descent. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Inventory is currently 0.

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Maja Cardigan' (knitwear/long-sleeved). We are currently in mid-December (2019/12/16). Demand history shows a late November spike to 84 (Black Friday), followed by stability in early December (33 and 35 units). This establishes a post-peak seasonal regime significantly higher than the mid-November low of ~20, but lower than the autumn peak. Given the zero-period lead time, I aim to maintain sufficient inventory for the current period while accounting for potential final holiday-related fluctuations. Current on-hand is 12. Recent demand is ~35. I will order 33 units to target a total available inventory of 45, which covers the current regime plus a small buffer for late-December volatility, while minimizing holding costs as we approach the end of the year.",
  "carry_over_insight": "December demand regime has stabilized following the Black Friday spike: Period 43 (33 units) and Period 44 (35 units) confirm a steady baseline approximately 65% higher than the mid-November seasonal trough.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-Christmas week. Historically, the 'Maja Cardigan' (H&M Divided collection, recycled polyester knit) saw a significant Black Friday spike (84 units) followed by a stabilized December baseline around 30-35 units (P43: 33, P44: 35). Period 45 demand softened slightly to 27 units, likely as shipping cut-offs for pre-holiday online orders approached or store foot traffic shifted towards last-minute gifting. Given that we are now in the week of Christmas, I expect demand to remain steady or slightly decrease as the primary shopping window closes, though some late-season demand or post-Christmas clearance/gift-card usage could maintain recent levels. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 18 units. I will target an order that brings total available stock to 35 units to satisfy expected demand while minimizing holding costs for the post-holiday period.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The current date is December 30, 2019, which marks the final period of the game. For SKU 679854001 (Maja Cardigan), the product is in a stable post-holiday/winter demand regime following the late November Black Friday spike. Recent demand figures for December have been 33, 35, 27, and 31 units, indicating a consistent baseline average of approximately 31.5 units per week. The lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods, meaning any order placed now will arrive in time to satisfy this period's demand. We currently have 4 units on-hand. To meet the expected demand of ~32 units while minimizing ending inventory (and thus holding cost) for the final period, an order of 28 units is required (32 expected demand - 4 on-hand = 28). This strategy aims to satisfy demand while aiming for an ending inventory as close to zero as possible given this is the last period.",
