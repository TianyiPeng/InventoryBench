Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 679854001, a 'Maja Cardigan' (knitwear). The product is a soft cardigan, which is highly relevant for the current late winter/early spring season. Historical demand for the last five weeks (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows values of 1, 6, 7, 5, 5. The mean of these samples is 4.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 2.28. Given the product type and the time of year, we expect demand to remain steady or slightly increase as customers look for layering pieces for the transition into spring. With a promised lead time of 0 periods, an on-hand inventory of 0, and no units in-transit, we need to establish a baseline order. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (the full sample set provided) to capture the current demand regime. Setting L to 'default' (0) reflects the promised lead time until evidence suggests otherwise. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base-stock level that balances the $1.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the history, demand in Period 1 was 18 units, which significantly exceeds the initial samples from Jan/early Feb (mean of ~4.8). This suggests a demand jump as we move further into February, possibly due to seasonal transition or increased interest in this specific knitwear item (Maja Cardigan). The actual lead time for Period 1 was 0, matching the promised lead time. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we have no units in transit (the Period 1 order arrived and sold out immediately), we need to set parameters that reflect this higher demand level. I will use the last 5 samples (including the high Period 1 demand) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick with the default (0) lead time as confirmed by Period 1's arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Maja Cardigan' is experiencing a major demand surge as it transitions from late winter into spring. Historical pre-game demand was low (avg ~4.8), but actual Period 1 and 2 demand (18 and 79) shows a massive trend. Period 2 demand (79) is likely driven by the start of the spring shopping season. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). With Profit and Holding cost equal ($1.0), the targeted service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median. However, since the current inventory is 0 and we are missing out on significant sales (sold=9 out of 79 demand in P2), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the momentum. I expect Period 3 demand to meet or exceed Period 2, so I set mu_hat (for 1+L = 1 period) at 85 to capture this growth. Sigma is set to 25 to allow for the high volatility observed in the jump from 18 to 79.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: Demand jumped from an average of ~5 to 18 (P1) and then to 79 (P2) as spring season begins. Lead time is stable at 0 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 4 (2019-03-04). Analyzing the recent demand for the 'Maja Cardigan' (a spring/knitwear item): P1=18, P2=79, P3=56. Pre-regime shift (Jan-early Feb) average was ~4.8. The carry-over insight correctly identified the shift, but the demand peak appears to have occurred in P2 (79) followed by a slight softening in P3 (56). Given the item is a cardigan and we are in early March, demand is expected to remain high but potentially stabilize as it moves past the initial spring launch spike. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 29. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit), I will use the mean of the three periods in the new regime (18, 79, 56) to set mu_hat, which averages to ~51. Since lead time L=0, the backend calculates (1+0)*mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to capture the high volatility seen during this transition.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Maja Cardigan', a seasonal knitwear item. As of March 11 (Period 5), we are entering the peak spring season. Historical demand shows a massive jump from the initial baseline (~5 units/week) to a much higher regime: Period 1 (18), Period 2 (79), Period 3 (56), and Period 4 (71). The average demand over the last four weeks is ~56 units, but with significant volatility (std dev ~27). In Period 4, we stocked out because the system under-ordered (only 22 ordered when demand was 71), leaving us with 0 on-hand. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture this new high-demand regime for both mean and variance while providing enough stock to recover from the current stockout and meet the expected spring demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 2: Average weekly demand increased from ~5 to ~56 units (+1000%) following the start of the spring season.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Maja Cardigan TVP' (Knitwear/Cardigan) from the Divided Collection. Given the current date is March 18, we are in the peak spring season demand. Looking at history, demand has shifted significantly upwards from its initial January baseline (~5) to a high-demand regime starting Period 1. Historical demand for the last five periods (P1 to P5) is: 18, 79, 56, 71, and 88. This averages approximately 62.4 units per week. Periods 2, 4, and 5 resulted in stockouts (ending on-hand = 0), indicating that the current OR base stocks (which are influenced by the low early-January data) are under-ordering. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. However, given the zero stockouts and increasing trend (88 demand in the latest period), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to focus exclusively on the spring regime. This N=5 captures the shift from the low-demand pre-February period while reflecting the current high volatility and growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high regime since Feb 11; last 3 periods show demand consistently above 55 units (avg 71.6), significantly exceeding initial January levels (~5). Stockouts occurred in 3 of the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Maja Cardigan TVP', a spring/seasonal knitwear piece. Demand has aggressively ramped up since Feb 11 (Period 1), with demand in the last three periods being 71, 88, and 105. This represents a clearly increasing trend rather than a stable regime. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in 5 out of 6 periods, meaning actual demand is significantly higher than units sold. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this peak seasonal growth, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. I estimate next period's demand will continue its upward trend toward 115-120 units. To compute mu_hat (which covers review + lead time, i.e., 1+0=1 period), I will set it to 120. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the high volatility seen during this growth phase, allowing the OR backend to set a sufficient safety stock buffer with a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level offset by the capped policy's safety margin).

Carry-over insight: Demand is in an accelerating growth phase (Spring seasonality); last 3 periods actual demand: 71, 88, 105 (+~20% weekly). Observed lead time remains 0.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Maja Cardigan TVP', a spring/summer knitwear item. We are currently in Period 8 (2019/4/1), entering the peak of spring seasonality. Historical demand has shown a clear accelerating growth trend: 56, 71, 88, 105, 110 over the last 5 periods. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Despite previous stockouts, the last period (Period 7) saw a slight deceleration in growth (105 to 110), but demand remains high. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (88, 105, 110) which average approximately 101 per period. Given L=0, mu_hat represents the demand for (1+0) periods. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of this high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high holding cost ($1/unit) equal to the profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth is stabilizing at a high level (avg ~100 units/week) as of April 1st; the prior 20% weekly growth has slowed to ~5% in the most recent period.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a 'Maja Cardigan', which has seen a massive demand surge throughout the spring season (starting from ~5 units in January to 161 units in the most recent period). We have experienced frequent stockouts because demand consistently outpaces estimates, and profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. However, with current on-hand inventory at 0 and demand still accelerating (from 110 to 161 in the last period, a nearly 50% jump), we must capture this growth. I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to focus on the current peak-season regime (Periods 6, 7, and 8), where demand averaged ~125 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the forecast mu_hat will represent demand for one period. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility seen in this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed for April: Period 8 demand reached 161, a 46% increase over Period 7 (110). This represents a second-order shift within the spring season high regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Maja Cardigan' (Knitwear), which has experienced a massive demand surge since February (Spring seasonality). Historical demand samples from January (initial context) were ~5. Since mid-February (Period 1), demand has climbed significantly: 18, 79, 56, 71, 88, 105, 110, 161, and 108. The drop from 161 (Period 8) to 108 (Period 9) suggests that Period 8 was a peak, possibly driven by specific weather or promotional events, but the overall regime remains high (avg of last 4 periods is ~121). Lead time (L) is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand Spring regime while accounting for the recent volatility, ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~121 units plus a safety buffer for the high variance observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high level for April; while P8 (161) was a peak, the 4-week average is ~121, confirming a sustained high-demand Spring regime compared to Feb/March averages (~75).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a 'Maja Cardigan', which aligns with spring seasonality in the northern hemisphere. Looking at recent demand, Period 8 saw a peak of 161 units, followed by 108 in Period 9 and 77 in Period 10. This indicates that while we are in a high-demand regime, the peak of mid-April may be tapering off as we transition toward late spring/early summer. The last 4 weeks of demand are 161, 108, 77, and (from Period 7) 110, averaging 114 units. Given the recent downtrend from 161 down to 77, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the current high but fluctuating regime, while ensuring we don't over-order on the tail end of the season. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-April peak (P8: 161) is showing a cooling trend: P9: 108, P10: 77, suggesting the peak spring season for this knitwear item may have passed.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 29, 2019. The SKU is a lightweight Maja Cardigan (Knitwear), which exhibited strong growth through March and peaked in early April (Period 8: 161 units). The carry-over insights correctly identified a 'cooling trend' in Periods 9 and 10, but Period 11 demand rebounded significantly to 116 units, causing a stockout (on-hand was 114). This volatility is common in transitional fashion seasons. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.50, meaning the backend aims for the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 7-11), where demand averaged ~114.4. This filters out the early-season ramp-up and focuses on the current stabilized but volatile late-spring behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains volatile in late April: after a two-week decline, Period 11 demand surged back to 116 units, resulting in a stockout. Peak spring demand appears to be a plateau (avg ~114 over last 5 weeks) rather than a sharp drop-off.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Maja Cardigan) is in its peak spring season (May 6th). Demand has remained high and volatile, with recent weekly demands of 108, 77, 116, and 137. The stockout in Period 12 (sold 115 against a demand of 137) confirms that demand is not yet cooling as previously hypothesized but is fluctuating at a high plateau. To capture this volatility and avoid further stockouts, I will use the recent 5-week demand average (approximately 110 units/week) for mu_hat. This period includes the peak (161) and the lows (77), providing a robust estimate for the current regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will set sigma_hat to explicit based on the standard deviation of the high-regime period (roughly 30) to ensure the OR backend sets a sufficiently high base stock to handle the observed demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in May: Period 12 demand (137) rebounded sharply after a lower mid-April, resulting in a stockout. High-regime average (P7-P12) is ~118 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-13. The item is a knitwear cardigan, which aligns with the high-demand 'Spring' regime observed since mid-February. However, recent demand shows high volatility: Period 12 was 137 (stockout), while Period 13 dropped significantly to 66. This suggests we are in a 'late spring' phase where demand is no longer consistently growing and may be more erratic or starting to soften. Looking at the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand was 108, 77, 116, 137, and 66, averaging 100.8 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To account for this volatility and ensure we are not over-ordering as the season potentially concludes, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the 100.8 mean, and a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect the high variance observed in these pulses (standard deviation of ~29). Setting L to calculate confirms the 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in May: P12 (137) followed by P13 (66), suggesting the spring peak is transitioning into a less predictable late-season phase.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a soft cardigan (knitwear), which is now moving from the peak spring season into a late-season phase. Recent demand history shows high volatility (P12: 137, P13: 66, P14: 114), indicating that while the peak may be past, demand remains strong but unpredictable. The stockout in Period 14 (sold 101 out of 114 demand) highlights the need for a sufficient buffer. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use the last 8 periods (covering April-May) to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime (average demand ~111). Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat best reflects this phase while maintaining responsiveness to the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late spring demand regime (May) is characterized by high volatility (CV ~0.3) despite lower peaks than early April; average demand remains ~110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product (Maja Cardigan) is a knitwear item currently in a late spring/early summer phase. While demand was expected to cool (Period 13 demand was 66), the most recent period (Period 15) saw a significant surge to 162 units, resulting in a stockout. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has been 116, 137, 66, 114, and 162, with an average of 119 units and considerable volatility (standard deviation ~36). The observed lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To account for the recent volatility and the risk of stockouts during these high-demand pulses, I am setting N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the current high-regime behavior while reacting to the most recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in late May: Period 15 demand reached 162 units (matching the April peak), following a series of fluctuations. The trailing 5-week average has stabilized around 119 units, but the high coefficient of variation (~0.3) necessitates higher safety stock despite being late in the spring season.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Maja Cardigan) is currently in a high-demand late-spring/early-summer phase (Period 17, June 3rd). Recent demand history indicates high volatility and frequent stockouts (Periods 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16 all ended with zero inventory). Specifically, Period 15 demand was 162 and Period 16 demand was 142. The trailing 5-period average (P12-P16) is approximately 124 units, with a standard deviation indicating significant volatility. Given the 1:1 Profit-to-Holding-Cost ratio, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0), but the repeated stockouts suggest this is inadequate for capturing the upside of the current regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand/high-volatility regime (May/June) and ensure the base stock accounts for these surges. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early June demand remains high and volatile: Periods 15 (162) and 16 (142) show values significantly above the Spring average (~110), confirming a sustained high-demand regime with frequent stockouts into early summer.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a soft-knit cardigan, which continues to show high demand even into early June, likely due to its 'soft, loose knit' nature suitable for transitional weather. Demand remains in a high-volume, high-volatility regime. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand values were 66, 114, 162, 142, and 130, averaging 122.8 units/week. Since the backend uses a base-stock policy that calculates safety stock based on profit and holding cost (equal at $1.0 each, leading to a target service level of 50%), and we have experienced stockouts in 6 of the last 7 periods, the OR engine is consistently under-ordering. To mitigate this trend of 0 ending inventory and lost sales, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P13-P17) to capture the current elevated average (122.8) rather than the long-term average which is dragged down by early season low numbers. Lead time is stable at 0. I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime persists into June: Recent 5-week average (P13-P17) is ~123 units, significantly higher than the early spring average (~75). Continued frequent stockouts indicate demand is consistently exceeding the 50th percentile target of the OR backend.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679854001 (Maja Cardigan) is in a sustained high-demand regime in mid-June (trailing 5-week average is ~134 units). Despite frequent stockouts, demand remains robust between 117-162 units over the last month. With profit and holding cost equal ($1.00), the base OR engine targets the 50th percentile (median). However, due to consistent under-ordering leading to 11 stockouts in 18 periods, the observed demand is censored (lower than actual). I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-spring/early-summer high-activity state. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in a sustained high plateau through early June: last 5 periods (P14-P18) actual demand averages ~133 units (including censored values), significantly higher than the early April peak (avg ~121). Lead time stable at 0.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Maja Cardigan' (soft, loose knit, no buttons), which is characteristic of late spring and early summer transitional wear. We are currently in late June (2019/6/24). Demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) has consistently been high, with values of 162, 142, 130, 117, and 116. While there is a slight sequential downward trend from the P15 peak, the average demand over these 5 weeks remains 133.4 units. Stockouts have been frequent throughout the spring, including P14, P15, P16, and P17, indicating that the OR engine is likely underestimating the actual demand distribution due to censored sales data. To maintain a competitive service level given the equal cost of profit and holding ($1.00), I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 (since late May) for mu_hat to capture this high-demand plateau. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to account for the sustained volatility observed in this late-season phase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Maja Cardigan) is in a high-demand regime that has persisted from spring into early summer (July 1st). Recent demand observations (P16-P20) are: 142, 130, 117, 116, 105. While there is a slight downward trend as we move into peak summer, demand remains significantly higher than the initial January/February levels. The average of the last 5 periods (N=5) is 122 units, which is a reliable estimate for the current sustained plateau. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The OR backend's service level target is 50% (profit=1, holding=1), which has led to frequent stockouts in this high-volatility environment. By using a recent_N window of 5, I am capturing the current demand level while allowing for the observed slight cooling as summer progresses, ensuring we don't over-order if the cardigan's popularity dips in the July heat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a high plateau for June/July: trailing 5-week average (P16-P20) is 122 units, showing a slight softening from May peaks but remaining well above early spring-levels.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679854001 (Maja Cardigan) is in a high-demand, high-volatility plateau. Current date is 2019/7/8 (Mid-summer). Historically, this item has seen demand averaging around 110-120 units over the last 5-10 periods with significant volatility (demand values ranging from 66 to 162). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, allowing for same-period responsive ordering. For Period 22, the trailing 5-week average demand (P17-P21) is 114.2 units, and the trailing 10-week average is 119.4 units. Given several stockouts in the history where demand exceeded the previous 'ordered' amounts, I will use a recent 10-period window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer plateau's mean and variability while maintaining enough safety stock to mitigate stockouts. Method 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 is selected to reflect the sustained high-regime demand since May.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Maja Cardigan remains in a high-demand plateau during the summer (July), consistently averaging around 120 units over the last 5 periods (P18-P22 avg: 113.6, but includes a stockout in P22 where demand was 127). The item stocked out in P22, meaning true demand was likely higher than the 120 units sold. Given the stockout and the persistent demand volatility (historical peaks of 160+), I am setting mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the current plateau, while using sigma_hat from the last 10 periods to capture the high volatility seen throughout late spring and early summer. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The goal is to provide enough buffer to minimize stockouts in this high-frequency sales phase.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679854001 (Maja Cardigan) is in late July (2019/7/22). Historically, the demand for this knitwear product surged in spring and has maintained a high-demand plateau throughout June and July. Recent actual demand values (P21: 103, P22: 127 [censored], P23: 104) show that demand remains robust, averaging ~111 units over the last 3 periods despite entering the mid-summer phase. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (10 units), and the product has a high turnover with frequent stockouts (e.g., P22), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (approx. 111) to capture the current plateau. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the moderate volatility observed during this steady but high-volume phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed for July: Trailing 5-week average (P19-P23) is ~111 units, indicating a continuation of the high-demand regime from late spring/early summer into mid-summer with persistent stockout risk.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679854001 (Maja Cardigan) is in a late-July period (P25). Reviewing the history, the demand regime has reached a relative plateau after the volatile spring peaks. In the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand values were 105, 103, 127, 104, and 91 (average 106). The product is a 'loose knit' cardigan, which typically sees sustained demand through summer for cool evenings, but we expect a transition toward late summer/autumn trends soon. Stockouts have been frequent when demand exceeds 120, even with a lead time of 0. Currently, on-hand is 20. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game. To respond to the slight softening in recent weeks (P24 demand was 91) while maintaining protection against the volatility seen in P22 (127), I will use N=5 for the demand mean and variance to capture the most recent stability. This balances the risk of overstocking as the season progresses against the high historical volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679854001 (Maja Cardigan) is entering August. Historically, demand for this knitwear item peaked in April/May (avg ~120-130) and has shown a gradual softening through July. Looking at the last 5 periods (P21-P25), actual demand was 103, 127, 104, 91, and 82. This indicates a descending trend from the mid-summer plateau, likely as the summer clearance phase begins or pre-fall transition occurs. However, demand remains significantly higher than the initial January levels (~5). The trailing 5-week average is approximately 101.4 units. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent cooling trend while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the persistent volatility observed throughout the season (e.g., the spike to 127 in P22). Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening in late July: Trailing 5-week average (P21-P25) dropped to ~101 units, compared to the June average of ~111 units, indicating a transition out of the high-summer plateau.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The product is a soft-knit cardigan, which typically sees peak demand in spring and a secondary peak or sustained interest in early autumn, with a potential softening in mid-summer. Analyzing the recent history (Periods 22-26), demand has clearly transitioned from the June/July plateau (~110-120 units) to a lower August level. The last 5 periods (P22-P26) show demand values of 127, 104, 91, 82, and 89, averaging 98.6 units. The last three periods specifically average 87.3 units, confirming a downward trend or 'softening' as noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this seasonal transition, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current mean of ~99 units, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility (std approx 17). This setting balances the risk of holding costs against potential late-summer demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed in August: The trailing 3-week average (P24-P26) is 87 units, down 21% from the June/July average of ~111. This identifies the transition into the late-summer/pre-autumn phase.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late August (Period 28, Date: 2019/8/19). Demand has transitioned out of the peak summer plateau (~111 units) into a softer late-summer phase. Period 27 saw a demand of 100 units, which resulted in a slight stockout, following a 3-week average of 87 units (P24-P26). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts against the risk of overstocking during this softening regime, I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current average of approximately 93 units (P24-P27: 91, 82, 89, 100). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the current localized volatility in this regime. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand while responding to the documented softening trend.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late August (2019/08/26). The demand for this cardigan has stabilized in a lower regime compared to the early summer peak. The trailing 5-week average (P24-P28) is approximately 91 units (91, 82, 89, 100, 92), confirming the softening trend noted in Period 27. Period 27 and 28 resulted in minor stockouts because demand slightly exceeded the on-hand inventory. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the OR backend aims for a 50% service level (the median). To ensure we cover current demand while respecting the seasonal downward trend, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent late-summer stability while discarding the higher June/July data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a late-summer average of ~91 units (trailing 5-week average P24-P28). High-summer plateau (~111) has ended.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-09-02 (Period 30). The SKU 679854001, a soft-knit cardigan, is entering September. Historically, demand for this item saw a major spring peak (avg ~120), a high summer plateau (avg ~110), and a recent softening in August (avg ~91). However, Period 29 showed a unexpected surge to 115 units, resulting in a stockout. September usually marks the beginning of the Autumn/Winter retail season for knitwear, suggesting this surge is not an outlier but the start of a new seasonal regime. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the likelihood of increasing demand as temperatures drop, I will shift to a recent demand window that captures this potential seasonal upturn. I'll use N=5 to balance the lower early-August values with the recent spike, ensuring the OR backend raises the base stock to cover this momentum. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely starting Period 29 (late August/early September): Demand increased to 115 units, following an August average of ~91, signaling the start of the Autumn/Winter seasonal uptake for knitwear.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (Sept 9) confirms a significant demand upturn as we enter the Autumn/Winter season. Demand has been 115 (P29) and 119 (P30), exceeding the August average of ~91. Both periods resulted in stockouts, indicating actual demand is likely higher than sold quantities (censored data). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this rapid seasonal growth while accounting for censorship, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 (P28-P30) for mu_hat, which includes the lower P28 but the rising P29-P30. I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to account for higher volatility typically seen during regime transitions and to prevent the backend from under-ordering due to the previous low-volatility August period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter uptake confirmed: Demand increased from an August average of ~91 to 117+ in early September (P29: 115, P30: 119), resulting in consecutive stockouts.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '679854001' (Maja Cardigan) has entered the Autumn/Winter seasonal uptake, as indicated by a significant demand increase starting around Period 29. Periods 29, 30, and 31 recorded demands of 115, 119, and 106 respectively, compared to the August average of approximately 91. While demand slightly dipped in Period 31, the overall trend since late August confirms a shift to a higher regime. Stockouts in Period 29 and 30 suggest that the previous base stock levels were insufficient for this new regime. Given the current date (Sep 16), demand is expected to remain high or continue rising. To capture this shift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (averaging the most recent periods of the new regime: 115, 119, 106) and sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current volatility within this shift. Actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Maja Cardigan is entering the Autumn/Winter uptake phase as of early September. Demand in the most recent four periods (P29-P32) has been 115, 119, 106, and 101, which is higher than the August late-summer average of 91. This shift was correctly identified in previous carry-over insights. While the demand showed a slight softening in the last two weeks from the early September peak, the onset of cooler weather typically sustains demand for knitwear like this cardigan. The observed lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To capture the current seasonal regime while remaining responsive to the recent minor deceleration, I am using recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the ~110 unit average of the current Autumn phase and accounts for the observed volatility within this new regime, preventing further stockouts observed in P29 and P30.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679854001 (Knitwear) is in a clear Autumn/Winter seasonal uptake as of late September. Period 33 demand was 136, causing a stockout of the 111 units available. The trailing 5-week average (P29-P33) is approximately 115.4 units, representing a significant increase over the August average of ~91. Given the 'soft, loose knit' description, demand is expected to remain high and potentially increase as temperatures drop further in October. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and satisfy the current demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the Autumn uptake while ignoring the lower August data. Sigma_hat is also set using N=5 to reflect the current volatility in this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter seasonal uptake sustained: average demand for last 5 periods (P29-P33) increased to ~115 units, compared to August average of ~91 (+26%). Period 33 showed highest demand of this regime (136).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679854001 (Maja Cardigan) is currently in a sustained Autumn/Winter high-demand regime. Since Period 29 (late August), demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to the August summer lull. The trailing 6-week demand values (P29-P34) are 115, 119, 106, 101, 136, and 119, averaging approximately 116 units per period. This confirms the seasonal uptake previously noted. In the last period (P34), we observed demand of 119 and ended with 0 inventory, indicating a stockout and suggesting that actual demand may be higher than recorded sales. To account for this seasonality and the potential for demand spikes as the weather cools in October, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this entire Autumn regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect the current volatility (notably the spike in P33). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679854001 (knitwear) is currently in the Autumn/Winter seasonal uptake phase. Period 35 demand (84) showed a decrease from the previous 5-period average (~115), but this likely represents volatility rather than a regime shift, as temperatures generally drop in mid-October. The trailing 5-period average (P31-P35) is approximately 109 units (106, 101, 136, 119, 84). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current seasonal level and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed in late September/early October.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679854001 (Knitwear Cardigan) is currently in the Autumn/Winter seasonal phase. Following the initial uptake in September (averaging ~115 units), demand has softened in the last two periods (P35: 84, P36: 79), consistent with a stabilization or slight dip before the deeper winter peak. The trailing 5-period average (P32-P36) is approximately 104 units, which reflects this recent softening. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this most recent stabilization while filtering out the volatile peak of P33 (136). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods, the OR backend will align the base stock with the current late-October demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softened from the early Autumn peak (~115) to a more moderate Autumn level; trailing 3-week average (P34-P36) is ~94 units compared to the P29-P33 average of ~115.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Maja Cardigan is currently in a softer Autumn regime following a peak in September (P33: 136). The trailing 4-week average (P34-P37) is approximately 89 units, which is a significant drop from the early Autumn average of ~115 units. We are currently at Period 38 (late October), moving into November. Historical lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while demand softens, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition. This allows the OR backend to target a base stock reflecting the recent ~89 unit average rather than the higher seasonal peak, while the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio naturally targets a ~50% service level.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Maja Cardigan is currently in a sustained cooling phase as we move into November. In Period 38, demand dropped to 52 units, which is significantly lower than the October average of ~83 units and the September peak of ~115 units. This suggests the Autumn uptake has concluded, and we are entering a late-season regime with lower expected demand. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the recent weekly demand values (119, 84, 79, 74, 52), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent trend while providing enough variance to handle the product's inherent volatility. Setting N=4 covers the transition from October's stability to the current November cooling.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Cooling confirmed: Trailing 4-week average (P35-P38) is ~72.3 units, a 37% decrease from the September peak (~115). Entering late-Autumn/Winter low-demand phase.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Maja Cardigan is currently in a cooling phase as we move into mid-November. The trailing 4-week average (P36-P39) has dropped to approximately 61.5 units, significantly lower than the September peak of ~115 units and the mid-Autumn levels of ~94 units. Period 39 demand was 41 units, confirming this downward trend as we approach the end of the year for this loose-knit cardigan. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (which equal the profit per unit), I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this more recent, lower-demand regime using N=5 (covering Periods 35-39). This will allow the OR backend to lower the base stock level in alignment with current sales velocity while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Cooling confirmed: Trailing 5-week average (P35-P39) is ~66 units, a significant decrease from the early Autumn peak (~115). Period 39 demand (41 units) is the lowest observed since early February.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41 (mid-November), demand for the 'Maja Cardigan' is clearly declining as we progress further into the late-autumn/winter low-demand phase. Period 40 demand dropped significantly to 20 units, the lowest observed since early February. The trailing 5-week average (P36-P40) is approximately 53.2 units, but the most recent two weeks (P39-P40) show an even sharper drop (avg 30.5). To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this Cooling phase, I am selecting recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will sensitize the OR backend to the most recent downward trend (approx 37.7 units/week) compared to the longer-term averages. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase accelerated in November: P39-P40 average (30.5) is 54% lower than the P35-P39 average (~66), confirming a decline toward winter lows.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Maja Cardigan is in a clear late-autumn/winter decline. The trailing average has shifted significantly: the last 3 periods (P39-P41) observed demand values are 41, 20, and 22, resulting in an average of ~27.7 units. This is a sharp drop from the early October average of ~66 units. Given the transition into late November, further cooling or stabilization at these lower levels is expected. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To adapt the OR backend to this new low-demand regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand behavior (Post-Nov 4th) while excluding the much higher October data that would otherwise inflate inventory for this 1:1 profit/holding cost ratio SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 40 (mid-November): Demand has stabilized at a low winter regime, with the trailing 3-week average dropping to ~28 units, a 58% decrease from the late-October average of ~66.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand unexpectedly spiked to 84 units after a three-week low-winter regime averaging ~28. This occurs as we enter December (2019/12/2), suggesting a potential holiday shopping surge for knitwear (gift-giving season). While the previous month showed a cooling trend, this spike necessitates an immediate adjustment to avoid stockouts during the peak December weeks. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) would yield too low a forecast (~42) given this 84-unit jump. Therefore, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to 100 units to cover the potential for continued holiday demand while acknowledging the seasonal volatility. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of this transition. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected starting Period 42 (early December): Demand jumped from a 3-week average of ~28 to 84 (+200%), signaling a potential short-term Christmas/gift-giving peak for knitwear items.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season. Period 42 showed a significant holiday demand surge (84 units), followed by a lower Period 43 (33 units), which is likely a temporary fluctuation within a high-demand December regime. Given that the item is a 'Maja Cardigan' (knitwear/giftable) and it is mid-December, we must anticipate high demand for the next 2 weeks. The trailing 5-week average (approx 40) is too low because it includes the November trough. The spike in P42 (84) is a more accurate indicator of holiday potential. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat set to 85 to ensure we cover the P42 peak level plus a small buffer, as a stockout this late in the game is costly. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0. sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value (25) to account for the high volatility observed in both the Spring peaks and the recent Dec 2 surge.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed: Dec 2 (P42) showed a 200% surge to 84 units, establishing a high-volatility peak regime for the Christmas season.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday season (Period 45). History shows a clear holiday surge starting in Period 42 (84 units), followed by a pullback to more moderate but still elevated levels in Periods 43 and 44 (33 and 35 units respectively). The knitwear category often sees high volatility during the two weeks immediately preceding Christmas. Although the last two periods averaged ~34 units, the surge in P42 suggests the potential for significant spikes as last-minute shopping occurs. Given the high stockout frequency throughout the year when demand shifts, and the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50th percentile service level), I will use a recent_N approach to capture the holiday regime. I'll set N=4 to include the initial P42 surge (84) and the subsequent stabilization (33, 35), plus the preceding low period to slightly temper the average, resulting in a balanced mu_hat for the OR backend. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-23 (Period 46), which is the peak holiday week. Historical demand shows a significant surge occurred in Period 42 (demand=84), followed by a cooling to 33, 35, and 27 in Periods 43-45. However, this is a knitwear item ('Maja Cardigan') and we are in the middle of winter. The immediate holiday peak may have passed its initial surge, but demand for soft knits typically remains elevated compared to late-October/November lows (~20-22 units). The recent average since the holiday surge began (P42-P45) is 44.75 units. Period 45 demand was 27, and on-hand is 23, leaving us slightly under-stocked for even a low-end scenario. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to capture this holiday-impacted regime (avg ~45), while acknowledging that the very sharpest peak (P42) might have been a focused event. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend recognizes the higher volatility experienced during this Christmas period.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P45) characterized by an initial surge (84) followed by a stabilization at a higher floor (avg 31.6 for P43-P45) compared to pre-holiday winter lows (avg 21).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, right after the Christmas peak. Based on the history of Period 42-46, the holiday surge (initial peak of 84) has stabilized to a lower floor with recent demands of 33, 35, 27, and 31 (average ~31.5). We are entering the post-holiday January period, which historically (based on the provided January samples: 1, 6, 7, 5, 5) is a very low-demand regime for this knitwear SKU. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this transition to the January low (~10-15 units) rather than using a longer recent_N that would over-index on the December surge. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized volatility of the last month. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday regime shift detected starting Period 47: Demand is expected to return to January lows (historical avg ~5) following the conclusion of the December holiday season.
