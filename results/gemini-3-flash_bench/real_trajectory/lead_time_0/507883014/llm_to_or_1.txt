Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear). Historically, demand has been increasing: 31, 60, 70, 64, 68. The mean of the last 4 samples is approximately 65.5, while the mean of all 5 samples is 58.6. Since we see a significant jump from the first available data point (31) to a relatively stable level around 65-70, I will use recent_N=4 to reflect this shift. The promised lead time is 0, and since we have no historical 'concluded' periods yet to verify lead time drift, I will use the default (0). Setting mu_hat to recent_N=4 will capture the current demand regime of ~66 units per week, ensuring our base stock is sufficient for the immediate demand + lead time (1+0=1 period).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is Women's Lingerie (Underwear 3pk). Promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirm this (ordered 73, arrived 73). Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) were: 31, 60, 70, 64, 68, with a mean of 58.6. Period 1 actual demand was 48, which is slightly lower than the recent average but within a reasonable range. Given the stability of the demand (post-January ramp-up), I will use the last 4 historical samples plus Period 1 (total N=5) to forecast. Since L=0, mu_hat should cover (1+0)=1 period of demand. Mean of {60, 70, 64, 68, 48} = 62. Standard deviation is approximately 8.7. The OR backend will use these to set the base stock level to satisfy a high service level (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 3 (2019-02-25), the product (women's lingerie 3pk) shows consistent demand. Historical samples range from 31 to 70. Recently, the demand in Period 1 was 48 and Period 2 was 69. The average of the last 5 historical samples plus the two observed periods (31, 60, 70, 64, 68, 48, 69) is approximately 58.5. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent behavior while smoothing out the spike seen in Period 2. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using the high profit margin ($19) vs holding cost ($1), leading to a high service level target.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear) shows stable demand in the early season. Historical demand for the last 5 samples (including pre-game data) are: 60, 70, 64, 68 (Feb 4), 48 (P1), 69 (P2), and 64 (P3). The average demand over the last 5 samples is approximately 63 units per week. The promised lead time is 0, and the actual lead time observed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 has consistently been 0. We have 15 units on hand and 0 in transit. To prevent stockouts for the upcoming week while demand is stable, I will set L to 'default' (0), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent stable average, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the moderate volatility seen in the recent periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1183.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear) shows stable demand around a mean of ~61 units over the last 4 periods (48, 69, 64, 63). The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1 through 4. Inventory is currently low (14 units) relative to recent demand. Since there is no strong evidence of seasonal shifts yet (March), I will use the recent history (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation responds to the current demand regime rather than incorporating older initialization data from Jan/Feb if they differed significantly.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Women's Underwear (3pk), which typically shows stable demand absent major seasonal shifts. The current date is March 18th. Over the last 5 periods (Feb 11 - Mar 11), demand has been consistent: 48, 69, 64, 63, 67, with a mean of 62.2. The initial historical data (Jan 7 - Feb 4) showed 31, 60, 70, 64, 68, which also aligns with this range (excluding the Jan 7 outlier). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will set the base stock to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1) using the mean of the last 4 periods (65.75) which reflects the more recent stabilized demand levels. The service level target is high (q \u2248 0.95), and the current inventory is very low (9 units), necessitating a replenishment order. I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture the stable demand regime while filtering the early Period 1 outlier.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. We are managing a 3-pack of women's underwear. Historical demand over the last 6 periods (Game History) has been relatively stable, averaging 61.8 units per period (48, 69, 64, 63, 67, 60). The demand samples provided before the game start (Jan-Feb) also showed similar levels (31-70 range). No significant seasonal spike is expected for this category in late March. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the recent_N method (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current stable demand regime while ignoring the lower initial Jan sample. On-hand inventory is 11, and we have 0 units in-transit. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to maintain high service levels (Profit/Holding ratio is 19:1) while accounting for the current inventory position.

Daily Reward (R_t): $965.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 is a 'Womens Underwear' product. Current date is April 1st. Historical demand from January to present shows relative stability: Jan mean ~56.2 (n=5), Feb/Mar (Game History) mean ~60.4 (n=7). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory starts at 23 units. Demand across the last 7 periods ranges from 48 to 69, with a standard deviation of approximately 7.1. Since there is no clear seasonal trend for this staple item in early spring, I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime. The base stock calculation by the OR engine will target a very high service level (q = 19/20 = 95%) since profit is high relative to holding cost. This protects against the stock-out risks seen in Periods 2 and 5 where inventory dropped to single digits.

Daily Reward (R_t): $986.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Ellen Thong (Malva) L 3pk' is a staple lingerie item. The demand has been remarkably stable since the provided start date (2019/1/7). Analyzing the historical samples (31, 60, 70, 64, 68) alongside the game history demand (48, 69, 64, 63, 67, 60, 52, 53), the recent demand (last 4 periods) has stabilized around an average of 54.5 units, slightly lower than the initial weeks. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu) with N=8 to capture the game history stability while weighting against the earliest higher samples. For sigma, I will also use N=8 to accurately reflect the steady volatility observed in the recent data. Lead time will remain at 'default' (0 periods). The high service level requirement (95% because Profit=19, Holding=1) ensures we maintain enough stock for slight deviations despite the stable demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 53-60 units after Period 2. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is women's underwear (Ellen Thong L 3pk). Looking at the history, Period 9 (April 8) showed a significant drop in demand to 28 units, compared to the previous 7-period average of ~61 units. This sudden drop might be a temporary fluctuation or a new regime. However, the pre-game historical samples (Jan/Feb) showed higher values (60-70). Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level. To avoid over-reacting to one low demand point (Period 9) while acknowledging the slight downward trend observed from Period 7-8, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand (covering Periods 5-9). This captures the recent average of 52 units, which is lower than the long-term average but higher than the last outlier. I will use the default lead time (0) as it is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 9: dropped significantly to 28 units from a previous 7-period mean of 61.

Daily Reward (R_t): $723.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for the product (Women's Underwear) showed a significant drop to 28 units in Period 9 and a slight recovery to 40 in Period 10, compared to the stable Period 2-8 mean of ~61 units. This suggests the high demand period (potentially late winter/early spring or specific promotions) has subsided. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory health is good with 37 units on hand. To prevent overstocking at a $1.00 holding cost while capturing the current demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3, covering the drop and recovery (28, 40, and the previous 53). This reflects the new, lower demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime identified: Mean demand dropped from ~60 to ~34 units over the last two periods (P9-P10).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1019.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear) is transitioning out of a post-peak demand dip observed in Periods 9-10. Demand in Period 11 rebounded to 54 units, suggesting the 'mid-30s' regime identified in the previous carry-over insight was temporary or overly pessimistic. The current on-hand inventory is very low at 7 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, the system needs to order enough to cover Period 12 demand immediately. I will use a larger N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent recovery while acknowledging the volatile trend (28, 40, 54). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect this recent variance. This setting balances the risk of a stockout (with only 7 units on hand) against the $1 holding cost, given the high $19 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovered in Period 11 to 54 units, invalidating the previous 'drop to 34' regime; demand appears to be stabilizing in the 40-55 range post-peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are looking at women's lingerie (3pk underwear), which has shown relative stability with minor fluctuations. Historic lead time is consistently 0 periods. After a brief dip in early April (Period 9: 28 units), demand has recovered and stabilized: Period 10 (40), Period 11 (54), and Period 12 (57). The last three periods show a clear upward trend back to the long-term average observed between periods 2-8 (~60 units). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this recent recovery while remaining slightly conservative compared to the early-game peak. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility around this recovery trend. With a 0-period lead time and high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level for the immediate period.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Post-dip demand (P10-P12) shows an upward trend (40 -> 54 -> 57), returning toward the long-term mean of ~60.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1234.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear) exhibits stable demand with a confirmed lead time of 0 periods. Historical demand data from 2019-01-07 to 2019-05-06 shows a consistent mean around 55-60 units, despite a brief dip in Periods 9-10 (April). The most recent demand (Period 13) recorded 65 units, signaling a return to the long-term stable level observed in early 2019. The 'Carry-over insights' also track this recovery. Given the high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), and the current low on-hand inventory of 1 unit, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current recovery trend (Period 10-13 demand: 40, 54, 57, 65). This provides a \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) that reflects the recent upward movement toward the long-term mean of ~60 while acknowledging the recent variability in \u03c3\u0302 (sigma_hat).

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully returned to pre-dip levels, with Period 13 reaching 65 units; current demand regime mean is established at ~55-65 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1368.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 saw a sharp demand spike to 83 units (Date: 2019/5/13), which resulted in a stockout (72 units available, 72 sold, 0 ending inventory). This represents a significant deviation from the previously established regime of 55-65 units. Analyzing the specific date, May 13th is the lead-up to the post-Mother's Day period but specifically in 2019, mid-May often sees a shift toward early summer apparel. Given the stockout, we need to increase our base stock to capture this higher demand level and prevent further lost sales. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N method (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent recovery and current spike more heavily than the April dip. Since L=0, (1+L)=1, so mu_hat will be the average of approximately [53, 28, 40, 54, 57, 65, 83], which is ~54.3, however, the OR backend's cap and the high service level requirement (95%) will help buffer against the 83+ potential.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 14 (83 units), causing a stockout. Current demand regime (P11-P14) shows a strong upward trend: 54 -> 57 -> 65 -> 83.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand period for this product (Womens Lingerie/Underwear), likely driven by seasonal factors or promotions. Demand has spiked significantly in the last two periods, increasing from 65 in Period 13 to 83 in Period 14, and then jumping drastically to 140 in Period 15. This resulted in consecutive stockouts (Period 14 and 15). The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this rapid upward surge and prevent further stockouts, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the periods where the spike occurred (P13-P15), calculating a mean of ~96 units per period. Using a short window is necessary here to respond to the shift, as the long-term historical mean (approx 60) is now far too low to meet the current demand trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: Demand increased from a baseline of ~60 to 140 over Periods 13-15, resulting in back-to-back stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2079.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear) experienced a significant demand spike between Periods 14 and 16, peaking at 140 units in Period 15 and settling at 112 units in Period 16. This surge suggests a seasonal shift or promotional event. The previous 'normal' demand of ~60 units is no longer relevant for the current regime. While demand softened from 140 to 112, it remains significantly above historical averages. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this high-demand cluster (83, 140, 112). This averages to 111.7, and with L=0, the backend base stock logic will target approximately this level. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, allowing for rapid response to these shifts. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) captures the high volatility observed during this surge, ensuring the OR backend sets a sufficient safety stock buffer to prevent further stockouts despite the high holding cost ratio (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P14-P16) confirmed with mean ~112 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~60 (+86%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1081.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand dropped significantly to 62 units from the previous surge levels (83, 140, 112). This indicates that the surge, likely a seasonal peak or event, has subsided. The period's demand (62) aligns closely with the long-term stable mean of approximately 60 observed between Periods 1-8. Although the previous three-period average (P14-P16) was high (~112), Period 17 suggests a return to the baseline. I will use recent_N with N=4 to transition away from the peak while accounting for the lower Period 17 value, which results in a mu_hat calculation based on demand values [83, 140, 112, 62]. This approach balances the risk of a continued high demand against the evident cooling. On-hand inventory is currently high at 97 units, which provides a safety buffer. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge has subsided: Period 17 demand (62) is a 45% drop from the surge average (~112) and indicates a return to the pre-spike baseline of ~60 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1464.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand surge that occurred between Periods 14 and 16 has clearly subsided. Since Period 17, demand has stabilized around a more moderate level (62 and 81). The average demand of the last two periods is 71.5, which is higher than the original ~60 baseline but significantly lower than the surge peak of 140. Period 18 saw demand of 81, which might indicate a stabilized higher baseline or just random fluctuation. I will use recent_N with N=2 to focus on the post-surge behavior while maintaining a buffer for the slightly higher recent demand. The inventory level is currently healthy at 75 units on-hand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand stabilization: Period 17-18 demand (avg 71.5) suggests a new baseline slightly higher than the pre-surge mean of ~60.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1586.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 has stabilized following a significant surge (Periods 14-16). Demand in the last three periods (P17-P19) was 62, 81, and 84, demonstrating a new baseline that is slightly higher than the pre-surge mean of ~60. The average demand over these last three periods is approximately 75.7 units. The Lead Time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods through the entire history. Given the recent stabilization, I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-surge environment. This allows the OR engine to set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~76 units while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (range 62-84). On-hand inventory is currently low (10 units), so a prompt order based on these parameters is necessary to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand baseline established: Periods 17-19 show stabilization at a higher mean of ~76 units compared to the pre-surge baseline of ~60.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear) continues to exhibit lead time = 0 based on consistent 'Period X conclude' messages where ordered=arrived in the same period. Demand analysis: After a significant surge (Periods 14-16), demand has stabilized in a higher regime (Periods 17-20). The mean for the last 4 periods is (62+81+84+86)/4 = 78.25 units. This confirms the carry-over insight that we have a new baseline roughly 30% higher than the original ~60. For Period 21, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this new sustained baseline of ~78 units. The sigma will also be set based on the last 4 periods to account for the stabilized volatility in this new regime. On-hand is low (10), so the OR backend will trigger a replenishment order to meet the base stock calculated from this higher mean.

Carry-over insight: New demand baseline confirmed at ~78 units (average of Periods 17-20: 78.25), significantly higher than the pre-surge mean of ~60.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1843.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 (Underwear) remains high. In Period 21, demand reached 101 units, which exceeded starting on-hand inventory (97), leading to a small stockout. The last five periods (P17-P21) show demand values of 62, 81, 84, 86, and 101, establishing a robust upward trajectory within the current post-surge regime. The current mean for this 5-period window is 82.8 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods across all concluded intervals. Given the latest demand of 101 and the clear upward trend, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this higher stabilized baseline (approx 83 units per period). I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility (approx 14.1), ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent another stockout while accounting for the profit/holding cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand baseline continued upward trend in Period 21 (101 units); 5-period mean (P17-P21) is 82.8, significantly higher than the previous estimate of 78.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear) is experiencing a sustained upward shift in demand. Following a surge in May/June, demand has not returned to the old baseline of ~60 but has instead stabilized at a higher level. The last 6 periods (P17-P22) recorded demands of 62, 81, 84, 86, 101, and 93. Period 21 saw a stockout, and Period 22 demand (93) remains high. The 6-period mean is approximately 84.5 units, which is significantly higher than the previous baseline. I am setting N=6 for mu_hat to capture this post-surge stabilization at a higher level, which is more representative than the all-time average. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival to satisfy current demand. I will also use N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen during this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift confirmed: Post-surge demand (P17-P22) has stabilized at a higher mean of ~85 units, a 40% increase over the original baseline of ~60. Volatility has also increased proportionally.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 (Women's underwear) has established a new demand regime since Period 17, following a significant surge. Analyzing the last seven periods (P17-P23), the mean demand is approximately 83.3 units (62, 81, 84, 86, 101, 93, 76), which is roughly 40% higher than the initial baseline of ~60. The demand in the most recent period (P23) was 76 units. Although lower than the peak of 101, it aligns with a stabilized higher baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for this sustained shift and the associated increase in volatility, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the entire post-surge stabilization period. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (q \u2248 0.95), and the OR backend will calculate a base stock that prioritizes avoiding stockouts while managing the increased demand mean.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear) shifted to a higher regime following a major surge in May. Over the last 8 periods (Period 17-24), which represents the post-surge stability phase, the mean demand is 82.25 units (range 62-101). The most recent 3 periods (Period 22-24) show demand levels of 93, 76, and 73, indicating a slight softening from the early July peak but remaining well above the original baseline of ~60. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this entire post-surge regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this window covers the stabilization period and accounts for the increased volatility observed during the transition. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, so I will maintain the default (promised) lead time setting.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand regime (P17-P24) mean stabilized at 82.25 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~60.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 is currently in a stable post-surge regime. Following a significant demand spike in mid-May (Periods 14-16), the market has settled into a new baseline. Over the last 9 periods (P17-P25), the mean demand has been approximately 82.1 units (62, 81, 84, 86, 101, 93, 76, 73, 67), which is significantly higher than the original pre-surge baseline of ~60 units. Recent periods (P23-P25) show a slight downward drift (76, 73, 67), but remain well above the historical average. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized but higher demand while acknowledging the recent slight decline, I am using a recent_N window of 9 periods (covering the entire post-surge regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level appropriate for the ~82 unit mean and its associated volatility, balancing the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear) continues to exhibit a stabilized demand regime following a significant surge in periods 14-16. Since Period 17, the mean demand has settled around 80 units (average of P17-P26 is 79.3). The most recent four periods (P23-P26) show a slight cooling with demand values of 76, 73, 67, and 68 (mean ~71), suggesting the regime may be drifting slightly lower than the 80s but remaining well above the initial baseline of 60. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this stabilization while acknowledging the slight downward drift in the last 4 weeks, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 10 to cover the post-surge period (P17-P26), which provides a stable mean of approximately 79-80 units. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same N=10 period to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand (P17-P26) mean is 79.3 units, confirming a sustained shift from the original baseline (~60). Recent 4-week demand (P23-P26) shows a slight softening to ~71 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear) continues to stabilize following a significant mid-year surge. Recent behavior (Periods 23-27) shows demand figures of 76, 73, 67, 68, and 64, indicating a very stable and slightly declining trend compared to the earlier post-surge peak. The current mean for the last 5 periods is 69.6 units, which is lower than the long-term post-surge average of ~79 reported in the carry-over insights. Given that the promised and actual lead times are consistently 0, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent stabilization and slight softening. This ensures the base stock reflects current demand levels (approx 70 units/period) while maintaining an appropriate safety buffer for the 0-period lead time environment (total coverage for current period demand).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at lower range (64-76 units) over the last 5 periods (P23-P27), with a mean of 69.6. This is a slight softening from the previously established post-surge baseline of ~80.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 (underwear) has stabilized after a mid-year surge. Recent periods (P23-P28) show a softened but consistent demand pattern, with a mean of 67.33 units and a standard deviation of approximately 6.5. This is lower than the post-surge peak but higher than the initial base of 60. Specifically, demand in the last three weeks (P26-P28) was 68, 64, and 57. The current on-hand inventory is 21 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'softened' regime (P23-P28), allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected ~67 units of demand for the current period while maintaining a safe buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization in the range of 57-76 units confirmed over Periods 23-28 (mean: 67.3). This represents a sustained softening from the previously established post-surge baseline of ~80.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 (Women's Underwear) exhibits a stabilized pattern following a large surge in periods 14-16. Since Period 23, demand has settled into a softer regime compared to the immediate post-surge peak. Periods 23-29 show demand values of 76, 73, 67, 68, 64, 57, and 59, respectively. This gives a 7-period mean of approximately 66.3 units, compared to the previously observed 80+ units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To align with this sustained softening and provide a responsive forecast, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current demand regime (Periods 23-29) while excluding the higher volatility from the transition period. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will maintain a high service level naturally; using recent statistics ensures we don't overstock based on the older, higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed for Periods 23-29 with a lower mean of 66.3 units compared to the early post-surge baseline (~80).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 507883014 (underwear) shows a stabilized regime after a mid-summer surge. Over the last 8 periods (P23-P30), demand has averaged 69.0 units (76, 73, 67, 68, 64, 57, 59, 78). Although Period 30 saw a slight uptick to 78 units resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0), the overall trend since Period 23 suggests a mean in the 65-70 range rather than the previous post-surge level of 80+. To respond to the stockout and the slight upward movement in the most recent week while maintaining the stabilized mean, I will use a recent_N approach with N=8. This captures the current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the historical surge and the very early low-demand baseline. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P23-P30 stabilized with a mean of 69.0 units, significantly lower than the P17-P22 post-surge average (~85).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 is currently stabilizing in a regime that followed a significant mid-year surge. Based on the Carry-over Insights, a regime shift was identified starting around Period 23 where demand softened from the post-surge peak of ~85 units to a lower range. Over the most recent 9 periods (P23-P31), the demand values were [76, 73, 67, 68, 64, 57, 59, 78, 49], yielding a mean of approximately 65.6 units. The most recent period (P31) showed a drop to 49 units, which may indicate further softening or just typical variance. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this entire stabilized period since the last major shift. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. The parameters are designed to maintain a high service level given the $19.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio, which favors holding safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P30.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P23-P31 has stabilized with a mean of 65.6 units, showing a slight softening trend compared to the previous post-surge baseline (~80).

Daily Reward (R_t): $718.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 is currently in a stabilized regime following a period of high volatility and a significant surge. Over the most recent 10 periods (P23-P32), the demand has averaged approximately 67 units (76, 73, 67, 68, 64, 57, 59, 78, 49, 40). Period 32 demand (40) is at the lower end of this range, continuing a slight softening trend noted in previous periods. The 'conclude' messages consistently show that the actual lead time is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture this stabilized post-surge baseline while accounting for the recent softening, allowing the OR backend to balance the high profit margin ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand stabilization confirmed for Periods 23-32 with a mean of 67.1 units, exhibiting a slight downward trend in the most recent two weeks (49 and 40 units).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 (Women's underwear) has shown a sustained stabilization in demand following a mid-year surge. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Over the last 11 periods (P23-P33), demand has fluctuated between 40 and 78 units, with a mean of 66.4. However, the most recent three periods (P31-P33) show a slight dip (49, 40, 56) with a mean of 48.3. This could indicate a seasonal cooling at the end of September. I will use a window of the last 11 periods (N=11) to capture the current stable regime (mu_hat ~ 66) while allowing the OR backend to calculate volatility (sigma_hat) based on this same period range. The Profit ($19) is much higher than the Holding Cost ($1), so the backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate given the relatively stable but occasionally fluctuating demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P23-P33 remains stable with a mean of 66.4 units. Recent 3-week mean (P31-P33) is lower at 48.3 units, suggesting a potential seasonal softening entering October.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883014 is currently in a seasonally softening demand phase as we enter October. Reviewing recent demand (P31-P34: 49, 40, 56, 37), the 4-week mean has dropped to 45.5 units, which is significantly lower than the P23-P30 mean of 69 units. This validates the seasonal softening hypothesis mentioned in the P34 carry-over insight. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining a high service level (profit/cost ratio supports z~1.28), I will shift the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the last 4 periods (N=4) and set the volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent variance. This prevents the OR engine from over-ordering based on the higher historical mean from the summer (July-August).

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal softening confirmed entering October: Mean demand for P31-P34 dropped to 45.5 units, a 34% decrease from the previous P23-P30 baseline (~69).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Historical demand for the last five periods (P31-P35) has been consistently lower: 49, 40, 56, 37, 30 units, with a mean of 42.4. This confirms the seasonal softening insight recorded in Period 35. The carry-over insight from previous periods also suggested a drop starting in October. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To adapt to this lower demand regime and avoid high holding costs while maintaining a service level (z* ~ 2.2 since profit is 19 and holding is 1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this recent seasonal dip. This focuses the forecast on the most recent five weeks of data (P31-P35), aligning with the observed 34% decrease in demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal low confirmed (Oct): Period mean for P31-P35 has dropped to 42.4 units, maintaining the ~35% decrease from the previous summer/post-surge baseline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 21, 2019. The product is a 3-pack of women's underwear. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm a lead time of 0 periods. Demand analysis shows a significant seasonal softening that began in late September (Period 31), likely corresponding to the transition into the autumn/winter retail season. The demand regime from Period 31 to Period 36 has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the summer. Specifically, demands for P31-P36 are 49, 40, 56, 37, 30, and 35, yielding a mean of 41.2 units. This is a clear departure from the earlier post-surge baseline of ~69 units. To respond to this sustained lower demand level and minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level (as profit margin is high: $19 vs $1 holding cost), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this current October regime. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Carry-over insight: October seasonal low further confirmed: Periods 31-36 mean demand has stabilized at 41.2 units, a 40% reduction from the P23-P30 baseline (~69).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507883014 (Womens Lingerie) has been in a sustained seasonal low since Period 31 (early October). The mean demand over the last 7 periods (P31-P37) is approximately 40.4 units (49, 40, 56, 37, 30, 35, 36), which is significantly lower than the preceding summer regime of ~66-69 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. Given the current date (Oct 28), we are still within the identified October seasonal low. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 samples (N=7) to reflect this current regime. Setting L to 'default' matches the observed 0-period lead time. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the lower seasonal demand while maintaining a high service level (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: October seasonal demand regime (P31-P37) confirmed: Mean has stabilized at 40.4 units, a 40% reduction from the summer baseline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Historical demand shows a confirmed seasonal softening throughout October (Periods 35-38), with demand consistently in the 30-37 range. The mean for the last 4 periods (P35-P38) is 34.5 units, which is significantly lower than the preceding September/August baseline. Lead time is reliably 0 periods. As we enter November, I will maintain parameters aligned with this stabilized October low-demand regime to avoid overstocking, while keeping a small buffer for potential early Holiday increases (November/December), although no evidence of such a spike is yet visible in the data. I'll use recent_N with N=8 to capture the full seasonal shift starting in September through October.

Carry-over insight: November entrance demand regime: October stabilized at a mean of 34.5 units (P35-P38), a clear 50% drop from the summer post-surge peak of ~80.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent arrival patterns. Demand has stabilized into a clear low-season regime since Period 35, coinciding with the October/November period. For the last 5 periods (P35-P39), demand has been very consistent: 30, 35, 36, 37, 36, with a mean of 34.8 units and very low volatility. This represents a significant and sustained drop (~50%) from the summer post-surge baseline of ~70. I am choosing N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable, low-demand regime. This will prevent over-ordering as we enter mid-November while ensuring sufficient service level to meet this lower, predictable demand.

Carry-over insight: November seasonal demand regime confirmed: Mean demand for P35-P39 is 34.8 units, showing high stability and a ~50% reduction from summer levels (~70).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is Women's Underwear. In Period 40, demand spiked to 56 units from a highly stable October/November baseline of ~35, causing a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). This shift (56 vs 35) suggests the beginning of a seasonal uptick associated with the late November retail period (pre-Black Friday/Holiday season). History shows that lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this rising demand phase, I will increase mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent baseline plus the new spike, while also using an explicit sigma_hat of 12 to account for increased volatility during seasonal transitions. This allows the OR engine to set a higher base stock to meet the potential festive season surge.

Carry-over insight: Late November seasonal uptick detected: Period 40 demand (56) is 60% higher than the previous 5-period stable mean of 34.8, indicating the start of holiday season demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $621.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data shows a significant shift. After a stable low period in October and early November (mean ~35), Period 40 spiked to 56, and Period 41 returned to 34. However, the current date is November 25, 2019. Historically, demand for this category (Womens Lingerie/Underwear) often increases leading into the end-of-year holiday season and Black Friday/Cyber Monday week (which typically falls on the last week of November). To account for this seasonality and the high service level required (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the stabilization after the October drop while allowing for the recent upward volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season transition: Period 40-41 demand (avg 45) is 30% higher than the October/early-November baseline (~34).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering December, typically a peak month for retail (clothing/underwear). Recent demand history shows high volatility: Period 40 spiked to 56, Period 41 dipped to 34, and Period 42 hit 66 (causing a stockout). The current date is December 2nd, which includes Cyber Monday and the start of the holiday shopping rush. The 3-period mean (P40-P42) is 52 units, while the pre-holiday baseline was ~35 units. Given the stockout in P42 and the seasonal context, I expect demand to continue scaling upward. I am setting mu_hat to 75 units using the 'explicit' method to account for the holiday peak, effectively targeting a base stock that covers the expected increase and prevents further lost sales. Sigma_hat is set to 15 (explicit) to reflect the increased holiday volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand ramp-up confirmed: Demand in P40-P42 (avg 52) is 50% higher than the Oct/Nov baseline (~34), with P42 (66) indicating a strong upward trend entering December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-December (2019/12/9). Inventory is at 62 units. Recent demand has been volatile due to holiday ramping: P40=56, P41=34, P42=66, P43=38. The average over these four periods is 48.5 units. The Carry-over insight for Period 43 noted a ramp-up toward December, but the specific drop to 38 in P43 suggests a high-variance environment typical of retail in December. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level. To capture the holiday peak while accounting for recent volatility, I will use recent_N with N=4 to set the demand mean around 48.5, which balances the high spikes (66) and the lower weeks (34-38). This ensures sufficient stock for another potential spike as Christmas approaches.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand volatility confirmed: Periods 40-43 show a mean of 48.5 with high variance (range 34-66), up from the October/Nov baseline of ~35.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 is mid-December (2019/12/16). Demand in the holiday transition period (P40-P44) has been highly volatile, with values of 56, 34, 66, 38, and 32. While there was an initial ramp-up in late November, the first two weeks of December have actually seen lower demand (38, 32). This suggests the peak for this specific underwear SKU might have been the late-November/early-December 'Pre-Christmas' shopping window. However, with only 3 periods left in the game and on-hand inventory at 42, we must prepare for potential late-December clearing or a final surge. The mean for the 'Holiday Transition' (P40-P44) is 45.2. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this holiday mean and explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (std of P40-P44 is ~14.8). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak for this SKU occurred in late November/early December (P40-P42, avg 52); mid-December (P43-P44) has seen a softening to ~35 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. Historical demand for this Ellen Thong SKU shows a holiday-related peak occurred between late November and early December (Periods 40, 42: demand 56, 66). However, demand has since softened and stabilized significantly over the last three periods (P43-P45) with demand values of 38, 32, and 33 respectively. This indicates the primary holiday surge for this SKU (likely early holiday shopping) has passed, and we are entering the post-Christmas/late December trough. The mean demand for the most recent regime (P43-P45) is 34.3 units, which aligns closely with the pre-holiday October/November baseline of ~35 units. Given that Period 46 starts on Dec 23, we should expect low demand for the following week as shopping concludes. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this stabilized lower demand regime and avoid over-ordering based on the earlier Nov/Dec spikes.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: After a late-Nov surge, demand has returned to its previous baseline, averaging 34.3 units over Periods 43-45.

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Historical data for Periods 43-46 shows demand has stabilized after the late November/early December volatility, with a mean of 29.75 units (38, 32, 33, 16). The most recent period (P46) showed a further drop to 16 units, which is expected during the post-holiday/end-of-year week. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this lower-demand phase, I am transitioning to a recent_N window of 4 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the post-holiday baseline (mean ~30) rather than the volatile surge periods (P40-P42). With on-hand inventory at 24 units, the OR engine will calculate a small safety-focused order to cover the current stabilized demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 43-46 show a return to lower demand levels with a mean of ~30 units (representing a 40% drop from the holiday peak average of ~50).
