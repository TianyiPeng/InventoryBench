Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'Tilly' women's basic t-shirt. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend over the last five weeks (148 -> 175 -> 160 -> 233 -> 308), likely indicating a seasonal buildup as we move towards spring. The most recent demand (308) is significantly higher than the early January values. Given the 0-period promised lead time and the current 0 on-hand inventory, we need to order immediately to capture the current demand level. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the recent surge (avg \u2248 234) while smoothing some noise, rather than using the full history which is skewed low by early January data. Since L=0 and we have no arrival history yet, I will use the default lead time method.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-02-18. Looking at historical demand (148, 175, 160, 233, 308, 266), we see a clear upward trend starting around early February, likely reflecting early spring/transitional demand for basic jersey T-shirts. Period 1 demand (266) exceeded our initial order/on-hand (234), resulting in a stockout. The promised lead time of 0 periods was confirmed in Period 1 (ordered and arrived same period). Given the recent growth, a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat better captures the current higher demand level (average of 308, 266, and the previous 233 is ~269) compared to the long-term mean. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (1+L) factor where L=0, forecasting demand around 280-300 to recover from the stockout and meet current velocity. A slightly higher sigma_hat via recent_N is used to account for the increased volatility during this demand ramp-up.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, and we are entering Period 3. Historically, demand for this item (Womens Everyday T-shirt) has shown a clear upward trend: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308 (pre-game) and 266, 316 (in-game). The mean demand over the last four weeks (spanning late January to late February) is approximately 281. The most recent demand (316) reflects a seasonal build-up as we move toward spring. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory has stocked out in both Period 1 and Period 2 because demand exceeded the beginning inventory. To prevent further lost sales, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime more aggressively than the full history, while L remains at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Average demand increased from ~160 in early Jan to ~300 in Feb (+87%). Transitioning to recent_N to prevent stockouts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand was ~160-230 in January but surged significantly in February to an average of ~300. In the last three periods (P1-P3), demand has been 266, 316, and 306 respectively (avg 296), all of which resulted in stockouts (ending inventory = 0) because the OR backend's order quantities (capped by historical mean) were insufficient for this new regime. The promised lead time of 0 periods is holding true (orders arrive within the same period). To prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this high-demand regime, and since we are entering March (spring season for basic tees), I expect these levels to remain elevated or increase further.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 610776002 (a basic T-shirt) shows a clear shift. January samples averaged ~179, while the last four observed periods (Feb 11 - Mar 4) show a significantly higher and stable regime: 266, 316, 306, and 283 (average ~293). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time 0). Inventory currently stands at 13 units. Since demand is stable in this new higher regime, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current mean and variance accurately. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent trend while providing enough safety stock to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 1-3 where demand exceeded supply.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Feb-Mar demand average is ~293 (+64% vs Jan). Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019-03-18), we are managing a women's basic jersey T-shirt. Historical demand shows a clear shift: early January demand averaged ~180, while the period from Feb 11 to March 11 (Periods 1-5) has stabilized at a higher mean of 284.6 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods (immediate arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 41 units with zero in-transit. Given the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic', demand is relatively stable but has shown susceptibility to stockouts when under-ordered in Feb. I will use recent_N=5 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P1-P5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the recently established mean (~285) rather than the lower January figures, while the Lead Time remains at the promised 0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, and demand for this basic jersey T-shirt has stabilized following the initial February increase. The demand over the last four periods (Periods 3-6) has been: 306, 283, 252, 270, resulting in an average of 277.75 units. This is slightly lower than the early February peak (~300) but consistently higher than Jan (~160). Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Given the high parity between profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5 (the median). To avoid stockouts while minimizing overstock, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime and recent_N for sigma_hat to accurately reflect current volatility. On-hand inventory is currently low (15 units), so an order is required to meet this week's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $278.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Women's Jersey T-shirt) experienced a significant demand spike in Period 7 (364 units), likely signaling the start of a spring seasonal increase as we move into April. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand shows a transition from an initial mean of ~160 in January/early February to a higher regime of ~284 (Periods 1-6), which has now been exceeded by the Period 7 demand. Given the product type and date (April 1st), further growth is expected. I will set L to 'default' as lead time is consistently 0. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent trend (average of ~295) while acknowledging the latest spike to 364. To prevent stockouts seen in Period 7, I will increase sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to accommodate the higher volatility observed in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal growth detected: Period 7 demand (364) is 28% higher than the previous 6-period average (~284).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is entering mid-April, which is a prime period for spring seasonal apparel. Demand has surged significantly in the last two periods: Period 7 (364 units) and Period 8 (372 units), compared to the February-March average of ~290. This confirms the 'Spring seasonal growth' noted in the Period 8 carry-over. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts (as seen in P7 and P8 where ending inventory was 0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3. This focuses on the most recent demand regime (270, 364, 372) to capture the upward momentum. This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock reflecting the current seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained spring surge confirmed: Demand for Periods 7-8 averaged 368 (+26% vs Feb-Mar baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $206.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), we are managing a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt'. Historically, demand shifted from ~160 in January to ~300 in February/March. Starting around Period 7 (late March), demand surged again (364, 372), likely due to the arrival of spring weather driving T-shirt sales. Period 9 saw a dip to 271, but the 3-period average for this 'spring' regime (Periods 7-9) is 335.6, which is notably higher than the previous baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during this volatile seasonal growth while allowing for the recent lower observation, I am using EWMA_gamma=0.7 for mu_hat. This weighting prioritizes recent values (like the 271) but retains significant memory of the preceding high-demand weeks to ensure we are prepared for potentially higher demand as the weather continues to warm up in mid-April. Since Profit = $1.0 and Holding = $1.0, the target service level is 50%; the backend will use sigma_hat to buffer against the high variance observed in this spring regime (std of last 3 periods is ~55).

Daily Reward (R_t): $307.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a seasonal growth phase as we enter late April. Demand has been volatile but high: Period 10 demand was 310, and recent history (Periods 7-10) shows an average of ~329 units. The stockout in Period 10 (sold 307 vs demand 310) indicates that current order levels are too lean for the spring surge. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current demand regime and provide a buffer for potential further spring increases, I am setting N=4 for mu_hat to focus on the last month of activity (averaging 329.25 per period). Since the lead time is 0, the backend base stock logic will be (1+0)*mu_hat. I will also use N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility and ensure a higher service level to prevent stockouts, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1 (targeting a 50% service level via OR logic, but the capped policy provides safety).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's lightweight T-shirt, which is currently entering its peak seasonal period (late April). The demand in Period 11 surged to 564, a significant jump from the previous 4-period average of ~329. This spike aligns with the warming calendar and historical trends where 'Everyday Basics' jersey items see increased velocity in spring. I am currently out of stock (Ending Inventory = 0) and have no pipeline inventory. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N=3 (encompassing the recent jump and the preceding baseline) to prioritize recent peak signals. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current demand is 70% higher than the previous month's mean, I am using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Demand spiked to 564 (+71% vs trailing 4-week avg of 329), signaling peak spring seasonality for lightweight jersey items.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and the product is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which is highly seasonal for late spring and early summer. Historical demand shows a significant spike starting in late April (Period 11: 564 units, Period 12: 424 units). This confirms the 'Spring peak' regime noted in carry-over insights. Total demand for the last two periods averaged 494 units, far higher than the previous baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since on-hand inventory is 0, a stockout likely occurred in Period 12 as demand (424) exceeded order (382). I will set mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect the current high-demand regime (targeting 500 units for Period 13) and use a high sigma_hat to provide a buffer against the high volatility observed during this seasonal ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Spring Peak Regime confirmed: Late April/Early May demand (Periods 11-12) averaged 494 units (+50% vs March/April baseline).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/5/13), we are in the peak spring/early summer season for this 'lightweight jersey T-shirt'. History shows a significant demand surge starting in late April (Period 11), with demand peaking at 564 and averaging 430 units over the last three periods (P11-P13). Although Period 13 saw a drop to 304, this follows several periods of stockouts (P10-P12) where true demand may have been suppressed or consumer behavior shifted due to lack of availability. Given the product type and date, demand is likely to remain high but volatile. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (averaging 430.6) to capture this high-demand regime while respecting the recent pullback. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the high variance observed during this transition (std dev of P11-P13 is ~130). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Since Period 13 concluded with 196 units on hand, the order will automatically adjust to bridge the gap to the target base stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which is in high seasonal demand during the spring/summer transition. In Period 14, demand was 431 units, resulting in ending on-hand inventory of 0 despite having 431 units available (inventory + arrival). This suggests the system is currently under-ordering relative to the high-demand regime. Looking at the last 4 periods (P11-P14), demand has been 564, 424, 304, and 431, averaging 430.75 units. This is a significant step up from the March/April baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during this peak season and capture the high demand while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (which targets a 50% service level via the OR backend's logic), I will use the recent 4-period window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current high-demand 'Spring Peak' regime detected in recent weeks.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is in high demand during the spring/summer transition. We have observed a significant performance shift starting around Period 11 (late April), with demand consistently higher than the early spring baseline. Specifically, demand in the last 5 periods (Periods 11-15) averaged 433 units (564, 424, 304, 431, 442). Despite a temporary dip in Period 13, demand has returned to the 430-440 range. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on the arrival history. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend quintile (q) is 0.5, which targets the median demand. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, having sold out in Period 15. To avoid stockouts in this high-demand summer seasonal phase, I am using recent_N=5 to capture this higher demand regime (approx 433 mean) while providing a sigma_hat that reflects the volatility of the recent peak (std of approx 92 for these 5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime established (Periods 11-15): Average demand has stabilized at ~433 units, following the initial spring spike. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 17 (2019/6/3), we are entering the peak summer months. Demand has stabilized into a 'Summer Regime' following the spring spike. Over the last 6 periods (Periods 11-16), demand has averaged 433 units/period, despite some high volatility (e.g., Period 11's spike to 564). The product (lightweight jersey T-shirt) is highly seasonally relevant for June. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock effectively equals the median/mean of the expected demand distribution for (L+1) periods. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized summer demand level while accounting for the recent variance, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers approximately 433 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently experiencing a peak summer surge. Period 17 demand hit 640 units, a 47% increase over the previous 5-period average (~435). This aligns with the June 3rd date, marking the start of summer heat. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio of 1:1, the OR engine targets a 50% service level (median demand). However, consistently selling out (on-hand zero at end of Period 17) indicates we are underestimating the right tail of this summer peak. To ensure we capture this shift and avoid stockouts during the June peak, I am shifting to an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the most recent demand (640) and using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed in the transition from late May to early June.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak surge detected at Period 17: Demand spiked to 640 (+47% vs previous 5-week average of 435), reflecting peak seasonality for lightweight jersey basics in early June.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We are in the middle of the summer peak for womens 'Jersey Basic' t-shirts. The demand in Period 17 (June 3) jumped to 640, while Period 18 saw a cooling to 419. Over the last 4 periods (Periods 15-18), demand has averaged 484 units, which is a significant increase over the previous 'late spring' average. Since lead time is consistently 0 periods, we need to ensure the base stock (calculated as mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) covers the current period's potential for high volatility. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), resulting in a target service level of 50%. I will use the last 4 periods to capture this recent summer regime (N=4), which includes both the massive spike and the subsequent normalization, providing a balanced forecast for the OR engine to manage the end-of-season peak risk.

Carry-over insight: Summer Peak Regime confirmed: Early June demand (Period 17) hit 640 (+47% vs avg). Mean demand for the last 4 weeks (Periods 15-18) is 484 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are in the 'Summer Peak' regime for this lightweight jersey t-shirt. Period 17 saw a demand surge to 640 units, but recent demand has stabilized near the 430-440 range (P18: 419, P19: 439). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is 475 units, reflecting the periodic spikes seen in peak summer seasonality. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this elevated summer average while smoothing out the single extreme spike from P17. Sigma_hat is set to a recent_N of 5 to account for the high volatility (standard deviation ~93) associated with these seasonal surges. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/07/01), we are entering the mid-summer season for SKU 610776002 (Jersey Basic T-shirt). Demand analysis shows that the 'Summer Peak' observed in early June (640 units in Period 17) has moderated. The last three periods (18-20) recorded demands of 419, 439, and 301, respectively. The drop to 301 in Period 20 suggests a potential deceleration as we move past the peak summer buying period or a temporary fluctuation. The average demand over the last 4 weeks is approximately 450 units, but the last 2 weeks suggest a lower mean of 370. Given the inventory on-hand of 174 and a consistent lead time of 0, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the summer average (approx 450) and allow the OR backend to adjust for the recent lower demand while maintaining a buffer for seasonal volatility. L remains 'default' (0 periods).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak moderated at Period 20: Demand dropped to 301, compared to the early June peak of 640 and the late June average of ~430.

We are currently in early July (2019/7/8), and historical demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has shown a clear downward trend following a June peak (640, 419, 439, 301, 232). This suggests the peak summer seasonality has passed and demand is returning to a baseline similar to early spring (approx 250-300 units). Demand in P20 and P21 averaged 266 units. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent deceleration while providing enough buffer for potential residual summer volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Summer peak decline confirmed: Demand has dropped for two consecutive periods (301, 232) from the June average of ~500. Demand regime appears to be returning to a ~250-300 units/week baseline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for the last three periods (301, 232, 238) confirms a significant downward shift from the June peak of 640. This aligns with the seasonal lifecycle of a lightweight jersey T-shirt as the mid-summer peak passes. The mean demand for the last three weeks is approximately 257 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent overstocking and high holding costs (which equal the profit per unit), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current lower demand regime, following the confirmed post-summer peak decline identified in Period 22. Historical standard deviation will be calculated from the same recent period to reflect current volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' continues its post-summer peak decline as we move further into late July. Recent demands for Periods 20-23 are 301, 232, 238, and 212, showing a clear stabilization at a lower level compared to the June peak (640). This aligns with the seasonal lifecycle of basic lightweight apparel. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory holding costs while maintaining service levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window of 4 (Periods 20-23) to capture this new, lower demand regime (average ~246). This allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock accurately for the current market conditions.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at post-summer baseline: Average demand for Periods 21-23 is ~227 units, reflecting a return to pre-peak demand levels for lightweight jersey basics in late July.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Historical demand analysis confirms that the peak summer season for this 'lightweight jersey T-shirt' has passed. Demand has stabilized at a lower post-summer baseline. Specifically, demand for the last four periods (Periods 21-24) has been 232, 238, 212, and 207 units, respectively. This gives a very consistent recent mean of approximately 222 units. I will use a recent_N method with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime and avoid excess holding costs. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on all historical 'conclude' messages, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts continues to decline following the summer peak in June. Demand in Period 25 was 154 units, down from the ~220-230 range observed in periods 21-24. We are currently in early August (Period 26), which typically sees a further reduction in sales for summer-weight basics as retailers transition toward autumn collections. To avoid accumulating excess inventory (holding cost equals profit per unit), I am reducing the lookback period (N) for demand estimation to capture this downward trend more aggressively. Using N=3 for mu_hat centers the forecast on the most recent low-demand signals (212, 207, 154), resulting in a mean estimate around 191 units. Sigma_hat is calculated over a slightly longer window (N=5) to ensure sufficient safety stock for potential late-summer volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand decline: Demand has dropped from ~227 (Periods 21-24) to 154 in Period 25, indicating a transition toward lower autumn baseline levels for lightweight jersey items.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are observing a significant and sustained downward trend in demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt as summer concludes. Demand has dropped from a June average of ~500 to a late July average of ~200, and most recently to 102 in Period 26. This is consistent with seasonal clearance or the end of the 'Everyday Basics' peak summer period. Since demand is rapidly declining, using a long-term average would result in significant overstocking. I am setting N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent local demand levels (212, 207, 154, 102) while reacting quickly to the cooling market. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The holding cost and profit are equal ($1.0), meaning the OR backend will target a 50% service level (z=0), effectively ordering up to the mean demand of the next period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline confirmed in August: Demand dropped to 102 in Period 26, continuing a downward trend from the late July average of ~220. This indicates a transition to autumn baseline levels for lightweight jersey basics.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt is continuing its downward trend as summer ends and autumn begins. Historical demand for the last few periods has been 207 (P24), 154 (P25), 102 (P26), and 120 (P27). The average of the last three periods is approximately 125 units, which is significantly lower than the July baseline of ~220 units. To avoid excess inventory and the associated holding costs (which equal profit for this SKU), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining responsiveness to minor fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all previous arrival data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a seasonal decline as we move from August into September (late summer to autumn transition). Following a significant peak in June (~640) and July (~230), demand in August has averaged approximately 128 units (Periods 25-28: 154, 102, 120, 158). Period 28 saw a slight uptick to 158, which caused a stockout (ending inventory 0). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts while acknowledging the lower seasonal baseline, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current August average and set sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient for the current late-summer demand regime without over-ordering for a period that is typically low-volume for lightweight jersey basics.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey t-shirt. Current history shows we are in an autumn baseline period (late August/early September). Demand significantly declined from June peaks (~500+) through July (~220) to a lower August/September baseline. Periods 25-29 show demand values: 154, 102, 120, 158, 140. The average demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 25-29) is 134.8 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). Since the demand has stabilized at this lower level after the post-summer decline, I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime while protecting against stockouts, as we have been hitting zero inventory for the last two periods (28, 29).

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline established at Period 29: Demand for the last 5 periods (25-29) has stabilized around an average of 135 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Lightweight Jersey T-shirt) is in an autumn baseline period following a significantly higher summer peak. For the last 6 periods (Periods 25-30), demand has been consistently low, averaging approximately 136.5 units per week (154, 102, 120, 158, 140, 145). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. Recent demand in the last two periods (140, 145) is very stable. Therefore, I will use a recent_N method with N=6 to capture this autumn regime (Periods 25-30) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need for responsiveness to the lower seasonal demand against the risk of stockouts during minor fluctuations in this stable phase.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/09/16. The SKU is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which has moved past its peak summer seasonality (May-August) into an autumn baseline. Historical demand over the last 7 periods (from Period 25 to 31) shows a stabilization: 154, 102, 120, 158, 140, 145, 141. The average over the last 4 periods (Periods 28-31) is approximately 146 units. We have zero on-hand inventory because the order from the previous period (137 units) was slightly less than the demand (141 units). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the demand is stable at this lower autumn volume, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this specific post-summer regime while maintaining a high service level to prevent stockouts, given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which has moved past its summer peak and is currently in an autumn baseline period. The demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 28-32) has been remarkably stable, with values of 158, 140, 145, 141, and 135, averaging approximately 144 units per week. This confirms the 'Autumn baseline' noted in the Period 30 carry-over insight. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, as every order placed has arrived within the same period. Given the high stability of the current demand regime (mu ~144, sigma ~8.5 based on the last 5 periods), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this local stability and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level near the profit/cost equilibrium.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019 (Period 34). Analysis of the autumn baseline established since Period 29 shows extremely stable demand levels for this lightweight jersey t-shirt. Historical demands for the last 5 periods (P29-P33) are 140, 145, 141, 135, and 147, resulting in a mean of 141.6 units with very low volatility. The product is currently out of stock (ending on-hand inventory = 0 at the end of Period 33). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the stability of the current autumn demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this baseline precisely and avoid overstocking as we move further into the autumn season.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The SKU is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which has moved past its spring/summer peak and into an autumn baseline. Review of the last 10 periods (Periods 25-34) shows demand has stabilized: 154, 102, 120, 158, 140, 145, 141, 135, 147, 106. The average for the last 5 periods (Periods 30-34) is 134.8 units, compared to 134.4 units for the last 10 periods. This indicates a very stable demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent conclude messages. Given the stability, I will use recent_N with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current autumn baseline effectively while providing enough samples to handle minor weekly volatility. With on-hand inventory at 36 and lead time 0, the OR backend will target the calculated base stock to meet this period's demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. We are in an autumn demand regime for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand for this item peaked in June (Summer peak) and has been declining since August. The most recent data (Periods 34-35) shows a further drop in demand to 106 and 85 respectively, compared to the September average of approximately 140. This suggests we are moving into a lower-demand late-autumn/early-winter baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory as demand cools, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this most recent downward trend for mu_hat. This will sensitize the forecast to the recent average of ~120 units, rather than the higher full-season average.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn demand decline detected: Demand in Periods 34-35 (avg 95.5) is significantly lower than the September average of ~140 (-32%). Transitioning to recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to prevent overstocking during the seasonal downturn.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' continues its late autumn decline. As of Period 37 (October 21), the last three periods of demand (P34: 106, P35: 85, P36: 84) show a clear downward shift compared to the September baseline of ~140. The average demand for the most recent regime (P34-P36) is approximately 91.6 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders in the same period they are placed. To prevent overstocking during this lower-demand seasonal phase, I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4, which covers the period of decline and provides a more reactive forecast than the full history. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a base stock levels that account for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1) while recognizing the reduced volume.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Historical demand for the last few periods (P34-P37) has been 106, 85, 84, and 109, respectively, resulting in a 4-week mean of 96. This is significantly lower than the September average of ~140, confirming the late autumn downturn previously identified. As this is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, demand is expected to remain at this lower baseline or continue to decrease as winter approaches. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking in a declining demand environment while maintaining a sufficient service level (profit and holding cost per unit are equal at $1.0), I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime established in October.

Demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) has been 106, 85, 84, 109, and 78, averaging ~92 units per week. This is a clear step down from the September average of ~140. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for small fluctuations (like the brief P37 uptick), I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current lower-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt is in a clear late-autumn decline. The average demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 35-39) is 83.4 units, significantly lower than the September average of ~140. Most recently, Period 39 saw only 61 units of demand. Given the product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, we are entering the lowest seasonal demand period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current low-demand regime and prevent overstocking. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will continue to use to maintain a lean inventory posture.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Winter low-demand regime confirmed: Average demand for Periods 35-39 has fallen to ~83 units/week, down from the September average of ~140 (-40%).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a late-autumn/winter low-demand regime, which were expected for lightweight jersey products during mid-November. Demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 36-40) has averaged 80.2 units per week (84, 109, 78, 61, 69). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining sufficient service levels for this low-demand phase, I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized mean (~80) and volume variance. The OR backend will use these to calculate the base stock and appropriate order quantity to cover Period 41 demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the winter season. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which typically sees its lowest demand during this period. Historical data shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 35 (early October), with demand consistently below 100 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 37-41) is approximately 76.8 units (109, 78, 61, 69, 67). Although Period 37 saw a slight bump to 109, the most recent four weeks show a stable downward/flat baseline near 65-70 units. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late autumn/winter stabilization while filtering out the volatile spring/summer data. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all previous 'conclude' messages.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Recent demand history indicates a potential uptick (Period 42 demand peaked at 109, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales for this 'Everyday Basic' item), despite the broader late autumn low-demand regime (~83 units/week). My carry-over insight from Period 40 identified a baseline of ~83 units. However, looking at the last 4 periods (39-42), the demand has been 61, 69, 67, and 109, averaging 76.5. The jump to 109 in Period 42 suggests a temporary promotional surge or the start of holiday demand. Given the product is a staple T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), demand typically remains low but stable through December, barring holiday peaks. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=4) with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the broader late autumn baseline while acknowledging the recent volatility, as the profit/holding cost ratio (1:1) results in a 50% target service level (z=0), essentially ordering to the mean.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019. We are in a low-demand winter regime for this lightweight jersey t-shirt. Since the autumn baseline was established around Period 40, demand has fluctuated between 61 and 109 units. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 39-43) is 73.4 units. Period 42 saw a brief spike to 109, likely due to late November promotions (Black Friday/Cyber Monday), but Period 43 immediately returned to the lower baseline of 61. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for minor holiday-related fluctuations in December, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) and continue using recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in the mid-winter period for the Northern Hemisphere. Historically, demand for this 'lightweight jersey t-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics) has been in a sustained low-demand regime since late October. The last five periods (Period 40-44) show demand values of 69, 67, 109, 61, and 55, respectively, averaging approximately 72 units/week. While Period 42 saw a temporary spike to 109 (likely related to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions), the numbers have since returned to the 50-60 range. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will continue using a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current low-demand winter baseline while accounting for the recent volatility seen in early December. This ensures we don't overstock as we approach the end of the year.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (late December). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its off-peak winter season. Demand over the last 5 periods (41-45) has been consistent with a low-demand regime, averaging 71 units per week (67, 109, 61, 55, 64). Period 42 saw a small spike (109) likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions, but demand has since returned to the ~60 unit range. The current on-hand inventory is 9 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a lean inventory while covering the current baseline, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent post-spike demand levels.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are in a low-demand winter regime for the 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt'. Although the previous two periods (P42 and P46) showed slight demand spikes to 109 and 92 units respectively (likely due to holiday shopping or end-of-year sales), the overall demand for the last 7 periods (P40-P46) has averaged approximately 74 units. Given that this is a lightweight jersey item, major growth is not expected until the spring. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while providing enough buffer for minor holiday-related fluctuations, I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable winter baseline.
