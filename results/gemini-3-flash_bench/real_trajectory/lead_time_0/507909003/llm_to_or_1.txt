Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 507909003 (Womens Blouse). The historical demand over the past 5 weeks shows a stable pattern with a slight upward trend, averaging 86.2 units per week (min 74, max 103). The current date is mid-February, transitioning from winter towards spring, which typically sees steady demand for professional attire like blouses. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and promised lead time is 0, we need to establish a baseline. I will use the mean of the available 5 samples (86.2) to set mu_hat. Since the lead time is promised as 0, the OR backend requires a base stock that covers demand for (L+1) periods, which is (0+1) = 1 period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture current demand levels while ignoring any potential older data if the history were longer.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the history, the 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that the actual lead time for this SKU is 0 periods (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). Demand for the first recorded week (2019/2/11) was 111 units, which is slightly higher than the pre-history average of ~86. The product is a women's blouse, and mid-February often sees the start of spring fashion demand. Since lead time is confirmed as 0, L remains 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (including the new Period 1 demand of 111 and the 5 pre-history samples) to account for the slightly higher recent demand trend while maintaining a stable average. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture the variability across all available data points. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using the provided profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), resulting in a 50% service level target (z=0), which the system then caps appropriately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and Period 2, we observed a massive mismatch between supply and demand. Demand in Period 1 was 111 (vs mean of ~86) and jumped to 159 in Period 2. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms orders arrive within the same period (L=0). However, the OR backend's default capping mechanism and base-stock calculation are under-ordering because they rely on the historical average (which includes lower Jan/early Feb figures) and assume the default 'promised' lead time. The current product is a women's blouse, and the date is late February, entering the Spring fashion season. Demand has surged +85% compared to the early January baseline. I will use 'explicit' values to force a higher base stock. Given the recent demand (111, 159), I'm forecasting a mean \u03bc of 160 per period. With L=0, \u03bc_hat = (1+L)*\u03bc = 160. To handle the high volatility seen in the jump from 111 back to 159, I'll set sigma_hat to 40. This aggressive stance is necessary because the profit/holding ratio is 1:1, but the cost of lost sales (stocking out at 0 on-hand twice) is high in terms of unrealized reward.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting Period 1 (Feb 11); demand increased from ~85 to 135+ (+60% average shift) coinciding with Spring season transition.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909003 (Rebecca or Delphine shirt) is experiencing a demand regime shift likely linked to the spring season. Historical samples (Jan) averaged ~85 units, but since Feb 11 (Period 1), demand has spiked to 111, 159, and 126 (averaging ~132). This represents a ~55% increase. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals in Periods 1-3 confirm that actual lead time is consistently 0. Current on-hand inventory is 34 units. To avoid stockouts observed in Periods 1 and 2, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this higher demand regime for my mean and volatility estimates. Setting L to 'default' since it aligns with the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Gently tailored shirt in a stretch cotton blend', which typically sees increased demand as spring begins in March. Previous history showed a demand surge in Feb (Periods 1-2), followed by a stabilization in Periods 3-4 (averaging ~108). The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period). Current on-hand is 41 units. Demand in Period 4 was 91, which is lower than the previous weeks, but we should maintain a safety buffer for typical spring volatility. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the demand regime since the February surge, rather than including the lower pre-February samples. With a lead time of 0, the OR engine will target L+1 = 1 week of demand. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand (z=0).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909003 (women's shirt) is currently in a high-demand phase compared to early January samples. While there was a significant surge in periods 1 and 2 (111 and 159), the demand has stabilized over the last three periods (126, 91, 92) with an average of approximately 103 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as evidenced by 'arrived... lead_time was 0' in all conclude messages. To optimize for the current regime while accounting for the high volatility observed in the early weeks of the spring transition, I am setting mu_hat using a recent window of 5 periods (Periods 1-5). This captures the recent average demand of ~116 per period. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=5 to reflect the high variance seen in the recent surge. This approach ensures the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) period demand while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering given the 1:1 Profit-to-Holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-surge; Periods 3-5 average 103 units vs Periods 1-2 average 135 units. Actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods over 5 consecutive observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand shows a volatile pattern with a mean around 117.6 units over the last 6 periods (111, 159, 126, 91, 92, 127). Specifically, Period 6 saw a stockout with demand of 127 units exceeding the 116 units available on-hand. Lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods. Since on-hand is currently 0 and there are no units in transit, we must order sufficiently to cover the current period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent demand regime (avg ~109), which balances the high spike in early February with the more moderate recent demand. Given profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the backend's default service level (0.50) is appropriate, and 'recent_N' for sigma will provide the necessary buffer for the high variance observed (std dev ~18 in recent weeks).

Carry-over insight: Recurring stockouts (Periods 1, 2, 6) indicate that previous mu_hat estimates were too conservative for this high-variance SKU. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (April 1st), the product (women's shirt) is entering the core Spring season. Analysis of demand shows high volatility (standard deviation ~23 units) and a mean of approximately 116 units across the last 7 periods (111, 159, 126, 91, 92, 127, 108). We have experienced three stockouts (Periods 1, 2, and 6) because the base stock calculation was too low to handle demand spikes. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the equal weight of profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, but due to high stockout frequency and the product's seasonal relevance in April, I will use 'recent_N' for all parameters to prioritize the most relevant data from the current 2019 season. Using N=7 incorporates the full scope of the observed Spring behavior while moving past the January pre-season baseline. This will provide a more responsive mu_hat and capture the high variance (sigma_hat) to reduce the risk of further lost sales.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing a women's blouse SKU. Historical demand analysis shows a high-variance pattern with a recent uptick: Period 8 demand reached 130, leading to a stockout. Over the last 5 periods (P4-P8), the mean demand is 109.6 units, but the last 3 periods alone (P6-P8) average 121.7 units. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent recurring stockouts observed in P1, P2, P6, and P8, I am choosing the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the stabilized post-surge average (approx 110) while providing enough safety. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=8 (the full live history) to capture the high volatility inherent in this SKU, ensuring the OR backend's service level calculation accounts for these spikes. Lead time (L) remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high with frequent stockouts (P1, P2, P6, P8); recent 3-period average (P6-P8) has risen to 121.7 compared to the earlier post-surge average of 103.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/15. This SKU (Womens Blouse) continues to experience high demand (average ~123 over the last 4 periods) and persists in hitting zero ending inventory (stocking out 5 out of 9 periods, including the last two). The 'actual' lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods. To break the cycle of stockouts and capture the full demand of this spring-relevant item, I need to adjust mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime and increase sigma_hat to account for the frequent underestimation of variability. The recent 4-period mean (P6-P9) is 119.5, and the overall mean since the spring transition (P1-P9) is 117.6. I will use recent_N=4 to anchor on the current higher-demand level and provide a higher service level.

Carry-over insight: Persistent stockout pattern (P6, P8, P9) confirms that the current demand regime (since mid-March) levels at ~120 units per week with high volatility, requiring a more aggressive mu_hat and sigma_hat strategy.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/22. The SKU is a 'Gently tailored shirt', which is seasonally relevant for spring. Historical data and Carry-over Insights indicate a high-demand regime (~120 units/avg) with significant volatility and multiple stockouts (P1, P2, P6, P8, P9). However, Period 10 saw a sudden drop in demand to 63 units, resulting in a rare inventory carry-over (57 units). This drop might be a localized fluctuation or a shift as we move deeper into spring. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the high volatility while acknowledging the recent dip, I will use a 5-period average (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window (P6-P10) captures the volatile high-demand phase (averaging ~108 units) and the recent drop, providing a more balanced forecast than the short-term 3-period average, which was prone to stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed as a primary risk for this SKU; a 5-period observation window (P6-P10) shows an average demand of 108.2 units despite the P10 dip, suggesting the high-demand regime is still active but inconsistent.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (Apr 29), we observe the SKU 507909003 ('Gently tailored shirt'). Historical patterns show the lead time is consistently 0 periods. Demand remains highly volatile; while Periods 10 and 11 saw a dip (63 and 78 units), Periods 6-9 averaged 119.5 units, leading to frequent stockouts whenever the mu_hat parameter was set too low. Given the product type and the spring season, demand is likely to remain inconsistent but biased towards higher volume. The current on-hand inventory is 31 units. To protect against another upward surge and prevent further stockouts (which have occurred in 5 out of 11 periods), I am setting mu_hat using a 6-period window (P6-P11) which covers the latest regime of high volatility, resulting in an average of approx 103 units. I am also using a 6-period window for sigma_hat to capture the high recent variance, ensuring the service level target (50% based on Profit=1, Holding=1) is sufficiently buffered by a wider distribution.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/5/06), we are observing a potential downward shift in demand for the 'Rebecca or Delphine shirt'. The last three periods (P10-P12) show demand figures of 63, 78, and 86 respectively, which is significantly lower than the ~120 units observed during the peak spring months (P6-P9). This suggests the peak demand regime associated with early spring has concluded. The average demand over the last 3 periods is 75.7 units. However, to guard against volatility and the risk of stockouts seen in earlier periods (Profit and Holding cost are equal at $1.0, implying a target service level around 50%, but the backend cap and stockouts suggest a need for a buffer), I will use a 5-period window (P8-P12) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a balanced transition from the high-demand regime (avg ~94.0 units over P8-P12) to the current lower trend. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-Spring peak (P6-P9 avg 119.5), demand has cooled in P10-P12 (avg 75.7), indicating a return to moderate levels (~80-90 units).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507909003' (Womens Blouse) has entered a more stable demand regime following the Spring peak. For Period 14 (May 13), demand history over the last 4 periods (P10-P13) shows values of 63, 78, 86, and 69, averaging approximately 74 units. This is a significant decrease from the mid-March to early-April average of ~120 units. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 25 units and the 1:1 ratio of profit to holding cost, the optimal service level is 50%. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new lower-demand regime (post-Spring cooling) while maintaining flexibility. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the peak periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: P10-P13 average demand is 74 units, a 38% decrease from the P6-P9 peak average of 119.5 units. Shift occurs as Spring inventory peak recedes.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The SKU is a 'Gently tailored shirt', which fits a steady demand profile. I am observing a clear shift in demand regimes. There was a notable peak in demand from Period 6 to Period 9 (average ~120), likely corresponding to early spring shopping. However, from Period 10 to Period 14, demand has demonstrably cooled, averaging 75.8 units. The most recent demand was 83 units, confirming the cooling trend noted in Carry-over insights. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 10-14) to capture this new, lower demand level (~76 units) while accounting for the recent stockout in Period 14. Lead time is consistently 0. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the current volatility within this cooled regime. The zero on-hand inventory entering Period 15 necessitates a precise estimate to recover without overstocking, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand surged to 111 units, which follows a stockout in Period 14 where demand was 83+ units. This indicates that the 2019/5/27 period is seeing a rebound or sustained volatility higher than the ~74 unit average noted in recent carry-overs. With On-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time consistently at 0 periods, the goal is to replenish enough to meet this potential second peak or high volatility in late May. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P10-P15) is approximately 81.67 units, but the last two periods (83, 111) suggest an upward trend compared to the earlier cooling phase. To prevent the recurring stockouts (P14, P15), I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current moderate-to-rising regime while using a recent N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility experienced in May.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late May (P14-P15); recent two-period demand average is 97 units, reversing the previous 'cooling' trend (P10-P13 avg 74).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), we observe that the SKU (Rebecca or Delphine shirt) continues to exhibit high demand volatility. After a 'cooling' period (P10-P13 avg: 74), demand surged again in P14-P15 (avg: 97), resulting in stockouts. Period 16 saw a moderate demand of 70, leaving 12 units on-hand. The current period is early June, where summer retail demand for 'Gently tailored shirt in a stretch cotton blend' typically remains steady or slightly increases due to office-wear needs in warmer weather. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent volatility and prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the cooling from the spring peak, I am selecting N=7 for recent demand samples (P10-P16). This captures the full 'post-peak' behavior, including the recent volatility. The N=7 average demand is 79.8, and the standard deviation over this period is 15.6. Using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 will set the base stock level to robustly handle the current variance without over-ordering to the levels seen during the Spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime Period 10-16: Average demand has stabilized at ~80 units (vs ~120 in Spring peak), but 27% volatility (std dev ~16) leads to frequent stockouts if safety stock is insufficient. Lead time confirmed stable at 0.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18 (June 10), we are managing a stretch cotton blouse. The historical data shows a clear shift from the high-demand Spring peak (Feb-Apr, ~120 units) to a more moderate Summer regime. Analysis of the last 8 periods (P10-P17) shows demand averaging 78.9 units (63, 78, 86, 69, 83, 111, 70, 73). While demand spiked briefly in P15, the overall trend since May has settled into a range of 70-85 units. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same-period). The 'explicit' method for mu_hat is chosen (set at 80) to reflect this stable post-peak level, while a 'recent_N' of 8 for sigma_hat captures the recent volatility (including the P15 spike) to maintain a sufficient safety stock buffer. With a critical profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 50/50 (1:1), the OR backend will target the median demand; however, given the recent stockouts in P14 and P15, ensuring the sigma_hat reflects recent variance is vital to prevent lost sales.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). The product is a women's blouse, which has transitioned from a high-demand Spring regime (~120 units/period) to a more moderate Summer regime. Historical analysis shows that since Period 10, demand has averaged approximately 76 units (763 total demand / 9 periods), but with significant weekly volatility (ranging from 54 to 111). The most recent three periods (P16-P18) show a slowing trend with an average demand of 65.7 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 14 and 15 while minimizing holding costs for this lower-margin period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 9 periods (since the regime shift at P10) to capture the current level of variability while acknowledging the lower mean. This provides a balanced base stock for the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 10 (mid-April to mid-June) has averaged 76.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17 units, confirming a shift from the Spring peak (~120 units).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Analysis of the demand history confirms a sustained shift from the high-Spring peak (~120 units) to a significantly lower and more volatile Summer regime started roughly at Period 10. The last three periods (P17-P19) show a notable downward trend in demand (73, 54, 33), with the Period 19 demand of 33 being the lowest recorded. The average demand across the current late-Spring/early-Summer window (P10-P19) is 72.2 units. Given the recent steep drop in the last period, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach allows the model to adjust downward to the cooling interest in this shirt while maintaining a safety buffer for the high variance observed throughout the season. Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling intensified at Period 19: 3-period demand average (P17-P19) dropped to 53.3 units, significantly below the P10-P16 average of 80 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st. The demand for SKU 507909003 (women's tailored shirt) has entered a significantly cooling phase since mid-June (Period 19). The demand for the last three periods has been 73, 54, 33, and 27, showing a clear downward trend from the previous regime average of ~80. The most recent three-period average (P18-P20) is 38 units. This cooling aligns with the transition from the peak spring/early summer season into mid-summer. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (z=0), meaning the base stock should strictly target the expected mean. I am setting L to 0 (stable history) and mu_hat to a recent_N of 3 to capture this local downward shift while maintaining enough stock (42 on-hand) to cover the expected lower demand. Sigma_hat is also set to a recent_N of 3 to reflect the reduced but still present volatility at this lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensified cooling from Period 19: 3-period average (P18-P20) dropped to 38.0 units, down from the P10-P16 average of 80 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507909003 (stretch cotton shirt) has entered a clear low-season regime as of mid-June (Period 19). For the last three periods (P19-P21), demand has been 33, 27, and 39 respectively, resulting in a three-period average of 33 units. This is a significant drop from the previous 'stabilized' average of 80 units seen in May and early June. The current date (2019/07/08) suggests a post-Spring/early-Summer lull for tailoring. Inventory is currently at 3 units. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 50%, meaning the base stock should align closely with the median/mean demand to minimize total costs. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this new lower demand floor and stabilize sigma_hat similarly to prevent over-ordering during this low-utilization phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 19: 3-period average (P19-P21) dropped to 33 units, representing a 58% decrease from the P10-P16 average of 80 units, marking a transition to a low-summer demand phase.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-demand summer phase, though Period 22 saw a sudden spike to 69 units (which resulted in a stockout since on-hand was only 33). Looking at the history, demand from Period 19-21 averaged 33 units. The Period 22 demand of 69 units might be a one-off fluctuation or a minor mid-summer rebound. Given the systematic cooling noted in 'Carry-over Insights' since Period 19, I will use a recent window (N=4, covering P19-P22) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the very low weeks (27, 33, 39) with the recent spike (69), resulting in a mean of 42.0 and capturing the increased volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since Period 22 ended with 0 inventory and there is nothing in-transit, a base stock approach is necessary to prevent further stockouts while respecting the lower seasonal mean.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Gently tailored shirt in a stretch cotton blend', which typically follows seasonal demand shifts. We are currently in late July (Period 24). Historical data shows a clear regime shift: the high-demand Spring peak (~120 units) ended around Period 10, followed by a moderate phase (~80 units) until Period 18, and then a significant Summer cooling phase starting Period 19. However, the last two periods (P22-P23) have shown a resurgence in demand (69 and 53 units), causing stockouts as on-hand inventory hit zero. This suggests the extreme 'low-summer' dip was temporary or is transitioning into a slightly higher mid-summer baseline. The 3-period average (P21-P23) is 53.7 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the overall lower trend compared to Spring, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent slight uptick (P19-P23 avg: 44.2) and use a recent_N sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during these stockout events.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-Summer-trough (P19-P21) is showing signs of recovery: Period 22-23 demand averaged 61 units, up from the the 33-unit average of the preceding low phase.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507909003' (Womens Blouse) is emerging from a volatile summer trough. Period 24 demand dropped to 24 units after a brief two-week recovery (avg 61 in P22-P23), following the deep trough in P19-P21 (avg 33). The recent 3-period demand (P22-P24) averages 48.7 units. However, looking at the broader post-Spring cooling phase (P10-P24), the variance remains quite high (std dev approx 22). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (averaging P20-P24: 27, 39, 69, 53, 24 = 42.4) to capture the current post-trough stabilization while remaining cautious. For sigma_hat, I'll use a slightly longer window (N=10) to account for the frequent stockouts seen when volatility isn't adequately buffered, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level plus the backend's inherent safety stock logic).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility post-Summer trough (P19-P21) remains high; Period 22-24 demand shows frequent fluctuations between 24 and 69 units, requiring conservative mu_hat but robust sigma_hat.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a recovery phase following a summer trough (Periods 19-21, avg ~33). Since Period 22, demand has increased but remains highly volatile, with recent samples showing 69, 53, 24, and 50 units. The most recent demand (P25) was 50 units, and the average over the last four periods (P22-P25) is 49 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18 units. We are starting Period 26 with 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in P25. Given the high volatility (36% CV recently) and the risk of stockouts seen throughout the history, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the post-trough stabilization (~50 units per period) and use an explicit sigma_hat to provide a robust safety buffer against the observed volatility. Actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer trough (starting Period 22) has stabilized at a higher mean of ~50 units compared to the trough average of 33, but maintains high volatility (std dev ~18).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. This SKU (Womens Blouse) has transitioned from a summer trough (P19-P21 avg 33) into a more volatile recovery phase starting around P22. Over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 54.4 units, but with significant weekly swings (69, 53, 24, 50, 76), leading to stockouts in P22, P23, P25, and P26. The stockout at P26 (demand 76 vs on-hand 49) confirms that the demand has shifted higher than the 'summer-low' regime. To prevent further lost sales during this higher-volatility phase, I am resetting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (N=5) to capture the upward shift in mean and the increased standard deviation. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed post-summer trough: Period 22-26 average demand rose to 54.4 units (+65% vs trough), accompanied by high volatility that caused 4 stockouts in 5 weeks.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a recovery phase following a summer trough. Demand in Period 27 spiked to 136, significantly exceeding all recent expectations and the previous recovery average of ~54 units. This spike suggests either high volatility or the start of a late-summer/early-fall demand surge (potentially Back-to-School or seasonal transition for this 'stretch cotton blend' shirt). Since Period 22, the SKU has faced frequent stockouts (Periods 22, 23, 25, 26, 27) despite increasing orders, indicating that my parameters are consistently lagging behind the actual demand variance. To address this, I am shifting mu_hat to a more aggressive calculation and increasing sigma_hat to account for the massive volatility seen in Period 27. I will use the last 6 periods (P22-P27) to capture this recovery regime, which yields an average of ~68 units (boosted by the outlier) and significant standard deviation. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge detected in Period 27 (136 units), substantially higher than the P22-P26 recovery average (54.4 units). Persistent stockouts since P22 indicate the current low-inventory strategy is failing to capture potential sales in this high-volatility recovery phase.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a high-demand recovery/growth phase following the summer trough. Period 27 recorded 136 units and Period 28 recorded 85 units, both significantly above the previous 'recovery' average of 54.4 units. Frequent stockouts (ending inventory of 0 in P25, P26, P27, P28) confirm that the base-stock levels are too low to capture current volatility. I am shifting the mu_hat forecast to an explicit value of 110 (approximately the average of the last two high periods) and setting sigma_hat to an explicit 40 to provide a robust safety buffer against the high volatility (std dev has spiked recently). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Period 27-28 average demand is 110.5 units, a 103% increase over the P22-P26 recovery average (54.4), signaling a return to Spring-level demand volumes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a high-demand recovery/surge status as of late August (Period 27-29), with demand averaging 102.7 units over the last three periods, a significant increase from the summer trough. The product (blouse/shirt) likely sees a back-to-work or Autumn season surge starting in September. Recent history shows frequent stockouts when inventory is kept low, so a more aggressive mu_hat is required. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this new regime (Period 27-29 demand: 136, 85, 87) which averages ~103 units. Given the high volatility observed in surge periods, I am setting sigma_hat to recent_N=3 to ensure the safety stock is high enough to cover potential spikes like the 136-unit demand seen in Period 27. Lead time is stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge starting Period 27 confirmed: P27-P29 average demand is 102.7 units, reflecting a shift to an Autumn/Back-to-work regime (+89% vs P22-P26 average of 54.4).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507909003' (Womens Blouse) has entered a high-demand autumn/back-to-work regime starting around Period 27 (mid-August). Demand in Period 30 reached a massive peak of 164 units, far exceeding the recent 3-period average (P27-P29) of 102.7 units. This volatility has led to a stockout in Period 30, with 103 units sold out of 164 demanded. Given the date (Sept 9) and the product type, we are likely in a seasonal peak. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, I am shifting mu_hat to an explicit value of 140 (reflecting the strength of the recent surge) and increasing volatility (sigma_hat) to 40. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. These parameters will raise the base stock level to capture the elevated demand while acknowledging the high risk of stockouts during this phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge intensified: Period 30 demand reached 164 units, compared to the P27-P29 average of 102.7. The regime shift starting Period 27 is characterized by very high volatility (std dev > 30).

This averages 114.2 units per period, a significant increase from the summer trough. The volatility (sigma) is also exceptionally high, with demand swinging between 85 and 164 units. Given that recent estimates (P27-P31) capture this new regime better than the long-term history, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for both the higher mean and the intense volatility observed in the last month. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful same-day arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge (starting P27) stabilized with high volatility; P27-P31 average demand is 114.2 units (+110% vs summer trough) with a standard deviation of approximately 35 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an Autumn demand regime (starting Period 27) which has replaced the Summer trough. Recent demand (Periods 27-32) shows a mean of 110.8 units compared to the summer average of ~33-54 units. This new phase is characterized by extreme volatility (std dev ~33.5). The most recent demand was 94 units, maintaining the elevated level. Given the high volatility and the frequency of stockouts when inventory is thin, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this regime shift accurately. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which I will reflect using the recent_N method to ensure responsiveness to any future delays.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed since Period 27: Average demand stabilized at ~111 units (+100% vs summer recovery) with high volatility (std dev ~33.5) and frequent demand spikes.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an Autumn demand regime (starting Period 27) characterized by a mean demand of approximately 120 units and high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 35). Period 33 confirmed this with a demand of 168 units leading to another stockout. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistently actualized, the OR backend requires a 1-period lookahead (1+L=1). I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (P27-P33) to capture this regime shift accurately (mean \u2248 119). Given the frequent stockouts and high variance (stdev \u2248 35) in this period, I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 45 to increase the service level and buffer against the observed spikes (85, 87, 94, 99, 136, 164, 168). This aggressive safety stock is justified by the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio, which target a 50% service level by default, but requires higher \u03c3\u0302 to prevent frequent lost sales in this specific high-swing regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-work demand regime (P27-P33) shows mean demand of 119.0 units with high volatility (std dev ~35), leading to frequent stockouts (P27, P28, P30, P33).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Autumn/Back-to-work demand regime for the 'Gently tailored shirt', which began around Period 27 (mid-August). The demand in this regime is characterized by a significantly higher mean and very high volatility compared to the summer months. Over the last 8 periods (P27-P34), demand has averaged 115.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 33.7. The most recent demand (P34) was 83 units, following a spike of 168 in P33. Frequent stockouts (P27, P28, P30, P33) reinforce the need to maintain a high base stock to capture these unpredictable spikes, especially since lead time is reliably 0. I will use a 8-period window (N=8) to capture the full extent of this Autumn regime's mean and volatility while excluding the irrelevant low-demand summer trough.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an Autumn/Back-to-work demand regime that began around Period 27. Demand from P27 to P35 has averaged 115 units with significant volatility (standard deviation of ~33), including spikes as high as 168. Period 35 demand was 103, following a lower 83 in P34, suggesting the high-demand phase remains intact but unstable. Given the Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the critical service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the mean. To account for the frequent stockouts observed in this regime (P27, P28, P30, P33) and the high volatility, I am using a recent_N of 9 (P27-P35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current state accurately. Lead time is stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-work regime (P27-P35) average demand is 115.0 units with high volatility (std dev ~33.2). Service level is balanced (profit=holding), but frequent spikes necessitate robust volatility estimates to avoid stockouts.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an Autumn/Back-to-work demand regime that began around Period 27. Analyzed data from P27 to P36 shows a mean demand of 110.4 units with a high standard deviation of approximately 33.7 units. The most recent observation (P36) showed demand of 74, which is lower than the mean, but given the high volatility (spikes of 136, 164, 168 in this period), we must maintain high coverage. Lead time is consistently 0. Using recent_N with N=10 (covering the P27-P36 regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the current mean and the significant volatility required to prevent stockouts while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The 'Autumn/Back-to-work' regime that began at Period 27 (late August) has shown a softening in the last two periods (P36: 74 units, P37: 47 units). However, the carry-over insights and historical evidence from Spring (P1-P9) demonstrate that this SKU is highly volatile and prone to sudden demand spikes (e.g., P30: 164, P33: 168). While recent demand suggests a cooling trend, behaving too conservatively resulted in multiple stockouts during previous transitions (P22, P23, P26, P27). To balance the high holding cost (equal to profit) against the risk of lost sales in a high-volatility environment, I will use a window of the last 11 periods (P27-P37) to capture the full breadth of the Autumn regime (including its current softening). This provides a \u03bc\u0302 (mean) of approximately 104 units and captures the high variance (\u03c3 \u2248 40) required for safety stock. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (starting P27) shows signs of cooling in late October (P36-P37 avg 60.5 vs P27-P35 avg 115.0), but remains characterized by extreme volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering November (Period 39), following a confirmed cooling in the Autumn/Back-to-work regime. Specifically, the last three periods (P36-P38) show demands of 74, 47, and 49 (mean ~56.7), which is a significant drop from the P27-P35 average of 119.0. This cooling was previously flagged in Carry-over Insight Period 38. While volatility has been a defining characteristic of this SKU, the recent trend suggests the high-demand Autumn peak has subsided. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this current lower mean of ~57 units per period. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to capture the reduced variance of the immediate three periods, though the backend's inherent service level calculation (based on profit=holding) will maintain a balanced position. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed late October/early November: Period 36-38 average demand dropped to 56.7 units, a 52% decrease from the Autumn peak average (P27-P35) of 119.0 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-November. Carry-over insights from Periods 38 and 39 confirmed a demand cooling phase following the Autumn peak. Specifically, demand has dropped from an average of 115.0 units (P27-P35) to 55.5 units across the last four periods (P36-P39: 74, 47, 49, 52). This lower regime is currently very stable (standard deviation of ~11.8 in this 4-period window). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the optimal service level is 50%, which the backend achieves by setting the base stock to mu_hat. Given the clear and sustained shift to this lower demand level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect this new regime while maintaining responsiveness to the low volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical data confirms a significant demand regime shift starting around Period 36 (mid-October), where demand cooled from the Autumn peak (~115 units) to a much lower average. Over the last five periods (P36-P40), demand has been: 74, 47, 49, 52, 44, yielding an average of 53.2 units. This shift is consistent with late Autumn seasonality for a cotton-blend blouse. While the mean has dropped, there is still moderate volatility. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the target service level is 50%, but to mitigate the risk of stockouts during minor fluctuations and considering the 0-period lead time stability, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stabilized cooling phase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further in November: P37-P40 average demand is 48.0 units, confirming the cooling trend identified in P39 and marking a transition to a low-winter demand baseline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 507909003 has transitioned into a low-winter regime since Period 37 (late October). Over the last five periods (P37-P41), demand samples are [47, 49, 52, 44, 57], resulting in a recent mean of 49.8 units. The period 41 demand of 57 units caused a minor stockout (on-hand was 54), confirming that while the mean is lower, volatility remains a factor. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the OR backend targets by default. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 5-period window (N=5) to reflect the current stabilized winter demand baseline while capturing the most recent variance.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked to 141 units, which is significantly higher than the low-winter baseline of ~48 units identified in Period 41. This suggests a pre-holiday or 'Cyber Monday' surge (2019/11/25-12/2). Based on the high volatility of this SKU, I am shifting mu_hat to capture this potential holiday momentum, moving from the recent cooling trend to a more robust level. I will use recent_N=6 to include the current surge while keeping the baseline in context, and set sigma_hat to recent_N=6 to reflect the increased volatility (standard deviation ~36-40 range). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected Period 42: Demand rose to 141 units from a previous 4-week average of 48 units (+194% shift), likely corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Monday shoppers.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering Period 44 (Dec 9), reflecting the post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Period 42 saw a major demand spike (141 units), followed by a return to baseline in Period 43 (52 units). Historical data from Jan/Feb 2019 suggests a pre-spring baseline of roughly 75-90 units. I need to balance the potential for holiday-related gift demand (December) against the sharp drop seen immediately after the November peak. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to average the spike (141) and the correction (52), resulting in a mean forecast of 96.5. This captures the current regime's higher potential compared to the November trough (~48) but respects the recent cooling. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=10 for sigma_hat to provide a robust buffer against the high volatility (141 followed by 52) which has characterized this product's performance throughout the year.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed in Period 42 (141 units, +194% vs Nov avg), followed by a sharp stabilization in Period 43 (52 units). Current December regime suggests a mean of ~96 units with high return-to-baseline volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in the mid-December period following the Black Friday/Cyber Monday holiday spike (141 units in Period 42) and a subsequent stabilization to ~52 units in Periods 43-44. Historical analysis of this 'Rebecca or Delphine shirt' shows high volatility and significant demand spikes during transitional or holiday periods. While the last two periods averaged 52 units, we must remain prepared for potential late-December holiday shopping or pre-January clearance effects. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods over many weeks, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the backend's target service level is 50%, which may be too lean given the history of stockouts. To protect against late-December spikes while recognizing the recent stabilization, I will set mu_hat using a recent 4-period window (P41-P44) which includes the holiday spike and the subsequent cooling (avg ~75.5 units). I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 40 to account for the extreme volatility observed during holiday transitions (141 vs 52).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, entering the final week before the Christmas holiday. Historically, this SKU (a gently tailored shirt) saw a massive spike in Period 42 (Black Friday week) with demand reaching 141 units, but has since stabilized around 51 units (P43-P45 average: 51.3). Given the lead time is reliably 0 periods, the objective is to satisfy current demand while accounting for potential late-holiday volume or post-holiday clearance activity. Period 45 demand was 50, and Period 44 was 52, showing a consistent plateau. I will use a recent_N (N=4) method for mu_hat to capture the post-spike stabilization (P42 surge to P45 stabilization). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to account for the high volatility introduced by the Period 42 outlier, ensuring sufficient cushion against a potential pre-Christmas surge. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday surge stabilization confirmed: Following the Period 42 spike (141 units), demand has stabilized over three periods (P43-P45) at an average of 51.3 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering Period 47 (Dec 30), which is the bridge between the Christmas/New Year holiday period and the early January return-to-office phase. Historical data from early 2019 (P1-P2) showed significant demand (111 and 159 units) in mid-February, but January data is sparse. Following the Black Friday spike (P42: 141 units), demand has stabilized remarkably over the last four periods (P43-P46) with a mean of 51.5 and almost zero variance (52, 52, 50, 52). While current demand is low, the upcoming post-holiday period historically sees a surge in 'Womens Tailoring' as customers return to work. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0. I will maintain a mu_hat based on the recent stable period (N=4) but will increase sigma_hat explicitly to account for potential early January demand volatility seen in professional/office wear categories.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday stabilization: Periods 43-46 show highly consistent demand averaging 51.5 units (std dev < 1), following the P42 holiday spike.
