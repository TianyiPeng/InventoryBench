Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a 'Nora T-shirt', an everyday basic item. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend over the last five weeks: 0, 0, 11, 17, 38. This suggests a transition from a product launch or seasonal dormancy into an active selling phase as we move toward Spring. The mean over those 5 weeks is 13.2, but the most recent observation of 38 is much higher. Promised lead time is 0. Since the inventory is currently 0 and demand is accelerating, I will use a conservative approach for the first period by using the most recent 3 observations (11, 17, 38) to capture the trend, while acknowledging the high volatility (sigma). Setting N=3 for demand and volatility to bridge the gap between early zeros and current activity.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). Looking at the history, this is the 'Nora T-shirt', an Everyday Basic item. We saw a significant demand surge in Period 1 (demand=54) compared to the historical samples (0, 0, 11, 17, 38). The item is a basic jersey t-shirt, and demand appears to be ramping up as we approach spring. Period 1 had a lead time of 0 periods (same-day arrival). However, because we started with 0 on-hand and the order arrived *after* the decision phase but was still able to satisfy some demand in Period 1, we actually stocked out (sold 22, demanded 54). We currently have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit because the Period 1 order already arrived and was sold out. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to capture this upward trend (N=3 includes the last three weeks: 17, 38, 54). For the lead time, I will stick with the promised 0 periods as confirmed in Period 1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is the Nora T-shirt, a women's everyday basic. We are entering late February (Period 3: 2019-02-25), heading into the Spring/Summer season where demand for short-sleeved jerseys typically rises. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 0 (Jan 7) -> 0 -> 11 -> 17 -> 38 (Feb 4). In the last two game periods, demand exploded to 54 (Period 1) and 100 (Period 2), resulting in stockouts because on-hand inventory was zero at the start of both periods (lead time 0 allows same-period arrival, but the OR backend's order was based on lower historical means). Observed lead time is 0. Demand is accelerating rapidly (38 to 54 to 100). I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat to capture this momentum, setting it at (1+L) * 130 to prevent further stockouts as spring approaches. Sigma is also increasing with volume, so I will adjust it using recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility of the current growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand accelerated from ~15 in late Jan to 100 by mid-Feb, indicating strong early spring seasonality for the Nora T-shirt.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598038' (Nora T-shirt) is exhibiting a clear upward trend as we enter the spring season (March). Historical demand grew from ~15 in late Jan to 54 (P1), 100 (P2), and 113 (P3). The product is a staple 'Womens Everyday Basic' which typically sees increased velocity in spring. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). In Period 2, we lost 63 units of demand due to insufficient stock, and in Period 1 we lost 32. Period 3 was the first period we met demand (113). Given the consistent growth and the start of March, I anticipate demand will continue to rise or at least stabilize at this higher level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new higher-demand regime (averaging ~89), while setting an 'explicit' mu_hat slightly higher (130) to both cover the current trend and prevent stockouts seen in P1/P2. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Average weekly demand increased from <20 (late Jan) to ~90+ in Feb/March across Periods 1-3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is in a high-demand spring regime. Over the last four periods (Feb 11 - Mar 4), demand has been 54, 100, 113, and 88, averaging 88.75. The most recent two periods show a stabilization around ~100 units (mean 100.5). Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With current on-hand inventory at 42 and zero in-transit, we need to order to meet the expected demand for the upcoming week. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the shift to ~100 units/period while accounting for small fluctuations. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility (std dev of 100, 113, 88 is ~12.5). This ensures the base stock (mu + z*sigma) covers the (L+1)=1 period of demand effectively.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is in a clear spring seasonal demand regime. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand samples since the season started are 54, 100, 113, 88, and 56. The most recent demand (56) shows a cooling from the peak of 113, but demand remains significantly higher than the initial January samples (<20). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend will aim for a 50% service level (z=0). To avoid over-stocking while maintaining coverage for this seasonal item, I am using recent_N=5 to capture the full spring pattern (avg ~82). With L=0, mu_hat represents the expected demand for the current period. On-hand is 45, and pipeline is 0, so the backend will order approximately (82 - 45) = 37 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is in its spring selling season. History shows a strong demand spike in mid-February followed by stabilization. Current demand (Periods 3-6) ranges between 56 and 113, with an average of approximately 82 units per week. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). At the start of Period 7, on-hand inventory is 12 units. Since L=0, we need to cover the current period's demand (Period 7). I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the demand mean and variance within the current stable spring regime (Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6), which better reflects current levels compared to the initial ramp-up period.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in March (Periods 4-6) at an average of ~72 units/week, down from the peak of 113 in Period 3, but significantly higher than pre-Feb levels.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of April 1st (Period 8), the Nora T-shirt is entering the core spring season. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 7 (114 units), potentially signaling a new seasonal upward trend compared to the March average of ~72. Stockouts in Period 7 (sold 82 vs demand 114) mean we have 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent April surge and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the high-demand periods (P5-P7), while using explicit sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility observed in the transition from March to April.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing with the onset of April: Period 7 saw a 60% jump in demand (114) relative to the Period 4-6 average (72), leading to stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing high demand as we enter the spring season (April). In the last two periods (Period 7 and 8), demand was 114 and 107 units respectively, leading to total stockouts because the supply was insufficient. The current status shows 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit, meaning we are completely starting from scratch for Period 9. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, I will set mu_hat using the last 2 periods of high demand (average ~110.5) to capture the current spring regime. Since Profit ($1) is equal to Holding Cost ($1), the OR backend will target a service level of 50% (z=0). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=2 ensures we prioritize recent high-demand volatility and mean to aggressively capture the current trend without being weighted down by lower March sales.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand regime confirmed for April: Periods 7-8 average demand is 110.5, a significant increase from the March average of ~72.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing a sustained high-demand regime in April, with the last three periods (P7-P9) recorded as 114, 107, and 122 respectively (average 114.3). Despite increasing order quantities, we have been stocking out for three consecutive periods because demand has consistently exceeded our on-hand inventory plus same-day arrivals. Lead time is consistently 0 (same-period arrival). For Period 10 (mid-April), I am transitioning to a recent_N strategy (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current April trend of ~114 units, and an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during these stockouts. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level high enough to satisfy this elevated demand and avoid a fourth consecutive stockout.

Carry-over insight: April high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 7-9 average 114.3 units/week, with frequent stockouts suggesting latent demand may be higher.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing a clear upward demand trend as we move further into spring (late April). Historical demand for the last four periods (P7-P10) has been 114, 107, 122, and 133, all of which resulted in total stockouts (ending inventory = 0). This confirms that actual demand exceeds these sales figures. Demand has increased by approximately 24% over the last four weeks. To capture this growth and account for the high cost of lost sales (due to stockouts), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to anchor to the current April regime, while using an 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility and latent demand observed during this period. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in late April (Periods 9-10), with sales reaching 133 units despite stockouts, indicating a sustained upward trend from the early April average of 110.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing a strong spring/summer seasonal surge as we enter May. Period 11 demand reached 164 units (a 23% increase over Period 10), resulting in another stockout. History shows a clear upward trend from March (~72) to early April (~114) to late April (~148 over last 2 weeks). Lead time is consistently 0. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine targets the mean demand. However, frequent stockouts indicate the 'observed' demand is lower than the 'actual' latent demand. To prevent further stockouts during this high-growth phase, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the most recent demand (164) plus a growth factor for May, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in the last 4 periods (N=4).

Carry-over insight: May seasonality confirmed: Demand for jersey basics (Nora T-shirt) continues to accelerate, with Period 11 reaching a new peak of 164 units (+23% WoW). Stockouts in 5 consecutive periods (P7-P11) confirm demand is outstripping supply and latent demand likely exceeds 160 units/week.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6th, 2019. The Nora T-shirt is in its peak seasonal window (Late Spring/Early Summer). History shows a clear upward trend in demand: March averaged ~72 units, April averaged ~114-133 units, and Period 11 reached 164. Period 12 demand was 150, which is the first drop in six periods but still highly elevated compared to earlier months. The item has frequently stocked out (Periods 7-11), meaning latent demand likely matches or exceeds the 150-165 range. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 13, I will set mu_hat using recent_3 to capture the High-Demand April/May regime (Avg(133, 164, 150) = 149). Since L=0, mu_hat represents one period of demand. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during this seasonal ramp-up. This configuration ensures the base stock (target inventory) is high enough to satisfy peak seasonal demand while accounting for recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained peak demand regime for May: Mid-April to Early-May demand (P10-P12) averaged 149 units/week, establishing a new baseline for late-spring performance.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt, a jersey basic, transitioned into a high-demand regime throughout April and early May. Period 12 saw demand peaking around 150-160 units, which then slightly cooled to 118 units in Period 13 as we transitioned further into May. However, historical stockouts in Periods 7-11 suggest that latent demand is likely higher than the sales figures show. We are currently in mid-May (2019/5/13). Given the consistent 0-period lead time, the strategy is to maintain a high base stock to avoid further lost sales while recognizing the slight pullback in the most recent period's demand (118). I will calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods: P9-P13), which captures the step-up to the 110-160 range. Lead time is reliably 0, so L=0.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20th. We are in a high-demand spring/summer regime for the Nora T-shirt. Historically, demand peaked in late April/early May (P11-P12 at 150-164 units) and has recently stabilized. The last three periods (P12-P14) show an average demand of 130 units (150, 118, 122), suggesting a slight cooling from the early May peak but still significantly higher than March levels. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is low (16 on-hand), so we need to set parameters that cover the current forecast. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers P10-P14, average ~137) to capture the current late-spring baseline while respecting the slight downward trend from the P11 peak. For sigma_hat, N=5 captures the recent volatility (std ~19), ensuring enough safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 7-11.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt, a women's jersey basic, is entering the late-May period (5/27). Demand remains high and volatile as summer approaches, with Period 15 recording 153 units, resulting in another stockout (ending inventory 0). The last three weeks (P13-P15) show demand of 118, 122, and 153, averaging 131 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To account for the recent upward trend and avoid stockouts during this peak season, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current demand intensity (~131 units) and using an explicit value for sigma_hat to provide a safety buffer against the observed volatility (std of the last 3 periods is ~19; using 25 to be conservative).

Carry-over insight: Late-May demand surge confirmed: Period 15 demand reached 153 units, a 25% increase over the mid-May average (P13-P14), returning the SKU to a stockout state.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is in a sustained high-demand phase coinciding with the peak summer season (early June). Demand in Period 16 was 147 units following a Period 15 peak of 153. Stockouts have occurred in the last two periods, indicating that actual demand likely exceeds the sales figures of 138 and 131. The 4-week average (P13-P16) is 135 units, while the peak demand observed is 164 (P11). To recover from stockouts and prevent further lost sales during this high-season regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P11-P16) which captures the current high-demand stability (~142 avg). Lead time remains consistently 0. I will increase sigma_hat using the last 6 periods to account for the supply-side volatility caused by stockouts and latent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-summer demand confirmed for June: Last 6 periods (P11-P16) average 142 units/week, with frequent stockouts suggesting true demand floor is >140.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is in a high-demand summer regime (June). In Period 17, demand was 123 units, slightly lower than the recent average of ~140, but frequent stockouts in the preceding periods (P15, P16) suggest that true demand remains elevated. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P12-P17) is approximately 135 units, while the average of the last 3 periods (P15-P17) is 141 units. To reflect the actual market pressure and mitigate persistent stockout risks during the peak summer month of June, I will use a recent demand window (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). Setting N=6 for mu_hat captures the high summer volume while accommodating recent variability.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is in the peak summer demand phase (mid-June). While Period 18 saw a dip to 82 units, this follows a long stretch of demand averaging ~140 units (P11-P17 average is 141). The dip in Period 18 is likely an outlier or a temporary fluctuation rather than a regime shift downward, given the product type (short-sleeve jersey basic) and current date (June 17). To avoid overreacting to one low data point which would lead to stockouts if demand rebounds to the 140+ level, I am using a recent_N of 8 periods for mu_hat. This window captures the high-demand summer regime (starting from the spike in P11) while including the recent dip to moderate the forecast. L is set to default as lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=8 to capture the increased volatility observed during the summer peak.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is currently in a sustained high-demand summer regime. Over the last 5 completed periods (P15-P19), demand has averaged 126.4 units/week (153, 147, 123, 82, 127). The lower demand in Period 18 (82) appears to be an outlier compared to the surrounding weeks which remain above 120. As we are in late June (P20), demand is expected to remain firm or potentially soften slightly as the peak summer season progresses, but the risk of stockout remains high given the low on-hand inventory (6 units). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (N=5 corresponds to the June/Late May period) to capture the current mean of ~126. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to account for the increased volatility seen recently. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, L is left at default.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is in a high-demand summer regime. Period 20 (late June) saw demand of 144 units, which resulted in a stockout (on-hand is currently 0). Over the last 4 periods (P17-P20), the average demand is 119 units, but this includes a dip in Period 18 and a supply-constrained sale in Period 20. The most recent 2 weeks (P19-P20) average 135.5 units. As we move into July, historically a peak month for summer basics like jersey t-shirts, demand is expected to remain high or increase. I will use an explicit lead time of 0 (consistent with historical record) and set mu_hat to 140 (reflecting the 135.5 average of the last two weeks plus a small buffer for latent demand/seasonality). Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the volatility seen in the June period (82 to 144).

Carry-over insight: July high-summer demand peak confirmed: Period 20 demand (144) and stockout environment suggest current demand remains at or above 140 units/week.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is currently in a sustained high-summer demand regime (July). Recent demand history shows a slight cooling from the extreme peaks of late April/May, but it remains significant. Period 20 saw demand of 144 (stockout), while Period 21 saw a dip to 113. Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand has averaged 117.8 units, though this includes some stockout periods that likely suppress the actual mean. Given the 'July high-summer demand peak' noted in carry-over insights, I am prioritizing a recent window to capture current seasonality while accounting for the recent variability. I will use a recent_N of 5 to balance the 144 spike and the 113 dip, which provides a robust estimate for the current mid-summer period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 21 concluded periods. The profit to holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level (q) of 0.50, which the OR engine will target with these parameters.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The Nora T-shirt continues to exhibit high-summer demand patterns. Recent demand history shows a slight cooling from the peak of 140+ units: P18 (82), P19 (127), P20 (144), P21 (113), and P22 (84). While there is some volatility (standard deviation remains high), the average demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is approximately 110 units. This is lower than the June peak of 142 but remains significantly higher than the spring baseline. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, meaning we aim for the median demand. Lead time has consistently been 0. I will anchor mu_hat to the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) to reflect the slight July decline while keeping a reasonable N value to buffer against the identified volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening in July: post-peak June demand (avg 142) has moderated to an average of 110 units/week over the first half of July (P18-P22).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing high late-July demand following a brief dip in mid-July. Period 23 saw a demand (117) that exceeded available inventory (110). While the Carry-over Insight from Period 23 suggested a softening to around 110, the most recent period shows demand is actually slightly higher and the SKU is back in a stockout position. The date is July 22, the height of the summer season for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 6 periods (P18-P23), which is approximately 111. However, since P23 was a stockout at 110 with actual demand of 117, and the 6-period mean is slightly lower due to the P18-P19 outliers, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the most recent July stabilization (Avg of P20-P23 demand is ~114.5). This slightly higher baseline accounts for the persistent high-summer demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt, a jersey basic, has entered a late-summer softening phase as of mid-July. After peaking alongside high temperatures in June (avg ~142), demand has normalized. Over the last three cycles (P22-P24), demand has averaged 102.3 units (84, 117, 106), significantly lower than the June peak but relatively stable. The stockout in P23 was marginal (demand 117 vs starting inventory 110), suggesting we are nearing the true demand floor for this period. Given the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this stabilization (P21-P24 average: 105), while using a slightly wider sigma (recent_N=6) to account for the volatility seen during the July transition (standard deviation of ~24). This ensures sufficient stock for local spikes while acknowledging the overall seasonal downtrend.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed for late July: Average demand for P22-P24 is 102 units, indicating a ~25% reduction from the June peak of 142.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th. Demand for the Nora T-shirt has stabilized in the 100-110 units/week range following the July summer peak, consistent with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 25. Specifically, demand in the last three periods (P23-P25) was 117, 106, and 104 units, averaging 109 units. While the late July average was slightly lower, the start of August often maintains stable 'back-to-school' or late-summer demand for basics. I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this stabilized August transition (covering Periods 22-25: 84, 117, 106, 104). Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods consistently through history. On-hand inventory is near zero (1 unit), requiring a full restock to the base stock level. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current period's stabilized volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 12, 2019. The Nora T-shirt (a jersey basic) is entering the late-summer period. Historical demand analysis shows a stabilization in July following the June peak. Specifically, the average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is 98.2 units, which represents a significant cooling from the early summer peak of ~140. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. Recent demand has been: 84, 117, 106, 104, 83. The most recent period (P26) showed a further softening to 83 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this stabilized but slightly declining late-summer demand regime. This will set the base stock to cover the expected demand and variance of this new level, preventing excess inventory as we move towards the end of the summer season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization confirmed for late summer: Average demand for P22-P26 is 98.2 units/week, down ~30% from the June peak (142).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing a clear late-summer demand decline as we enter August. Period 27 demand dropped to 69 units, following a trend of lower demand since the July peak (averaging ~98 units since P22). The last three completed periods (P25-P27) show a mean demand of 85.3 units (104, 83, 69). Given the date (August 19), demand for basic short-sleeve jersey t-shirts is likely to continue softening as the season transitions toward autumn. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this recent downtrend and stabilize inventory levels. With a promised lead time of 0 and consistent arrival history, L remains at default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for mid-August: Average demand for P25-P27 has declined to 85.3 units/week, a ~15% drop from the late July baseline (98) and a significant reduction from the June peak (142).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Demand for the Nora T-shirt (a jersey basic) is continuing its seasonal decline from the June high-summer peak. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P25-P28) is 82.75 units, closely matching the carry-over insight of a shift to ~85 units/week in mid-August. Period 28 demand was 75 units, slightly lower than the recent average, confirming the softening trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory as summer ends, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this lower baseline, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility. This will ensure the base stock levels adjust quickly to the decreasing demand while maintaining a buffer against standard variance.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Demand for the Nora T-shirt, a jersey basic, has been on a sustained downward trend since its peak in June (avg ~142). Recent demand history confirms a significant cooling: Period 22-26 averaged 98.2 units, and the most recent three periods (P27-P29) averaged 69.3 units (69, 75, 64). This matches expectations for late-summer/early-autumn seasonality for short-sleeve basics. I am using a recent_N window of 4 (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower late-August baseline (avg ~73) while maintaining a small buffer for variance. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. These parameters will adjust the base stock downward to prevent excess holding costs as the product exits its peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late August/early September: Average demand for P27-P29 has declined to 69.3 units/week, a ~30% drop from the late July baseline (98) and a 50%+ reduction from the June peak (142).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as we move into September. Following the summer peak of ~140 units, demand has consistently dropped: the average for late July (P22-P26) was 98.2, mid-August (P25-P27) was 85.3, and the most recent three periods (P28-P30) have averaged 64 units/week. Period 30 demand was 53 units, confirming the downward trend as fall approaches. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this current regime by using recent_N=3. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the reduced volatility at these lower volume levels. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 30 historical conclusions. This conservative setting minimizes holding costs for this basic jersey item as its core season ends.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for early September: Average demand for P28-P30 has declined to 64 units/week, a ~35% drop from the August average (98) and a ~55% drop from the June peak.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing a clear late-summer/early-autumn seasonal decline. Demand has consistently dropped over the last several periods: from ~98 in late July to ~85 in mid-August, ~69 in early September, and now 37 in the most recent period. The period-on-period decline is significant as the weather cools. For Period 32 (Sept 16), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward momentum (averaging the last three demands: 53, 37, and a projection of the current trend). Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, L remains at default. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current, albeit decreasing, volatility. This approach prevents over-ordering as the product moves toward its off-season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for mid-September: Demand has dropped to 37 units in Period 31, representing a ~40% decrease from the early September average (64) and confirming a sharp seasonal decline as autumn begins.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is experiencing a significant seasonal decline as we enter late September. Demand has dropped from an average of ~64 in early September to 37 (P31) and 29 (P32). This confirms a strong downward trend associated with the end of the summer season. To prevent overstocking and excessive holding costs as demand continues to taper, I am using a recent_N method specifically targeting the last 3 periods (P30-P32), which capture this accelerated decline better than the long-term history. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The chosen N=3 captures the current demand baseline of approximately 39 units/week, down 40%+ from the previous August/September transition regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late September: Demand has fallen to a baseline of ~33 units/week (P31-P32), representing a 50% decrease from the early September average and confirming a sharp seasonal exit for this summer basic.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt, a summer jersey basic, is entering a deep seasonal decline as of late September (Period 33). Demand has stabilized at a much lower baseline; for the most recent three periods (P31-P33), demand was 37, 29, and 45 respectively, averaging ~37 units. This represents a significant drop from the early September average of 64 and the mid-August average of 85. The stockout in Period 33 (on-hand 40 vs demand 45) suggests latent demand is slightly higher than 40, but the overall trend remains sharply downward. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this late-seasonal baseline (avg ~37) and adjust mu_hat accordingly. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals in the game history.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt, a summer jersey basic, is in a clear seasonal decline as we enter October. Period 34 demand was 24 units, continuing a downward trend from the September average of ~33 units. Since early September (P31), demand has consistently dropped following the autumn transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in the off-season, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect the most recent 3-period average (P32-P34), which is approximately 32 units, and setting sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility in this declining phase. This strategy aims to maintain a lean inventory (base stock ~30 units) as demand for this category phases out.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for early October: Average demand for P32-P34 has stabilized at 32.6 units/week, a significant decrease from the early September baseline (64) and representing the final seasonal exit for this summer basic.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt, a summer jersey basic, is in a clear seasonal decline as we enter mid-October (Period 36). Demand has steadily dropped from a June peak of 147+ to an average of ~30.6 over the last five periods (P31-P35). Specifically, the last two periods (P34-P35) have seen demand fall to 24 and 16 units respectively. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend's optimal service level (critical ratio) is 0.50, meaning we should aim to carry inventory approximately equal to the mean demand. With 17 units currently on-hand and recent demand trending towards 15-20 units, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to catch the most recent downward momentum. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for mid-October: Average demand for P33-P35 has fallen to 28.3 units/week, with the most recent sample (P35) at 16, indicating the final stage of seasonal exit for this summer basic.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey) is in its final phase of seasonal exit. Demand has stabilized at a low baseline: the last four periods (P33-P36) show values of 45, 24, 16, and 17, with an average of 25.5. The most recent two periods (P35-P36) average 16.5, indicating a continued slow drift downwards as we move further into October. Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target the 50th percentile of demand (z=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is 12 units. To prevent overstocking during this terminal decline, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (P34-P36 average = 19) to reflect the most current low-demand environment. Historical lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late October: Average demand for P34-P36 has stabilized at ~19 units/week, marking the final seasonal baseline before end-of-year levels.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598038 (Nora T-shirt) is in the final stages of its seasonal exit as of late October. Demand has stabilized at a low baseline, with the last four periods (P34-P37) showing demand of 24, 16, 17, and 27 units respectively, averaging 21 units/week. Period 37 saw a slight uptick (27) causing a stockout of the 19 units on hand, but the broader trend remains late-autumn low. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new late-October baseline (~21 units) while maintaining enough stock to cover the recent variability. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since on-hand is currently 0, the OR backend will order approximately the difference between the calculated base_stock and current inventory to meet this low-season demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' item, which has completed its primary seasonal cycle. Demand peaked in June (~142 units) and has steadily declined through October. As of early November (Period 39), demand has stabilized at a late-autumn baseline. Over the last three periods (P36-P38), demand was 17, 27, and 12, averaging approximately 18.7 units/week. This aligns with the 'late October' shift identified in the carry-over insights. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 samples (N=3) to capture this low-level baseline and prevent over-ordering as the game enters its final 10 periods. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all concluded periods in the history.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is a summer basic in its final seasonal exit phase. Demand has settled into a low-volume baseline for late autumn, with recent observations (P38-P39) consistently showing 12 units/week. This aligns with the carry-over insight from P37 identifying a baseline of ~19 units, followed by a further dip. Inventory is currently at 7 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given the promised lead time of 0 has consistently held true, a base stock (demand across R+L) targeting this new lower baseline is appropriate. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-autumn stabilization (P37-P39 demand: 27, 12, 12) while ignoring the much higher summer peaks. This will result in a mu_hat calculation of (1+0) * avg(27, 12, 12) = 17.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for early November: Average demand for P37-P39 has settled to 17 units/week, marking the final pre-winter baseline for this summer basic.

Demand has stabilized at a low level; the average demand for the last 4 periods (P37-P40) is 14.75 units/week. Period 40 demand was particularly low at 8 units. Given high holding costs relative to the low demand and seasonal context, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to capture this stabilized low-demand floor, while maintaining a lean inventory profile suitable for an out-of-season product. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey item currently in its final seasonal phase (late November). Demand has stabilized at a very low level compared to its summer peak. Over the last five periods (P37-P41), demand values were 27, 12, 12, 8, and 15, yielding an average of 14.8 units/week. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this current low-demand regime using the last 5 samples (N=5) to ensure we cover the immediate week's requirement without overstocking as we approach the end of the game (Period 42 of 47).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized and low for late November: Average demand for P37-P41 is 14.8 units/week, representing the winter baseline for this summer-oriented basic.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is in its winter baseline period, which is characterized by very low and stable demand. Period 42 demand followed this pattern at 18 units, following a sequence (P37-41) that averaged 14.8 units. The promised lead time of 0 remains accurate, as all orders have arrived within the same period. For Period 43 (early December), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of 5 periods (P38-P42) to capture this stable winter floor. This corresponds to the demand regime identified in Carry-over Insights (Period 42). With Profit=1 and Holding=1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0), effectively making the base stock equal to the mean forecast (1+L)*mu. On-hand is currently 0, so the order will replace the expected demand for the current period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598038 (Nora T-shirt) is a summer-oriented basic currently in its winter low-demand phase (December). Demand has stabilized at a low baseline, with the last 7 periods (P37-P43) averaging 14.7 units/week. The most recent demand was 11 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. Given the very stable and low demand environment, and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1.0 (implying a 50% service level target), the OR backend should focus on minimizing waste while maintaining this small baseline. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-autumn/winter stability (P37-P43: 27, 12, 12, 8, 15, 18, 11). This provides a mean of ~14.7 and accounts for the low volatility in this regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). The Nora T-shirt is a jersey basic geared towards summer, and demand has followed a clear seasonal cycle: peaking in June (avg ~142), declining through autumn, and stabilizing at a winter baseline. Recent demand (P41-P44) has been 15, 18, 11, and 8, averaging 13 units/week. This aligns with the 'winter baseline' identified in Period 42. Since we are in the depths of winter and lead time remains stable at 0 periods, I will set parameters based on the most recent 5-period regime (P40-P44) which reflects these stable, low-demand conditions. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level is 50%, which is appropriate for a low-cost, low-risk item in its off-season. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this late-year stability.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is a jersey basic currently in its winter seasonal low. The date is December 23 (Period 46), coinciding with the Christmas holiday period. Demand has been stabilized at a low baseline since early November (Period 40). Recent demand figures (P41: 15, P42: 18, P43: 11, P44: 8, P45: 15) show an average of 13.4 units/week. While there might be a slight holiday-related uptick or 'gift-card' effect in the coming week, the overall regime remains low. I will use the last 9 periods (P37-P45) for forecasting, as this covers the stable late-autumn and winter baseline. The average demand for this period is 14.0 units. Given that holding costs equal profit ($1.00 each), the OR backend will target a 50% service level. Lead time has consistently been 0. Inventory is currently 0, so the backend will order to meet the base stock for the upcoming period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product (Nora T-shirt) is a summer-oriented 'Everyday Basic' which has completed its seasonal exit. Demand has stabilized at a low winter baseline. Over the last 5 periods (P42-P46), demand has been 18, 11, 8, 15, and 9, averaging 12.2 units per week. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with actual performance (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Given the low and stable winter demand, I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mean and volatility to reflect this baseline while avoiding over-stocking during the year-end transition to the new year.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for December: Average demand for P42-P46 is 12.2 units/week, reflecting the minimum winter baseline for this summer basic.
