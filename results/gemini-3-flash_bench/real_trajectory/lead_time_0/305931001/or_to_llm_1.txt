The current period is Feb 11, post-winter but still relevant for transition styles. Inventory is at 0 with no pipeline. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive within the same period (visible in the Period 1 conclude message at the start of Period 2). The OR recommendation is 70 units, calculated via a base-stock policy. Given Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning safety stock should aim to cover the median demand to minimize total cost.

Since lead time is 0, the order arrives and is sold in the same period. I need to cover Period 3 demand with no starting stock.

This is based on historical demand which includes the earlier high-demand period. 5. **Strategy**: Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand.

This confirms a stabilization at a much lower level than the start of the year, likely due to the 'Imitation Leather Leggings' product category losing seasonal relevance as the weather warms towards late May. 3. Inventory & Strategy: On-hand inventory is 12 units. No orders are in transit. The OR baseline recommends 42 units, calculated using all historical samples (which include the high-demand early period). Using the more recent average (approx. 33 over the last 5 weeks) and subtracting current on-hand (12), I need about 21 units for a 1:1 replacement. However, to maintain a safe cushion for service level, I will target a stock level of approximately 45 units (average demand + 12 safety units). 45 - 12 = 33.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The OR recommendation of 6 units is based on whole-history averages and doesn't account for the established winter demand regime for imitation leather leggings. Historical analysis shows a significant seasonal surge starting in September, with demand peaking in November and December. Recent demand for Periods 43-46 was 128, 137, 137, and 112 units respectively, averaging roughly 128 units/period. The current date is December 30th. While we are exiting the absolute peak of the holiday season, imitation leather leggings remain seasonally relevant through winter. A sharp drop to 6 units (OR's cap) would cause a massive stockout. Given on-hand inventory is 51, and expecting demand to gently taper but remain high (estimated 100-110 units for the coming period), an order of 60-70 units is required to maintain service levels. I will target a stock level of approximately 115-120 units.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overriding OR's 6 units to 65 units; OR baseline is heavily skewed by summer lows and doesn't account for the current winter demand regime (~128 units/period).",
