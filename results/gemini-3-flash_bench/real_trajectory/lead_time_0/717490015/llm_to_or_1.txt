Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 717490015 is a basic jersey T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 44 units (54, 36, 43, 32, 55). There is no inventory on-hand or in-transit. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive within the same period. Since we have zero stock and the first period's demand occurs after the decision, we must order enough to cover the forecasted demand for P1. Using all 5 historical samples provides a stable mean (44) and standard deviation (approx 10). I will use 'default' for L to match the promised lead time of 0, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent behavior.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 starts on 2019-02-18. Looking at the historical demand for this T-shirt (SKU 717490015), the previous samples were 54, 36, 43, 32, 55 (mean: 44.0). Period 1 actual demand was 41, which is very consistent with the historical mean. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirm this with an actual lead time of 0 (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). On-hand inventory is currently 12. Since demand is stable and lead time is zero, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using all available recent data (N=6, including the most recent Period 1 demand) to capture the current demand level. The OR backend will calculate the replenishment to cover the current period's demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we experienced a significant demand spike (73 units) compared to the historical average (approx. 44 units). This resulted in a stockout (sold 52, ending inventory 0). The product is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt', and the current date is late February (2019/2/25), which often aligns with the start of Spring fashion cycles and increased demand for basics. The observed lead time for both Period 1 and Period 2 was 0, matching the promised lead time. To address the recent surge and prevent further lost sales, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat based on the last 3 samples (including the high demand from Period 2) to capture the upward trend. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed in Period 2 demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Jersey T-shirt, a staple garment. Current status: On-hand is 0, and demand has consistently outstripped available inventory for the past two periods (P2: demand 73 vs 52 available; P3: demand 82 vs 70 available). The historical demand samples (range 32-55) are significantly lower than recent observed demand (avg ~65 over last 3 weeks, peaking at 82). The promised lead time of 0 is being met consistently. To recover from stockouts and match the upward trend in demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime. This will elevate the base stock to cover the expected demand of ~65-80 units plus a safety buffer, while the zero lead time allows for immediate replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 1: average demand increased from ~44 in historical samples to ~65 in Periods 1-3 (+47%), with recent peaks exceeding 80 units.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019, following a transition from February. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averaged 44, but actual demand in Periods 1-4 has averaged 61.5 (41, 73, 82, 50). The 'Cat Tee' product is seeing a sustained increase compared to early winter, likely due to spring seasonality. Period 4 demand (50) was lower than the previous two peaks (73, 82), but still significantly higher than the original baseline. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all four active periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing out the volatility seen in Periods 2 and 3. On-hand inventory is 34, and the OR backend will calculate the order based on this updated baseline (average ~62) to prevent the stockouts experienced in Periods 2 and 3.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. Demand for this 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' continues to show a higher regime than historical pre-Period 1 data. Over the 5 active periods, demand has averaged 59.2 units (41, 73, 82, 50, 50), confirming the carry-over insight of a shift to a higher mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. However, stockouts in Periods 2 and 3 indicate that historical stats were initially under-forecasting. Recent demand (Periods 4 and 5) has stabilized at 50, suggesting the peak might be leveling off slightly from the 82 high. I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the full shift while weighting current period visibility. Since lead time is 0, the backend target becomes 1 period of demand (L+1).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. Analysis of historical and recent demand shows a clear upward trend. Pre-game data (Jan/Feb) averaged ~44 units. Periods 1-6 (Feb/Mar) show an average demand of 62 units (41, 73, 82, 50, 50, 76). The most recent period (P6) had a demand of 76, which resulted in a stockout since total supply (74) was exhausted. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals (P1-P6). With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a service level that prevents frequent stockouts. Given the volatility (std dev ~16) and the high demand in P6, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current demand regime which is significantly higher and more volatile than the pre-game samples.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift: Average demand from Period 1-6 is 62 units (+41% vs historical 44), with higher volatility (std dev ~16) and frequent peaks near 80.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a basic jersey T-shirt, which is moving into the spring/summer peak season. Analyzing history from Periods 1-7, the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand has been significantly higher than the initial historical average of 44. Since Period 1, the average demand is ~66 units (41, 73, 82, 50, 50, 76, 91), with a clear upward trend as we enter April. Period 7 saw a peak of 91 units, resulting in a stockout. To prevent further lost sales and capture the seasonal uptick, I will increase the demand forecast. I am using recent_N=7 to capture the higher regime observed since the start of active play, which better represents current spring demand than the Jan/Feb historical data.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand growth confirmed: March/April demand average increased to ~66 units compared to initial Feb average of 55 units, with peak demand reaching 91 units in Period 7.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/04/08. The product is a Cat Tee (T-shirt), and we are in the middle of spring, which is a peak season for this item as confirmed by historical demand. The promised lead time is 0, and all history confirms actual lead time is 0. Demand from Period 1 to Period 8 averaged 66.375 units (std dev ~16.8), which is significantly higher than the pre-game historical average of 44. Recent periods (7 and 8) show demand of 91 and 68. The current on-hand inventory is 15. Since lead time is 0, the order arrives within the same period to meet demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current spring demand regime while maintaining a buffer for the observed high volatility (91 units peak). The OR backend uses a target service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80, which is conservative; therefore, I will ensure mu_hat represents the sustained high-demand level to prevent stockouts seen in Periods 2, 3, 6, and 7.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the item (Cat Tee) remains in a high-demand spring seasonal phase. Historical samples (mean ~44) are no longer representative of the current regime. Analyzing data since Period 1, the mean demand is approximately 65.4 units with a standard deviation of 16.5. In the most recent four periods (Periods 6-9), the average is 73 units, reflecting sustained spring interest. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all 9 concluded instances. To maintain a high service level given the $4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost (75% service level target) and to prevent the stockouts observed in previous periods, I am using recent_N (N=9, covering the entire active shift) for lead time and mu_hat, while using recent_N (N=9) for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this higher-demand regime.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 22nd. Reviewing the history for SKU 717490015 (Cat Tee), the lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand has stabilized into a higher spring regime compared to the early-year baseline. Since Period 1, the demand average has been approximately 64.5 units (sum: 645 over 10 periods), with a peak of 91 and a recent trend ranging between 57 and 68. The current inventory (on-hand 13) is low relative to this average. Given the carry-over insights indicating sustained spring growth and the observed mean since February being significantly higher than the training samples (44), I will use the recent 10 periods to capture this regime shift. Setting L to default (0 periods) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers this 65-unit average plus a safety buffer for the inherent volatility (std dev ~17 in this regime), adjusted by the profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a soft jersey T-shirt, which is entering its peak seasonal demand phase (Spring/Summer). Analysis of the last 11 periods shows a clear regime shift from the historical mean of 44 to a current mean of approximately 67 units (P1-P11 average: 67.0). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding message. In Period 11, demand was 82, resulting in a stockout (sold 79 out of 82 demand), leaving on-hand inventory at 0 for the start of Period 12. Given the seasonal peak (late April) and the high volatility (std dev ~14), I will use the recent 11-period mean as the baseline for mu_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the sustained higher demand levels and avoids under-ordering during this critical window.

Carry-over insight: April demand plateau confirmed: Periods 8-11 average demand is 68.5 units, maintaining the elevated Spring regime noted in Period 8.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are in a high-demand Spring/Early Summer regime for this 'Cat Tee'. Historical data from Period 1 to Period 12 consistently shows lead times of 0 periods. Since the lead time is 0, the backend calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z * sigma_hat, where mu_hat represents the expected demand for the current period. Recent demand (Periods 8-12) has averaged ~70.8 units (68, 57, 67, 82, 80). The Spring growth noted in Period 12 is sustained. Given the high stockout frequency (ending inventory was 0 or near 0 in 5 out of the last 7 periods), I will set mu_hat using a recent window to capture this higher mean. Specifically, N=5 for the most recent period average (70.8) which aligns with the May shift. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture the increased volatility of this higher-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime confirmed: Average demand for late April/Early May (Periods 11-12) is 81 units, showing a slight increase from the April average of 68.5 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/13. The product is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), which typically sees higher demand in spring and summer. Historical demand for the last 13 periods shows a clear upward shift versus the pre-game baseline (~44). Recent activity from Period 11 onwards shows a peak around 80-82 units, though Period 13 saw a significant drop to 26 units. I must determine if Period 13's 26 units is a random outlier or a regime shift. Given the seasonal context (May is prime T-shirt season), it is highly likely a random low-demand event. In Period 13, because of the low demand, we ended with 54 units on-hand. Lead time consistently stays at 0 periods. To avoid over-reacting to the single low data point while acknowledging the trend, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 (capturing the 82, 80, and 26 samples plus the current period) to smooth demand back towards the 65-75 range. Sigma_hat will use the last 7 samples to capture the increased volatility seen in the spring regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), which generally sees increased demand in Spring and Summer. Historically, we identified a Spring surge (Periods 7-12 avg ~75 units). However, the last two periods (13-14) have shown a significant drop in demand (26 and 40 units respectively), contrasting the early May peak of 80+. This could indicate a temporary lull or a shift in the demand regime. On-hand inventory is currently 42 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the OR engine will order the difference between base_stock and on-hand inventory immediately. Since the recent demand is volatile (lulls following peaks), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent high volatility and the sudden drop, balancing the risk of stockouts if demand rebounds against overstocking if the lull continues. N=4 covers the high demand of Period 11-12 and the low demand of Period 13-14.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in May (Periods 11-14): demand fluctuated between 26 and 82 units, showing a two-period drop (avg 33) following a high-demand peak (avg 81).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490015' (Cat Tee) is entering late May/early June. Historical demand analysis shows a high-demand regime in April/May (averaging ~65-70 units) with significant volatility (recent demands: 80, 26, 40, 72). Period 13 and 14 showed a temporary dip, but Period 15 rebounded to 72 units, confirming that demand remains robust. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (9 units) and there is no in-transit inventory, a substantial order is required to maintain the service level across the next period. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current late-Spring demand level and the increased volatility observed in the last 5 periods (mean=58, including the outliers). This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover the expected 60-80 unit demand range while accounting for the recent standard deviation.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a jersey T-shirt, entering June (Summer season). Historically, demand for t-shirts increases as weather warms. Recent demand (Periods 11-16) average is 60 units, but this includes a volatile dip in early May. The last two periods show a recovery (72, 61), and historical demand in early 2019 was around 44, while Spring averaged around 66. As we enter June, I expect demand to remain at the higher Spring/early Summer levels. Lead time is consistently 0 (ordered and arrived in the same period). To capture the recent higher and stabilized demand while accounting for seasonal growth into June, I will use a recent window of N=6 (Periods 11-16) for mu_hat to set the base stock at the current 'higher' regime (average ~60), and N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the broader volatility observed in the transition from April to May. This protects against stockouts during potential early June spikes while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: June Summer demand regime: Periods 15-16 indicate recovery from May volatility, stabilizing at an average of 66.5 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a 'Basics' Jersey T-shirt, which typically experiences steady demand during the summer months. Examining the demand history since Period 15 (entry into June/late May) shows values of 72, 61, and 42. The average for these last 3 periods is 58.3, which is lower than the April/May peaks (~80) but remains higher than the initial historical mean (44). Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. Given the recent drop to 42 in Period 17, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the current June cooling trend while still accounting for the slightly higher volatility seen in May. This N includes the last four periods (72, 61, 42, plus the preceding 40) to stabilize the forecast. Setting L to default (0) as there is no evidence of delay. Mu_hat and sigma_hat will use N=4 to represent the current 1-month seasonal behavior.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a Jersey Basic T-shirt, which is into its peak summer season. Historically, demand in June (Periods 17-18) has softened slightly (42, 37 units) compared to the higher May/early June levels. However, as it is mid-June, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly recover before any potential mid-summer heatwaves or sales. Promised lead time remains 0, and actual lead time has consistently been 0 units throughout the game history. On-hand inventory is 30 units. To set parameters for the OR engine, I will use a window of the last 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the recent 'June' softening while maintaining enough stock for a possible rebound (average demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 53 units). This approach balances the need for service level against the holding cost in a period of shifting demand.

Carry-over insight: June Summer demand regime (mid-month update): Periods 15-18 show slowing demand with an average of 53 units, down from the May average of 54.5 but with lower volatility than the start of May.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490015 (Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a late June summer regime. Demand in the most recent periods (P15-P19) has stabilized around an average of 55 units (72, 61, 42, 37, 63), which is a decrease from the high May peaks but remains higher than the early historical baseline (~44). The inventory on-hand at the start of Period 20 is very low (4 units), and lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while matching the current stabilized summer demand pattern, I will use a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with N=5 (covering the last 5 periods P15-P19). This captures the current mid-to-late June demand level (avg ~55) while smoothing out the volatility observed in early June. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been highly consistent at 0 periods, ensuring the backend reacts quickly to replenishment needs.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization: Periods 15-19 show demand stabilizing with an average of 55 units, lower than the May peak of 81 but consistent for the June summer period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historically, demand for this cat-themed jersey T-shirt peaked in late April and early May (avg ~81) and then transitioned into a stable summer regime. Over the last 6 periods (Periods 15-20), representing the transition through June, the average demand has been approximately 56 units (range 37-72). The last two weeks (Periods 19 and 20) saw demand of 63 and 61, showing stability coming out of June into July. July is likely to maintain this consistent summer demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Based on the stabilization observed in the carry-over insights and recent history, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture this summer regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which balances protection against the minor recent uptrend (60+ units) while respecting the lower average compared to the Spring peak.

Carry-over insight: July summer regime confirmed: Demand stabilized in late June (Periods 19-20) at ~62 units, consistent with the broader June average (Periods 15-20) of 56 units, showing reduced volatility compared to the May peak.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (2019/7/1), we observed a massive demand spike of 151 units, which is significantly higher (nearly 2.5x) than the recent summer average of ~56-62 units and exceeds all historical peaks (~91 units). Given the date is early July, this is likely a retail event (e.g., July 4th related sales or peak summer clearance for a basic jersey T-shirt). Despite the spike, our inventory was limited to 68 units, resulting in significant lost sales. We are now at Period 22 with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. I need to react to this regime shift but must balance the possibility of this being a one-week anomaly versus a sustained July peak. Period 21's demand (151) is a clear outlier. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this shift while smoothing slightly to avoid over-ordering if demand mean-reverts. The OR backend will compute the base stock based on the high variance introduced by the 151 demand unit observation. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/spike in Period 21: Demand reached 151 units (July 4th/Summer peak), representing a >100% increase over the previous three-week average of ~62 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490015 (Cat Tee) has entered a distinct high-demand summer peak. Period 21 saw demand jump to 151 (July 4th week effect) and Period 22 hit 187, far exceeding the June average of ~56. History shows two consecutive stockouts despite aggressive ordering. Current on-hand inventory is 0. As it is mid-July, this peak demand is likely to persist or gradually taper, but we must protect against high lost-sales costs ($4 profit vs $1 holding). The actual lead time remains 0. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new regime, as historical averages (even recent_N) are lagging behind the 150-190 unit range observed in the last two weeks.

Carry-over insight: Sustained July peak demand regime: Periods 21-22 show an average demand of 169 units, a +200% increase over the June average of 56 units, corresponding with peak summer/t-shirt seasonality.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt,' which is highly seasonal during the summer months. Historical evidence from the last three periods (P21-P23) confirms a major seasonal demand shift associated with July, with demand values of 151, 187, and 150 units respectively. This averages 162.7 units per period, a +200% increase over the June average of ~55 units. Given that we are still in late July (P24, July 22nd), I expect this peak demand to continue. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 163 (1+0 lead time * average of the last 3 periods) to maintain high service levels during this peak, and sigma_hat is set based on these recent high-demand samples to acknowledge the increased volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in the peak of the summer T-shirt season. Historically, demand spiked in Period 21 (151 units) and has remained elevated through Period 24 (187, 150, 129). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P21-P24) is 154.25 units. While Period 24 saw a slight dip to 129, it is significantly higher than pre-July levels. Given the high profitability ($4.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0), and the lead time remaining stable at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture this high-demand summer regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent levels to account for the increased volatility during this period.

Carry-over insight: July Peak Demand Profile: Sustained high demand from Period 21-24 (avg 154 units) following the summer seasonal spike. Period 24 (129) suggests the very top of the peak may have passed, but demand remains >100% above June averages.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering early August (Period 26). Historical demand analysis shows a massive July peak (avg ~154 units in P21-P24) followed by a significant drop in Period 25 to 80 units. This decline is typical as the late summer 'Back to School' transition begins and the peak heat of summer fades. The product is a basic jersey T-shirt, which remains relevant but usually sees a tapering off after the July 4th/mid-summer highs. I am setting mu_hat to capture this downward trend using a recent_N of 5, which covers the start of the summer spike through the current drop (Avg for P21-P25 is 139). This will likely remain slightly high for the coming week, but the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend will prevent excessive overstocking. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-July peak demand softening: Period 25 demand dropped to 80 units, a 38% decrease from the P24 level (129) and 53% below the P22 peak (187), indicating the summer seasonal peak has passed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $237.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms that the July summer peak (avg ~154) has definitively passed. For the last two periods (P25 and P26), demand has stabilized significantly lower at 80 and 82 units, respectively. This decline aligns with the transition from peak summer to mid-August. Given the product is a 'T-shirt in soft jersey,' we expect a return toward the pre-peak summer baseline (approx 55-65 units) as the season progresses. I am using recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current downward trend while weighting the most recent stability (avg ~97 for the last 3 periods including the tapering P24). sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to maintain a buffer for the volatility experienced during the regime transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-July peak baseline established: Periods 25-26 show demand stabilizing at ~81 units, a ~47% reduction from the July peak average of 154 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490015 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is entering late August (Period 28, 2019/8/19), which typically marks the end of the peak summer season and the transition into localized 'back-to-school' or late-summer demand. Historical demand analysis shows a clearly defined peak in July (Periods 21-24, avg ~154) followed by a significant drop to a lower baseline in August (Periods 25-27, avg ~78 units). Specifically, demand has been 80, 82, and 72 over the last three periods. Given this stability at the lower level, I am setting the demand regime length to N=3 to capture the most recent post-peak behavior without being skewed by the July spike. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 64 units, which is close to one period's expected demand (~78), necessitating a replenishment order to maintain service levels while avoiding excessive holding costs as the season winds down further.

Carry-over insight: August demand baseline confirmed: Periods 25-27 show demand stable at an average of 78 units, a significant 49% reduction from the July peak (avg 154).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490015 (Cat Tee) has transitioned from its peak July summer demand (avg ~154) to a clearly defined August baseline. For the last four periods (P25-P28), demand has been 80, 82, 72, and 67, respectively, resulting in a mean of 75.25 units. This indicates a sustained softening as summer ends and we move towards late August. The current date is 2019/8/26. We are now entering the 'Back to School' transition period, but recent history (N=4) is the most reliable predictor of the current demand level. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent 'conclude' messages. I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 to capture this post-peak stabilization while allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~75) and reduced volatility compared to the July spike.

Carry-over insight: August demand baseline confirmed at ~75 units (Periods 25-28), representing a 50% decrease from the July peak regime and signaling the end of the summer seasonal spike.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic jersey t-shirt. Period 30 (2019/9/2) marks the start of September. Historical and recent data show a clear transition out of the July peak (average ~154) into a stable August regime. Demand in the last four periods (Periods 26-29) was 82, 72, 67, and 57, averaging 69.5. Specifically, the last two periods averaged 62. Given the seasonal transition from summer to autumn, I expect demand to continue stabilizing or slightly softening toward the initial February/March levels (~50-60). Using recent_N with N=4 captures the post-peak stabilization while respecting the most recent downward trend. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: September transition: Demand has stabilized post-summer peak, with the last 4 periods (P26-P29) averaging ~70 units, trending downwards towards a likely autumn baseline of 55-60 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9th, 2019. We have moved clearly out of the high-demand summer season (July avg: 154) into a lower autumn baseline. As noted in the Period 30 carry-over, demand is stabilizing post-summer. The last five periods (P26-P30) have seen demands of 82, 72, 67, 57, and 38 respectively, showing a distinct downward trend. The most recent demand (38) is the lowest since June. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this cooling trend and avoid over-ordering based on the July spikes. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition confirmed: Demand has dropped for 5 consecutive periods since the August baseline, reaching a new low of 38 units in Period 30. The average for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 63.2 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 16, 2019. We are in the middle of a seasonal transition from summer/late August into autumn. Demand has significantly cooled from the July peak (avg ~154) and August plateau (avg ~75). The last five periods (P27-P31) show demand of 72, 67, 57, 38, 45, which averages 55.8 units. The most recent two periods (38, 45) suggest a new lower baseline likely consistent with the historical pre-spring average (which was ~44) or slightly above. I will use N=5 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough buffer for the observed stabilization around 40-50 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline established: Demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) at an average of 55.8 units, reflecting a return to near-historical levels after the summer peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the t-shirt SKU (717490015) has stabilized into an autumn baseline post the summer peak. Comparing recent demand: Period 30 (38), Period 31 (45), and Period 32 (34). This reflects a significant drop from the summer/August levels. My carry-over insights confirm this transition, with the last 5 periods (P27-P31) averaging 55.8 units, but the very latest data (P30-P32) shows even lower demand averaging 39 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking in a declining or low-demand season (holding cost is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture this stabilization, while acknowledging that the most recent three periods are at the lower end of that range. This method will allow the OR backend to calculate mean and variance based on the current autumn regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand in Period 33 was 67 units, which is higher than the previous few weeks but aligns with the 'Autumn baseline' established in late September. History shows the July peak (avg ~154) has fully subsided, and we are now in a stabilized regime. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P30-P33) is 46 units, though the P33 jump to 67 suggests potential minor volatility or a floor around 50-60 units. Inventory is currently 0, meaning we must order to meet all of next period's demand. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-summer stabilization while accounting for the recent uptick in demand volatility (34 to 67).

Carry-over insight: September demand volatility: Late September (P33) showed a spike to 67 units after three weeks of declining demand (avg 39), suggesting a baseline higher than the early September lows.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. This SKU (Jersey T-shirt) is exiting its peak summer (July) and late-summer (August) demand cycles. In September (Periods 30-34), demand has shown volatility, dropping to lows of 22 and 34 but spiking to 67, resulting in a September average of ~41 units. This aligns with the transition to an Autumn baseline. Period 34 demand was particularly low (22 units), leaving 37 units on-hand. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the shift toward a cooler season for a T-shirt, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 30-34) to capture the lower autumn baseline (averaging ~41.2 units per period). This will prevent overstocking as demand cools. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to account for the recent volatility seen in September.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand baseline for October: Periods 30-34 show an average demand of 41.2 units, down significantly from the August baseline of 75 units, reflecting the seasonal shift for jersey t-shirts.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490015 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in an autumn demand regime. Observations from Periods 30-35 show a clear downward trend and stabilization at a lower baseline compared to the summer peak. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P30-P35) is 39.1 units (38, 45, 34, 67, 22, 29), with October specifically showing even lower averages (avg 25.5 for P34-P35). I will use a recent_N window of 6 to capture this current autumn baseline while Smoothing the volatility observed in Period 33. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable as all recent orders have arrived within the same period. Since on-hand inventory is 27 and demand is currently low, a defensive posture is appropriate to avoid excess holding costs as we head further into the off-season for t-shirts.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand for this soft jersey t-shirt has transitioned into an autumn baseline. Over the last 7 periods (P30-P36), demand has averaged 37.8 units (38, 45, 34, 67, 22, 29, 30), significantly lower than the summer peak and the August baseline (75). Most recently, the last 3 periods (P34-P36) have averaged only 27.2 units, indicating a potential further cooling as we move deeper into October. On-hand inventory is 23 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for occasional spikes (like the 67 in P33), I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the current autumn regime, which calculates to (1+0)*37.8 \u2248 38. This allows the OR engine to right-size inventory for current seasonal conditions.

Carry-over insight: October Autumn regime: Demand has stabilized at a lower average of ~38 units (Periods 30-36), confirming the end of the transition from the August baseline (75 units) to a cooler seasonal pattern for jersey basics.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 28, 2019. We are in the Autumn season for a 'soft jersey t-shirt', a category that has seen a significant decline from its summer peak. The Carry-over insights and recent history confirm a stabilized Autumn baseline. Specifically, demand over the last 8 periods (P30-P37) has averaged 37.4 units. Although there was a single outlier in Period 33 (67 units), the most recent three periods (P35-P37) are very consistent at 29, 30, and 34 units (average 31). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent window of N=8 to capture this post-September stabilization while smoothing out the minor remaining volatility. This ensures we don't over-react to the single late-September spike while maintaining enough inventory for the current baseline of ~30-40 units.

Carry-over insight: Late Oct Autumn baseline confirmed: demand for P35-P37 averaged 31 units, indicating a move from the 40-unit early Oct average toward a slightly lower late-season baseline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the late autumn/pre-winter season for this SKU (jersey t-shirt). Reviewing the demand history since Period 30, the average demand has settled into a lower regime, with the last 4 periods (P35-P38) averaging 27.25 units (29, 30, 34, 16). The most recent demand was particularly low at 16 units, which may indicate a further seasonal dip as temperatures drop in November. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 (covering Periods 32-38) to capture the stable but declining autumn trend, which averages approximately 33 units. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for current levels while maintaining enough safety stock for typical weekly fluctuations in this lower-demand environment without overstocking and incurring unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn regime (Nov) confirmed: Last 4 periods (P35-P38) average demand dropped to 27 units, compared to the early Oct average of 38 units, indicating a continued seasonal decline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490015 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a late autumn/pre-winter seasonal decline. Analysis of the most recent data (Periods 35-39) shows a clear and sustained low-demand regime, with an average demand of 23.2 units and a standard deviation of ~7.6 units. Specifically, the last two periods (P38-P39) recorded demand of 16 and 17 units, respectively, which is significantly lower than the early October average of ~38 units. This reflects the cooling weather in November and reduced consumer interest in basic thin jerseys. My lead time analysis shows that the actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given this low-demand state and the high relative holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5 from P35-P39) to capture the current trough. This will prevent overstocking during the low season while maintaining sufficient service levels.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Early Winter low regime confirmed (Nov): Demand for Periods 35-39 averaged 23.2 units, a 46% decrease from the early October average (38 units) and a 70% decrease from the August baseline (75 units).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a late autumn/early winter low-demand regime for jersey t-shirts. Demand has consistently declined from the summer/August peaks, stabilizing at a very low level throughout November. The last 5 periods (P36-P40) show a mean demand of 21.2 units (30, 34, 16, 17, 14), and the most recent 3 periods (P38-P40) average only 15.6 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am adjusting mu_hat to look at the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current 21-unit baseline, and sigma_hat to N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility (std dev ~8.6). This ensures the base stock reflects the current winter seasonal minimum while maintaining a slim buffer.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a late autumn/early winter low-demand regime for jersey t-shirts. Demand has stabilized at a very low level: the last three periods (P39-P41) saw demand of 17, 14, and 12 units respectively, averaging 14.3 units. This is a consistent decline from the late October average of ~23 units. The 'carry_over_insight' from Period 40 already reflects this downward trend. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this seasonal low, I am using a small window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilization at the ~14 unit level. This allows the OR backend to set a lean base stock that reflects current run-rates while still maintaining a safety buffer for the 80% service level target (based on profit/holding cost ratio).

Carry-over insight: Early Winter low regime stabilized: Periods 39-41 average demand is 14.3 units, representing a further 38% decrease from the early November average of 23.2 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). We are in a winter low-demand regime for jersey t-shirts. Demand has consistently declined from October levels (~40 units) to a current early winter baseline of approximately 14-16 units over the last 4 periods (P39-P42). Specifically, demand was 17, 14, 12, and 21. While P42 saw a slight uptick to 21, the average of the last 4 periods is 16 units. The on-hand inventory is 0. My goal is to maintain enough stock for a 16-unit demand level while accounting for the recent slight variance. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the OR engine needs to target a service level that favors lean inventory to avoid high holding costs during this low-season trough. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized winter floor.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand floor established in December: Period 39-42 average demand stabilized at 16.0 units, a 48% reduction from the early October average (31 units).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the heart of the winter season for the jersey t-shirt. Historical demand and the carry-over insights confirm we have established a winter low-demand floor. The average demand for the most recent regime (Periods 39-43) is 16.4 units (17, 14, 12, 21, 18). Despite a small spike in Period 42 (21 units), demand remains low and stable. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 2 units. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand and standard lead time settings to maintain this winter baseline and avoid excessive holding costs as the game nears its end (Period 47).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16th, deep into the winter season for this jersey basic t-shirt. Historical demand over the last 6 periods (P39-P44) has consistently been low, averaging 15.6 units (17, 14, 12, 21, 18, 12). This represents the winter floor as identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time is reliably 0 periods. I will use the recent_N method with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable, low-demand winter regime. This ensures we maintain enough stock to satisfy the current 15-20 unit weekly demand without overstocking as we approach the end of the year.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, 2019 (Period 46). Demand for this soft jersey t-shirt has been in a winter low regime. However, Period 45 saw a spike to 29 units, the highest in 10 weeks, potentially due to holiday shopping or pre-Christmas clearance. The last 4 periods (P42-P45) have averaged 20.0 units. With lead time consistently at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4-period window to capture this slight holiday lift while remaining cautious about a post-Christmas slump. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to reflect recent volatility (which increased due to the P45 spike).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand lift observed in P45: Demand spike to 29 units (Dec 16) from a 16-unit average, moving the 4-week average to 20 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30, the week following Christmas. Period 46 saw a significant demand spike to 40 units (Dec 23), following a lift to 29 units in P45 (Dec 16). This aligns with peak holiday/gift shopping and potentially early post-Christmas sales. The 4-week average (P43-P46) has risen to 24.75 units, up from the early December floor of ~16 units. Given the seasonality of jersey basics, we are entering the post-holiday clearance and transition to early Spring inventory. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this upward movement while avoiding over-stocking if demand cools significantly after the new year. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility observed during the holiday weeks.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Late December (P45-P46) demand averaged 34.5 units, a 115% increase over the early December baseline of 16 units.
