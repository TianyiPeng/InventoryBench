Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 316441001. Historical demand for the preceding five weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a significant shift: the first three weeks averaged ~93 units, while the last two weeks (Jan 28 and Feb 4) surged to 148 units each. This suggests a transition from a low-demand period to a higher-demand regime, likely following post-holiday clearance or early spring transition. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Since the promised lead time is 0, orders arrive within the same period. To avoid stockouts in this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 to reflect the latest demand level (148 units/period), and L=0 to ensure coverage for the current period's demand. sigma_hat is set to 'default' as we need more data to establish a stable standard deviation for this new regime.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a Women's Jersey Basic long-sleeved top. Historically, demand has been around 100-150 units, but the most recent official samples (Jan 28, Feb 4) both showed 148, while actual demand in Period 1 (Feb 11) was lower at 82. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on the Period 1 conclusion. Given the product is a long-sleeved jersey top and it is mid-February, we are likely transitioning from peak winter into early spring in the Northern Hemisphere, which might explain the slight drop in demand compared to late Jan/early Feb. I will use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility to prioritize the recent trend (N=4 includes 3 historical samples + Period 1 demand). Setting L to 'calculate' to continue monitoring the actual lead time delivery.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a 'Long-sleeved top in soft jersey', which is a wardrobe staple (Everyday Basics) but may see increased demand in late winter/early spring. Historical data shows demand increasing from ~90 to ~140-150 in late January/early February. Period 1 demand was lower (82), but Period 2 jumped significantly to 138, which exceeded the total supply (117), resulting in a stockout and a loss of 21 sales units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm actual lead time is indeed 0. To prevent further stockouts, I need to adjust mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to focus on the 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04, and recent game periods (avg ~145) rather than the lower January samples. L is set to calculated as the supply chain is responsive.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a Women's Everyday Basics long-sleeved top. Reviewing history: P1 saw a lead time of 0 (arrived 148), P2 saw a lead time of 0 (arrived 51), and P3 saw a lead time of 0 (arrived 123). Demand has been 82, 138, and 106 respectively, compared to historical samples (102, 89, 87, 148, 148). The mean of the 5 historical samples is 114.8. The mean of the 3 active game periods is 108.6. There is no clear evidence of a significant regime shift yet, though the product is a staple item. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture recent trends while including the most recent pre-game samples, and set L to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top, a staple basic. Current demand data shows fluctuations but no clear seasonality trend yet in early March (samples: 82, 138, 106, 60). The mean demand over these 4 periods is 96.5. Including pre-game historical samples (102, 89, 87, 148, 148), the overall mean is approximately 107. Since the promised lead time is 0 and all orders from Period 1-4 arrived with an actual lead time of 0 (L=0), I will continue to use L=0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior (averaging 102, 138, 106, 60 plus one pre-game sample), which balances the high February spikes with the recent March dip. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to incorporate broader historical volatility, ensuring adequate safety stock for this low-margin/high-holding-cost item (Profit=1, Holding=1, implying a 50% service level target).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top, a staple item. Current date is March 18, 2019. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 89.8 units (82, 138, 106, 60, 63). However, there's a noticeable drop in the last two periods (60, 63) compared to the initial surge. The early samples provided (102, 89, 87, 148, 148) suggested a higher mean. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the fact that holding cost equals profit (1:1 ratio), the backend OR logic will target a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1)). To prevent excessive stockouts seen in Period 2 while respecting the recent lower demand trend, I will use a 5-period window for mu_hat to capture the recent cooling of demand while maintaining enough volume for volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey basic top. Historical demand data (from 2019-01-07 to 2019-03-18) shows a mean demand of approximately 99 units. Recent demand (Periods 4-6) has dropped to an average of 62.33 units, likely due to a seasonal shift as spring progresses and demand for long-sleeved basics softens compared to late winter. Observed lead time consistently remains 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 26 units with 0 in-transit. To avoid the stockouts seen in Period 2 while managing holding costs, I will use a recent demand window to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=6 covers the entire active period history which balances the high early-period demands with the recent decline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Long-sleeved top in soft jersey,' an everyday basic. In Period 8 (April 1st), we are entering spring, but demand has stabilized significantly. Reviewing the historical data for the last 4 periods (Periods 4-7: 60, 63, 64, 60), the mean demand is 61.75 with a very low standard deviation (approx 1.89). Prior periods were much more volatile. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all 7 periods of history. I will set L to 'calculate' to lock in this 0-period observation. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new low-volatility, stabilized demand regime, rather than including the noisy earlier periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: Mean demand stabilized to ~62 units/week with significantly reduced volatility compared to Periods 1-3.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top, a staple item. Since Period 4 (March 4), the demand has entered a remarkably stable regime. Demand for the last 5 periods (P4-P8) has been [60, 63, 64, 60, 61], providing a mean of 61.6 and a very low standard deviation of approximately 1.8. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations confirm that actual lead time consistently equals 0. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit), and there is nothing in transit. To capture this stable demand accurately and avoid overstocking while ensuring availability, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the higher volatility and higher volume seen in Periods 1-3. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base_stock will closely track the mean (approximately 62 units).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Women's Long-sleeved top) has shown a stable demand regime since Period 4, with weekly demand averaging approximately 60 units (60, 63, 64, 60, 61, 50). The most recent demand (Period 9) was slightly lower at 50 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 12), and there are no in-transit units. To set OR parameters, I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the stable demand regime starting at Period 4. This covers the transition from late winter into spring. Given that profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the backend's critical ratio q will be 0.5, aiming to target the median demand. Using the stable statistics from the last 6 periods balances the risk of stockouts against holding costs appropriately for this staple item.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '316441001' (Womens Jersey Basic Long-sleeved top) is currently in a lower demand regime. Since Period 4 (March 4th), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level (mean ~53 units/week) compared to the initial periods. The most recent three periods (P8-P10) show a further downward trend (61, 50, 34). As we move deeper into spring (late April), demand for long-sleeved basic jersey tops often softens. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 26 units. Setting mu_hat using the last 7 samples (from Period 4 onwards) captures the stabilized lower demand regime while filtering out the early volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect the reduced volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: Potential seasonal softening as demand dropped to 34 units/week, down from the previous stabilization level of ~62.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '316441001' is a 'Long-sleeved top in soft jersey,' which typically experiences a seasonal decline in demand as the northern hemisphere transitions into late spring (current date April 29). Demand history supports this: Periods 4-9 averaged 60.16 units/week, while Periods 10-11 dropped to 34 and 41 units (avg ~37.5). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for this new stabilized lower demand regime and avoid overstocking (holding cost equals profit), I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the immediate softening while maintaining enough inventory to satisfy the current demand level of ~40 units, ensuring the OR backend's base-stock calculation reflects the most recent trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 10: Demand has softened from ~60 units/week to ~37.5 units/week (-37%) as of Period 12, likely due to seasonal transition away from long-sleeved jersey tops in late spring.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The SKU is a 'Long-sleeved top', which is experiencing a seasonal demand decline as spring transitions into summer. The demand regime shift noted at Period 10 is sustained, with the last three periods showing demand of 34, 41, and 34 (mean ~36.3). This is significantly lower than the ~61 units/week average seen from Period 4-9. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the current softened demand level of ~36.3 units/week (total mu_hat = (1+0)*36.3). I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility of this lower demand level.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Long-sleeved top in soft jersey,' which naturally sees a seasonal decline as late spring (mid-May) progresses. Demand history shows a clear regime shift starting around Period 10 (April 15), dropping from a mean of ~62 units/week to ~38 units/week. Periods 10-13 demand values are 34, 41, 34, and 43 (mean = 38). Period 13 resulted in a stockout (sold 37 of 43 demanded) due to the ending inventory being 0. Promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time has consistently been 0. To capture the recent lower demand regime while accounting for the small stockout in P13, I will use a window of the last 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new seasonal baseline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Long-sleeved top', which is seasonally declining as we move into late May (Period 15). Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 39.8 units over the last 5 weeks (Periods 10-14). Although we experienced stockouts in Periods 13 and 14 (demand of 43 and 47 respectively), this represents typical volatility rather than a reversal of the downward seasonal trend. On-hand and In-transit inventory are both zero, so an order must be placed to cover Period 15. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (approx 40 units/week), balancing the risk of stockouts against the high holding cost ($1/unit) during a period of seasonal decline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Long-sleeved top) has entered a more volatile demand phase. While a regime shift down to ~37 units/week was identified around Period 10 (late April), the last three periods (13-15) show a significant resurgence in demand: 43, 47, and 63 units respectively (mean = 51). This contradicts the previously identified softening and suggests either a temporary late-spring spike or a higher stabilized demand. Inventory has been wiped out for three consecutive periods (ending inventory=0), indicating consistent under-stocking. I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=6 (Periods 10-15) to capture the blend of the recent lows and the current surge, resulting in a more responsive baseline (avg ~43.6). I will use explicit sigma_hat to account for this increased volatility (std dev of last 6 periods is ~11, and I am choosing a conservative buffer to prevent further stockouts). Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 12: Previous softening at Period 10 (avg 37) has been replaced by a significant upward trend (43, 47, 63) in Periods 13-15, necessitating a higher base stock level to prevent stockouts observed in the last 3 weeks.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Long-sleeved top) is currently experiencing high demand volatility. After a significant demand spike (63 units) in Period 15, Period 16 showed a demand of 40 units. This suggests the upward trend identified in previous periods may be stabilizing or retreating as we move further into June (summer). However, because the system has experienced stockouts in Periods 13, 14, and 15, and the current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units), we must maintain a robust base stock to avoid further lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 (Periods 13-16) to capture the current active regime, which averages ~48 units/week. This N=4 window specifically targets the transition from the seasonal low back to higher demand levels. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for this SKU (Womens long-sleeved jersey top) has been volatile, showing a significant softening in Period 17 (demand = 23) compared to the upward trend observed in Periods 13-15 (avg ~51). Period 16 also showed a moderate demand of 40. Given the current date is early June (2019/6/10) and this is a long-sleeved item, the sharp drop in Period 17 likely signals a secondary seasonal decline as summer temperatures rise. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a low-margin SKU ($1 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am focusing on the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17) to capture both the recent peak and the subsequent downturn. Setting N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a balanced mean estimate (~42 units) and accounts for the recent high volatility, ensuring enough stock to capture potential demand spikes while starting to draw down inventory for the off-season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Significant softening (demand 23) following a volatile high-demand period (P13-P15), suggesting late-season decline for long-sleeved jersey basics.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '316441001' (Womens Long-sleeved top) is exhibiting a clear seasonal decline as we move into mid-June (current date 2019/6/17). This product is less relevant in summer. Historical demand samples from Period 17 (23 units) and Period 18 (16 units) confirm the downward trend noted in the Period 18 carry-over insight. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and minimize holding costs during this low-demand phase, I am adjusting parameters to reflect this new regime. mu_hat will use the average of the last 3 periods (Periods 16-18: 40, 23, 16) which averages to 26.3, significantly lower than the historical mean, as the OR backend calculates (1+L)*mean. I am using recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent steep decline and the reduced variance associated with lower demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 confirmed: Demand for long-sleeved jersey top has declined from ~40-50 units to an average of 19.5 units over the last two weeks (P17-P18), consistent with summer seasonality for long-sleeved basics.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is experiencing a significant seasonal decline as summer begins. In Period 17, demand dropped to 23, in Period 18 to 16, and in the most recent Period 19, it dropped to 5 units. This confirms the previously noted demand regime shift at Period 17, but the decline is accelerating much faster than anticipated. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P17-P19) is approximately 14.7 units, but the most recent observation of 5 suggests we should anticipate even lower volume. With an on-hand inventory of 23 units and zero in-transit, we already have over four weeks of cover relative to the most recent demand. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid accumulating excess holding costs on a declining seasonal item where profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), I will set the base stock level to reflect this ultra-low demand regime. Using N=3 for mu_hat captures the recent drop, but to be safer against further drops in early July, I will rely on recent_N for both mean and volatility to minimize further ordering until existing stock clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: Demand decline for long-sleeved jersey top accelerated sharply to 5 units, confirming late-season obsolescence as summer temperatures rise.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top (Womens Everyday Basics). We are currently in early July (Period 21). Historical demand shows a severe decline starting around Period 17 (June), with demand dropping from a range of ~40-63 units down to single digits (5 and 6 units in the last two periods). This is consistent with summer seasonality for long-sleeved garments. With 17 units on-hand and a current demand run-rate of approximately 5-6 units per week, the existing inventory is sufficient to cover nearly 3 weeks of demand. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the critical ratio (q) is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand (z=0). Ordering more at this stage poses a high risk of incurring holding costs on stagnant summer inventory. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent low-demand regime (avg ~5.7) and set L to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently been 0.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is currently experiencing a seasonal low as we are in July (mid-summer). Looking at the recent demand history: Period 19 (5 units), Period 20 (6 units), and Period 21 (18 units). The sudden jump to 18 units in Period 21 might be a small outlier or a clearance-related spike, as the previous weeks established a very low baseline of ~5-6 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Given the high holding cost ($1/unit) relative to the profit ($1/unit), the optimal base stock (q=0.5) targets a 50% service level, essentially aiming for the median demand. I will use a recent_N calculation where N=3 to capture the true summer low (avg ~9.6 units) while smoothing out the Period 21 bump. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Summer seasonal low confirmed (approx 10 units/week). Initial decline (P19-P20) was 5.5 units; Period 21 showed a slight uptick to 18, but overall volume remains significantly below spring levels.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Long-sleeved top in soft jersey,' which is seasonally inappropriate for July. Demand history confirms a sustained low-demand regime starting around Period 17 (Dates: 6/3 onwards). Recent demand figures (P17-P22) are: 23, 16, 5, 6, 18, 20. The mean of the last 6 samples is 14.6 units. Despite a slight upward tick to 20 units in Period 22, the overall volume is low and inventory has been consistently stocking out due to zero or minimal orders in recent periods (P19-P21 had 0 orders). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture the current summer low while accounting for the recent minor volatility (18, 20 units), I am selecting a recent_N window of 6 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the very low weeks (5, 6) with the slightly higher recent weeks (18, 20).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is currently in its seasonal trough during the peak of summer. Demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) has been 5, 6, 18, 20, and 13, averaging 12.4 units per week. While there was a slight increase in Periods 21 and 22, Period 23 saw a drop back to 13, reinforcing the summer seasonal low identified in the carry-over insights. With the profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning we want to target the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while the item is seasonally weak, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this low-demand regime. This keeps the base stock aligned with the current average of ~12 units, ensuring we satisfy the likely demand without accumulating high holding costs for an out-of-season item.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, currently in the middle of summer (July 29). Demand has been consistently low for the last six weeks (P19-P24), averaging 9.3 units per week (5, 6, 18, 20, 13, 4). The most recent demand was only 4 units. However, we are approaching August, where 'Back to School' or early autumn preparations might drive a slight uptick in jersey demand. Given the current on-hand inventory of 9 units and the recent average of ~9 units, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the summer baseline, while maintaining a standard sigma_hat for the current regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Long-sleeved jersey top) is currently in a deep summer seasonal low. Demand over the last 7 periods (P19-P25) has averaged 10.8 units per week (5, 6, 18, 20, 13, 4, 10). The most recent period (P25) showed a demand of 10. We enter P26 (August 5) with an on-hand inventory of 1 unit. Given the consistent lead time of 0 periods, we simply need to cover the current period's demand. I am using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the low-volume summer regime accurately while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the volatility seen in P21-P23 (8-10 units above mean).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, currently in the middle of August (Period 27). Historical demand since Period 19 has remained at a consistent summer low regime, following the seasonal decline from spring. Over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 11.6 units per week (20, 13, 4, 10, 11) with moderate volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0. As we approach late August, we expect demand to remain in this low-volume state before any potential autumn recovery. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current summer regime while filtering out the higher spring demand. With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will approximate. Maintaining stock to cover the upcoming week's mean demand plus a small buffer for the observed variance is appropriate to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 21 and 22.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historically, demand for this 'Women's Everyday Basics' long-sleeved jersey top has been in a sustained summer low since mid-June (Period 19). Over the last 6 periods (P22-P27), demand has stabilized at an average of 11.5 units per week (values: 20, 13, 4, 10, 11, 11). While there was a slight dip at Period 24, the levels are consistently hovering around 10-12 units. As we approach late August, we expect this low-demand regime to continue until the transition into fall. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current stabilized summer volume while maintaining enough stock to cover the consistent demand of ~11-12 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Historically, demand for this long-sleeved jersey top plummeted during June and July (averaging ~12 units/week) but has shown a slight recovery in the last two weeks (Period 27: 11 units, Period 28: 20 units). As we approach September, we anticipate the beginning of the autumn transition, where demand for long-sleeved basics typically increases. Period 28's demand of 20 units (a 100% increase over the previous 4-week mean of ~10) provides evidence of this upward shift. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this nascent recovery (average ~14) while maintaining enough buffer for further growth. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Entering autumn transition; demand increased to 20 units in Period 28, moving away from the summer low of ~10 units/week.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, which is highly seasonal. Current date is Sep 2, 2019, signifying the start of the autumn season. Historical data shows demand was significantly higher (60+ units) in February and March compared to the summer low (approx 10-15 units). The last two periods (P28 and P29) showed a meaningful increase in demand to 20 and 19 units respectively, marking a clear departure from the summer regime and the beginning of an upward autumn trend. To capture this shift while protecting against stockouts, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent trend (avg ~16.7 units) and increasing volatility. Actual lead time remains consistent with the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Autumn transition confirmed. Demand has increased from a summer average of ~10 to ~20 units/week over the last two periods (P28-P29).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Long-sleeved top) is entering its peak autumn season. Historically, demand for this item was high in Feb/March (approx. 60-80 units/week) and plummeted during the summer (approx. 10 units/week). As of Period 30 (early September), demand has stabilized at a higher level (~18.6 units/week over the last three weeks: 20, 19, 17) compared to the summer. However, we are stocking out frequently (ending inventory 0 in P28, P29, P30), indicating the OR backend's cap or base stock is too low for the current growth phase. To capture the seasonal uptick and prevent lost sales, I am using an explicit mu_hat forecast of 40 units (calculated as 1+L * 40). This is a bridge towards the item's historical non-summer performance, anticipating further growth as temperatures drop in September. Sigma_hat is set relatively high (explicit 15) to account for the volatility seen during previous regime shifts. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand entering second phase of autumn growth. Summer average (~10) moved to early-autumn average (~19), now positioning for peak-season return (historical Spring average ~60).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '316441001' (Womens Long-sleeved Jersey Top) is entering its peak autumn season. Demand has surged from a summer average of ~10 units/week and an early autumn level of ~19 units/week to 41 units in Period 31. This aligns with historical spring data where demand averaged ~60 units/week. Given the current 100% stockout (sold 40 against demand of 41), I need to increase base stock immediately to prevent lost sales as the weather cools. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P29-P31: 19, 17, 41) to capture this rapid upward momentum, while applying an explicit lead time of 0 as delivery remains reliable.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Autumn peak transition confirmed. Demand jumped from ~18 to 41 (+127%) in P31, nearing historical spring levels of ~60 units/week.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Long-sleeved jersey top) is entering its peak autumn season. Demand jumped in Period 31 to 41 units and was 26 in Period 32 (constrained by stockout). Historical spring data (Periods 1-9) shows average demand was significantly higher (approx. 80-90 units initially, then stabilizing at ~62). The current 'concluded' demand is artificially low due to back-to-back stockouts (Periods 31-32). To avoid continued lost sales during this seasonal ramp-up, I am setting mu_hat to a value that reflects the higher historical baseline for this product category during cooler months. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 70 (slightly above the stabilized spring average of 62 to account for the momentum seen in P31) and 'recent_N' with N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the current high volatility of the transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand ramp-up for autumn is currently under-forecasted by historical summer averages, leading to consecutive stockouts in P31 and P32. Adjusting targets toward historical spring baseline (~60-70 units/week).

The SKU 316441001 (Long-sleeved jersey top) is entering its peak autumn season. Demand has surged significantly: Period 31 (41), Period 32 (26 - likely stockout constrained), and Period 33 (98 units). This confirms that demand has moved well past the summer low (~10) and early autumn transitional levels (~20) and is now exceeding historical spring levels (~60). In Period 33, demand reached 98, resulting in a stockout despite ordering 70. Given the date (Sept 30) and the category, we must anticipate sustained high demand. I am setting mu_hat to 100 units (explicit) to cover the observed ceiling of ~98 and prevent further stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the high volatility seen during these seasonal ramp-ups.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Peak autumn demand confirmed. Demand surged to 98 in P33, significantly exceeding the spring baseline (~60). This marks the transition from autumn ramp-up to peak season levels for long-sleeved jersey basics.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '316441001' (Womens Everyday Basics Long-sleeved top) is currently in its autumn peak season. Demand in the last two periods (P33 and P34) has surged to 98 and 93 units respectively, significantly exceeding the spring baseline of ~60-70. This confirms a sustained peak demand regime. In P34, starting with 100 units, 93 were sold, leaving 7 on hand. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level during this peak, mu_hat should reflect the recent high-volume regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture the current weekly average (~95 units). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the volatility during the autumn ramp-up and peak. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current high demand while minimizing stockout risk as we continue through the peak autumn season.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey top, currently in the middle of October (Peak Autumn season). Historical demand has transitioned from a summer low (~10) through an autumn ramp-up (P31: 41), reaching a peak regime in the last three weeks: P33 (98), P34 (93), and P35 (75). The average demand over these last three peak weeks is 88.7. To maintain service levels during this high-demand period and avoid the stockouts seen during the ramp-up (P31-P33), I am setting mu_hat to reflect this recent peak volatility using recent_N=3. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the increased variance (range 75-98) compared to the stable summer baseline. Actual lead time remains consistent with the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Peak autumn demand regime established (Periods 33-35). Mean demand has stabilized at ~89 units/week (range 75-98), significantly higher than the spring baseline (~60).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Long-sleeved jersey top) is currently in its autumn peak season. Demand over the last four periods (P33-P36) has been 98, 93, 75, and 77, respectively, averaging approximately 86 units per week. This is significantly higher than the spring peak (~60 units) and the summer low (~10 units). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level during this peak, I am selecting mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods of peak demand (N=4) to accurately capture the current regime mean (~86) while accounting for the recent stabilization after the initial surge. Using sigma_hat with a recent window (N=4) will ensure the safety stock reflects the volatility of this high-demand period rather than the lower-volatility summer periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '316441001' (Womens Long-sleeved top) is currently in its peak autumn demand season. Since Period 33, demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime. The last five weeks of demand (P33-P37) are: 98, 93, 75, 77, and 79 units. This establishes a mean demand of approximately 84.4 units per week, significantly higher than the spring average of ~60. The current date (late October) suggests this peak likely continues through the colder months before any winter softening. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of this new peak regime, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility of the autumn peak while excluding the ramp-up and summer data. This ensures the base stock (approx 85-100 units depending on variance) is sufficient to meet demand without excessive holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0/unit).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Peak autumn demand regime (post-ramp) is sustained. Last 5 periods (P33-P37) show mean demand of 84.4 units/week (range 75-98).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in its peak autumn demand regime (Period 33 onwards). In Period 38, demand was 90, which slightly exceeded the starting on-hand inventory of 85, leading to a small stockout after a series of high-demand weeks. Over the last 6 periods (P33-P38), demand has been 98, 93, 75, 77, 79, 90, resulting in a mean of 85.3 units/week. Since the current date (2019/11/04) is early November, we are still within the peak window for long-sleeved jersey tops before any potential late-Q4 holiday/winter shift. I will set N=6 to capture this entire peak regime for the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Long-sleeved top) is currently in its peak autumn/winter demand regime. Since Period 33, demand has stabilized at a high level. Calculating the mean across the last 7 periods (P33-P39: 98, 93, 75, 77, 79, 90, 68) results in an average demand of approximately 82.8 units/week. While P39 showed a slight dip to 68, this is within the expected variance of the peak season. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level for this basic item during its peak season while balancing holding costs (profit=1, holding cost=1 suggests a 50% critical ratio, but the backend OR capped policy uses a specific formula to protect against stockouts), I will use the recent 7-period window (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current sustained peak regime while excluding the significant ramp-up and summer low data points.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the late autumn peak season for long-sleeved jersey tops. Recent demand from Period 33 to Period 40 has been robust, with a mean of approximately 83 units/week (98, 93, 75, 77, 79, 90, 68, 86). Period 40 showed a high demand of 86 units, which resulted in a stockout (sold 83, on-hand 0). Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, which the OR backend uses to set base stock near the mean. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand peak, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average. Sigma_hat will also be set based on this recent high-volatility peak period (N=8). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for this long-sleeved jersey top remains in its peak autumn/winter regime. Over the most recent 9 periods (P33-P41), demand has averaged 82.2 units. The last four periods specifically (P38-P41) show demand levels of 90, 68, 86, and 71 (average 78.75). There is no strong evidence of a late-season drop-off yet, as demand consistently fluctuates between 70 and 90 units. On-hand inventory is low at 13 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the stability of the current peak regime (since P33) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current high-demand state rather than the lower-volume summer/transition historical data.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), we observed a massive demand spike to 182 units, which is over double the recent peak-season average of ~84. This aligns with Black Friday (Nov 29, 2019), a major retail event. I expect this surge to be transient but potentially followed by elevated holiday demand. In Period 42, we were stock-out limited (sold only 82), so on-hand is currently 0. I will treat the P42 demand as a seasonal outlier. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the stable autumn plateau (average ~82) while slightly elevating the forecast via sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in the last few weeks (P40-P42). The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike in P42 (182 units) confirmed as Black Friday seasonal event. Pre-event autumn baseline (P34-P41) was stable at ~82 units/week. Expecting return to high-stable baseline or post-holiday softening in coming periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Black Friday week), demand spiked to 182 units. As expected and captured in the Period 43 carry-over, Period 43 demand dropped significantly to 42 units, signaling a post-holiday demand 'crater' or a return to baseline. The current date is Dec 9, 2019. Historically, demand for this 'Everyday Basic' long-sleeved top stabilized during the autumn peak (P34-P41) at approximately 82 units/week. Given the drop in P43 and the proximity to the end of the year, I expect demand to revert toward this high-stable baseline rather than stay at the extreme low of P43. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the high autumn volume while softening the impact of the Black Friday outlier and the immediate post-spike drop. L remains 0 based on consistent historical performance (all orders arrived within the same period). Sigma_hat will be calculated over the same N=10 period to account for the heightened volatility caused by the holiday spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday demand 'crater' confirmed in P43 (demand 42), following P42 spike (182). Anticipating stabilization toward the late-autumn baseline of ~80 units/week for the remaining periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/09), demand was 46, confirming the post-Black Friday 'crater' (P43 demand was 42) is extending into a broader December softening. The current date is December 16th; while there might be a minor pre-Christmas bump, the primary autumn/winter peak for 'Women's Everyday Basics - Long-sleeved jersey top' has likely passed. Demand is stabilizing at a level lower than the October/November peak of ~82 units/week. Over the last two periods (P43-P44), the average demand is 44 units. However, looking at the lead-up to the peak (P31-P32) and the post-peak behavior, a stabilized baseline of ~50-60 units is more likely for late December/early January before the true spring resurgence. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (P42, P43, P44) to capture the sharp descent from the 182-unit spike while acknowledging the current lower volume. sigma_hat will also be based on these 3 periods to account for the high volatility introduced by the spike and subsequent crater. The actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Late-December demand softening confirmed. Mean demand for the last two periods (P43-P44) is 44 units, down significantly from the pre-holiday baseline of ~82 units (-46%).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-Christmas week. Historically, the 'long-sleeved jersey top' saw a demand softening starting in P43 (post-Black Friday), with demand figures of 42, 46, and 58. While P45 showed a slight uptick to 58, the overall late-December trend is significantly lower than the autumn peak baseline (~82). I expect demand to remain in this softened state or drop further as we approach the final week of the year and transition into January, which often sees post-holiday clearance or reduced interest in basics before the spring refresh. Given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. I am setting mu_hat using the recent 3-period average (approx 48.6 units) to capture this late-season softening and prevent excess holding costs during a period of lower volume. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current reduced volatility after the Black Friday spike and crater.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '316441001' (Long-sleeved jersey top) is in a post-holiday softening phase as of late December. After the Black Friday spike (P42: 182) and subsequent crater (P43: 42), demand has stabilized at a lower mean. The last four periods (P43-P46) show demand of 42, 46, 58, and 38, resulting in a recent average of 46 units/week. This is significantly lower than the autumn peak of ~82-89 units. Given the date (Dec 30), we are moving into the deep winter/January period where demand for basics often remains stable but lower than the autumn ramp-up. The actual lead time remains consistently 0. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this lower late-season regime (46 units/week) and using the same window for sigma_hat to reflect the current reduced volatility (approx 8.5 units), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that prevents excess inventory during this seasonal slowdown.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Late-December/Early-January demand regime shift confirmed. Post-holiday average has stabilized at ~46 units/week (last 4 periods), down from the autumn peak of ~84 units/week.
