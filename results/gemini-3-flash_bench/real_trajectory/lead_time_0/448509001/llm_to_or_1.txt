Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Feb 11, 2019. We are looking at a fashion item (jeans) in the 'Divided Collection'. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend over the last 5 weeks (65, 117, 162, 118, 146), with the average around 121.6 units and a standard deviation of approximately 36 units. February typically sees a transition into spring fashion, which might explain the rising interest. Since this is Period 1, there is no historical lead time to observe (promised L=0). I will use recent_N=5 to capture the most recent growth trend for demand forecasting (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The backend OR will compute the base stock using the provided profit ($19) and holding cost ($1) to target an optimal service level.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18) for SKU 448509001 (Denim Trousers). In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 periods (order arrived same-period), which matches the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 was 149 units, which is consistent with the pre-game historical samples (65, 117, 162, 118, 146; mean=121.6). Including P1, the 6-sample mean is 126.1 and the standard deviation is 34.3. Given the product type (basic denim) and the mid-February date, there is no immediate seasonal spike expected before major spring shifts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to include all available data points for demand estimation, ensuring the OR backend captures the most relevant mean and volatility for this early stage. The 0-period lead time is confirmed, so I will use 'default' (promised).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, transitioning from late winter into spring. The product is 'Slim Mom Denim TRS' (jeans), which typically sees steady demand with potential upticks for spring wardrobe refreshes. Historical demand samples (65, 117, 162, 118, 146) combined with Period 1 and 2 actual demand (149, 150) suggest a stable demand regime centering around 140-150 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical concludes for Period 1 and 2 confirm the actual lead time is indeed 0 (orders placed and arrived in the same period). The OR backend logic uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 as (1+L) multipliers; with L=0, it targets inventory for the current period's demand. I will use recent_N for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the recent stabilized demand of ~150 units while excluding the early lower samples (65, 117). N=4 includes P1, P2 demand and the two preceding samples (118, 146).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS', a basic denim item. Historical demand (including samples) shows values of 65, 117, 162, 118, 146, 149, 150, 115. The mean of the last 5 demand observations (including the 3 periods of game play) is (146+149+150+115+118)/5 = 135.6. There is no clear seasonal spike for this category in early March based on the data. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments have arrived within the same period (confirmed lead_time 0 in periods 1, 2, and 3). Pipeline inventory is currently 0. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most stable recent demand regime while filtering out the very early low-demand outliers from January.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3135.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS', a standard pair of 5-pocket ankle-length jeans. Demand over the last 9 weeks (pre-seed + periods 1-4) has been: 65, 117, 162, 118, 146, 149, 150, 115, 173. The current date is March 11, moving into spring, which often sees stable or increasing interest in denim. Demand in Period 4 spiked to 173, causing a stockout (ending inventory 0). The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across the first four periods, confirming the promised lead time holds. To avoid further lost sales and account for the recent spike, I will use the mean of the most recent 4 periods (149, 150, 115, 173 = 146.75) as the basis for \u03bc\u0302. With L=0, the backend base stock logic will target (1+0) periods of demand. Sigma_hat is calculated from the same recent window to capture the increased volatility seen in Period 4.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509001' (Slim Mom Denim TRS) is showing a strong upward trend as we move into March, likely driven by spring fashion demand. Historical demand progressed from ~120 in January/early February to 173 (P4) and 225 (P5). In the last two periods, we stocked out (ending inventory 0), indicating that the OR backend's default estimation (which includes lower January values) is lagging behind actual demand. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this growth and prevent further stockouts, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (Avg: 171) which is more representative of the current spring season than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 4: Significant increase in weekly demand (from ~130 to 200+) coinciding with spring season transition for 'Slim Mom Denim'.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3058.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has shown a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 4, coinciding with the spring fashion season. Historical weekly demand for the first 5 samples was ~120, while the last 3 periods (P4-P6) show an average demand of ~188 (173, 225, 166). The current date is late March, suggesting sustained high demand for spring apparel. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 6 concluded cycles. To capture the elevated demand level while accounting for recent volatility (P5 was 225, P6 was 166), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to isolate the high-demand regime, and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect current variance. L remains at the promised 0.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' saw a significant demand surge in Periods 4 and 5 (173 and 225 units), although it has cooled slightly in the last two periods (166 and 139 units). The average demand over the last 4 periods (the 'spring' regime identified in carry-over) is 175.75. Given the seasonality of denim in early spring, I expect demand to remain higher than the initial February levels. The observed lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (approx 176 per period) and recent_N of 4 for sigma_hat to reflect the higher volatility seen during this regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated seasonal demand while accounting for the recent variance.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is 'Slim Mom Denim', which has shown a distinct upward demand shift starting around Period 4 (early March), consistent with spring fashion seasonality. Demand has been volatile: Period 4 (173), Period 5 (225), Period 6 (166), Period 7 (139), and Period 8 (261). The last five periods (P4-P8) average ~193 units, compared to the early-season average of ~130. We stocked out in Period 8 (sold 235 on 261 demand), leaving 0 on-hand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this higher, more volatile spring demand regime while minimizing stockouts, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the mean and standard deviation from the most recent 'high demand' period to calculate a safety stock that balances the high profit ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/04/15) managing a seasonal denim SKU. The demand history shows a regime shift starting around Period 4-5. Before Period 4, average demand was ~130. From Period 4 onwards, demand has been volatile but significantly higher, with peaks reaching 225-261 units and a mean of approximately 189 units. The product is 'Slim Mom Denim', which is highly relevant for the spring season. Recent data shows a alternating pattern of high demand (225, 261) followed by lower readings (166, 139, 158). This volatility suggests a higher \u03c3\u0302 is needed to prevent stockouts, which occurred in Periods 4, 5, and 8. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To capture the current higher demand level and its volatility, I am using recent_N=6 (covering Periods 4-9) for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This aligns the inventory base stock with the increased spring demand regime and provides enough safety stock to handle the observed spikes.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' (448509001) is currently in a spring demand regime. Analysis of demand since Period 4 (start of the shift) shows significant volatility: weekly demand values are [173, 225, 166, 139, 261, 158, 115]. The average demand over these last 7 periods is approximately 177 units. The Lead Time (L) is consistently 0, as all orders have arrived within the same period they were placed. Although the last two weeks (P9, P10) show a slight cooling (158, 115), the overall average for this spring regime remains high, and stockouts in P4, P5, and P8 suggest we should maintain a robust buffer. I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (the current regime) to capture this higher mean demand (approx 177 * (1+0) = 177). I am using recent_N for sigma_hat as well to account for the heightened spring volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509001' (Perrie Slim Mom Denim) has shown a demand regime shift previously noted. However, looking at the most recent 3 periods (Periods 9, 10, 11), demand has softened (158, 115, 109) compared to the mid-March spike. Currently, it is late April (2019-04-29). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory on hand is 151 units, which is relatively high given the recent downward trend in demand. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the stabilization after the spring peak while still weighting the recent deceleration more heavily than the full history. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the expected demand for the upcoming period without over-ordering into a potentially cooling interest phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized and begun to soften following the March spring transition; recent 3-period average is ~127 units compared to the previous peak average of ~200.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509001' (Slim Mom Denim) has shown a clear downward demand trend since the peak in early April. As noted in the Carry-Over Insights, the demand shift from a ~200 average to a softening regime is confirmed. Recent demand observations for Periods 10, 11, and 12 are 115, 109, and 84 respectively, yielding a 3-period average of 102.7 units. This represents a significant drop from the spring peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the high on-hand inventory (Inventory: 174), which is significantly higher than the most recent demand (84), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the softening demand regime while smoothing the volatility observed in the last two weeks. This setting allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that reflects the current lower demand level and helps avoid excessive holding costs from the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening regime confirmed (Periods 10-12): Weekly demand has dropped significantly from spring peak, with a 3-period average of 102.7 units (approx. 50% decrease from peak average).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' is experiencing a significant demand softening following its spring peak. Current date is May 13, 2019. Demand have dropped from a peak of ~200 units (Period 4-9) to a recent average of 85.3 units over the last 3 periods (Period 11: 109, Period 12: 84, Period 13: 63). The most recent demand (63) indicates a continuing downward trend. To avoid overstocking and excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the remaining baseline demand, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower regime properly. Actual lead time is confirmed consistently at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory of 111 is sufficient to cover about 1.5 periods of the current demand rate, so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order or none to converge toward the new lower base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-spring peak has trended lower than previously estimated; the new regime (Period 11-13) average is approx 85 units, down from the earlier softening estimate of 102.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim Trans' (448509001) has transitioned into a lower demand regime following the spring peak. Analysis of the last 4 periods (P11-P14) reveals demand levels of 109, 84, 63, and 65 (average = 80.25). This confirms the softening trend noted in previous insights as we move further into late May. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 68 units and a projected demand of ~80 per period, the OR backend needs updated parameters to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs for this lower volume period. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current stable-but-low demand regime, and L to default as the lead time of 0 is reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower levels: Periods 11-14 average 80.25 units, confirming a ~60% reduction from the March peak of ~200 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509001' (Perrie Slim Mom Denim) is currently in a late-spring cooling phase. Demand has significantly decreased from the March/April peak (avg ~200) to a lower, stable regime starting around Period 11. Specifically, demand for the last five periods (Periods 11-15) was 109, 84, 63, 65, and 59, respectively. This gives a 5-period average of 76 units and a 3-period average of 62.3 units. Given the downward trend as we move further into late May, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this established lower regime while acknowledging the recent stabilization around 60-65 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a safety stock that reflects the lower current demand volatility and volume, minimizing holding costs while keeping service levels high for the expected ~60-70 units of demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical data for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' shows a clear seasonal lifecycle: a pre-season mean of ~130, a spring peak (March/April) averaging ~180-200, and a significant post-peak decline starting in May. The demand has continued to soften over the last four periods (Periods 13-16), with actual demand values of 63, 65, 59, and 47. This equates to a trailing 4-period average of 58.5 units. The Carry-over insights previously identified a stabilization around 80, but the most recent data (especially Period 16: 47 units) suggests the decline is persisting as we enter the summer months. To prevent overstocking and excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level (backend target q \u2248 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this latest lower-demand regime. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history, so I will continue using the 'calculate' method.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline continued through May: Period 13-16 average demand dropped to 58.5 units, down from the early-May estimate of 80, reflecting typical late-season exhaustion for 'Mom Denim'.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has shown a consistent downward trend since the spring peak (March/April). In May, weekly demand dropped from 63 to 47. The most recent demand (Period 17) was 40 units. This decline is typical for heavyweight denim entering the summer months. The demand regime over the last 4 periods (P14-P17) has averaged 52.75 units (65, 59, 47, 40) with a standard deviation of approximately 11.2. Setting N=4 for the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters will capture this local softening while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the recent volatility. The actual lead time remains 0 periods as evidenced by Period 17's order arriving in the same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline confirmed through early June: Period 14-17 average demand dropped to 52.75 units, a further reduction from the previous late-May estimate of 58.5, indicating continued seasonal tapering for denim trousers.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' is experiencing a sustained late-season decline as we move into late June. The demand has systematically dropped from a peak of ~200 in March/April to a recent 4-period average (Periods 15-18) of 44 units. The most recent demand (Period 18) was 30 units. Given the 'Divided' collection focus and the product type (sturdy cotton denim trousers), demand typically tapers off during high summer in favor of lighter fabrics or shorts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 42 units, which already covers the most recent week's demand and is near the 4-period average. I will set mu_hat to be more responsive to this continued downward trend by using the recent_N method with N=4 (average = 44) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current tapering and avoids overstocking as we enter the summer season. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline continues into late June: Periods 15-18 average demand dropped to 44.0 units, down from the early-June estimate of 52.75, confirming significant seasonal tapering for the 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim'.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product (Perrie Slim Mom Denim) is experiencing a continued seasonal demand decline as we move further into the summer months. Demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) has consistently decreased (47, 40, 30, 33), averaging 37.5 units. This is down from the previous average of 44.0 units reported in P19's carry-over. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and holding costs during this clear tapering phase, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent, lower demand regime. This will allow the OR backend to lower the base stock level accordingly. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as historical performance has been stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline continues into late June: Periods 16-19 average demand dropped further to 37.5 units, down from the mid-June estimate of 44.0, confirming the item is nearing its seasonal floor.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' is in a strong seasonal decline as we enter July. Demand has dropped consistently from over 200 units in March to just 22 units in the most recent period (Period 20). The last four weeks of demand were 40, 30, 33, and 22, averaging 31.25 units. The trend is clearly downward as summer progresses, with the item nearing its seasonal floor. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs on a declining product, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect this most recent floor, as the historical average is now significantly higher than current reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor confirmed: Period 17-20 average demand dropped to 31.25 units, down from the late June estimate of 37.5, marking the lowest demand levels since tracking began.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' (448509001) is in a late-season trough as we enter July. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P18-P21) is 31 units (30, 33, 22, 39). Although P21 saw a slight bounce to 39, the overall trend is near a seasonal floor. With on-hand inventory sitting at 5 units after P21, an order is necessary. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=5) to capture the current low-demand stability while acknowledging the recent slight uptick, ensuring we don't stock out while minimizing holding costs for this tapering product.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand spiked unexpectedly to 97 units, significantly exceeding the previous 'floor' estimate of 31-39 units. This jump coincides with mid-July, which often triggers summer clearance sales or 'back-to-school' interest for denim, despite the warm weather. The stockout (sold 45, demand 97) indicates that the previous conservative strategy was insufficient for this sudden volatility. I am shifting the mu_hat forecast to use a recent_N of 3 to capture this upward shift immediately while balancing it with the preceding lower demand. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the high variance observed in the last period (97 vs 39), ensuring the OR backend targets a higher safety stock to prevent further lost sales during this potential mid-summer surge. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected Period 22 (97 units), breaking the previously established floor of ~31 units. This suggests a mid-summer regime shift or clearance-driven demand spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1701.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has exited its low-demand summer floor (which was ~31 units) and entered a new high-demand regime, likely driven by summer clearances or back-to-school early demand. Period 22 demand was 97 (limited by stock) and Period 23 demand was 91. These two periods average 94 units, representing a significant shift from the previous regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this sudden shift and maintain a high service level for the new higher-demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 to focus exclusively on the latest data points (97 and 91). I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=2 to reflect the current volatility. This will ensure the OR engine targets a base stock level sufficient for the current momentum (approx. 94 units + safety stock).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime shift confirmed (Starting Period 22): Weekly demand increased from a floor of ~31 units to an average of ~94 units (+200% increase), potentially due to clearance or mid-season promotion.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509001' (Slim Mom Denim) has entered a mid-summer demand regime shift starting in Period 22. After a long seasonal decline reaching a floor of ~31 units, demand spiked and has stayed elevated (P22: 97, P23: 91, P24: 65), averaging approximately 84.3 units over the last 3 periods. This shift likely corresponds to mid-season promotions or clearance events typical for late July. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent history. To capture this new, higher-demand regime while remaining responsive to the slight trailing off seen in P24, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 (P22-P24). This allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level around the current average of ~84 units per period, ensuring adequate stock for the sustained increase while minimizing excessive holding costs if the trend begins to taper further.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. We are in a confirmed mid-summer demand regime shift that began around Period 22 (July 8th). Demand in the last four periods has been 97, 91, 65, and 79 units, averaging 83 units per week. This is a significant jump from the previous floor of ~31 units, likely driven by mid-season promotions or clearance for this 'Slim Mom Denim' item. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 to capture this current regime (Periods 22-25). Sigma_hat will also be set using N=4 to account for the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level. This approach ensures base stock levels are sufficient to cover the current sales velocity while minimizing holding costs as we move further into the late summer season.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the middle of a mid-summer demand regime shift that began around Period 22 (July 8), likely driven by back-to-school preparations or clearance promotions for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim'. In the most recent period (Period 26), demand spiked to 120 units, resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand 0). The demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) has been: 97, 91, 65, 79, 120, giving an average of 90.4 units. To respond to this increasing trend and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. I will use the last 5 periods for sigma_hat as well to capture the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P22-P26) average demand confirmed at 90.4 units, with a recent peak of 120 units in Period 26. This represents a significant upward trend from the previous floor of ~31 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' (448509001) has surged significantly in August. Period 27 recorded a demand of 182 units, which is a sharp increase from the previous average of ~90 units observed during the mid-summer regime (P22-P26). This reflects a 'Back-to-School' or late-summer peak. Since the item is currently at 0 on-hand inventory and the lead time remains consistently 0 periods, I need to adjust the forecast to capture this latest demand level immediately. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include the transition from established summer levels (P22) to the current spike, while allowing the OR backend to react to the high Period 27 figure. This ensures we cover the current high-demand momentum while acknowledging the volatility.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand spike confirmed (Period 27): Demand surged to 182 units, significantly exceeding the mid-summer average of 90 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2985.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' is experiencing a significant late-summer/back-to-school demand surge. Demand in Period 27 was 182 units and in Period 28 was 158 units, compared to the mid-summer average of ~90 units. On-hand inventory is currently low (17 units) after selling out or nearly selling out for two consecutive periods. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held. I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods of data (average ~170) to capture this higher demand regime, while the OR backend's high service level (based on $19 profit vs $1 holding cost) will ensure adequate stock to prevent further stockouts during this peak. Lead time remains 'calculate' as actuals have reliably matched the 0-period promise.

Carry-over insight: Significant back-to-school demand surge confirmed (Periods 27-28): average weekly demand increased to 170 units, up from the summer average of 90.4 units (+88% shift).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering Period 30 (Sep 2, 2019). Reviewing the demand history, we have exited the intense back-to-school peak (Periods 27-28: 182 and 158 units) and the most recent demand (Period 29: 114 units) shows a significant softening as we enter September. The 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' back-to-school surge appears to be tapering, though it remains much higher than the mid-summer average of ~90 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this post-peak stabilization (Avg of P27-P29: 151.3 units). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility during this transition period. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so I will continue using the default method.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School tapering detected: Demand dropped from an average of ~170 in mid-August (P27-P28) to 114 units in the final week of August (P29), indicating the peak intensity has passed but remains above the summer floor.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility following the late-August back-to-school surge. Period 30 saw a bounce back to 165 units after a dip to 114 in Period 29. The current date is September 9th, which represents the start of the autumn retail season. While the peak back-to-school intensity (P27-P28) has passed, demand remains elevated compared to summer levels. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P27-P30) is 154.75 units. Given the fluctuation between 114 and 182 in the last month, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture this post-peak stabilization. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this shift. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand stabilization (P27-P30): Demand remains at a high plateau with an average of 154.75 units, significantly higher than the mid-summer average of 90 units, despite a brief dip in late August.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' is currently in a high-demand phase following the Back-to-School season (P27-P31). Recent demand historical samples show values of 182, 158, 114, 165, and 135 units. The average for this most recent regime (N=5) is 150.8 units, while the standard deviation is approximately 25.8. Looking at the seasonal calendar (mid-September), we are moving into the autumn peak for denim. Demand has remained consistently higher than the summer average (90 units). Inventory stands at 68 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period regime and use a recent_N sigma_hat to capture the current volatility of this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School high-demand regime confirmed (P27-P31): Average demand stabilized at ~151 units, a ~67% increase over the summer average of 90 units.

Demand has stabilized over the last few weeks (Periods 29-32) with values of 114, 165, 135, and 134 units, yielding an average of 137 units. This is slightly lower than the initial peak average of 151 units noted in previous periods but remains significantly elevated compared to summer levels. Since lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L=0. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 (capturing the full stable plateau from Period 27 onwards) to represent the current seasonal demand level of ~150 units across the review and lead period. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current volatility of this high-demand phase. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a high service level to capture profits while adjusting to the slightly lower, stabilized demand volume observed in September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand spiked sharply to 275 units, significantly exceeding the previous autumn plateau of ~151 units and exhausting all on-hand inventory. This surge coincides with late September/early October, likely driven by a seasonal shift towards heavier denim as temperatures drop or a specific promotion. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To address this new demand regime and the stockout, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent high-demand trend (averaging approx 177 units over P30-P33), while also using an explicit sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility shown by the 275-unit spike. This should prevent further lost sales while balancing holding costs for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim'.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge detected Period 33: Weekly demand jumped to 275 units, a 100% increase over the previous 5-week average of ~137, suggesting a new peak autumn/early winter regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509001' (Perrie Slim Mom Denim) is currently in an autumn high-demand regime, likely influenced by cooler weather and the transition into October. Period 33 saw a massive demand spike to 275 units, while Period 34 returned to 134 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 168.6 units. Given the seasonality of denim, demand is expected to remain elevated or continue to climb as autumn progresses. I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 175 units per period (representing (1+L) * 175) to account for the current high-demand plateau and protect against another spike like P33. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen in the last few weeks. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime continues: Average demand over P30-P34 is 168.6 units, maintaining the elevated levels seen since the Back-to-School period but with higher volatility (CV ~0.37).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1924.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October. Demand for the 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has remained elevated since the back-to-school season began; however, the massive spike to 275 units in Period 33 appears to have been an outlier or a temporary peak, as demand has retreated to more sustainable levels (134 and 110 units in Periods 34 and 35, respectively). The current regime (P31-P35) average is 157.6 units, but the most recent two weeks suggest a cooling trend toward late-autumn levels. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the Period 33 surge while maintaining a high service level for the autumn season, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility, which effectively smooths the recent 275-unit spike with the more recent lower observations.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak stabilization: Following a one-week surge in late September (P33: 275 units), demand has moderated back to an average of ~122 units over the last two weeks (P34-P35), aligning with mid-autumn tapering expectations.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has shown a consistent tapering trend over the last three periods following the late-September peak (P33: 275). Demand decreased from 134 in P34, to 110 in P35, and most recently to 79 in P36. The average demand over the last three periods (P34-P36) is 107.7 units, which is notably lower than the Autumn high-demand regime average of ~150-170 units. This suggests the product is entering a late-autumn cooling phase. With on-hand inventory currently at 188 units and actual lead time consistently at 0 periods, the current stock is sufficient to cover approximately 2.3 periods of recent demand. To prevent overstocking during this tapering phase while maintaining a high service level (given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the recent deceleration, while keeping sigma_hat based on a slightly longer 5-period window to account for the residual volatility from the late-September surge.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand tapering confirmed (P34-P36): Average demand decreased to 107.7 units, down from the peak Autumn average of ~151 units, reflecting seasonal cooling for denim trousers.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509001' (Slim Mom Denim) is currently in a late-autumn tapering phase. Demand has significantly cooled from the September/October peaks. Last period's demand was 93 units, and the average over the last four periods (P34-P37) is 104 units, confirming a downward trend compared to the earlier autumn average of ~151. With an on-hand inventory of 139 units and 0 in-transit (as lead time is consistently 0), we are well-covered for the immediate future. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this cooling trend and avoid over-ordering as we move into November. Promised lead time remains 0, and actual lead time has consistently matched it.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509001' (Slim Mom Denim) is currently in Period 39 (early November). Recent demand history shows a period of tapering in October followed by a sudden spike to 133 units in Period 38 (late October), possibly driven by early November promotions or a pre-holiday lift. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently confirm a lead time of 0. Given the recent volatility\u2014ranging from 79 to 133 over the last 4 periods (P35-P38 mean: 103.75)\u2014I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=4 for mu_hat captures the recent uptick better than a longer average, while setting N=6 for sigma_hat provides a more stable estimate of volatility during this transition period. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the unexpected demand surge while remaining sensitive to the underlying tapered trend observed earlier in autumn.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge detected Period 38 (133 units), following a tapering phase; 4-period average (P35-P38) is 103.75 units, suggesting potential early-winter stability or promotion-driven volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has shown significant volatility recently. After an autumn peak that reached 275 units (Period 33), demand stabilized around 110-130 units, followed by a sudden spike to 133 units (Period 38) and a sharp drop to 64 units in the most recent Period 39. This drop likely signals late-season tapering or a return to baseline after a promotional event. With on-hand inventory at 157 units and no in-transit units, and given the observed drop in demand, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent average while allowing for potential volatility. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 captures the transition from the Period 38 spike to the Period 39 drop, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 92.5 units per period (before lead time scaling). This ensures we don't over-order if the downward trend continues while maintaining enough buffer for localized spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late Oct/early Nov: Period 38 spike (133) followed by Period 39 drop (64), suggesting the autumn regime is ending or becoming highly unstable.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18 (Period 41). The item is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim', a seasonal trouser SKU. Demand analysis shows a clear downward volatility trend after the Autumn peak. Recent demand for Periods 37-40 has been 93, 133, 64, and 55. This indicates the late-autumn tapering is transitioning into a lower winter regime. The 4-period average is approx 86 units, but the last two periods (64, 55) suggest the true current mean is closer to 60. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 102 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately two weeks of current demand levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent volatility while reflecting the downward trend. This will set a base stock that likely results in a small or zero order this period, which is appropriate for a softening demand phase to minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed mid-November: Average demand for P39-P40 dropped to 59.5 units, a significant decrease from the P35-P38 average of 103.75, confirming the end of the Autumn/Early-Winter peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a confirmed late-autumn/early-winter demand softening phase for the 'Slim Mom Denim'. Demand for the last three periods (P39-P41) has been 64, 55, and 48 units, averaging 55.7 units. This confirms a significant shift from the volatile October phase. The on-hand inventory is 97 units with no units in transit. Since the promised lead time (L=0) has consistently held throughout the history, the OR engine will place a same-day arrival order. To prevent overstocking during this definitive tapering phase, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current mean of ~56 units. I am also using recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility (std ~8.1) observed during this stabilization, compared to the higher volatility seen in earlier autumn peaks. This approach balances the high profit margin with the risk of high holding costs as the season concludes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization confirmed late November (P39-P41): Average weekly demand has leveled out to approximately 56 units, reflecting a clear transition away from the higher volatility seen in October.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike (274 units), a 490% increase from the previous 3-period average of ~56 units. This surge corresponds with the week of November 25th, encompassing Black Friday (Nov 29, 2019). Given this coincides with a major retail event followed by Cyber Monday and the Christmas shopping season, I am treating this as a new high-volatility holiday demand regime. The previous 'stabilization' carry-over is now obsolete. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to incorporate this spike while acknowledging it may be an outlier caused by Black Friday, weighting the forecast toward high volume to capture potential follow-on December demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime shift detected Period 42: Demand surged to 274 units (Black Friday week), breaking the late-November floor of ~56 units. Anticipate continued high volatility and elevated demand through December.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1822.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the December holiday season. Period 42 saw a massive spike (274 units) coinciding with Black Friday/Cyber Monday, while Period 43 demand moderated to 108 units as the initial surge settled. Considering the product is 'Slim Mom Denim', demand typically remains elevated and volatile through the Christmas shopping peak and into the post-holiday clearance phase. Current on-hand is 230 units. To maintain a high service level while managing volatility, I am setting mu_hat using EWMA (gamma=0.5) to balance the recent massive spike with the subsequent moderation, ensuring the base stock reacts quickly but not excessively to individual outliers. Sigma_hat is set using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current high-volatility regime (Standard Deviation approx 96). Lead time remains 0 based on consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed (Start P42): High volatility observed with a peak of 274 followed by 108; early Dec demand is ~2x late-Nov baseline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak holiday season (mid-December). Demand remains highly volatile and elevated following the Black Friday spike (P42: 274) and subsequent weeks (P43: 108, P44: 163). The current 3-period average for the holiday regime (P42-P44) is 181.67 units. Transitioning into the final weeks of December, we expect high demand to persist or potentially spike further before the post-Christmas drop-off. With 131 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, and a lead time of 0, we need to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover this elevated demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current holiday regime accurately while excluding the much lower November baseline.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime peak confirmed: Mean demand for P42-P44 is 181.7 units with high volatility (Std Dev ~85), representing a 3x increase over the late November baseline (~56 units).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the week of Christmas. The Carry-Over Insights and recent history (P42-P45) confirm a high-demand holiday regime for 'Slim Mom Denim', with demand values of 274, 108, 163, and 169. This results in an average demand of 178.5 units over the last 4 periods (N=4), representing a significant 3x shift from the late-November floor of ~56. Given the date (Dec 23), we anticipate high demand to continue through the end of the year and into the post-Christmas sales period. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility holiday seasonal peak while maintaining the lead time at default.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P45) sustains high levels: mean demand 178.5 units, significantly elevated due to December seasonality and holiday sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2167.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, representing the final week of the holiday season and the transition into the New Year. The holiday demand regime (starting Period 42) has shown high levels but with significant volatility (P42: 274, P43: 108, P44: 163, P45: 169, P46: 123). The average demand over these last 5 holiday-influenced periods is approximately 167 units. Historically, January (as seen in the provided initial samples) shows a cooling trend, with demand starting high in early January (~146 in Feb-04, but early samples like Jan-07 were 65) and then tapering toward the spring transition. Given the high on-hand inventory of 170 units and no units in transit, the current stock covers the recent holiday average demand perfectly for one period. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the high December levels but keep L at default (0) to allow the backend to respond quickly to potential post-holiday tapering in the first week of January.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P46) shows a mean demand of 167.4 units with high volatility (range 108-274), significantly higher than the late November baseline of ~56.
