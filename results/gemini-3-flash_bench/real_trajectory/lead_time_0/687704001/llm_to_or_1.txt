Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a pair of ladies' denim trousers. Based on the historical demand provided (Jan 7 to Feb 4), we see a clear ramp-up in demand: 0, 0, 56, 216, 319. This suggests a post-holiday launch or a seasonal trend leading into spring. The promised lead time is 0. Since we are in an upward trend, the 'default' method (using all history) will significantly underestimate current demand because it includes the zeros from early January. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 (matching the non-zero demand periods) to capture the current mean of ~197 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level. For L, I will use 'default' as we have no evidence yet that the promised lead time of 0 is inaccurate.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a core denim item (Embrace Super Skinny Ankle High Waist). For Period 1, we ordered 415 units with a promised lead time of 0, and they arrived immediately (confirmed by 'arrived=415... lead_time was 0 periods' in the Period 1 conclude message). Demand for Period 1 was 276. Historical demand samples (0, 0, 56, 216, 319) plus the Period 1 result (276) show a clear ramp-up phase as the product becomes active. The average of the last three active periods (Jan 28: 216, Feb 4: 319, Feb 11: 276) is ~270. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR engine will target a high service level. Since L=0, we need to cover (L+1)=1 period of demand. I will use the recent 3-period average for demand and volatility to capture the current active status without including the initial 'zero' periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'super-skinny ankle jeans,' a staple denim item. Currently, we are in late February. Historical demand shows a significant ramp-up from zero in early January to a peak of 319 in early February, followed by a slight stabilization/dip (276 and 207 in the last two periods). The average demand over the last three available observations (319, 276, 207) is approximately 267. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the lead time is 0, we need to cover the current period's demand (N=1 for mu_hat/sigma_hat calculation). I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) to reflect the recent high-demand regime while acknowledging the slight cooling from the peak. This ensures we stay responsive to the current sales velocity without overreacting to the initial zero-demand weeks in January.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Post-Jan start-up, demand stabilized at an average of ~267 units/week (last 3 weeks). Initial lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The SKU is 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle' jeans, a core denim item. Since Period 1, observed demand has been 276, 207, and 163. Combined with pre-game history (216, 319), we see a volatile but active demand pattern. The carry-over insight noted a regime mean of ~267, but recent data shows a downward trend (163 last period). However, early March often sees a slight uptick in denim as spring fashion ramps up. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently 198 (on-hand) with zero in-transit. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the recent activity while weighting it against the slower pre-game Jan/Feb starts. Sigma will also use recent_N=5 to account for the high variance seen between 163 and 319. Since L has been consistently 0, the 'calculate' method is safe.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3342.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a staple item (Ladies Super Skinny Denim), and demand has entered a relatively stable period after a February peak. Observed demand over the last 4 conclusive periods (P1-P4) has been [276, 207, 163, 184], averaging 207.5 units/week. This is a noticeable drop from the early February spike (~300+). Lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives in the same period it is placed). Period 4 ended with 154 units on-hand. Since L=0, the OR backend needs parameters covering (1+L)=1 period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new, lower demand regime (average ~208) compared to the all-time history. The OR engine will use these values to calculate a base stock that maintains a high service level (Profit:Holding ratio is 19:1), ensuring availability for the upcoming spring season while avoiding excessive stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a lower mean: Avg demand decreased from late-Feb peak to ~208 units/week (Periods 1-4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. Historical demand samples (before the game start) showed an upward trend (56 to 319), but in-game history (Periods 1-5) reflects a cooling demand regime following a late-winter peak. The demand for these super-skinny ankle jeans has been 276, 207, 163, 184, and 158. This shows a clear downward shift compared to the initial weeks. The average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 178 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods (immediate arrival). To prevent overstocking and minimize holding costs while ensuring a high service level for this $19 profit item, I will use a recent demand window to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=4 captures the most recent stabilization below 200 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed lower: Weeks 2-5 show an average demand of 178 units, significantly lower than the Period 1 peak of 276.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/03/25 (Period 7). The product is a staple item ('Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W' jeans). Demand has shown a consistent downward trend since the peak in Period 1: 276, 207, 163, 184, 158, 129. The most recent 3-period average (P4-P6) is ~157 units, and the 5-period average (P2-P6) is ~168 units. The latest demand of 129 represents a significant drop below the previous floor, suggesting a transition from early spring peak into a lower late-spring base. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), I will use the last 5 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the deceleration while hedging against the Period 6 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand has trended downward from ~200+ units in February to a 5-week average of 168.2 units and a 3-week average of 157 units by late March.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a staple item (Ladies Denim). Demand over the last 7 periods has trended downwards from an initial peak of 276 to a recent 4-week average of 160 units (184, 158, 129, 169). The most recent demand (Period 7) was 169, showing a slight uptick from Period 6. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (48 units) and there is no in-transit stock. To maintain high service levels while respecting the recent downward trend, I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the current stabilized demand regime of approximately 160 units/week. Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high (19:1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (quantile \u2248 0.95), and these parameters will ensure enough stock is ordered to cover Period 8 demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 687704001 (Women's Skinny Denim) has shown a downward trend from Feb/March (avg ~180-200) but recently ticked up to 193 units in Period 8. The start of April often sees a 'Spring' demand lift for seasonal apparel. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (6 units). I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture the recent stabilization and slight uptick without overweighting the much higher January/early February peaks. N=4 reflects demand from mid-March to early April (Avg: 162.25). Using recent_N for sigma will account for the recent volatility (stdev of the last 4 periods is ~26). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and maintains a buffer against the recent slight increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1874.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), the demand for the SKU 687704001 (Ladies Skinny Denim) remains volatile following a downward trend from its February peak. Recent demand samples are: P7=169, P8=193, and P9=104. The sudden drop to 104 units in Period 9 suggests significant volatility or a potential softening in demand as we move into mid-April. Actual lead time is consistently confirmed at 0 periods across all history (P1 to P9). I will set L to 0 using the calculate method. To handle the recent demand fluctuations, I will use a 4-period window (N=4) for mu_hat (averaging ~158 units per period) and sigma_hat to reflect the increased standard deviation (volatility) seen in the last month. This captures the lower overall mean compared to the start of the year while providing enough buffer for potential late-spring demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in April: Weekly demand fluctuated between 104 and 193 units (Periods 7-9). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the demand history for SKU 687704001, we observe a sustained downward trend in demand over the last four periods (193 -> 104 -> 81). The last two weeks have seen demand drop significantly below the previous March average (~160), with Period 10 recorded at just 81 units. As this is a denim product (Skinny Ankle jeans), we might be seeing a shift in seasonal preference as spring progresses into warmer weather, or a stabilization after an early spring peak. To avoid overstocking and excessive holding costs given the current on-hand inventory of 134 units (which already covers over a week of recent demand), I am reducing mu_hat by using the average of the last 4 periods (N=4), capturing the recent decline while acknowledging the higher demand from Period 8. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen throughout April. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed in late April: Demand dropped from a late-March average of ~160 to a 2-week average of 92.5 (Periods 9-10), a ~40% decrease.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001, a specific style of women's denim jeans, has seen a clear downward trend in demand since the spring peak. The most recent three periods (9, 10, and 11) show demands of 104, 81, and 90, establishing a stabilized low-demand regime with an average of approximately 91.7 units per week. This is a significant drop from the March average (~160). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (P1-P11). Given the current on-hand inventory of 134 units, and the detected demand regime of ~92 units, the system currently holds enough stock to cover more than 1 week of demand. For Period 12, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current low-demand stability (late April/early May context). This helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering during this seasonal slowdown while maintaining a safe service level for the skinny denim category.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level (~92 units/week) for the last 3 periods (P9-P11), confirming a significant downward shift from previous months.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Demand for this SKU (super-skinny ankle jeans) has entered a stable low-demand regime since mid-April. Looking at the last four periods (P9-P12), demand has been 104, 81, 90, and 93, resulting in a mean of approximately 92 units per week. The volatility has also decreased significantly compared to the early months of the year. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 41 units with 0 in-transit. I will use recent_N=4 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized late-spring regime, as older highly volatile data from February and March is no longer representative of current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1212.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a sustained downward trend in demand. Reviewing the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand values were [104, 81, 90, 93, 66], averaging 86.8 units/week. The most recent demand (P13) dropped even further to 66 units, suggesting that the lower end of the previous range (approximately 80-90) may be failing to hold. I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent lower-demand regime while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility. The lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Current on-hand is 42 units, which is below the recent average demand, necessitating an order to maintain service levels for the upcoming period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has dropped to 86.8 units/week, with Period 13 showing a further decline to 66 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 687704001 (Ladies super-skinny ankle jeans) has shown a consistent downward trend over the past few months, moving from ~210 units/week in February/March to an average of 72 units/week over the last three periods (P12-P14: 93, 66, 59). This decline aligns with typical seasonal shifts in denim as warmer weather approaches. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am using recent_N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this most recent lower-demand regime (mean ~73) and sigma_hat to reflect the associated volatility. As the profit is significantly higher than the holding cost ($19 vs $1), the OR backend's service level target (z-score) will remain high to prevent stockouts despite the declining trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P12-P14) has dropped to 72.7 units/week, down from the previous 5-period average of 86.8.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704001 (Ladies' Super Skinny Denim) continues a persistent downward trend as we move into late May. Demand in the most recent periods has been 93, 66, 59, and 48, showing a significant drop compared to the April average. The product is likely moving past its peak spring season. Current on-hand inventory is 55 units, which almost covers the entire last period's demand (48). Given lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set parameters based on the most recent 4-period regime (Periods 12-15) to capture this lower mean (approx 66.5 units) and reduced volatility. This approach prevents overstocking during a clear seasonal decline while maintaining a 95% service level via the OR backend. Lead time calculation remains 'calculate' as lead time has been consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P12-P15) has dropped to 66.5 units/week, with Period 15 reaching a new low of 48 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Embrace Super Skinny Ankle Jeans has continued a steady decline as we move into June. The most recent demand was 34 units (Period 16), which follows a clear downward trend since April (P9-P16: 104 -> 81 -> 90 -> 93 -> 66 -> 59 -> 48 -> 34). The product is a denim item described as having a 'high waist' and 'super-skinny legs', which may see less demand as summer temperatures rise and looser or shorter styles gain preference. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (Currently $1/unit/period) while demand is dropping, I am shrinking the sample window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to the last 5 periods (P12-P16), which averages ~54.2 units/week. This N=5 captures the recent acceleration of the decline while maintaining enough history to handle minor volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward continues: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has dropped to 54.2 units/week, with Period 16 reaching a new low of 34 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704001 (Ladies Denim) continues its steady seasonal decline as we move further into June. Demand has dropped sequentially over the last 5 periods (59, 48, 34, 31), and the most recent 3-period average is approx 37.7 units. This trend is consistent with a seasonal transition. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level (optimal q approx 0.95), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this most recent downward regime. Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to 'default'. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover current and lead time demand, restricted by the safety stock formula.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward continues: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P15-P17) has dropped to 37.7 units/week, following a peak of over 200 units in early spring.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704001 (super-skinny ankle jeans) continues its steady downward trend as we move into mid-June. Demand has decreased over the last five periods (P14-P18: 59, 48, 34, 31, 22), with the most recent three periods averaging 25.7 units. This represents a significant decline from the spring peak. The product description suggests a seasonal fashion item that is likely winding down its peak lifecycle. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the consistent and sustained decrease in demand, I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current, lower demand regime (avg ~26, std ~6) to avoid over-ordering and incurring unnecessary holding costs on a declining product. I will maintain L at default (0) as there is no evidence of delay.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward continues: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P15-P18) has dropped to 33.75 units/week, with Period 18 reaching a new low of 22 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001 (Super Skinny Ankle Jeans) is exhibiting a clear and sustained decline in demand as the summer season progresses (June 24). Demand has consistently dropped from over 200 units in early spring to 34, 31, 22, and 20 units over the last four periods (P16-P19). The most recent 3-period average (P17-P19) is approximately 24.3 units. On-hand inventory is currently at 24 units, which matches the recent weekly average. Given the promised lead time of 0 periods, current inventory is almost sufficient for the upcoming period's demand. I will use a window of the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand regime, ensuring we do not over-order as the product likely nears the end of its peak seasonal relevance. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward continues: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P15-19) has dropped to 31 units/week, with the most recent period (P19) reaching a low of 20 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704001 (Ladies Denim) continues to decline as we enter July, which is typically a slower period for heavy denim in many regions. Period 20 recorded a significant low of 5 units. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 22.4 units, but the most recent 3-period average (P18-P20) is even lower at 15.6 units. To avoid excessive holding costs in a clearly declining regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3. This reflects the most current, albeit low, demand level while maintaining the promised lead time of 0. On-hand inventory is currently 33, which is significantly higher than the most recent demand, meaning the OR backend will likely order 0 or very few units to burn off excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward continues: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P18-P20) has dropped to 15.6 units/week, with Period 20 hitting a new series low of 5 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is exhibiting a clear and sustained end-of-season decline. Weekly demand has dropped significantly from over 200 units in the spring to a very low volume in early July. The last five periods (P17-P21) recorded demands of 31, 22, 20, 5, and 9 units, respectively. This results in a 5-period average of 17.4 and a 3-period average of 11.3. Current on-hand inventory is 24 units, which already covers more than two weeks of demand at the most recent average. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the OR backend normally aims for a high service level, but because the trend is consistently downward and inventory is sufficient, I will use a very recent look-back window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering based on older, higher demand data. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward continues: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P19-P21) has dropped to 11.3 units/week, down from the previous 5-period average of 31. Retail season for this denim style appears to be nearing its minimum.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704001 (super-skinny denim) has entered a very low-volume phase as we move further into July. In the last three periods (P20-P22), demand has been 5, 9, and 9 units respectively (average 7.67). Over the last five periods (P18-P22), the average is 11.0 units. The downward trend observed since spring has bottomed out. Given the current on-hand inventory of 16 units and a consistent lead time of 0 periods, the existing stock already covers approximately 2 weeks of the current demand pace (7.67 units/week). To avoid accumulating excess holding costs ($1.0/unit) on a product with significantly cooling demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples to reflect this new floor. Sigma_hat will also be tightly tuned to the last 3 samples to reflect the reduced volatility at these low levels. L remains at the default (0) as verified by history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at floor: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P20-P22) is 7.67 units/week, indicating the seasonal low for this item is now established between 5-10 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704001 (super-skinny denim) has reached a seasonal floor. Over the last four periods (P20-P23), demand has been consistently low: 5, 9, 9, and 6 units (mean = 7.25). This aligns with the peak of summer (late July), where heavy denim demand typically troughs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to avoid over-ordering based on higher historical levels. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by multiple 'lead_time was 0 periods' messages in history. Since the current on-hand inventory is 10 units and the expected weekly demand is ~7.25 units, the OR backend will calculate a small or zero order quantity, which is appropriate to minimize holding costs during this low-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim skinny ankle jean. We are currently in late July (2019/07/29). Demand has been steadily declining from a peak of nearly 300 units in February down to current single-digit/low double-digit levels (average demand over the last 5 periods is 8.2 units). In Period 24, we saw a slight uptick in demand to 12 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending on-hand inventory 0). Given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally aim for a higher service level, but we must guide it with a realistic demand forecast. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (average demand ~8.2) and sigma_hat to capture the current low-volume, slightly volatile regime, ensuring we order enough to cover the recent slight increase in demand while avoiding overstocking as the season remains in a trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a seasonal floor in July; however, Period 24 showed a minor uptick to 12 units after a string of single-digit weeks, suggesting demand may fluctuate between 5-15 units during this low-season trough.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, there was a sudden and significant demand spike to 58 units, which follows a long period (P20-P24) where demand averaged ~8 units. This spike coincided with the end of July and the transition into August (Back-to-School season), which is a major driver for denim categories (Ladies Denim). I am shifting the demand forecast to account for this seasonal recovery. The previous floor of 10-15 units is no longer representative. I will use a recent_N of 3 to blend the recent trough with the current spike, while setting the Lead Time as explicit 0 per historical performance. This allows the OR backend to react to the increased volume while maintaining a buffer against further seasonal growth.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand recovery detected in late July/early August: Demand spiked from a 5-week average of ~8 units to 58 units in Period 25 (+625%), likely driven by Back-to-School retail cycles for denim.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001 (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a sharp seasonal recovery coinciding with the Back-to-School period in mid-August. Demand has surged from a seasonal floor of ~8 units to 58 units (P25) and then to 71 units (P26). This represents a clear demand regime shift. I am using recent_N (N=2) to capture this immediate upward trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the long-term historical mean is irrelevant during this spike. Lead time remains stable at 0. Since the profit/holding cost ratio is high (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level, which is appropriate for this rapid recovery phase to avoid lost sales, as seen in Period 25.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School seasonal recovery confirmed: Demand increased from single digits in July to an average of 64.5 units/week in the first two weeks of August (P25-P26).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late August (2019/08/19), a peak period for 'Back-to-School' shopping. The product is a staple denim item which is highly seasonal. History shows a clear recovery: demand jumped from <10 units in July to 58, 71, and 101 units in the last three weeks respectively. Period 27's demand was 101 units, but we stocked out (sold only 80). The trend is upward, and the average for the last three periods (P25-P27) is 76.7 units. Given the momentum and the stockout, I expect Period 28 demand to be at or above 100 units. I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture this recovery, but I will explicitly set a higher mu_hat to ensure we capture the full demand spike and avoid further lost sales. Lead time has been consistently 0. I will set mu_hat (which covers L+1 = 1 period) at 110 and sigma_hat at 20 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand acceleration confirmed: Demand increased from 58 to 71 to 101 units over P25-P27, indicating a sharp seasonal trend exceeding previous recovery estimates. Stockout occurred in P27.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001 (Ladies Denim) is in the middle of a Back-to-School (BTS) seasonal recovery. After reaching a seasonal floor in July, demand spiked significantly starting in late July. Recent demand history shows: P25 (58), P26 (71), P27 (101), and P28 (74). The slight drop in P28 from the P27 peak suggests the initial BTS surge may be stabilizing, but demand remains much higher than the summer trough. The mean of the last 4 periods (the recovery regime) is 76 units. Given the transition into late August/early September, I expect demand to remain in this higher regime before eventually tapering. I will use a 4-period window (recent_N=4) for mu_hat to capture this specific recovery phase while filtering out the extremely low summer demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the higher volatility observed during this shift. Observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School recovery regime (P25-P28) average demand is 76 units, confirming a shift from the summer floor of ~10 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1894.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001 (super-skinny denim) is clearly in its Back-to-School/Autumn seasonal peak. Demand has accelerated from single digits in July to an average of 86.8 units per week over the last 5 periods (P25-P29). The most recent demand (P29) was 100 units, following a volatile sequence (58, 71, 101, 74, 100). This indicates a high-demand regime with significant variance. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current seasonal average (~86.8) while the sigma_hat method will capture the increased volatility of this recovery phase. This approach ensures the base stock is high enough to handle the 100+ unit peaks seen in P27 and P29, minimizing stockout risk while maintaining a reasonable holding cost for the current 6 unit on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School/Autumn seasonal peak confirmed: Demand for P25-P29 averaged 86.8 units/week, up from <10 units in July. Demand remains volatile with peaks reaching 101 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2128.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak of the September Back-to-School/Autumn season. Demand in Period 30 spiked significantly to 157 units, which follows a general upward trend starting in late July. The average demand for the last five periods (P26-P30) is 100.6 units, but the most recent pulse (P30) suggests a higher potential ceiling. To prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 25, 27, and 30, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to 130 per period, using the average of the last 3 periods (approx. 110) plus a 20% buffer for the active seasonal climb. sigma_hat is set to account for the high volatility observed during these spikes (e.g., jump from 100 in P29 to 157 in P30). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand peak confirmed: Demand reached 157 units in Period 30, a series high for the H2 recovery, confirming strong seasonal momentum for the 'Embrace' denim line.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001 (Embrace Skinny Jeans) is currently in a strong seasonal upswing associated with the late-August through September period. Demand has risen significantly from the summer floor of <10 units to over 150 units in the last two periods (P30: 157, P31: 161). The current average for the last three periods (P29-P31) is 139.3 units. Given the consistency of the last two weeks at 155+ units, I will shift the demand forecast (mu_hat) to a recent_N method with N=3 to capture this new elevated plateau. This provides a base stock targets that accounts for the current 140-160 unit range while maintaining high service levels to avoid the stockouts seen in P27 and P30. Sigma_hat is also calculated over N=3 to reflect the high volatility typical of these peak weeks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand plateau confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a high level, averaging 159 units over the last two weeks (P30-P31), up from the August average of ~85.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704001' (Embrace Super Skinny Jeans) is currently in its autumn peak season (September/October), which follows a clear Back-to-School recovery pattern. Analysis of the most recent demand (P30: 157, P31: 161, P32: 146) shows a stable plateau. The mean demand for this recent high-volume regime (N=3) is 154.6 units per week. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand period while maintaining an efficient service level, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods to capture this stabilized September peak. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 periods to account for the current volatility level observed during this seasonal high.

Carry-over insight: September demand plateau established: Mean demand for P30-P32 is 154.6 units/week, confirming a stable peak following the August recovery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3192.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (late September), demand for the 'Embrace' skinny denim spiked to 342 units, more than double the previous two-week average of ~154 units. This likely represents a major seasonal peak or promotional event. The stockout was significant, as only 168 units were available. Lead time remains consistently 0. To prevent further lost sales during this peak and capture the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the base stock needs to be aggressively adjusted. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on this new peak (342) and the previous plateau (~150), estimating a sustained high demand of approximately 250 units for the next period. I will also increase sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to account for the massive jump in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Major demand surge detected in late September (Period 33): Demand spiked to 342 units (+120% vs previous plateau of 154), potentially indicating a peak seasonal peak or promotional event for denim.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704001' (Embrace S.Skinny Ankle jeans) is currently in its autumn peak season. Period 33 witnessed a massive demand spike to 342, followed by a still-high demand of 214 in Period 34. The current on-hand inventory is 191. Given the product's high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain high service levels. I am setting L=0 (explicitly, as observed history is consistently 0). For mu_hat, I am using the average of the last 2 periods (278 units) to represent the current high-demand regime caused by the late-September surge. For sigma_hat, I am using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the significant volatility seen between the 146, 342, and 214 demand markers. This approach ensures the base stock is high enough to cover potential repeat spikes while acknowledging the recent cooling from the all-time peak.

Carry-over insight: Major demand surge regime confirmed: Mean demand for P33-P34 is 278 units/week, marking a significant high-volatility peak compared to the previous plateau of ~155.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704001' (Ladies Denim) is currently in a high-demand autumn regime following a massive surge in late September. Demand for the last three periods (P33-P35) has been 342, 214, and 190 units respectively, resulting in a 3-period average of 248.7 units/week. While demand is slightly cooling from the P33 peak of 342, it remains significantly higher than the August/early September baseline of ~155. Given the product type and mid-October date, we are likely transitioning from the initial autumn peak into a sustained high-demand phase before potential holiday spikes. The current inventory (On-hand: 223) is exactly one week's average demand (223 / 248.7 \u2248 0.9 weeks). Since the Lead Time (L) remains consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3-period average (248.7) to ensure the base stock covers this high-volatility regime. sigma_hat will also be set based on the last 3 periods to account for the extreme volatility observed recently (range 190-342).

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand for P33-P35 is 248.7 units/week (down from initial P33 spike but 60% higher than early September plateau).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704001' (Ladies Denim) is in a high-demand autumn phase. Demand peaked in late September (P33: 342 units) and has since stabilized at a slightly lower but consistent level (P34-P36: 214, 190, 184). The mean demand for the last 3 periods (P34-P36) is 196 units/week, which is significantly higher than the early September plateau of ~155 but lower than the initial surge. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Based on this stability over the last three weeks following the surge, I will use a 3-period window (recent_N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established autumn regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current high-volume autumn demand while accounting for the recent reduction in volatility compared to the P33 spike.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Following the P33 surge, demand for the last 3 weeks (P34-P36) has averaged 196 units/week with lower volatility than the peak.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001 (Ladies Denim) is in its autumn peak season. While there was a significant demand spike in Period 33 (342 units), the last four periods (P34-P37) have shown more consistent, high-level demand with a mean of 200.25 units/week. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory risk is primarily stockouts given high demand; however, we ended P37 with only 10 units on-hand. To account for this stabilized autumn regime and protect against high-end fluctuations (like the P33 burst), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent stabilized average of ~200. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to reflect the current period-to-period variability in this peak regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand has stabilized: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P34-P37) is 200.25 units/week, down from the P33 extreme spike but significantly higher than the 150-unit September plateau.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W' is currently in a sustained autumn high-demand regime. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 198.6 units, following a significant seasonal increase in September/October. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. Based on the seasonal pattern from early 2019 (where demand peaked in period 1-4 and then gradually softened), we are likely at the peak of the autumn denim season (Early November). To maintain high service levels during this plateau, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this ~200 unit baseline, and sigma_hat using the same window to address the moderate volatility observed since the Period 33 surge. The backend OR engine will calculate the base stock to protect against stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the mid-autumn period for the 'Ladies Denim' SKU. Demand has shown a decline in the most recent period (P39: 124 units) compared to the stable autumn plateau of ~200 units observed from P34-P38. This drop may signal the beginning of a post-peak seasonal decline or simply weekly volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, maintaining a high service level is critical. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for the potential start of a downward shift while protecting against stockouts if P39 was an outlier, I will use a recent_N weighting for demand (N=4) to capture the trend of the last month (Avg: 178.25 units). The sigma_hat will also be based on recent volatility to reflect current market behavior.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Potential demand decline detected in early November: Demand dropped to 124 units in P39 after a 5-week plateau of ~200 units (P34-P38). Monitoring for a sustained downward seasonal shift.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for the last two periods (P39-P40) has averaged 126.5 units, which is a significant drop from the previous 5-week plateau of ~200 units (P34-P38). This suggests a post-autumn seasonal decline as we approach the end of the year for this specific denim item. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs during this downward trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3. This captures the two most recent lower demand observations (124, 129) and the final period of the previous plateau (192) to provide a responsive but balanced forecast. The current on-hand inventory of 113 units covers most of the expected demand for the next period, so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to reach the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed in November: Average demand decreased from ~200 units (P34-P38) to 126.5 units (P39-P40), a ~37% reduction.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for 'Embrace' denim has clearly shifted downwards following the October peak (~200 units/week). For the last three periods (P39-P41), demand has averaged 120.6 units (124, 129, 109), confirming the downward regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (ratio of 1:19), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect this new, lower demand level of approximately 121 units/week. This approach balances the need to maintain service levels for the upcoming period while minimizing the risk of overstocking as the seasonal demand continues to cool into late November.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P39-P41) has averaged 120.6 units/week, down from the October average of ~200 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704001' (Embrace Super Skinny Jeans) experienced a sudden demand spike to 227 units in Period 42 (late November), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales. This spike broke the recent November downward trend of ~120 units and resulted in a stockout (on-hand is 0). While the spike is significant, it is likely a temporary calendar-driven peak rather than a new long-term regime. For Period 43 (early December), I expect demand to remain higher than the November average due to holiday shopping but lower than the Cyber Week peak. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the November baseline while reflecting the recent volatility, but I will explicitly set mu_hat to 160 units\u2014a balance between the November mean (~120) and the spike (227)\u2014to ensure adequate stock for December while protecting against overstocking as the holiday peak potentially subsides.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Late November demand spike (227 units) confirmed as a significant calendar event (Black Friday week), disrupting the previous 3-week stable mean of 120 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. Period 43 (Dec 2) showed a sharp demand drop to 30 units following the Black Friday spike (227 units in P42). This conforms to typical retail patterns where a major promotional peak is followed by a significant post-event lull. The product is 'Ladies Denim' (Embrace S.Skinny Ankle), which has shown high seasonality throughout the year. The current on-hand inventory is 219 units, which is significantly high relative to the most recent demand observation (30 units). Given the transition into early December, we expect demand to remain lower than the October average (~200) but potentially stabilize or slightly rise as the holiday shopping season continues. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will transition the demand forecast to use a weighted approach (recent_N=4) to average the pre-Black Friday mean (~120) with the recent volatility (227 and 30), preventing overreaction to the post-peak drop while acknowledging the end of the high-autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday demand crash confirmed (30 units in P43). Combined with P42 spike, the late-November/early-December window demonstrates extreme calendar-driven volatility around a baseline of ~120 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the pre-holiday period (mid-December). Demand has significantly cooled following the Black Friday peak (P42: 227 units) and the subsequent post-event crash (P43: 30 units). Period 44 saw a slight uptick to 54 units, but the overall trend suggests a stabilization at a much lower baseline than the October/November peak (~200 units). The product, high-waisted skinny jeans, generally sees steady but lower demand in mid-winter compared to autumn. With an ending on-hand inventory of 204 units and current demand hovering around 40-60 units, we are overstocked relative to the holding cost ($1/unit vs $19 profit). The inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 4 periods of the current demand level. Therefore, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P42-P44) to capture the post-peak environment, which averages 103.6 units/week (driven by the P42 spike and P43 crash), though effective immediate demand is lower. This will lead to a '0' order recommendation from the OR backend to burn through current stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday stabilize: Demand has averaged 42 units over the last two weeks (P43-P44) following the late-November volatility, indicating a return to a lower winter baseline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-Christmas/Christmas week. Historically, after the Black Friday surge (P42: 227 units) and subsequent crash (P43: 30 units), demand has stabilized at a lower level (P44: 54, P45: 59). Total on-hand is 222 units, which is significantly higher than the latest 2-week average demand (~56 units). Given we are entering the final week of the year, demand is expected to remain low or further decrease as the winter season progresses, mirroring the pattern seen in early February (start of data). There is no need for additional inventory. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the recent stabilized mean of the last 3 periods (P43-P45) which is ~47.7 units per week, ensuring the OR backend sees that we are currently overstocked and avoids placing unnecessary orders that would incur holding costs.

Carry-over insight: December stabilization: Demand has averaged 47.7 units over the last 3 periods (P43-P45) following late-November volatility, confirming a winter baseline shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $978.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the end of December (Period 47, 2019/12/30). Demand has stabilized significantly following the Black Friday/Cyber Monday volatility of late November. Period 46 demand was 60 units, following 59 (P45) and 54 (P44), establishing a stable December mean of approximately 58 units. This confirms the winter baseline regime shift noted in previous insights. Currently, on-hand inventory is 162 units, which is ample given the current demand profile (~2.7 weeks of cover). The OR backend will likely order minimal units as the base stock calculation (for L=0) will be close to current on-hand levels. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this stabilized winter demand (P43-P46) while moving away from the extreme spike of P42. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime stabilized: Average demand for the last 3 periods (P44-P46) is 57.7 units/week, establishing a consistent winter baseline.
