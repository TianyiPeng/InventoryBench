Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 621381001 (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim TRS). This is a fashion denim item. Historical demand from the provided sample shows a clear upward trend: 25, 26, 20, 32, 48 (Mean: 30.2, Std: 9.8). The most recent jump to 48 units suggests a potential regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero, necessitating an immediate order. Promised lead time is 0, but since this is Period 1, no 'conclude' messages exist to verify actual lead time. To capture the recent trend without being overly reactionary, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (demand estimate) and sigma_hat (volatility). For lead time, I'll stick to 'default' (promised=0) until data proves otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim, a stable fashion item (High-waisted skinny jeans). In Period 1, we observed a demand of 48 units, which aligns with the most recent historical sample from 2019-02-04 (also 48). Historical demand shows an upward trend (25, 26, 20, 32, 48). The promised lead time is 0, and the Period 1 conclusion confirms that the actual lead time was indeed 0 (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). With only 1 unit on hand and demand likely to stay at the current level or grow slightly as we move further into February, I will use a recent demand window to capture this higher volume. I'll set N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the recent jump from ~32 up to ~48.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1102.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a fashion item (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim TRS) in the Divided collection. Demand history shows a clear upward trend: 25, 26, 20, 32, 48 (pre-game history), and then 48, 65 in Periods 1 and 2. The most recent demand (65) resulted in a stockout (only 58 units available), indicating that the current inventory levels are insufficient. February into March often sees a rise in spring fashion demand. Given the clear growth trend over the last 3-4 periods, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent acceleration (avg of 48, 48, 65 is ~53.7 per week). Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on the 'conclude' messages for both P1 and P2. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=3 to catch the momentum, while sigma_hat will use recent_N=3 to reflect the higher volatility seen in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand is trending upwards: rose from ~25 to 65 (+160%) over the last 7 weeks. Period 2 demand (65) caused a stockout.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim', a high-waisted skinny jeans item from the Divided Collection. Current date is early March 2019. Historical demand data shows a significant increase from an initial 20-32 range in January to peaks of 65 and 48 in February/March. Period 2 saw a stockout with demand at 65, followed by Period 3 demand at 48. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent higher level (avg 53.6) compared to the long-term average (avg 40.6), which ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current trend. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N=3 to reflect the higher volatility (standard deviation) seen in these later weeks. Since lead time is 0, the backend computes base_stock for 1 period (L+1).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim', a fashion staple. Current date is 2019-03-11. Historical demand shows a significant increase from January levels (~25-32) to an average of 51 over the last 4 concluded periods. The demand spike in Period 2 (65) led to a stockout, while subsequent periods stabilized (48, 43). Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and capture potential Spring season demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the higher baseline compared to January, while maintaining a recent_N sigma calculation to account for the volatility seen in Period 2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim TRS' (High-waisted skinny jeans) is currently in Period 6 (March 18th). Historically, demand for denim often fluctuates with seasonal shifts into spring. After a peak of 65 in Period 2 (late February), demand has stabilized at a lower level: 48 (P3), 43 (P4), and 36 (P5), averaging ~42 over the last 3 weeks. The carry-over insight from Period 3 regarding a 160% upward trend is no longer active as demand has clearly cooled down from that peak. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (confirmed in P1-P5). I will use a N=3 moving average to capture the recent stabilizing trend while protecting against the earlier volatility. mu_hat should reflect this lower stabilized mean (~42 per period), and sigma_hat will be based on the recent variance to avoid over-ordering based on the high demand spike in Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $787.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381001' (skinny denim) shows historical demand fluctuations likely linked to spring seasonality. Initial demand (Period 1-2) peaked at 65 but has since stabilized around an average of 42 over the last four weeks (Periods 3-6: 48, 43, 36, 42). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With current on-hand inventory at 11, we need to ensure the system targets a base stock that covers the expected demand for the upcoming period. I will use a N=5 window for mu_hat (average demand ~46.8) and sigma_hat to capture the recent stabilization relative to the earlier peak. This allows the backend to calculation a safety stock based on a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), ensuring a high service level while the demand remains moderately volatile.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at an average of ~42 units/period (P3-P6) after the P2 peak of 65.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381001' is 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim', a staple denim item. Today is April 1st. Historically, we saw a demand surge in mid-February (P2, 65 units) and another significant spike in late March (P7, 62 units). The recent demand in P7 (62) is much higher than the average of 42 seen in P3-P6. This suggests that as we move into spring, demand for this specific denim style is increasing again. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders P1-P7 arrived in the same period). Given the low ending inventory of 3 units, we need to restock aggressively to meet this higher demand regime. I will use the last 5 periods (P3-P7) to calculate the mean demand, which averages 46.2 units per period, capturing both the mid-range stability and the recent spike, which aligns better with current spring trends than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Demand spiked to 62 units, reflecting a resurgence in skinny denim interest entering April compared to the P3-P6 average of 42 (+47%).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is skinny denim, which typically sees seasonal demand increases during spring. Looking at the history, demand spiked significantly in Period 7 (62 units) and moderated in Period 8 (44 units). The average demand over the last two periods (P7-P8) is 53 units, compared to the P3-P6 average of 42.25 units, confirming a sustained shift to a higher demand regime as identified in the carry-over insights. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (8/8 observations). With on-hand inventory at 19 units and no units in transit, we need to order to meet the higher anticipated demand. I will use recent_N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift centered around the last two weeks, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current April demand levels rather than the lower March averages.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a high-waisted skinny denim jean, which is experiencing sustained demand as we move deeper into spring. Demand over the last three periods (P7-P9) has been 62, 44, and 53, averaging 53 units per period. This represents a confirmed upward shift from the previous regime (avg ~42). The inferred actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded transactions (P1 through P9). To ensure high availability for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods to capture this higher demand regime (N=3) and use a recent window for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed in the spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 7: average demand increased from 42 to 53 units (+26%) during the April spring season.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd, 2019. This SKU (Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim) is likely in a sustained spring demand phase. Historical analysis shows a regime shift starting in Period 7 (March 25th). Demand from Period 7 to Period 10 has been: 62, 44, 53, 41 (average ~50). This is higher than the Period 3-6 average of ~42. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 10 concluded cycles. With an on-hand inventory of 29 and a target of covering the upcoming period's demand (approx. 50 units based on the recent regime), I will use the recent 4 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend captures the current slightly elevated spring volatility and mean demand without being skewed by the very early February ramp-up or the lower-demand mid-March period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 (Skinny Denim) is currently in a spring demand regime. Since Period 7 (March 25), demand has averaged 48.6 units (samples: 62, 44, 53, 41, 43). This is a significant increase from the previous regime (P3-P6) which averaged 42 units. The current date (April 29) is at the end of April, moving into May. Based on the 2018 historical data (if looking at similar seasonal patterns) and current consistency, the 5-period average (N=5) captures this stable 'Spring' level well without being overly influenced by the very early-year volatility. All previous orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, confirming the promised lead time is reliable. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align with this confirmed April regime, and calculate for L.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 (Skinny Denim) is currently in a stable demand regime following an April increase. Observations from the last 6 periods (P7-P12) show an average demand of 47.8 units, consistent with the spring season. The most recent demand (P12) was 44 units. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 12 concluding events. Inventory is currently at 20 units with zero in-transit, which is below the expected demand for the upcoming period. To maintain a high service level given the $19 margin vs $1 holding cost, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 to capture the current demand level that began in early April (Period 7). This ensures \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are calculated based on the current higher-demand environment rather than the lower averages seen in March.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 (Skinny Denim) is entering mid-May. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Demand dropped significantly in Period 13 to 23 units, down from the previous April/early May average (P7-P12) of approximately 48 units. This could indicate the end of the spring skinny denim peak as weather warms up. However, one data point (P13) is not yet a sustained regime shift. I will use a balanced EWMA for mu_hat to allow the forecast to begin cooling down without overreacting to a single week, while maintaining a slightly wider sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7, covering the the April-May period) to protect against demand volatility. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it has been stable at 0.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand for this 'High-waisted Jeans' product showed a peak in April (avg ~53 units/period) but has recently cooled off in May. Periods 13 and 14 recorded demands of 23 and 36 respectively, suggesting a return to a lower baseline as the spring season transition concludes. The previous 'carry_over_insight' noted a shift at Period 7, but recent data (P13-P14) reveals a slowdown. Averaging the samples since the April peak started (P7-P14, N=8) gives a mean of ~43.25. This aligns well with the pre-April average (~42) and accounts for the recent lower observations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-peak stabilization while keeping sufficient safety stock for potential late-spring variability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 621381001 (High-waisted skinny denim) showed a peak in early April (Period 7: 62 units) but has since cooled down during May. The last three periods (P13-P15) show demand of 23, 36, and 39 units, respectively, averaging 32.6 units. This is significantly lower than the April average of 53 units noted in the carry-over insights. Since the lead time has been consistently 0 periods, I will set L to default. Given the recent cooling trend in late May, I am selecting recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand level (avg ~33) while maintaining a safe buffer. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the current localized volatility, preventing over-ordering as we move further into the warmer season where denim demand often stabilizes or softens.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Average demand decreased from 53 units (April peak) to ~33 units (-38%) during the latter half of May.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' is entering June. Looking at the demand history since Period 13 (mid-May), the average demand has been approximately 36 units (23, 36, 39, 46). Period 16 showed a significant uptick back to 46 units, suggesting that the late May / early June period might see slightly higher demand than the low seen in Period 13. However, given the profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the back-end logic targets roughly a 95% service level. With L=0 confirmed consistently in all 16 periods, the system arrives within the same period. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this latest demand stabilization/slight resurgence (avg ~36) while keeping sigma calculation responsive to recent volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. We are seeing a significant demand surge in the last period (Period 17) where demand spiked to 69 units, causing a stockout (17 units lost) and leaving on-hand inventory at 0. This follows a period of stability around 33-40 units. This spike likely reflects early summer/festival season demand for 'hard-worn skinny denim' which often peaks in June. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales and capture this upward momentum, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the recent high demand (Period 17) and the preceding few weeks, using a recent_N of 5 to bridge the lower May demand and the June surge. Sigma_hat is also increased to account for the heightened volatility seen in this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge at Period 17: Demand jumped to 69 units, significantly exceeding the late May average of ~33-40 units, leading to a stockout. This likely correlates with early June seasonality for denim.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/06/17), we are observing a significant demand surge in this skinny denim SKU, likely driven by early summer fashion seasonality. Demand jumped to 69 units in P17 (causing a stockout) and remained high at 66 units in P18. This contrasts sharply with the late May average of ~33-40 units. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high-profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), the OR backend should prioritize high service levels to avoid lost sales during this peak. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this new June demand regime (P16: 46, P17: 69, P18: 66) which averages ~60.3 units, significantly higher than the previous window.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed for June: Average demand for Period 17-18 is 67.5 units, compared to the May average of ~35 units (+92%).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Historically, demand for this skinny denim SKU shows significant seasonality. We are currently in a high-demand June regime. Over the last three periods (P17-P19), demand has been 69, 66, and 73, averaging 69.3 units per period. This is a massive jump from the May average of ~35. The carry-over insights correctly identified this surge starting in Period 17. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this sustained high demand (3 periods of clear shift) and ensure we don't stock out while balancing the high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus exclusively on the current June peak. This will maintain a high base stock to satisfy the current trend.

Carry-over insight: June high-demand regime confirmed: Period 17-19 demand is 69, 66, 73 (avg 69.3), a sustained 98% increase over May's average of ~35.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (June 24), demand dropped significantly to 36 units after a high-demand regime in June (averaging ~69 units). This likely signals the end of the early summer demand peak for skinny denim as we move into July. Historically, demand was around 35 units in May and 40-50 units in April. To avoid overstocking in July while acknowledging the high variance observed in June, I am transitioning from the high-growth 'recent_N' (N=3) used for June to a slightly longer lookback (N=5) to capture the cooling trend while tempering the impact of the volatile June data. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: June demand peak (avg ~69) ended with a drop to 36 units, signaling the start of a mid-summer cooling trend similar to May levels (~35-40).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1455.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand spiked to 77 despite the previous drop to 36, suggesting the June high-demand regime (avg ~69) is continuing or exhibiting high volatility as we enter July. The earlier hypothesis of a 'mid-summer cooling trend' is currently contradicted by the P21 jump. Given the 'Skinny Denim' product type and early July timing, there may be lingering summer peak demand or sales events. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 5 periods (P17-P21), which includes the high June demand and the recent volatile weeks, resulting in an average of approximately 64.2 units per period. Using N=5 captures the recent seasonality while smoothing the outlier at P20. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit/Holding cost ratio justifies a high service level (~95%), so recent_N for sigma will account for the increased volatility seen in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late June/early July: after a drop to 36 in Period 20, Period 21 rebounded to 77, suggesting the summer demand peak is still active or highly variable; June/July average is ~64 units.

The SKU '621381001' (Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-demand summer regime. Over the last 6 periods (since Period 17, June 3rd), demand has been highly volatile but elevated, with values of 69, 66, 73, 36, 77, and 53. The average for this 'June/July summer peak' is approximately 62.3 units per period. The most recent demand (P22) was 53. Although P20 showed a dip to 36, P21 and P22 confirm that demand remains significantly higher than the May average of ~35. Given the dates (late July), we are likely reaching the tail end of the summer peak, but must still cover the high volatility observed. Lead time has consistently resided at 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current summer demand regime (62.3 units/period) and its associated volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock. On-hand inventory is 39, and the order will arrive in the same period (L=0), so the target base stock must cover Period 23's demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381001' (Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-volatility summer demand phase. Reviewing the recent demand history: Period 21 (77), Period 22 (53), and Period 23 (53). After the June peak (avg ~69), the last three periods average 61 units, though the most recent two have stabilized at exactly 53 units. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this post-peak stabilization level (avg 61) while acknowledging the slight cooling from the June highs. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the higher volatility seen throughout the June/July period (ranging from 36 to 77), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to handle potential late-summer spikes without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization in July: Following the June peak (avg ~69), July demand has settled to an average of 61 units over the last 3 periods (P21-P23), with the last two periods consistent at 53 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' has cooled significantly in late July. Period 24 saw a drop to 27 units, which is much lower than the early summer peak (avg ~69) and the early July stabilization (avg ~53 in P22-P23). This suggests a transition from the mid-summer peak into a late-summer/pre-fall lull. Given the on-hand inventory is currently high (58 units), and the lead time is consistently 0, the primary goal is to avoid overstocking while adjusting to this lower demand regime. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the shift from the July average (~53) down to the current level (27), allowing the policy to scale down orders appropriately. L remains 0 (default).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: July demand slowed from an average of ~53 units (P22-P23) to 27 units, signaling the end of the summer peak and the beginning of a late-summer lull.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim, which has shown clear seasonal behavior. We are currently in early August (2019/8/5). Carry-over insights suggested a shift to a 'late-summer lull' in Period 24 (demand was 27), but Period 25 saw a rebound to 54. Looking at the last 5 periods (P21-P25: 77, 53, 53, 27, 54), the average is 52.8. The volatility is significant (sigma is high). Given we are entering August, demand for denim historically starts to stabilize or slightly rise for back-to-school transitions, but we have no explicit confirmation yet. I will set mu_hat using the recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current post-peak summer average (~53), and sigma_hat using the same period to account for the recent fluctuations (27 to 54). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 begins on 2019/08/12. Reviewing the history, the SKU 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' has shown high volatility in August. Period 25 was low (27 units), but Period 26 surged to 83 units, causing a stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests that while late July showed a lull, early August is experiencing a back-to-school or late-summer peak. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P24-P26) is approximately 55 units ((27+54+83)/3). However, given the most recent jump to 83, I need to protect against continued high demand. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this latest volatile cluster, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock reflecting the recent high mean and increased standard deviation. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in early August: after a July lull (avg ~44 units), Period 26 demand spiked to 83 units, indicating a late-summer/back-to-school resurgence.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late August (2019/8/19), which aligns with the peak 'Back-to-School' window. Demand has spiked significantly over the last two periods (83, 96), following a July average of approximately 45. Period 26 resulted in a stockout, and Period 27 demand of 96 units nearly exhausted a large order. These signals confirm a demand regime shift for August. To avoid further stockouts during this high-demand window, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 2 periods (N=2) to capture this new mean (~90 units) and its associated volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school surge confirmed: Demand spiked from a July average of ~45 to an August average of 89.5 units (+99%) over Periods 26-27.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak 'Back-to-School' season (late August). Carry-over insights and recent history (Periods 26-28) show a massive demand spike with units jumping from a July average of ~45 to an August average of 94 (83, 96, 103). Specifically, demand has increased sequentially for three weeks, leading to inventory levels being almost entirely depleted despite aggressive ordering. The current date (2019/8/26) suggests we are at the height of the fall fashion transition. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this high-demand regime (average ~94) and set sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this surge. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge reached a new level: average demand for Periods 26-28 is 94 units, a 109% increase over the July average (~45).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 (Skinny Denim) is currently in a sustained high-demand period associated with the 'Back-to-School' season (August through early September). Over the last four periods (P26-P29), demand has been 83, 96, 103, and 97 units, resulting in a mean of 94.75 units per period. This is a significant and stable increase (+110%) compared to the July average of ~45. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of this peak at ~95 units over the last month, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this specific regime. I will also use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility within this high-demand period, as historical volatility from lower-demand periods would underestimate the risk of stockouts at these higher levels.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand plateaued: Period 26-29 demand is 83, 96, 103, 97 (avg 94.8), establishing a stable high-demand regime for late August/early September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 31 (2019/09/09), and we are in the middle of a high-demand regime driven by back-to-school seasonality. Historical context shows demand surged from a July average of ~45 units to a sustained late August/early September average of ~94.8 units (Periods 26-30). The last four periods recorded demand of 83, 96, 103, 97, and 94 units respectively. Although some school terms start in late August, the first few weeks of September typically maintain high demand for denim before a potential mid-autumn cooling. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this specific 'back-to-school' regime's mean (94.6) and volatility. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods as observed in all historical conclusion messages. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a base stock that accounts for Period 31 demand, given current on-hand inventory is 15 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 621381001 is in the 'Back-to-School' high-demand regime, which started around Period 26 (August). We are now in mid-September (Period 32). In Period 31, demand dropped to 67 units from the previous four-period average of approximately 95 units. This 30% decrease signals a potential shift from the peak back-to-school surge towards a more moderate fall demand level. To react to this softening while maintaining a high service level (due to the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio), I will set N=6 for mu_hat to include the recent peak periods but also capture the weight of the latest 67-unit observation. This balances the risk of a continued decline against the possibility of a plateau at a level higher than July. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect the higher volatility seen during this transition. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Back-to-school peak (avg ~95) slowed to 67 units, indicating the start of a post-peak fall stabilization.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' is cooling down from the 'Back-to-School' peak observed in late August. Period 31 (67 units) and Period 32 (63 units) show a clear and sustained decline from the previous 4-week average of ~95 units. We are now in a late-September stabilization phase. I will use the last 2 periods to define this new post-peak regime (N=2), leading to a mu_hat calculation based on an average demand of approximately 65 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, allowing for responsive same-period inventory adjustments. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent window to reflect the reduced volatility characteristic of a stabilized regime compared to the peak surge.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand stabilization confirmed: Period 31-32 demand average is 65 units, a 31% decrease from the late August peak average (~95 units).

LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand spiked sharply to 110 units, far exceeding the recent post-peak stabilization average of ~65 units. This suggests a new high-demand event, potentially a late September promotion or a secondary seasonal peak. My inventory was completely depleted (ending on-hand: 0). Given the lead time is reliably 0 periods, I need to set base stock to cover this new volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the average of the stabilization level (67, 63) and the recent spike (110), resulting in a mean shift. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the volatility from the transition of the back-to-school peak into this current phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surge at Period 33: Demand jumped to 110 units from a stabilization average of ~65 (+69%), resulting in a stockout. This indicates a secondary peak or late-September demand event.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' is exhibiting a high-demand regime in late September/early October (Period 33 demand: 110, Period 34 demand: 103), following a peak in the 'back-to-school' season. This secondary peak suggests a sustained interest as the weather cools. Demand for the last two periods averaged 106.5 units. Given the high profit margins ($19) relative to holding costs ($1), ensuring a high service level is critical to avoid stockouts like the one seen in Period 33. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 2 periods (N=2) to capture this current surge, and sigma_hat based on N=4 to account for the volatility seen during the transition from the stabilization phase (avg ~65) to the current peak (avg ~106). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand peak confirmed: Period 33-34 demand averaged 106.5 units, a 64% increase over the mid-September stabilization average of 65 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '621381001' is currently in a secondary demand peak phase that confirmed in Periods 33-34 (averaging ~106.5 units). However, Period 35 demand dropped to 67 units, which is similar to the post-back-to-school stabilization level observed in Periods 31-32 (avg ~65 units). The date is 2019/10/14, moving further into October. Historical patterns suggest that these peaks are often followed by sharp corrections or returns to lower stabilization levels. The start of on-hand inventory for Period 36 is 80 units. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the recent high volatility, I will use a recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the high average of the secondary peak (Periods 33-35: 110, 103, 67) while recognizing the recent drop. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Secondary demand peak (avg ~106) appears to be ending; Period 35 demand (67) returned to mid-September stabilization levels (~65).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent secondary demand peak (approx. 106.5 units in P33-P34) has clearly subsided. Demand in Period 35 (67 units) and Period 36 (55 units) has returned to the mid-September stabilization levels of approximately 65 units. Current date is October 21, moving further away from the back-to-school and early fall peaks. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 77 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the trend from the secondary peak back down to current stabilization levels (average of P31-P36 demand is approx. 77.5). This protects against lingering volatility while acknowledging the downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed post-secondary peak: Period 35-36 demand (67, 55) has returned to mid-September levels (~65 units), following the brief late-September surge (avg 106.5).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade Trash HW Skinny Denim' has recently exited a high-volatility phase (secondary peak of ~106 units in P33-P34) and returned to a stabilization phase. While Period 37 saw a demand of 90, the recent periods (P35-P37) average 70.6 units, aligning with the mid-September level of ~65 units but showing some lingering upward pressure. We are now in late October (2019/10/28). Historically, lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid over-reacting to the P37 spike while providing sufficient buffer for a potential late-autumn increase, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (covering the stabilization post-secondary peak) to capture the current mean of ~70.6 units. Sigma_hat is also set using N=3 to account for recent variability (std of ~17.8), ensuring the base stock covers current volatility without excessive holding costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Historical demand shows a stabilization pattern after several seasonal peaks and lulls throughout the year. Most recently, demand fluctuates between 46 and 90 units (average of 68 over the last 4 periods). We are approaching the November 'Singles Day' and 'Black Friday' retail events, which typically drive high demand for denim fashion. While the immediate post-secondary peak stabilization saw an average of ~65 units, Period 37 showed a spike to 90. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current mean of 64.5 units per period, which aligns with recent stabilization levels while remaining prepared for November's potential volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period X conclude' messages.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand has transitioned from the October stabilization phase (avg ~65) to a late autumn lull. The last two periods (P38-P39) show demand dropping significantly to 46 and 32 units, averaging 39 units. This likely reflects a seasonal dip before potential holiday spikes in late November. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this downward trend (averaging P37-P39: 90, 46, 32 = 56) while maintaining enough buffer for the imminent holiday season. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility seen during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Demand slowed from the mid-October stabilization average of ~65 units to an average of 39 units (P38-P39), marking a pre-holiday seasonal lull.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is just before the major Black Friday/Cyber Monday holiday shopping period. Historically, this product (skinny denim) has shown significant demand spikes around seasonal shifts (Spring in April, Summer in June, and Back-to-school in August). While the last three periods (P38-P40) averaged 41 units (a pre-holiday lull), we must anticipate a sharp increase for the end of November. Based on previous major spikes (e.g., Back-to-School saw demand double from ~45 to ~95), I am forecasting a significant increase for the holiday peak. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to set a baseline demand of 90 units (approximately 2x the current lull average) to ensure we are stocked for the upcoming retail surge, and a higher 'explicit' sigma_hat of 25 to account for the high volatility seen during previous demand shifts.

Carry-over insight: Anticipated Holiday Demand Peak: Entering late November (Black Friday period), demand is expected to surge significantly from the P38-P40 average of 41 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 42 (Nov 25), which is Black Friday week. Historically, this SKU (denim) experiences significant demand surges during major retail events. The carry-over insight from Period 41 highlights an expected surge from the previous lull average of ~41 units. Demand in Period 41 was low (25), likely a 'calm before the storm' effect. To prepare for the holiday peak, I am aggressively increasing mu_hat to 120 units (explicitly) to cover the anticipated spike and prevent stockouts seen in previous peaks (e.g., Back-to-School at ~95, late Sept spike at ~106). Lead time remains consistently 0. I am also increasing sigma_hat to 35 to account for the high volatility typically associated with holiday sales spikes.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 43 (Dec 2nd), which is immediately following Cyber Monday in the Black Friday cycle. Period 42 showed a jump to 67 units (from 25 in P41), confirming the start of the holiday surge. Based on historical peaks (Back-to-School avg ~95, late September avg ~106), I expect demand to accelerate significantly in early December as holiday shopping reaches its peak. A base stock calculation using recent samples would be too slow to react given the seasonality of denim in the 'High-waisted jeans' category during gifting season. I will use an explicit forecast of 120 units (sustained peak) to ensure sufficient stock, as the inventory is currently 111 and lead time is 0. This ensures we capture the Dec 2 - Dec 9 volume.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed starting Period 42: demand increased from 25 to 67 (+168%) following Black Friday; historical trends suggest demand will peak between 95-120 units for several weeks in December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season. There is a discrepancy between expected demand and observed demand in Period 43. While Period 42 showed a jump to 67 units (Black Friday period), Period 43 dropped unexpectedly to 21 units. However, looking at the full history of this SKU, demand often exhibits sudden, high-magnitude spikes (e.g., P33 at 110, P27-P30 averaging 95+). Given the seasonal context of 'Holiday Demand' and past behavior of this 'Divided Collection' skinny denim, a significant surge is still highly probable for the remaining weeks in December. The current on-hand inventory is 141 units. I will set a mu_hat to 110 (using explicit) to ensure we are covered for a potential 95-120 range peak, as holding one period of stock is relatively inexpensive ($1) compared to the profit of a lost sale ($19). This base stock approach will naturally result in a smaller order or no order if the backend sees our high on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover the 110 forecast.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Holiday demand volatility observed. After a post-Black Friday surge to 67 (P42), demand dropped to 21 (P43). Sustained peak levels of 95-120 units still anticipated based on early-September and late-September historical spikes.

LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), right in the middle of the holiday peak season. Despite expectations for a major surge (95-120 units), the last two periods (P43-P44) have shown significantly lower demand (21 and 28 units). This volatility makes forecasting challenging. However, historical data from earlier peaks (August/September) showed sustained levels near 100 units once established. Given the date (Dec 16), we are approaching the final peak shopping week before Christmas. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the current slow-down while allowing for the OR engine's service level logic to cover potential spikes. Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent historical performance (all orders arrived same-period). On-hand inventory is healthy at 127 units, which provides an adequate buffer for a potential return to the 70-100 unit demand range.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility persists: Week of Dec 9 (P44) demand remained low at 28 units, despite being mid-holiday season. Historical peak levels of 95-120 remain a reference for potential spikes.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the Christmas holiday week. Despite observed demand being low over the last three weeks (P43-P45: 21, 28, 19), historical performance of this SKU shows extreme volatility and late-season spikes (e.g., P33 post-peak jump to 110, P37 jump to 90). The 'holiday surge' that began with Black Friday (P42: 67) has stalled, but significant demand often returns in the final week of December due to post-Christmas sales and gift card redemptions. With only 1 period remaining after this decision, and on-hand inventory at 108, we are well-positioned for a moderate spike. However, since P45 demand was only 19, I will use an EWMA with gamma=0.3 to allow the forecast to reflect recent lows while remaining sensitive to a potential rebound. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 47 (Dec 30). The expected holiday peak (95-120 units) did not materialize in December; instead, demand has consistently declined from 67 (P42) to 16 (P46). This identifies a significant and sustained overestimation of holiday demand for this SKU. We are entering the post-holiday period (January), where demand historically (from the seed data: 25, 26, 20, 32) starts lower and follows a gradual upward trend. With 92 units on hand and a current demand regime of approximately 16-19 units, we have over 5 weeks of inventory. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 (averaging P44-P46) to reflect the current low-demand environment and allow the high on-hand stock to be utilized without placing new orders. L remains 'default' (0) as all shipments have arrived instantly.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand failure: The anticipated Dec peak (95-120) did not occur; instead, demand averaged ~21 units for Period 43-46, a 68% decrease from the late Nov surge (67).
