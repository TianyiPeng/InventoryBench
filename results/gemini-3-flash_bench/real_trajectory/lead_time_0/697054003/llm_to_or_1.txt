Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the SKU 'Despacito' (Womens Blouse). Historically, demand over the last 5 weeks has been declining from a peak of 186 down to ~89 (Samples: 186, 132, 98, 86, 89). The mean of the last 3 samples (98, 86, 89) is approximately 91. Since this is a woman's garment, we should be aware of Spring seasonality, but current demand is cooling after what appears to be a January peak. With a promised lead time (L) of 0 and a current inventory of 0, we need to place an order immediately to cover current and future demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to anchor on the current stable lower demand level rather than the high earlier values. For sigma_hat, recent_N=3 captures the current volatility. Since there are no observed arrivals yet (it's P1), L remains at default (0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's blouse. In Period 1, we ordered 91 units and they arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Demand in P1 was 79. Looking at historical samples, demand has been on a downward trend: 186, 132, 98, 86, 89, and now 79. This suggests a post-holiday/early-year cooling period for this garment. The last 4 weeks of demand are [86, 89, 79] (plus 2019-01-28 which was 86). Using N=4 for mu_hat captures this recent stabilization around an average of ~85. Given high holding costs ($1) relative to profit ($1), the backend needs to be lean (service level target is ~50%). I will use recent_N to reflect the current lower demand regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' blouse. The current date is 2019/2/25. Looking at the historical demand samples (beginning 2019-01-07), we saw a declining trend from 186 down to ~89 in early February. However, the last two actual periods (P1: 79, P2: 130) show a significant rebound. P2 demand (130) resulted in a stockout (sold 88, on-hand 0), which implies the 'true' demand might higher than 130 since inventory was exhausted. As we approach March, spring fashion demand often picks up. The promised lead time is 0 and has been consistently 0 in P1 and P2. Given the stockout and the upward trend in demand compared to late Jan/early Feb, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent acceleration (132, 98, 86, 89, 79, 130). N=3 covers P1, P2, and the last provided sample (approx 89, 79, 130), averaging ~100. With L=0, (1+L)*100 = 100. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen in the jump from 79 to 130.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 2019-02-04 (89), P1 (79), P2 (130), P3 (150). We are currently out of stock (ending inventory 0 for two consecutive periods) and have experienced lost sales because demand (130, 150) exceeded our starting inventory (88, 100). The current date is March 4, transitioning into the spring season where demand for 'Everyday Collection' blouses typically increases. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent surge and prevent further stockouts, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation, focusing on the last 3 periods (P1-P3) to reflect the shift from ~80s to >130. mu_hat will use N=3 to average (79+130+150)/3 \u2248 119.7, and since L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*119.7. sigma_hat will also use N=3 to capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 2: mean demand increased from ~85 to ~140 (+65%) likely due to spring seasonality for women's blouses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Womens Blouse) is entering the spring season (mid-March). Historical demand from the initial samples (Jan/Feb) averaged ~118, but recent periods (P2-P4) show a significant increase, with actual demand reaching 130, 150, and 116 units respectively (average 132). Period 2 and 3 resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), indicating that demand likely exceeded supply. Promoting the base stock level is necessary to capture this higher demand regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods as observed in all historical 'conclude' messages (P1-P4). Given the stockouts and the product type's seasonal relevance, I will focus on the most recent 3 periods (P2-P4) to estimate the mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Setting L=0 explicitly as supported by history. Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), so the OR engine's q calculation will target a 50% service level; thus, ensuring mu_hat reflects the higher end of the recent regime is critical.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 18th. The product is a women's blouse, which typically sees increased demand during the spring season. Historical data shows a clear shift: early weeks (Jan-Feb) averaged ~115 units, whereas the last four periods (since mid-February) have seen peak demands of 130, 150, 116, and 98. While Period 5 showed a slight dip to 98, the upcoming mid-to-late March period is generally a high-sales window for spring garments. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (immediate arrival). My on-hand inventory is currently 34. I will use recent history (last 4 periods) to set my demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the higher spring baseline (~123 average), while keeping lead time at the promised 0. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current regime's volume and volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, transitioning from late winter to early spring. The product is a women's blouse, which typically sees sustained demand during the spring season. Historical demand shows a clear shift after Period 1: Period 1 was 79, while Periods 2-6 averaged approximately 120.6 units per week. Although demand dipped slightly in Period 5 (98 units), it recovered to 109 in Period 6. Based on the Carry-over Insight and the last 5 periods of data (P2-P6), I have identified a stable regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all completed cycles. To maintain high service levels while minimizing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the current spring demand mean (~120.6) and volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Women's Blouse) is entering April (Period 8). Analyzing the demand history, we saw a demand surge in Periods 2 and 3 (130, 150) followed by a stabilization in Periods 4-7 (116, 98, 109, 91). The average demand over the last four periods (the stable regime) is approximately 103.5 units per period. The Lead Time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrival data in Periods 1-7. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (critical ratio) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. Using N=4 for mu_hat will align the forecast with this recent stable demand level while capturing current seasonality before any late-spring shifts. This prevents overstocking that would occur if we included the initial Period 2-3 spikes in the mean calculation.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Women's Blouse) is in its spring season. Since Period 4, demand has stabilized into a regime with a mean of approximately 103 units per week (Period 4-8: 116, 98, 109, 91, 100). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met. Current on-hand inventory is exceptionally low (4 units). To ensure high availability (z* is 0 for profit=holding, but the OR backend caps order logic uses 0.95 for the cap) and given the steady recent demand, I will transition to using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the stabilization after the initial spring spike. This N=5 covers the consistent demand observed in the last five periods (Period 4-8), resulting in a mu_hat of approx 103 units for the review + lead period (L=0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 103 units/period (Periods 4-8) following the initial spring growth phase.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's blouse, which has passed its early spring peak and is now in a stable demand regime. In Periods 4-9, the average demand was approximately 99 units (Period 4: 116, P5: 98, P6: 109, P7: 91, P8: 100, P9: 81). The last period (P9) saw a drop to 81, which may indicate a slight downward trend as the peak spring season transitions, but it is not yet sustained enough to pivot away from the recent average. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture the demand mean and variance of this stabilized post-peak period (Periods 4-9). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~100 units plus a safety buffer for volatility while accounting for the low on-hand inventory of 22 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the demand history for SKU 697054003 (Womens Blouse), there was a high-growth phase in February (Periods 2-3 demand: 130-150) followed by a stabilization period in March/early April (Periods 4-8 average: ~103). Recently, however, there is a clear downward trend in the last two weeks: Period 9 demand was 81 and Period 10 was 67. April typically transitions away from early spring growth for some styles before summer peaks. Given this deceleration, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on the most recent 3 periods (Periods 8-10) to avoid over-ordering based on the higher March average. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all 10 concluded periods. Sigma_hat is also set to the recent 3 periods to capture the current volatility accurately. This conservative approach balances the equal $1 profit vs. $1 holding cost, where the optimal service level is 50% (z=0), aiming essentially for the mean demand expected in the next period.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected starting Period 9: average dropped from ~103 (Periods 4-8) to ~74 (Periods 9-10), a ~28% reduction.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. History shows a clear seasonal cycle: a spike in February/March (spring growth), stabilization in early April, and a deceleration starting in late April. Demand for the last three periods (9, 10, 11) was 81, 67, and 85, averaging approximately 78 units. The Carry-over insight from Period 11 correctly identified this deceleration. Although Period 11 saw a slight uptick to 85, the broader trend is downward compared to the March peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 11 with some lost sales (demand 85 vs sold 83), so we need to ensure the base stock covers this lower but steady regime. I will use N=3 to capture this recent decelerated state (~78 units/period) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Women's Blouse) is currently experiencing high demand volatility with recent demand figures of 85 and 101, occurring despite a previously identified deceleration trend. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit inventory, meaning we are stocked out and must re-supply. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use a recent window (N=4) to capture the current demand environment, which averages 83.5 units per period. This window covers periods 9-12 and balances the lower demand seen in P10 (67) with the higher demand in P12 (101). Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, which the backend's base-stock formula will naturally target. I am setting L=0 as no lead time drift has been observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late April/early May; the previously noted deceleration regime (P11 insight) has shifted to a more volatile state with a rebound to 101 units in Period 12.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the product (women's blouse) is entering the late spring/early summer season. Historical demand since Period 9 has shown significant volatility: 81, 67, 85, 101, and 82. The 'deceleration' noted in Period 11 failed to persist, as evidenced by the spike to 101 in Period 12 and 82 in Period 13. Average demand over these last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 83.2 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is only 2 units and there are 0 units in-transit, we need to restock to cover the upcoming period's demand. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the current volatility and mean shift (approx 83 units) while ignoring the higher early-spring peaks. The 50/50 profit-to-holding-cost ratio means the OR backend's service level target will be 50%, roughly targeting the median demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: After a brief drop in P9-P10, demand rebounded and stabilized between 82-101 units (Avg 83.2 for P9-P13), suggesting the 'deceleration' was temporary variance rather than a trend.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), the item (Womens Blouse) is in its late spring/early summer phase. Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the initial drop seen in Periods 9-10. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), demand has averaged 92.75 units (85, 101, 82, 103), which is significantly higher than the 67-81 range seen just before. The inventory ended at 0 in P14, indicating a stockout and untapped demand. To ensure adequate service levels during this volatile but strong demand period, I will use a recent window of N=4 to capture the current mean (~93) and volatility. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment to react to demand jumps. Using the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will prioritize the current May demand regime over older, less relevant data from early spring.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a higher level in May (P11-P14 avg: 93) compared to April deceleration (P9-P10 avg: 74), confirming the previous period's suspicion that the drop was temporary variance.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16 (2019/05/27), we are managing a women's blouse. Historical demand shows a stabilization in May, but the most recent observation in Period 15 was 65 units, which is lower than the previous weeks (103, 82, 101). The product description (long sleeves, woven fabric) suggests it may start seeing a seasonal decline as late spring transitions into summer in June. However, demand has been volatile, ranging from 65 to 103 over the last 5 periods. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level (critical ratio) target is 0.5. To find a balance between the high demand seen in early May and the recent drop, I will use a recent window of N=5 periods (P11-P15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the 'May' regime which averages ~87.2 units, providing enough stock to cover the average while being cautious of the recent dip to 65. Sigma will be derived from the same window to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime in May (P11-P15) has averaged 87.2 units but shows significant weekly volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 16), with a noticeable dip to 65 units in P15 as June approaches.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the SKU 'Despacito Blouse' is transitioning from the peak spring season into early summer. Demand in the most recent periods has shown significant volatility: P14 (103), P15 (65), and P16 (95). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 89.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 15. The 'arrived=60' in P16 despite higher demand resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0), indicating the previous order was slightly conservative given the recovery in demand after the P15 dip. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing volatility, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most current demand regime and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed throughout May.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in May/Early June: Average demand across P12-P16 stabilized at 89.2 units, but weekly fluctuations are high (range 65-103), requiring a wider safety stock margin.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. We have observed a significant demand drop in Period 17 (44 units), which is the lowest demand point since the start of the game. Comparing the last 5 periods (P13-P17: 82, 103, 65, 95, 44), the mean is 77.8 with a high standard deviation (approx 23.5). This suggests a transition out of the peak spring/early-summer demand regime for this blouse SKU into a lower-demand summer stage. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period). Given the Profit/Holding Ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50% (the OR engine uses q = Profit / (Profit + Holding)). I will use current regime data (N=5) to capture the recent deceleration while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. Using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will set the base stock based on the average of the last 5 weeks (~78 units), while the OR backend's z-score and capping logic will manage the holding cost/stockout risk balancing.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in early June (Period 17): Weekly demand dropped to 44 units, a significant decrease from the May average (~90), suggesting the start of a lower-demand summer regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant drop in June: Period 17 (44 units) and Period 18 (49 units), compared to the May average of approximately 87 units. This confirms a downward regime shift as we enter summer for this woven long-sleeved blouse. The Carry-over insight for Period 18 correctly identified this shift. I will set N=3 for mu_hat to capture this lower local mean (approx 46-49 units) while still accounting for the most recent May data point to avoid under-stocking too aggressively if there is a minor June rebound. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 17 and 18 show consistent lower demand, I am using recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the inventory strategy toward this lower-demand summer regime, minimizing holding costs for the current on-hand inventory of 29 units.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (Periods 17-18): Average demand dropped to 46.5 units, a ~48% decrease from the May average (approx 90 units).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (June 24th), we are assessing the summer demand regime for this long-sleeved woven blouse. Recent history (P17-P19) shows demand of 44, 49, and 70 units. While Period 19 experienced a spike to 70 units (possibly due to late June sales or midsummer events), the overall trend from May to June has been a significant drop from an average of ~90 units to a 3-period average of 54.3 units. Given that this is a long-sleeved garment, lower demand during the warmer months of June/July is expected. My strategy is to use the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this new lower-demand regime, while allowing the 70-unit spike in P19 to slightly buffer the safety stock (captured by recent_N sigma calculation). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, so we need to rebuild stock to meet this new summer baseline (approx 55 units/period). Promised lead time remains 0, and consistent same-period arrivals confirm no shift in lead time.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (started P17) shows increased variability: Demand jumped from an average of 46.5 in P17-P18 to 70 in P19 (+50%), although still significantly lower than the May average (~90).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are navigating the summer demand regime for this SKU. Historical data from the last four periods (P17-P20) indicates an average demand of 55 units (44, 49, 70, 57), marking a significant reduction from the high-90s observed in May. Period 19 showed a temporary spike to 70, but P20 retreated to 57, confirming a lower but volatile baseline for mid-summer. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since Period 20 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and the current on-hand is 0, the backend OR policy will order based on (mu_hat - pipeline). With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, effectively aiming to match the expected demand exactly. I will use recent_N with N=4 to target the summer regime average (approx 55) and capture the recent volatility for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 17-20) stabilized at an average of 55 units, a ~38% reduction from the May average of 89 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a summer demand regime for this blouse (SKU 697054003). Period 21 demand was 36 units, which is a decrease from the previous few periods (44, 49, 70, 57). The summer regime starting Period 17 (P17-P21) has an average demand of 51.2 units. Although the previous carry-over insight noted an average of 55, the inclusion of P21 (36 units) lowers the mean. The volatility in this period (\u03c3 \u2248 13) remains relevant. I will use a window of N=5 periods to capture this current summer regime's behavior (P17-P21). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The OR backend needs to maintain a service level balance where profit and holding cost are equal, so target base stock will be roughly the median demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 17-21) average has trended lower to 51.2 units/period, down from the previous 55 units observation.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, and we are in a summer demand regime for this blouse. Analysis of the current regime (starting Period 17) shows the following demand values: 44, 49, 70, 57, 36, 33. The average for these last 6 periods is 48.16 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 13.9. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 22 that demand has stabilized around ~51 units but with notable fluctuation. Since July is typically the peak of summer, demand for a long-sleeved blouse (as described in the product detail) is expected to remain low or possibly decline further before the fall transition. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain a cautious service level given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50%, I will focus on the most recent 6 periods to capture this downward summer trend while buffering against the recent volatility (e.g., the spike to 70 in P19).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 17-22) is confirmed with an average of 48.2 units, showing a trend toward lower stabilization compared to the previous spring average of ~90 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (women's blouse) remains in a low-demand summer regime. Starting from Period 17 (early June), demand shifted notably downward compared to the spring average of ~90 units. The average demand from Period 17 to Period 23 is 47.1 units (44, 49, 70, 57, 36, 33, 39). The last three periods (P21-P23) show even lower stabilization with an average of 36 units (36, 33, 39). Given the date (July 22), we are in the peak of summer, and high volatility persists (\u03c3 \u2248 12 in the summer regime). I will set N=7 for mu_hat to capture the entire summer regime (P17-P23) and N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the seasonal volatility. Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Women's Blouse) is currently in a stable summer demand regime which began around Period 17 (early June). Analysis of the most recent demand samples (P17-P24: 44, 49, 70, 57, 36, 33, 39, 38) shows an average demand of approximately 45.75 units per period. The demand has stabilized significantly over the last four periods (P21-P24: 36, 33, 39, 38), averaging 36.5 units with low volatility. Given the product type and the late July date (2019/7/29), we expect this low-demand summer baseline to continue until late summer/early autumn transitions occur. Carry-over insights confirm this lower stabilization. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full breadth of the summer regime for mean demand while ensuring the safety stock (via sigma) reflects the lower volatility observed in the most recent 4 weeks.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 17-24) further stabilized at an average of 45.8 units, with the most recent 4 periods showing an even tighter average of 36.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a stable summer low-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent data: the last 5 periods (P21-P25) have seen demand of 36, 33, 39, 38, and 36, resulting in a very stable mean of 36.4. The Carry-over insights confirm this stabilization at approximately 36.5 units. Current On-hand inventory is 10 units, and there are 0 units in-transit. Given the promised lead time of 0 periods and the consistent actual lead time of 0 periods observed in History, I will maintain L=0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this tight late-summer plateau (averaging 36.4), which corresponds to (1+L)*36.4. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the low current volatility (standard deviation is approx 2.0). These parameters will guide the OR engine to maintain a lean stock level suitable for the current demand, minimizing holding costs while covering the 36-unit weekly requirement.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime further tightened: Periods 21-25 show a highly stable mean of 36.4 units (\u03c3 \u2248 2.0), confirming a low-volatility summer floor.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand of 53 units in Period 26 is a significant increase from the stable summer floor of ~36 units observed in Periods 21-25. This suggests a potential transition out of the summer low-demand regime as we move into mid-August (Late Summer/Back-to-School season). To adapt, I am shifting the 'mu_hat' calculation to 'recent_N' with N=6 (covering Periods 21-26) to incorporate this new data point while still weighting it against the recent summer average. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Safety stock (sigma_hat) will be calculated over the same N=6 period to capture the recent increase in volatility caused by the rebound to 53 units.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand transition detected in Period 26: Demand increased to 53 units from a 5-period average of 36.4 units (+45%), potentially signaling the end of the summer low-demand floor as of mid-August.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand increased further to 60 units, following a rise to 53 in Period 26. This confirms the end of the summer low-demand floor (avg ~36) and the start of a late-summer/pre-autumn recovery phase. History shows this product (women's blouse) experienced a significant spring peak; a similar uptick as we approach September is expected. Average demand over the last 3 periods (P25-P27) is 49.7 units with an upward trend. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this transition and avoid the stockouts seen in the last two periods, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to prioritize the upward momentum, and use an explicit sigma_hat to provide a safety buffer against the observed volatility in this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Periods 26-27 show demand increasing from ~36 units to an average of 56.5 units (+56%), signaling the start of the autumn transition.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late August (2019/8/26), and demand for the women's blouse has shown a clear recovery from the summer low. The last three periods (P26-P28) recorded demands of 53, 60, and 68, establishing an upward trend as the autumn transition begins. This contrasts with the stable summer floor of ~36 units observed in P21-P25. The current 3-period average is 60.3 units. Given the consistent week-over-week increase (+7 units, +8 units), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 75 to anticipate further growth in the coming period. Sigma_hat is set to 15 to account for the increased volatility seen during transition phases. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P26: 53, P27: 60, P28: 68), averaging 60.3 units, up from the summer floor of ~36 units (+67%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Women's Blouse) is entering the high-demand autumn season. Demand has significantly recovered from the summer floor (~36 units) over the last four periods (P26: 53, P27: 60, P28: 68, P29: 71), averaging 63 units. This upward trend suggests a transition to a new regime consistent with fall retail patterns for 'Everyday Collection' garments. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this growth while maintaining responsiveness, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the autumn recovery phase (starting P26) and captures the increased volatility associated with the trend shift, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock level that covers the rising demand without relying on outdated low-demand summer data.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery is sustained: Demand has increased for four consecutive periods (P26-P29) averaging 63 units, confirming the end of the summer low-demand regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn demand recovery is accelerating as we move into September. Demand reached 90 units in Period 30, following a steady climb from the summer floor of ~36 units (P26: 53, P27: 60, P28: 68, P29: 71, P30: 90). The 5-period average for this recovery regime (P26-P30) is now 68.4 units. Given this consistent upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the recovery while acknowledging the most recent spike to 90. Observed lead time remains 0. With profit and holding costs equal, the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will calculate based on these updated parameters to balance stockout risks during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak intensified in Period 30: Demand reached 90 units, pushing the recovery average (P26-P30) to 68.4 units, a 93% increase from the summer floor.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 697054003 (Womens Blouse) is in a confirmed autumn recovery phase. Recent demand figures (P26-P31) are 53, 60, 68, 71, 90, 80, showing a significant upward shift from the summer floor of ~36 units. The average over the last 6 periods is 70.3 units, with the last 3 periods specifically averaging 80.3 units. Given the transition into mid-September (a peak time for long-sleeved blouses), I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture this recovery while smoothing the high P30 peak. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this transition compared to the stable summer period. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery sustained through mid-September: P26-P31 average is 70.3 units, a 93% increase over the summer floor (~36 units). Recent 3-period average (P29-P31) has reached 80.3 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Women's Blouse) is in a clear autumn demand recovery. Demand has stabilized at a significantly higher level than the summer floor. The last four periods (P29-P32) recorded demand values of 71, 90, 80, and 82, resulting in a 4-period average of 80.75 units. This confirms the recovery trend noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level by default (z=0). To ensure we cover this higher demand regime and mitigate recent stockouts (P30-P32 all ended with 0 inventory), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the 80.75 average, and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. This configuration helps the engine maintain enough stock for the current mid-September peak without over-committing if demand plateaus.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Periods 29-32 average demand is 80.8 units (Range 71-90), confirming a sustained recovery from the summer floor (~36 units).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the blouse has entered a high-growth phase as of Period 33, jumping to 137 units from a previous 4-period average of ~81 units (+69%). This aligns with the transition further into the autumn season. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last four periods), indicating that the OR backend's cap or our recent_N estimates are under-forecasting the current peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the upward trajectory (averaging ~92 units), but because Period 33 showed a significant spike to 137, I will use an 'explicit' sigma_hat to increase the safety stock margin and prevent further lost sales during this volatile growth phase. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak intensified further in Period 33: Demand reached 137 units, a significant increase from the previous 4-period average of 81 units, signaling a potential new high-demand regime for late September/October.

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we observed a massive demand spike to 137 units, which was followed by a sharp drop to 65 units in Period 34 (Date: 2019/09/30). This suggests significant volatility as we move into the October autumn regime. The product is a long-sleeved blouse, which historically sees demand growth in autumn but can be volatile based on specific local weather changes or early-month shopping patterns. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Given the high stock-out frequency in recent periods (P30-P33), even with a lower P34 demand, I need to set parameters that protect against another 100+ unit spike while accounting for the lower P34 baseline. I will use a recent_N of 5 (P30-P34) to capture the autumn recovery trend while moderating the extreme P33 outlier. This averages to approximately 91 units per period, which is appropriate for the current season. I will use explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (Standard Deviation of P30-P34 is ~27, and I will maintain this buffer).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand volatility confirmed: Demand surged to 137 in P33 then dropped to 65 in P34, resulting in a 5-period average (P30-P34) of 90.8 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Blouses' appears to be cooling off following the autumn peak. After a significant surge to 137 units in Period 33, demand has consecutively dropped to 65 (P34) and 54 (P35). Current period date (Oct 14) also suggests a transition away from the peak autumn wardrobe shopping season. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P30-P35) is 84.6 units, but the most recent two periods suggest a much lower regime around 60 units. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the average reflecting the high peak and the subsequent cooldown, but I will adopt a more conservative sigma approach using recent_N (N=10) to account for the extreme volatility observed during the autumn transition (Range 54-137). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak has concluded: Demand dropped from 137 (P33) to an average of 59.5 over P34-P35, signaling a transition into a late-autumn/early-winter lower demand regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn peak (reaching 137 units in P33) has transitioned into a significantly lower demand regime as we move into late October (current date: 2019/10/21). Analysis of the most recent three periods (P34-P36) shows demand has stabilized at an average of 59.7 units (65, 54, 60), a sharp decline from the peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Based on this confirmed regime shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 (the length of the new regime) to avoid over-ordering based on the previous peak data. This aligns the inventory levels with the current 'late-autumn' sales pace while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the inherent weekly volatility observed throughout the season.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime confirmed (starting Period 34): Demand has stabilized at an average of 59.7 units (P34-P36), representing a ~56% drop from the September peak (137 units).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-10-28. We are in a 'Late-autumn' regime which started around Period 34 after the September peak. The last four periods (P34-P37) have seen demand of 65, 54, 60, and 74 units, yielding an average of 63.25 units. This is significantly lower than the peak of 137 in P33 but indicates stabilization above the summer floor. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 38, I will use a 4-period window (N=4) to capture this most recent stabilization (P34-P37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent demand uptick in P37 (74 units) with the preceding three lower values. Setting L to default (0) as it has been perfectly reliable.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (Period 34-37) is stable with an average of 63.3 units (\u03c3 \u2248 8.7), following the September peak. Potential for slight volatility as winter approaches.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/4. We are in a late-autumn demand regime following a sharp peak in September (137 units in Period 33). Since Period 34, demand has stabilized at a lower mean. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P34-P38) show demand values of 65, 54, 60, 74, and 66, resulting in an average of 63.8 units per period. The standard deviation in this relative steady state is approximately 7.5. The promised lead time remains 0, and historical observations consistently show actual lead time is 0. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized late-autumn regime while ignoring the earlier high-growth and peak volatility of September. This ensures we carry enough stock for the ~64 unit average without over-stocking based on the outdated peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the late-autumn/early-winter regime. Demand in Period 39 dropped significantly to 35 units, which is a outlier compared to the Period 34-38 average of 63.8 units. This drop might signal a transitions to winter demand or simply high weekly volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Based on the product description (long-sleeved blouse), demand is expected to remain moderate rather than collapsing like the summer floor, but the drop in P39 suggests a need for caution. I will use recent_N (N=6, covering P34-P39) to balance the stable October performance against the recent dip. This N=6 includes the September peak's aftermath and the recent low, providing a mean of ~59 units and capturing the increased volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock for potential late-year surges or stabilized winter demand.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand (starting Period 34) has averaged 59.0 units through Period 39, but volatility increased in Nov (P39 demand: 35).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The late-autumn demand regime for this blouse has shifted noticeably lower following the September peak. Average demand since Period 39 has dropped significantly, with the last two periods showing 35 and 37 units respectively. This aligns with seasonal expectations for a light woven blouse as colder weather sets in. The previous average from P34-P38 was approximately 64 units, but the most recent two periods suggest a new stabilization level near 36 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I am adjusting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 using a recent window of 7 periods to capture the downward trend while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the recent volatility observed in late October (74 units in P37).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in mid-November (Starting Period 39): Demand has dropped to an average of 36 units (P39-P40) from the October average of ~64 units, signaling the start of a low-demand winter regime for this product category.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Collection blouse has entered a low-demand winter regime. Since Period 39 (early November), demand has sequentially dropped: 35, 37, and now 24 in Period 41. The current 3-period average (P39-P41) is 32 units. With the winter season fully established and retail demand for lighter blouses typically cooling further towards the end of the year, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this new lower mean. On-hand inventory is currently at 32 units, which already covers one full period of the current mean demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the remaining periods, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent downward shift in demand.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (starting Period 39) has further decelerated: 3-period average dropped to 32 units (P39-P41), down from the late-autumn average of ~59 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand spiked unexpectedly to 137 units, drastically deviating from the 'winter regime' average of 32 units (P39-P41). This spike coincides with the start of December (2019/11/25 concluding, moving into 2019/12/2), strongly suggesting a holiday sales event or 'Cyber Week' peak for this women's blouse. While the previous 3-period average was low, this 137-unit peak cannot be ignored given the calendar date. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture both the low baseline and the massive spike, effectively averaging them to prepare for potential holiday demand persistence. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected in Period 42: Demand surged to 137 units from a 3-period winter average of 32 (+328%), likely corresponding to late November holiday/promotional events.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand spiked to 137 units (likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Period 43 (Dec 2) demand was 74 units, which is higher than the early-November average (~32-37 units) but lower than the peak surge, indicating a post-holiday decay or stabilization. We are now in Period 44 (Dec 9). History for this period shows that after the late-November spike (P42), demand typically remains elevated compared to the winter floor as holiday shopping continues through December. The 'Winter regime' (P39-P41) avg was ~32, but the most recent period (P43) was 74. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the transition from the surge (137) back down to current levels (74), forecasting a mean that accounts for this seasonal elevation. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak of 137 in Period 42 was followed by a sustained level of 74 in Period 43, indicating December demand is roughly ~2x the November 'winter floor' baseline of 32-37 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-December (Period 45). Recent demand history shows a holiday spike of 137 units in Period 42 (late Nov), followed by 74 units in Period 43, and a drop to 26 units in Period 44. The drop in Period 44 suggests the initial peak demand wave for the holiday season has passed, but late December often sees a secondary 'last-minute' surge or sustained gift-buying demand before the post-Christmas slump. However, given the product is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' blouse, demand typically settles after the main gift-giving peak. Our on-hand inventory is 53 units. The lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the volatile holiday window (137, 74, 26), which averages ~79 units per period. This approach provides a safety buffer for any minor rebound in late December while accounting for the recent deceleration. Using N=3 for sigma_hat will also reflect this increased holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand period (starting P42) is highly volatile: transitioned from a peak of 137 to 74, then 26 units in P44. Late December regime is fluctuating significantly compared to the November floor of ~32 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), which is right before Christmas. Historically, this product category (Women's Everyday Blouses) experienced a peak of 137 in P42 (late November/Black Friday) and has remained volatile through December (P43: 74, P44: 26, P45: 75). We are entering the final week of December. Given the pattern of high demand followed by a sharp drop (seen in P43-P44), and considering post-holiday demand typically cools off significantly for fashion items until the spring, I expect Period 46 demand to be lower than the mid-December recovery. However, 'Womens Everyday Collection' items can see post-holiday sales or return-related traffic. The current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units). Lead time remains reliably 0. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the high-volatility December average (approx 78 units), while setting sigma_hat to explicit to handle the extreme variance observed in the last 4 periods (range 26 to 137).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition detected: Demand in December has been highly volatile (Avg 78, Max 137, Min 26), significantly higher than the November floor of 32 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30). The recent 'holiday' regime (P42-P46) has shown significant demand volatility (137, 74, 26, 75, 53) with an average of 73 units. Historically, January demand for this SKU (samples: 186, 132, 98, 86) is very high, likely due to post-holiday sales or new-year inventory cycles. The observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture both the recent volatile trend and prepare for the historically high January demand, I am using an EWMA method for mu_hat with a gamma of 0.5 to prioritize recent observations while still factoring in the seasonal upward trend. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility seen in December (standard deviation is high).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday/January transition: Historical data indicates a significant demand spike in January (P1-P4 avg: 125 units), contrasting with the lower winter floor of ~32 units. Prepare for higher demand regimes through early 2020.
