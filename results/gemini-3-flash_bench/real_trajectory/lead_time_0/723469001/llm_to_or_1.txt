Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Kelly 2pk Melbourne push ct'. Historical demand data shows a downward trend over the last 5 weeks: 85, 71, 74, 49, 36. This drop from levels around 70-80 down to 36-49 suggests a demand regime shift or post-holiday cooling in a lingerie/underwear category. The current date (Feb 11) is right before Valentine's Day, which typically sees a spike in lingerie sales, though the recent history doesn't capture that yet. Promised lead time is 0. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the OR backend (targeting a 50% service level) will be sensitive to inventory. To avoid over-ordering based on older, higher demand (mean ~63) while accounting for the recent low (36), I will use the last 3 samples (74, 49, 36) which average 53. This balances the recent decline while providing some buffer for potential Valentine's week demand that might not be fully reflected in the Feb 4 data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a core lingerie item (Kelly 2pk Push-up bra). In Period 1, the promised lead time of 0 was confirmed (ordered 53, arrived 53 in the same period). Demand in Period 1 was 43, which is significantly higher than the average of the trailing five weeks (approx 63 units/week average, but the last four weeks showed a downward trend: 85, 71, 74, 49, 36). The jump to 43 from the previous 36 suggests a possible stabilization or slight uptick, perhaps related to post-Valentine's clearance or mid-February retail cycles. However, the data is still too noisy to confirm a new regime. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the most recent trend (49, 36, 43, and an average of the prior 5 weeks) to avoid being overly influenced by the high January peaks while maintaining safety. Lead time (L) remains 0 as confirmed. The OR engine will aim to cover (L+1)=1 period of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '723469001' is women's cotton push-up bras. Current date is 2019/02/25. Looking at the historical demand samples (85, 71, 74, 49, 36) and the game history (P1=43, P2=118), there is a significant demand spike in Period 2 (118 units). This spike likely correlates with the post-Valentine's Day period or a specific sales event. The observed lead time is confirmed as 0 periods for both P1 and P2 orders. My on-hand inventory is currently 0 after selling out in P2. To capture the recent volatility and the demand jump while acknowledging the previous lower levels, I will use a recent_N approach. For mu_hat, N=4 will average [49, 36, 43, 118] \u2248 61.5, which better reflects the current higher demand level than the all-time mean. For sigma_hat, N=4 will capture the recent increase in variance. L remains at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in Period 2 (118 units), significantly higher than previous 5 periods (avg ~60). Lead time confirmed as 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P1: 43, P2: 118, P3: 84) shows a significant shift from the historical mean (~63) observed in January. Specifically, the last two periods (avg 101) indicate a new demand level for this SKU (Womens Lingerie / Push-up bras), which could be sustained. We have stockouts in both P2 and P3 (sold 51/118 and 62/84) because the OR engine's 'cap' mechanism, combined with the initial estimate, didn't provide enough stock. The lead time is consistently 0. To prevent further lost sales, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent spike (mean ~82) and including the high volatility from P2. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level; however, because of the stockouts and the 'cap' logic, I need to ensure \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 reflect the full demand (including the unmet 118 and 84) to lift the order ceiling.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 2: Avg demand increased from ~63 to ~82 (+30%) with high volatility (spike of 118 in P2). Lead time reliably 0.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-03-11. We are looking at women's lingerie (push-up bras). Looking at the demand history: P1=43, P2=118, P3=84, P4=69. In early February (P1-P2), demand spiked massively, likely related to Valentine's Day (Feb 14). Since then, demand has stabilized but remains higher than the January pre-period average (~63). The mean of the last 3 periods (P2, P3, P4) is approx 90, which is a better reflection of the current post-holiday baseline than the very low January samples. Lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 13. Given the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which means the OR engine will target the median demand. To ensure we don't stock out while acknowledging the downward trend from the P2 peak, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to focus on the current regime (avg ~90). I'll use default for sigma_hat to capture the broader volatility including the P2 spike.

Carry-over insight: Post-Valentine's Day demand (P3-P4) has moderated to ~76 units, though the P2 spike (118) keeps the 3-period average high (~90). Trend is downward but remains above Jan baseline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 18, 2019. We are looking at a 2-pack push-up bra SKU. Historical demand analysis shows a significant Valentine's Day spike in Period 2 (118 units) followed by a gradual decline (84, 69, 47). The demand of 47 in Period 5 matches the pre-February baseline mean (~50-60 range), suggesting the seasonal surge is over. Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods across all 5 historical periods. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend computes a target service level of 50%. To avoid overstocking as demand returns to normal baseline levels, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture the downward trend (avg of 84, 69, 47 is 66.7), versus using the all-time history which is skewed by the unique spike. L remains 'default' (0) as it is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-Valentine's surge has ended. Demand returned to baseline levels in Period 5 (47 units), down from peak Period 2 (118).

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), the demand for the Melbourne push-up bra has stabilized following the Valentine's Day surge observed in February (Period 2 peak of 118). Demand over the last two periods (47 and 49 units) perfectly matches the early January baseline (avg ~60, with a recent drift lower). There are no calendar events in late March/early April expected to drive immediate lingerie spikes. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize the last 3 periods (Period 4, 5, 6) for demand forecasting as this represents the post-surge regime accurately. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 will target a baseline of ~55 (average of 69, 47, 49), which is safer than the 'default' which is still inflated by the February spike. Sigma_hat is also set to N=3 to account for the lowered volatility in this stable period.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Period 5 and 6 demand (47, 49) indicates a return to the pre-holiday baseline after the Feb 14th surge. Volatility has also significantly decreased compared to the Period 2-3 window.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the demand for SKU 723469001 (Women's Push-up Bra) has stabilized following the Valentine's Day surge. History shows that demand spiked in Period 2 (118) and Period 3 (84) but has since settled, with the last three periods recording 47, 49, and 59. The mean demand of the last 3 periods is ~52. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1-7. Ending inventory in Period 7 was 0, meaning we lost 4 units of demand (59 demand - 55 sold), signaling a need for a slightly more robust safety stock despite the return to baseline levels. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized 'new normal' and use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the current, lower volatility compared to the February peak. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 52 units plus a safety margin to prevent further stockouts while minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully stabilized post-Valentine's surge. Baseline demand is currently 50-60 units (avg of P5-P7 is 51.6). Volatility has normalized after the Feb 18 spike.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Reviewing the history, Period 8 saw a massive demand spike of 121 units, which is a significant deviation from the post-Valentine's baseline of ~51 observed in Periods 5-7. This spike mirrors the scale of the Period 2 (Feb 14th window) surge. Looking at the calendar, this period (April 1st and April 8th) aligns with the lead-up to Easter 2019 (April 21), which often triggers demand for lingerie/apparel. Because demand has spiked again after a period of stability, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P5-P8) to capture both the baseline and this new surge, ensuring the OR backend raises the base stock level to prevent the stock-outs seen in Period 8. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge observed in Period 8 (121 units), likely linked to Easter seasonality. This breaks the post-Valentine's stabilization period (P5-P7 avg ~51).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-April period (P10: 2019/4/15). Observations from P8 (121) and P9 (110) confirm a significant demand surge, likely associated with Easter (April 21, 2019). The previous 'stabilized' regime (P5-P7) averaged 52 units, whereas the last two periods averaged 115.5 units\u2014a 122% increase. Since Easter is next Sunday, P10 is the final high-demand window before the holiday. I will set mu_hat using the last 2 samples (N=2) to capture this Easter peak and set sigma_hat to explicit values to reflect the high volatility seen during these holiday spikes (observed std dev in high-demand periods is significant). Lead time remains reliably 0. On-hand is currently 0 due to stockouts in P7, P8, and P9, which underscores the need to aggressively cover this high-demand regime before it tapers off post-Easter.

Carry-over insight: Easter demand surge confirmed: P8-P9 demand (avg 115.5) is more than double the P5-P7 baseline (avg 51.6). Forecast for P10 remains high due to proximity to Easter Sunday.

Today is April 22nd, 2019 (Monday after Easter Sunday, which was April 21st). Historical data shows a significant demand surge leading up to Easter (P8: 121, P9: 110). However, the Period 10 concluding message (Easter week) shows demand already moderating to 73 units as the holiday passed. Based on previous seasonal behavior (post-Valentine's), demand for this lingerie SKU typically returns to a baseline level immediately following the holiday. The average demand during the non-peak period (P5-P7) was approximately 51.6 units. Given that we are now post-Easter, I expect demand to return toward this baseline. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to bridge the transition from the holiday peak (avg of P8-P10 is 101) back to normal levels, while maintaining a higher sigma_hat to account for the recent high volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter demand regime shift: Demand peaked in P8-P9 (avg 115) and began declining in P10 (73) immediately following Easter Sunday. Expecting return to baseline of ~55 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. We have successfully navigated the Easter demand peak (P8-P9). Demand has begun to subside (P10: 73, P11: 76) following the Easter holiday (April 21). Historical data from periods P5-P7, which followed the Valentine's Day surge, showed a stabilization baseline of approximately 50-60 units. Period 11 demand of 76 suggests we are still slightly above that baseline but trending toward it. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while demand returns to baseline levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4: P8-P11). This window captures the end of the high-demand volatility while allowing the model to adjust downward as more post-peak samples arrive. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the OR backend will target a 50% service level, which is appropriate as we aim to minimize excess inventory at the end of a seasonal cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization following Easter peak: P10-P11 demand (avg 74.5) confirms a sharp decline from P8-P9 (avg 115.5) toward the pre-Easter baseline of ~55 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-06 (Period 13). History shows a significant demand spike in Period 12 (130 units), which contradicts the previous expectation that demand would return to the ~55-60 baseline after Easter (April 21). This surge likely correlates with the 'early May' seasonal lift often seen in women's apparel. Because the Easter surge (P8-P9) and this May surge (P12) both exceeded 110 units, while the weeks in between (P10-P11) averaged 74.5, I am detecting a high-volatility regime. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this recent volatility and the higher average demand (avg P8-P12 is 102), as the 'baseline' of 50-60 is no longer capturing the actual sales potential or current seasonal trend. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Recurring demand surges observed: Demand spiked to 130 units in Period 12 (early May), following an Easter peak in P8-P9 (avg 115). Baseline is shifting upward or experiencing extreme volatility; 5-period average is now 102 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. Historical data reveals a pattern of demand surges followed by sharp declines. Period 12 saw a significant spike (130 units), but Period 13 demand crashed to 44 units, confirming that the early May 'Mother's Day' or seasonal bump has concluded. This mirrors the post-Easter behavior (P8-9 spike, P10-11 drop). The 3-period average (P11-P13) is 83 units, but the most recent observation of 44 suggests we are returning to the baseline demand of ~55 units observed in calmer periods (P5-P7). To avoid excessive holding costs (current on-hand is 58) while protecting against volatility, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 (averaging 76, 130, 44, plus the current downward trajectory) to transition the OR backend toward the lower baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-early May spike demand regime shift: Demand fell from 130 (P12) to 44 (P13), signaling the end of the seasonal surge and a return toward the baseline of ~55 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P13: 44, P14: 55) confirms a return to the post-seasonal baseline (avg ~50) following the early May spike (P12: 130). Currently, we are in a non-peak period (late May, no major shopping holidays until June/July sales). With on-hand inventory at 26, the strategy is to set parameters that align with this stable baseline. I will use recent_N (N=2) for mu_hat to catch the downward shift immediately, and Recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility of early May while moving toward stabilization. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed following second seasonal spike: P13-P14 demand (avg 49.5) aligns with the pre-surge baseline of ~50-55 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand shows clear seasonal spikes around mid-February (Valentine's), mid-April (Easter), and early May. The most recent spike (P12, demand=130) has dissipated, with P13-P15 demand averaging 47.33 units (44, 55, 43). This aligns with the established baseline of ~50-55 units observed during previous non-peak periods (P5-P7). No immediate major holidays are pending in the very short term for this product category (lingerie). Given the high volatility (sigma is naturally large due to spikes) and equal profit/holding cost, the OR backend needs to stabilize for this baseline. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this return to baseline demand (approx. 47 units/period) and recent_N=10 for sigma to account for the residual volatility from the May spike while discounting the much older April spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16 (2019/5/27), we observed an extreme demand spike of 203 units, which is significantly higher than any previous observation. Historically, this product (Womens Lingerie) has shown sharp spikes followed by immediate crashes (e.g., P8/P9 spike followed by a drop in P10; P12 spike followed by a drop in P13). The date (end of May) suggests a possible peak related to the start of summer or a specific promotional event. Given the cost structure (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. With zero on-hand inventory, we need to order for Period 17. Following the previous pattern of 'spike-and-drop', I expect demand to moderate from the 203 peak but remain elevated compared to the baseline. Using recent_N=4 captures the transition from the P13-P15 baseline (avg ~47) into this new volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained extreme volatility observed: Period 16 saw a record demand of 203 units, continuing the pattern of high-magnitude episodic surges followed by sharp declines.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '723469001' (Womens Lingerie) is experiencing an extremely high-demand regime in late May and early June, likely associated with mid-year sales or early summer seasonal trends. Demand in Period 16 (203 units) and Period 17 (222 units) is roughly 4-5x the established baseline of ~50-55 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To prevent significant stockouts while the OR backend balances the equal profit and holding costs ($1.0 each), I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 220, reflecting the current high-demand plateau observed over the last two periods. I am setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the extreme volatility of the recent peak compared to the stable periods immediately preceding it.

Carry-over insight: Extreme June demand surge confirmed: Period 16-17 demand averaged 212.5 units, compared to the May baseline of ~50. This represents a 300%+ increase, necessitating high inventory buffers.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Kelly 2pk Melbourne push ct' (Womens Lingerie) has been in an extreme surge period throughout June (P16: 203, P17: 222, P18: 157). The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 194 units. Historically (following Valentine's, Easter, and early May peaks), these surges are short-lived (2-3 periods) followed by a sharp drop back to a baseline of ~50-60 units. However, because the current date (June 17) is close to the start of summer and potential mid-season sales, and demand remained high at 157 in P18, I must maintain a significant buffer while acknowledging the impending downward correction seen in previous cycles. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the average of the surge (194), while the OR backend's capping mechanism will moderate the risk of excessive overstocking as baseline demand returns. Actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: June demand surge peaked in P17 (222 units) and began decelerating in P18 (157 units). This mirrors previous episodic seasonal spikes where demand quickly returns to a ~55 unit baseline after 2-3 high-volume weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The extreme June demand surge (peaking at 222 units in Period 17) is now sharply decelerating, consistent with the pattern of previous episodic spikes seen in Period 2 (Valentine's) and Period 8 (Easter). Period 19 demand was 178, down from 222. Following the pattern observed in P4 and P10, demand typically drops back to the baseline of ~55-60 units within 2-3 periods of the peak. Period 20 demand is expected to continue this downward trend. Using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat (covering Periods 16-19) would result in a forecast of 190, which is too high given the visible deceleration. Therefore, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 120 (for L=0, meaning 1+L=1 period of inventory) as a midpoint between the peak and the baseline, and a high explicit sigma_hat of 60 to protect against the residual volatility of this specific surge. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-June surge demand regime shift: Demand peaking in P17 (222) and P19 (178) is reverting to the baseline, mirroring previous seasonal surges. Expected baseline return in 1-2 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 723469001 (women's lingerie) continues to experience high episodic volatility, with Period 20 reaching a new record demand of 230 units. While previous carry-over insights predicted a return to baseline, the data from P16-P20 (203, 222, 157, 178, 230) establishes a sustained high-demand regime throughout June and late July, likely driven by summer seasonality or promotions. The average demand of the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 198 units. Although demand often sharpishly reverts after these peaks, the consistent magnitude over the last five weeks necessitates a high mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid the stockouts seen in P16, P17, and P20. The lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand summer regime (P16-P20): Average demand rose to 198 units, a ~260% increase over the previous May baseline of ~55. High volatility persists with a peak of 230 in P20.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained high-demand summer regime that began around Period 16 (late May). Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand has averaged 190.1 units (203, 222, 157, 178, 230, 151), which is a massive increase over the spring baseline of ~55. While the most recent demand (151) is slightly lower than the peak (230), it remains very high. The lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To avoid the stockouts seen in P16, P17, and P20, I will use a recent_N approach targeting this summer regime. N=6 captures the entirety of this high-volatility, high-volume period since Period 16, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the high mean (~190) and the significant standard deviation of this specific window.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 (Women's Push-up Bra) is decelerating following a mid-summer peak. Demand dropped from 230 (P20) to 151 (P21) and now 93 (P22). This follows the established pattern of sharp episodic surges followed by a return to a lower baseline. The previous baseline was ~55 units, but the recent summer surge (P16-P21) had a much higher average. Given the current date is mid-July, the post-peak deceleration is confirmed. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (P20-P22 avg ~158) to capture the trend downward while maintaining enough stock to prevent stockouts if the decline is slower than expected. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to reflect the high volatility experienced during this summer regime. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak demand deceleration confirmed: Demand fell from 230 (P20) to 93 (P22). The summer regime (P16-P21) averaged ~190 units, but current levels suggest a reversion toward a lower seasonal baseline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 (Women's push-up bras) is currently in a deceleration phase following a sustained summer peak (Period 16-21 avg: ~190). Period 22 and 23 demand (93, 107) confirms a significant drop from the 200+ unit peaks seen in June. Historically, this product exhibits episodic surges (Valentine's, Easter, early May, June) followed by returns to a lower baseline of ~50-60 units. We are currently moving toward that baseline. Based on the last two periods (avg 100) and the historical pattern of rapid deceleration, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 (N=3 captures the downward trend: 151, 93, 107). Lead time is stable at 0. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5, so the backend OR logic will target the median demand. I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current, albeit reduced, volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand deceleration confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~190 (P16-P21) to 100 (P22-P23), signaling a return toward the seasonal baseline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 723469001 (Push-up bras) has exited its sustained summer peak period (P16-P21 had an average demand of ~190). The most recent three periods (P22-P24) show a clear downward trend with demand values of 93, 107, and 133, averaging 111. While P24 saw a slight uptick to 133, it is significantly lower than the peak values of >200 seen in June/July. We are currently transitioning to a post-summer baseline, which historically aligns around 50-70 units, but for this period, I will use a recent window (N=3) to set mu_hat at 111 units to capture the deceleration without under-ordering if the 133 is the start of a new plateau. Lead time has consistently remained 0 across all concluded periods. Inventory is currently 0, so the backend will order to reach the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand deceleration confirmed: Demand dropped from a peak avg of ~190 (P16-P21) to ~111 (P22-P24), moving towards the autumnal baseline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P22-P25) indicates a significant drop from the summer peak (avg ~190) to a more moderate but still elevated level (avg 114). The most recent period demand (123) and on-hand inventory of 0 suggest we need to maintain a higher inventory level than the early-year baseline of ~55, but much lower than the summer peak. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this post-peak stabilization (P22-P25). Calculated lead time remains 0. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to account for the current volatility in this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization: Demand has stayed consistently between 93 and 133 for the last 4 periods (P22-P25), averaging ~114, confirming a shift away from the extreme June/July peaks (~190).

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending August 5 (Period 26) was 88 units, showing a slight softening from the July average (~114). The current date is August 12. Historically, we saw a massive surge in June/July (averaging near 200) followed by a stabilization in late July/early August at a level roughly double the spring baseline (around 110 units vs 55 units). Although the most recent demand was 88, the 5-period average (P22-P26) is approximately 109 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the on-hand inventory of 26 units and the observed stabilization, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization level (avg ~109) while maintaining the 0 lead time setting.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed: Demand has shifted from the extreme June/July peaks (~190) to a steady late-summer regime averaging ~109 units (P22-P26 range: 88-133).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/19. For Period 27 (the latest concluded period), demand was 130, which is slightly above the recent stable average but within the seen volatility range of the current late-summer regime. As identified in the Carry-over Insights for Period 27, demand has shifted away from the extreme June/July surges (avg ~190) to a more moderate stabilization period. The average demand from Period 22 to 27 is approximately 112 units (93, 107, 133, 123, 88, 130). I will set mu_hat based on this 6-period window (N=6) to capture the current post-summer baseline accurately while ignoring the outlier peaks from June/July. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect the current standard deviation of this regime. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 has transitioned from the extreme summer peak (avg ~190 during P16-P21) to a more stable late-summer/autumn regime. Over the last 7 periods (P22-P28), demand has averaged 105.5 units (range 65-133), which is significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~55 but much lower than the June/July highs. The most recent demand (P28) was 65 units, suggesting a potential downward trend or just typical volatility within this newer regime. Given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5), the OR backend will target the median demand (z=0). To balance the risk of stockouts seen in P27 against the high on-hand inventory (48) and the lower P28 demand, I am using a recent_N window of 7 periods. This captures the post-summer stabilization period while excluding the extreme June spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-summer: Period 22-28 average is 105.5 units, representing a new autumnal baseline lower than the 190-unit summer peak but higher than the 55-unit spring baseline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear shift from the high-volume summer regime (P16-P21 avg ~190) to a stabilized autumnal baseline. Over the last eight periods (P22-P29), demand has averaged 100 units (range 60-133), with the most recent two periods (P28-P29) showing a further decline to 60-65 units. This suggests demand is returning toward the lower levels seen in the spring or stabilising at a lower autumn baseline. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given the recent downward trend (P28: 65, P29: 60), I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture the post-summer average (~100 units) to avoid overreacting to the two most recent low data points while still acknowledging the end of the summer peak. The sigma_hat will also use recent_N=8 to capture the current regime's volatility, which is significantly lower than the extreme spikes seen in June/July.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-summer: Period 22-29 average is 100.0 units, significantly lower than the P16-P21 peak (~190).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 has stabilized into a post-summer autumnal baseline. Following the extreme volatility of June and July (where demand peaked at 230 units), the last four periods (P27-P30) have shown a consistent range between 59 and 130 units, with the most recent three periods (P28-P30) specifically showing lower, more stable demand (65, 60, 59). The average for the last 9 periods (P22-P30) is approximately 95 units, but the most recent 3-period average is 61.3 units. Given the transition into September, I am targeting this more recent lower baseline while maintaining sufficient buffer for the moderate volatility seen in this category. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will Use recent_N=9 for mu_hat to capture the broader post-summer stabilization while allowing the OR engine to react to the recent lower trend, and recent_N=9 for sigma_hat to account for the stabilized variance.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 has stabilized in a post-summer regime. Since Period 28, demand has been very consistent (65, 60, 59, 58), averaging approximately 60 units. This is significantly lower than the June-July peak of ~190 and slightly higher than the spring baseline of ~55. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Period 32 (Sept 16) is a standard autumn week with no immediate calendar spikes expected. To optimize for the equal profit/holding cost ratio (z-score will be 0, targeting the mean), I will set mu_hat to the current regime average and use a narrow window (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect the significantly reduced volatility observed in the last month. This will minimize holding costs while meeting the stable demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime stabilized further (P28-P31): Demand is extremely steady, averaging 60.5 units with minimal variance, down from the P22-P27 autumn transition avg of 105.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Sept 23, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear stabilization into a post-summer baseline. Since Period 28, demand has been remarkably steady, with values of 65, 60, 59, 58, and 66 (average ~62). This follows a much higher summer peak (avg ~190) and an autumnal transition (avg ~105). Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the stability over the last 5 periods and the lack of upcoming major retail events in late September for this SKU, I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture this steady state for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will prevent overstocking from the previous higher-demand regimes while maintaining a tight buffer for the current baseline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 spiked to 113 units in Period 33, significantly higher than the previous four-period average of roughly 61 units (P29-P32). This pattern mirrors previous episodic surges seen in this product's history (e.g., Period 12, Period 16, Period 24). Based on history, these spikes usually last for 1-2 periods before reverting to a lower baseline or transitioning to a new plateau. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the spike in P33 and the zero on-hand inventory, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture both the recent steady baseline and the current surge, ensuring enough stock to cover a potential second week of high demand while mitigating the risk of excessive holding costs if demand drops quickly.

Carry-over insight: New demand spike detected in Period 33 (113 units) following a stable 4-week period averaging ~61 units. This follows the product's historical pattern of episodic surges.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 723469001 (Women's Push-up Bra) continues its pattern of episodic surges. After a significant spike to 113 units in Period 33, demand reverted to a baseline of 44 units in Period 34. This behavior (P33-P34 avg: 78.5) mirrors previous cycles where surges are brief. With the current date of October 7th, we are approaching mid-autumn, a period where demand has historically stayed near a baseline of 55-65 units between major promotional or seasonal events. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts during episodic spikes against the holding cost in baseline weeks, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3. This N captures the high P33 value and the lower P34 value (averaging ~74), providing a sufficient safety buffer for the next period while starting to acknowledge the post-surge deceleration. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to incorporate the recent volatility within the current autumnal regime.

Carry-over insight: Episodic demand surge pattern confirmed in Period 33-34: A rapid spike to 113 units was immediately followed by a drop to 44 units, consistent with the product's high-volatility behavior.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits episodic seasonal demand surges (Valentine's, Easter, early May, and a significant June/July peak) followed by stabilization. Currently, demand has settled into a post-summer baseline. Periods 34 and 35 recorded demand of 44 and 36, respectively, reflecting a return to the lower demand levels observed in early September (avg ~60) and late January/early February. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while holding costs equal profit ($1.00), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 (N=4) to capture the current stable demand regime (P32-P35 avg: 64.75) while moving past the brief P33 spike (113). This allows the OR engine to right-size inventory for the current autumn baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized into a late-autumn baseline (P34-P35 avg ~40), significantly lower than the P22-P31 autumn transition avg (~90). This follows a brief episodic spike in P33.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand has transitioned from the high summer regime (~190 units) and the autumn transition (~100 units) to a stable late-autumn baseline. Over the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has averaged 45.3 units (44, 36, 56), which is consistent with the early year baseline (~55 units). Although there was a brief episodic spike in P33 (113 units), the subsequent moderation suggests we should focus on the most recent stable regime to avoid overstocking, as holding cost equals profit ($1/unit). Lead time remains reliably 0. I will use N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stabilization while excluding the P33 surge from the immediate forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized into a late-autumn baseline (P34-P36 avg ~45), returning to levels seen in early Spring 2019.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the week ending Oct 21 (Period 37) spiked to 116 units, interrupting the late-autumn baseline of ~45 units. This mirrors the episodic surge seen in Period 33 (113 units) and previous cyclical patterns for this product. Historical data for late October/early November (approaching Singles' Day and typical pre-holiday transitions) suggests high volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To capture this recurring surge while recognizing the baseline is typically lower, I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the spike's influence (Avg: 63) and recent_N=4 for volatility (sigma_hat) to account for the large swing from 36 to 116. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: New episodic demand spike detected in Period 37 (116 units), following the pattern set in Period 33 (113 units). This indicates a high-volatility regime where demand frequently doubles or triples the established baseline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early November. Historically, this product exhibits episodic demand surges (P33: 113, P37: 116) interspersed with baseline periods (P34-P36 avg: 45). The current date (2019/11/4) is approaching the end-of-year holiday shopping season (Singles' Day on 11/11, Black Friday, etc.), which typically triggers high demand for women's lingerie. We just had two high-demand weeks in P37 (116) and P38 (88). Given the pattern of episodic spikes and the approaching peak retail season, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent volatility and the upward shift from the October baseline. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to account for the overall historical volatility which is high for this SKU. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand surge anticipated: Recent demand in P37-P38 (avg 102) is double the Oct baseline (~45), likely signaling the start of the Q4 shopping peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are entering the Q4 holiday shopping season. Recent demand in P37-P39 (averaging 91.7) is substantially higher than the October baseline of ~45, confirming the seasonal surge anticipated in the carry-over insights. Historically, this SKU exhibits extreme episodic peaks (e.g., June peaks of 200+). To avoid the frequent stockouts seen in Periods 37 and 38, I must set the base stock level higher than the immediate trailing average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current upward momentum of the holiday season, but will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during previous peak regimes (like the summer surge) to ensure the OR backend's inventory 'cap' and 'base_stock' calculations provide enough buffer for potential triple-digit spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand surge confirmed: P37-P39 avg demand (91.7) is double the Oct baseline (~45). Significant volatility persists, mirroring previous seasonal peak patterns.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, approaching the major Black Friday/Cyber Monday and holiday shopping window. Historical patterns for this SKU show significant episodic surges (P33 at 113, P37 at 116) overlaid on a seasonal baseline. The recent 4-period demand (P37-P40) has averaged 82.75 units, which is a clear elevation from the October baseline of ~45. While Period 40 saw a decrease to 56 units, we must anticipate the imminent holiday peak which typically drives high volatility and volume for apparel/lingerie. Period 16-21 showed that summer peaks can reach >200 units; while holiday peaks might differ, the current trend is upward. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current holiday-regime mean (~83), but I will use an explicit sigma_hat set to 35 to account for the high volatility observed during previous surges (spikes often exceed the mean by 50-100%). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand regime confirmed: P37-P40 demand avg 82.8 is ~85% higher than Oct baseline (~45). Significant volatility persists, mirroring previous seasonal peak patterns (P37 demand 116).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42), which is the start of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday week. The historical demand for this SKU shows significant episodic surges (e.g., P37 demand was 116 units). While the immediate last four periods (P38-P41) show a declining trend in demand (88, 71, 56, 43), this is likely the 'calm before the storm' common in retail before major Q4 shopping events. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the service level target is 50%, but the backend formula for 'cap' and the inclusion of safety stock (z-score) will allow us to buffer for the anticipated holiday spike. I am choosing recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat (average demand ~65) to capture the recent range while acknowledging the holiday seasonality will likely drive demand above the immediate P41 low of 43. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Anticipated Holiday/Black Friday surge. Recent demand indicates a lull (P41: 43), but historical patterns suggest high-volatility spikes during promotional windows.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Dec 2, 2019, the period immediately following Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. Period 42 showed a jump in demand to 88 units, up from 43 in P41, confirming the expected holiday volatility. Historically, this product (Womens Lingerie) exhibits episodic spikes followed by sharp variations. Period 43 encompasses the post-Cyber Monday fallout and early December shopping. Given that P42 demand (88) was not fully met (sold 75, stock out), we need to ensure mu_hat captures the current elevated regime. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend since mid-October (P37-P42), which includes both peak and lull periods, providing a balanced but responsive forecast for the holiday season. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday shopping surge confirmed: P42 demand (88) reflects Cyber Monday activity, breaking the short lull in P41. Demand volatility remains high as the Q4 peak continues.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in the peak December holiday shopping window (Period 44, Dec 9). Historical data and previous carry-over insights show that this product experiences significant episodic spikes during seasonal peaks (e.g., Period 16: 203 units, Period 20: 230 units). While Period 43 demand was low (29 units), this likely represents a pre-Christmas lull before a final surge. The Q4 regime (P37-P43) has an average demand of approximately 71 units, but given the proximity to Christmas and the 'Push-up bra' category's relevance for holiday gifts/apparel, I must prepare for a possible high-magnitude spike. The lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts during a potential surge against the high holding cost, I will set mu_hat to 85 (above the recent average of 71 to account for peak December activity) and use a recent_N sigma_hat (N=7) to capture the high volatility inherent in the current Q4 regime.

Carry-over insight: December holiday surge pattern: Period 42-43 show high volatility (88 followed by 29) consistent with pre-peak fluctuations observed in previous seasonal cycles.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-39.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16, which is peak holiday season. Demand has been highly volatile: P42 saw a surge (88), followed by a sharp drop in P43 (29) and P44 (23). However, historical data for this product shows episodic surges that often catch the system off guard (e.g., spikes to 110-230 units). Given the product description (lingerie/bras) and proximity to Christmas, a final holiday surge is highly probable before the year-end lull. The current on-hand inventory is 62 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prepare for a potential end-of-season surge while acknowledging the recent low demand samples, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8. This captures the active Q4 regime (from P37 onward), averaging approx 64.25 units with significant variance. This approach balances the risk of another spike (like the 116 in P37) against the recent low values to avoid overstocking significantly as we approach the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Late Q4 volatility confirmed: Demand shows deep troughs (23-29 units) immediately following holiday surges (88 units), suggesting extreme week-to-week consumption variance during the December peak.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the Christmas and holiday shopping season. Historical patterns for this SKU show extreme episodic volatility (e.g., spikes of 116, 121, 230). While the last two periods (P43-P44) were low (29, 23), Period 45 saw a significant recovery to 63 units, likely the start of the final holiday rush. Given that lead time is consistently 0, we must ensure on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover the potential for a large Christmas-week spike without over-correcting and incurring high holding costs. A profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1 implies a target service level of 50%, but in a high-volatility, same-day lead time environment, we need to capture the potential upside of the holiday peak. I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat to capture the Q4 trend (averaging ~65 units) while maintaining a standard volatility estimate.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand recovery: After a two-week lull in early Dec (avg 26), Period 45 demand rose to 63, signaling the commencement of the final holiday surge.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the final week of the year following the Christmas holiday peak. Historically, this product (a push-up bra) exhibits extreme volatility with sharp episodic surges followed by immediate drops. After a low-demand period in early December (avg ~26), demand recovered to 63 and 65 in Periods 45 and 46. We are now in the post-holiday wrap-up and approaching the New Year. Based on the pattern observed after previous major peaks (Easter, Early May, Summer surge), demand tends to stabilize or slightly decline back toward a baseline before any new seasonal event (like Valentine's Day). I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (approx 45 units) to capture the late December recovery while guarding against a post-holiday slump. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility seen in the transition from December lows to the current level of ~65.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand recovery: Following a December lull (avg ~26), demand stabilized at approximately 64 units in the final two weeks of the year (P45-P46).
