Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for this SKU (Ladies Denim Ankle Jeans) shows a strong upward trend from 19 to 85 over the last 5 weeks, likely driven by the transition into the Spring season and the upcoming Valentine's Day (Feb 14). Since the promised lead time is 0, orders arrive in the same period. The mean of all samples (52) significantly lags the most recent observation (85). To prevent stockouts on this high-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat to 95 via 'explicit' to account for continued seasonal growth. I will set sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus on the volatility of the current regime.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans'. Looking at historical demand (19, 46, 48, 62, 85) and the most recent Period 1 demand (67), there is a clear upward trend as we move into mid-February, likely reflecting early spring seasonal demand for denim. The mean of the last 3 samples (62, 85, 67) is 71.3. Given the steady growth from January (starting at 19), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this higher demand regime without being overly influenced by the very low early January numbers. The actual lead time for Period 1 was 0, matching the promised lead time, so L=default is appropriate. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are looking at 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' jeans in late February. Demand has surged significantly: P1 (67) and P2 (173), compared to Jan/early Feb history (max 85). This suggests a strong seasonal transition to spring fashion or a specific promotion. Inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in P2 (lost sales: 173 total demand vs 92 available units). The promised lead time is 0 and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0 (ordered in P1 arrived in P1; ordered in P2 arrived in P2). To satisfy the current high demand regime (avg ~120 over last 2 weeks), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this upward shift while avoiding over-weighting the extreme P2 spike. L will stay at 'default' (0) as lead times are reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected from mid-February: average weekly demand increased from ~50 to ~120 units (+140%) following a late-winter/spring transition.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. We are looking at SKU 636323003 (Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans). Historical demand samples from early 2019 showed a base level of ~50 units. However, recent periods (P1: 67, P2: 173, P3: 156) show a significant surge, averaging ~132 units over the last three weeks. This aligns with the transition to spring fashion. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (all orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 arrived in the same period). On-hand inventory is 46, and we lost sales in Period 2 due to a stockout. To stabilize, I will use a recent_N approach. For mu_hat, N=3 covers the high-demand regime since P1, reflecting the spring shift. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher volatility seen in this new demand state. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Demand average shifted from ~50 to ~132 units/period (+160%) starting Period 2, likely due to spring footwear/denim seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1974.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323003 (Ladies Denim) is in a sustained high-demand regime starting from Period 2 (late February). Historical demand samples from January (avg ~43) were significantly lower than the recent 4 periods (67, 173, 156, 110; avg ~126.5). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders placed in Periods 1-4 arriving in the same period. Since on-hand inventory is 116 and the 'in-transit' is 0, we need to ensure the base stock covers demand for the current period and the immediate lead-time window. Using recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat reflects the current high-demand Spring denim regime while excluding the January baseline. Setting L to default (0) as evidenced by consecutive successful same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1134.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Ladies Denim' item, with demand showing a clear regime shift since mid-February. Recent history shows demand values of 67, 173, 156, 110, and 67. The average since Period 1 (the start of the shift) is approximately 115 units per period. The most recent demand (67) suggests a potential cooling from the peak seen in Periods 2 and 3, but we must maintain a base stock that accounts for the high variability (std dev ~48). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable as all orders (P1-P5) have arrived within the same period. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-activity regime while being responsive to the latest downward tick. This balances the risk of stockouts seen in Period 2 against the holding costs for this high-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees strong demand in early spring (March/April). Reviewing the history: demand spiked significantly in Periods 2 and 3 (173 and 156 units), then stabilized somewhat in Periods 4-6 (110, 67, 107 units). The average demand over the last 5 periods (Period 2-6) is approximately 122 units, which is consistent with the 'sustained high-demand regime' noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this higher spring baseline. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility observed during this transition.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens Denim) is a spring fashion staple. Historically, demand shifted significantly around Period 2 (late February). Recent performance (Periods 2-7) shows an average demand of approximately 122.3 units per period. The most recent three periods (5-7) show a slightly lower but volatile trend (67, 107, 121), averaging 98.3, though the high-demand regime from the spring transition still appears active. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 7 historical periods. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the post-shift regime (since Period 2) and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this higher-demand period.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, 2019. This SKU (Ladies Denim Trousers) has stabilized in a demand regime characterized by an average of approximately 117 units per period since mid-February (Periods 2-8). While there was a spike in Period 2 (173), demand has fluctuated between 67 and 156 since then. The most recent demand (74) was lower than the recent average, potentially signaling the end of the initial spring surge or just normal volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 8 historical periods. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the demand regime post-January, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the localized volatility within this spring window. L will remain at 'default' (0) as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time perfectly.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is Ladies Denim (Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans), which typically maintains steady demand through spring. However, Period 9 (April 8) showed a sharp, anomalous drop in demand to 22 units compared to the previous regime average of ~115 units. This could be a temporary post-Easter lull or a random fluctuation. While I maintain the 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat (N=8 to capture the spring regime starting Period 2), I will slightly increase N for sigma_hat to 9 to encompass this recent volatility without overreacting. On-hand inventory is high at 158 units due to the low demand in Period 9, which the backend will naturally subtract from the order logic. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens) has entered a distinct low-demand phase following the predicted spring surge. Demand over the last two periods (P9: 22, P10: 31) is significantly lower than the previous regime mean (~110-130). This decline likely reflects a local saturation or a shift in late-April purchasing behavior. The current on-hand inventory is 151 units, which is approximately five times the recent average demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on this new, lower demand regime using the last 3 samples (N=3 includes Period 8's 74, Period 9's 22, and Period 10's 31) to capture the cooling trend while retaining a small buffer. Lead time L is kept at 'calculate' as it is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand regime cooling detected from mid-April; average weekly demand decreased from ~118 to ~27 units over the last two periods (-77%).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late April (2019-04-29). The product, skinny ankle denim, experienced a strong spring peak from mid-February through March, but demand has dropped significantly over the last three periods (22, 31, and 18 units respectively). This signals a clear regime shift from the high-demand spring period to a lower late-spring/early-summer baseline. The Carry-Over Insight from Period 11 correctly identified this 'cooling' phase. Currently, we have 133 units on hand, which is more than enough to cover several weeks of demand at the new lower rate (~24 units on average). Lead time remains consistently 0. I will continue using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this lower regime and prevent over-ordering while we burn through existing safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-spring demand regime confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~24 units/period from Period 9 through Period 11, down from the ~110 units/period observed in March.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Historical data for this Ladies Denim SKU shows a clear transition from a high-demand spring regime (averaging ~110 units in Feb/March) to a significantly lower demand regime starting around mid-April. In the last four periods (Periods 9-12), demand has been 22, 31, 18, and 24, resulting in a mean of 23.75 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 109 units, which is ample to cover several periods of this new lower demand regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set L to 'default' (0) and mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current post-spring demand stability while avoiding the influence of the prior March peak.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' (Ankle-length jeans) has transitioned into a lower demand regime following the spring peak. The demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13) has averaged approximately 22.4 units per period (22, 31, 18, 24, 17), a significant drop from the March average (~110). Current inventory is 92 units, which covers over 4 periods of demand at the current rate. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid incurring unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a service level for the current regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the stabilized lower demand. Given the current on-hand inventory of 92, the OR engine will likely not place an order this period, which is appropriate as we draw down existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-spring low demand regime stabilized: Period 9-13 average is 22.4 units/period, down from peak levels; holding current inventory levels to draw down stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a documented low-demand phase following its spring peak. In Period 15 (late May), demand has continued to soften, with the most recent sample at 11 units and the average for the last five periods (Periods 10-14) at 20.2 units. The on-hand inventory of 81 units is more than sufficient to cover this low-demand regime (approximately 4 periods of safety). Actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods as seen in all concluded orders. I will maintain the strategy of drawing down excess inventory by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the current post-peak demand level, which will lead to a low base-stock level and prevent unnecessary ordering while holding costs apply.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Late May (2019/5/27). Demand for 'Ankle-length jeans in washed denim' has transitioned into a low-demand regime following the spring peak. The average demand over the last 7 periods (since Period 9) is approximately 20 units/period (22, 31, 18, 24, 17, 11, 18). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 63 units, which provides over 3 periods of supply at the current consumption rate. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history, allowing for just-in-time replenishment. For Period 16, I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-spring stabilized demand levels and continue drawing down the existing on-hand stock to minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the current low-demand environment.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a pair of skinny ankle jeans. Since late April (Period 11), demand has entered a sustained low-volume regime following the spring peak. The average demand over the last 8 periods (Periods 9-16) is approx. 19.4 units, with the last 5 periods (P12-P16) averaging 16.8 units per period. On-hand inventory is currently 49 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs potential profit of $19.0 (a 95% service level target), the backend's base-stock logic will compare current inventory against the target. With a promised lead time of 0 (consistently observed in history), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to reflect the most recent stabilized demand regime, while using a recent window for sigma to account for the lowered volatility. This will likely result in a small or zero order to further draw down excess stock inherited from the spring peak.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10th. The product (Ladies Skinny Ankle Jeans) is in a low-demand regime following the spring peak. The demand over the last 9 periods (P9-P17) has averaged approximately 18.2 units per period (22, 31, 18, 24, 17, 11, 18, 14, 9), with a clear downward trend recently (averaging 14 units over the last 5 periods). On-hand inventory is 40 units, which covers approximately 2-3 periods of demand. Given the current low volatility and consistent delivery at lead_time 0, I will use a recent window (N=5) to reflect the current cooling demand and avoid overstocking as we enter mid-summer. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is Ankle-length jeans, which saw a peak in demand during the spring (late February through March) and has since stabilized at a much lower level. Looking at the last 10 periods (since Period 9), demand has averaged 17.3 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (Periods 14-18) show an even lower average of 12.2 units per period (11, 18, 14, 9, 9). With on-hand inventory at 31 units and zero units in transit, we currently have roughly 2.5 periods of stock at the current burn rate. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a service level for this low-demand summer phase, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the stabilized low-demand regime, and use the default lead time (0).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P20 (late June). The SKU (Ladies Denim Ankle jeans) has been in a sustained low-demand regime since mid-April (Period 11). Demand has continued to decline further: the average demand of the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is 11 units, and the last 3 periods (P17-P19) average only 7.7 units. The product is likely entering a summer seasonal trough for full-length denim. Current on-hand inventory is 26 units, which at the current rate of ~8 units/period, covers over 3 periods of demand. Since the promised lead time is 0 and consistently observed as 0, there is no need to carry excess inventory. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this lower stabilization point and allow the system to potentially trigger a small replenishment order if the base stock calculation exceeds on-hand, though naturally drawing down stock is preferred given the high holding cost relative to recent demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed: Demand has further declined from the 'post-spring' level (~22) to a new low-stabilization level (~9 units/period) over periods 17-19.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1) follows a stock-out in Period 20 (on-hand is 0). Demand in Period 20 spiked to 37 units after a period of extreme lows (~5-9 units), potentially marking the end of the summer trough or a localized demand surge. Looking at the full history: samples are [19, 46, 48, 62, 85] (pre-game history) and [67, 173, 156, 110, 67, 107, 121, 74, 22, 31, 18, 24, 17, 11, 18, 14, 9, 9, 5, 37] (game history). The 'summer trough' previously noted (Carry-over Period 20) seems to be transitioning. While the last 4 periods (P17-P20) average 15 units, the sudden spike to 37 warrants a slightly more responsive forecast to avoid further lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this recent volatility while respecting the lower average volume compared to spring. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough (avg ~8) ended at Period 20 with a spike to 37 units, indicating a move back toward the higher post-spring baseline or localized volatility.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' (Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans) is showing a significant late-summer demand surge. After a summer trough where demand averaged ~9-11 units, Period 20 jumped to 37 and Period 21 accelerated to 65. The current date is July 8, and this trend likely marks the 'Back to School' or 'Pre-Fall' shopping phase where denim demand typically recovers. Due to stockouts in the last two periods (ending inventory=0), captured demand (65) likely underestimates true demand potential. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture this immediate upward trend (average of 37 and 65 is 51, compared to the previous regime of 9). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, allowing for agile response. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set to reflect this new high-volatility, high-growth regime to minimize lost sales while inventory is currently zero.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Pre-Fall demand surge confirmed starting Period 20: Demand increased from ~9 to an average of 51 units/period (+460%) over the last two weeks.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' (denim trousers). We are currently in mid-July (Period 23). Historical data and carry-over insights confirm a significant demand surge starting at Period 20, aligning with 'Back-to-School' and 'Pre-Fall' shopping patterns for denim. Demand in Period 21 was 65 and surged to 144 in Period 22. My current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts, I need to capture this high-demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent surge (37, 65, 144) most heavily while balancing against the extreme volatility of the most recent data point. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on this recent high-mean, high-variance window.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school denim surge intensified: Period 22 demand reached 144 units, confirming a high-velocity regime for the Pre-Fall season (avg ~82 over P20-P22).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens Denim) has entered a clear high-demand regime, coinciding with late July/August (Back-to-School season). Demand in Period 23 was 107 units, preceded by 144 units and 65 units (average over P21-P23 = 105.3). This confirms the 'Pre-Fall denim surge' identified in carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 67 units with 0 in-transit. To ensure we capture this peak without over-stocking as the surge matures, I will use a recent_N window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's high mean and volatility. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it has been stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school denim surge regime confirmed (P21-P23): Demand average shifted to ~105 units/period compared to the previous summer trough of ~9.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323003 (Ladies Denim) is currently in a 'Back-to-School' high-demand regime that began around Period 20 (late June). Demand peaked in Period 22 (144 units) then moderated to 107 in Period 23 and 46 in Period 24. This pattern suggests we are past the initial peak surge but still in a elevated regime compared to the summer trough (~9 units). Period 24 demand (46) is lower than the previous three weeks, suggesting the 'initial spike' volatility is settling into a more stable high-demand baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this specific regime without being overweight by the summer trough or the extreme peak of P22, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat (P21-P24 average: approx 90.5 units) and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed since the regime shift. This will maintain a safety stock appropriate for high-velocity denim sales in the late July/early August window.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school denim regime settling: Following an initial peak in P22 (144), demand has stabilized at an average of ~90 units/period (P21-P24), significantly higher than the summer trough (~9).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' (Ladies Denim) is currently in a 'Back-to-School' high-demand regime that began around Period 21 (early July). Demand has shown significant volatility during this surge, with a peak of 144 units (P22) followed by a dip to 46 (P24) and a recovery to 80 (P25). The average demand over the last four periods (P22-P25) is approximately 94 units/period. The current date is August 5th, which typically represents the peak of the Back-to-School shopping season for denim. Given on-hand inventory is 83 units and expected demand is around 90-100 units, a moderate order is required to maintain stock. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period high-demand regime (N=4) to capture the current seasonal strength while allowing for the high observed volatility in sigma_hat.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans' is currently in a high-demand Back-to-School/Pre-Fall regime (Date: 2019/8/12). Demand in the last period (P26) surged to 136 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization estimate of ~90 units. History from earlier in the year (March) showed a sustained peak around 107-173 units. Given the current period is mid-August, we expect this high velocity to continue or increase as the fall season approaches. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid the stockouts seen in P21 and P22, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P21-P26) to capture the full breadth of the current surge (mean ~95), and sigma_hat using the same period to account for the high volatility (std ~40). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the immediate expected demand and provides a safety buffer for the recent 130+ unit spikes.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school denim regime peak: Period 26 demand reached 136 units, suggesting the regime average is likely higher than the P21-P24 average (~95 vs ~90) as the season reaches its zenith in mid-August.

LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' (Ladies Denim) is in the middle of a high-demand period associated with the 'Back-to-School' and 'Pre-Fall' seasons. Demand has been consistently strong since Period 21. Recent weekly demand values are: P21=65, P22=144, P23=107, P24=46, P25=80, P26=136, and P27=109. Over the last 7 periods (the current regime), the average demand is 98.1 units. The volatility also remains high. I will use a recent_N of 7 to capture this specific seasonal regime's mean and standard deviation. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are in the peak 'Back-to-School' and 'Pre-Fall' denim season. Demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' jeans has been strong and volatile over the last 8 periods (P21-P28), with a clear high-demand regime established. Recent demand samples are: 65, 144, 107, 46, 80, 136, 109, 151. The mean of these last 8 periods is approximately 104.75 units. Period 28 saw the highest demand of this regime at 151 units, leaving on-hand inventory at only 7 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the full magnitude of this active seasonal peak while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation of these 8 samples is ~37), I will use 'recent_N' for both mean and sigma with N=8. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers the ~105 average plus a safety buffer reflecting the recent variability, preventing stockouts during this critical sales window.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school denim regime peak confirmed: Period 28 demand reached 151 units, raising the regime average (P21-P28) to ~105 units/period, compared to the previously estimated ~95.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Ankle-length jeans' is currently in its peak 'Back-to-School/Fall' demand regime. We are at Period 30 (Sept 2), which typically marks the height or the beginning of a plateau for fall denim sales. Over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), demand has been consistently high: 80, 136, 109, 151, and 116 units, averaging approximately 118 units per period. The carry-over insights previously estimated the regime average at ~105, but recent data suggests it is closer to 115-120. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by recent arrivals. To ensure high service levels during this profitable peak (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the most recent high-velocity demand pattern while maintaining the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Peak back-to-school denim regime confirmed (P25-P29): Average demand has stabilized at ~118 units/period, marginally higher than the P21-P28 estimate of ~105.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in the post-peak phase of the Back-to-School/Pre-Fall denim season. Historically, demand for this SKU surged starting in Period 21 (July), peaking in August (Periods 26-28), and has remained high with an average of approximately 110-120 units per period. Period 30 data (107 units) shows demand is maintaining a strong but steady level as we transition fully into Autumn. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while the regime is stable, I will use a recent window (N=6, covering Periods 25-30) to capture the most representative 'peak-season' mean and variance. This period reflects a mature demand regime after the initial June/July ramp-up. mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will be based on this 6-week window, ensuring we have enough stock (base stock \u2248 mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) to cover the current period's demand without overstocking as we move further into the season.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323003' (Ladies Denim) is currently in the late stages of a sustained back-to-school/pre-fall demand regime. From Period 25 to Period 31, demand has been remarkably stable, with an average of approximately 116 units per period (samples: 80, 136, 109, 151, 116, 107, 112). The most recent period (P31) saw demand of 112, confirming this high-velocity regime is still active. Although the date (Sept 16) suggests we are nearing the end of the peak back-to-school window, there is no evidence yet of a 'cooling' phase similar to what was observed in April (Period 11). Therefore, I will maintain the current forecast using the recent regime data (N=7). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The base stock calculation (mu_hat/sigma_hat) will target a high service level (approx 95% given profit/holding ratio) to prevent stockouts during this high-volume period.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school denim regime stability: From Period 25 to Period 31, demand has stabilized at a high level with a mean of ~116 units/period (compared to the P21-P28 estimate of ~105).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime driven by the Back-to-School and Pre-Fall denim season. Over the last 8 periods (P25-P32), demand has stabilized with a mean of approximately 114 units/period and a standard deviation of 22 units. The current date (Sept 23) is past the initial August peak but remains in the high-velocity Fall window. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods to capture this stabilized high-demand regime (N=8). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for immediate replenishment. My parameters aim to maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), which justifies keeping a base stock sufficient to cover the 114 unit average plus a safety buffer.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323003 (Denim Trousers) is currently in its peak 'Back-to-School/Pre-Fall' regime, which started around Period 21. A review of the last 9 periods (P25-P33) shows remarkably stable high demand with a mean of 118.0 units and a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. Period 33 demand spiked to 147, which is at the upper end of this regime's volatility but consistent with late-September peaks often seen in denim before shifting to winter trends. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (3 units), requiring a full replenishment to the base stock level. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture this stable, high-demand regime for both mean and volatility, ensuring the target inventory covers the immediate upcoming demand period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' (denim) remains in a high-velocity 'Back-to-School/Fall' regime that started around Period 21 (July). Over the recent 10 periods (P25-P34), demand has stabilized with a mean of approximately 117.4 units per period (sum=1174). The most recent demand (P34) was 87, but the preceding week (P33) was 147, indicating continued high volatility within this regime rather than a definitive 'cooling' shift. Given the product type (year-round denim staple) and current date (early October), we expect this level of demand to persist into the autumn season. The lead time remains consistently 0. I am choosing N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable high-demand regime while smoothing out the significant weekly fluctuations observed (range of 80 to 151).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Fall denim regime remains stable through Period 34: average demand from P25-P34 is ~117 units/period, confirming a sustained high-velocity period following the summer trough.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' denim is currently in a sustained high-demand regime associated with the Back-to-school and Fall seasons. Since Period 25 (August 2019), demand has remained robust and relatively stable. Analysis of the last 11 periods (P25-P35) shows a mean weekly demand of approximately 112 units (sum: 1230, N=11). The most recent standard deviation for this period is approximately 23. This regime is significantly more stable than the initial surge observed in July. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain the inventory buffer for this high-velocity period while respecting the backend's base-stock logic, I will use a recent_N strategy for both demand and volatility targeting the last 11 periods (N=11) to capture this specific seasonal regime.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Fall denim regime average (P25-P35) stabilized at ~112 units/period with continued high velocity into October.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Ankle-length jeans) is currently in a sustained Fall/Back-to-school demand regime. Analyzing the most recent data (Period 25 to 36), the demand has averaged approximately 111.4 units per period. Specifically, the last three weeks (P34-P36) show a slight cooling trend (87, 82, 63) compared to the mid-September peaks, but remain within the high-velocity range. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (L=0, so 1+L=1 period of demand) with sufficient safety stock (z-score for 95% service level is ~1.645). Given the recent slight decline, using N=12 for mu_hat captures the full stability of the current Fall regime (since Period 25), while N=12 for sigma_hat captures the seasonal volatility. The realized lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October (Period 38). Historically, the 'back-to-school/Fall' denim regime has been the dominant driver since Period 25. While demand remains relatively high compared to summer, there is a slight decelerating trend observed over the last three periods (82, 63, 81). The average demand from Period 25 to Period 37 is approximately 106 units per period. However, given the most recent three periods average ~75 units, a 'recent_N' approach with N=13 (covering the high-velocity fall window) for mu_hat will capture the stabilized seasonal average (~106) while sigma_hat will reflect the volatility seen across that same period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' is entering early November. Historically, the back-to-school/fall peak identified from Period 25 through Period 35 (avg ~112) is beginning to soften as we transition into late autumn. Demand in the most recent periods (P34-P38) has averaged approximately 77 units (87, 82, 63, 81, 72), indicating a decline from the ~110+ levels seen in September. I am setting N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the z-score. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 39: Demand has stabilized at a lower late-autumn level (avg ~77 units/period over P34-P38), down from the peak Fall/Back-to-school average of ~112.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens - Denim) is transitioning from its high-velocity Fall/Back-to-school peak into a lower late-autumn regime. Period 39 observed a demand of 46 units, following a period of 72. This confirms the 'late-autumn cooling' insight from Period 39. The average demand across the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 68.8 units, while the very recent 2-week average (P38-P39) is 59 units. To avoid overstocking during this downward trend, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 5-period window (N=5) to capture the cooling trend while maintaining enough safety stock for the high-margin ($19 profit) item. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 47 units, which is nearly one full week of 'new regime' demand.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn cooling sustained: Period 38-39 demand average dropped to ~59 units/period, confirming the shift away from the ~112 units/period peak seen in early October. Mid-November seasonality for denim typically sees a stabilization before any holiday uplift.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' denim has clearly transitioned from the high-velocity back-to-school/early-autumn peak (~112 units/period) to a significantly lower late-autumn regime. The last two periods (P39-P40) show a continued decline with demand at 46 and 38 units respectively, averaging 42 units/period. This aligns with mid-November seasonality where denim sales typically cool before any potential holiday uplift. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this cooling phase, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use the most recent 3 periods (P38-P40) to better capture the current stabilization point (average ~52 units/period), as the previous 'recent_N' or 'default' methods would be heavily skewed by the high-demand October samples.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand cooling confirmed (P38-P40): Average demand has stabilized at ~52 units/period, down from the ~112 units/period peak seen in September/October.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' denim has completed its autumn cooling phase and is stabilizing at a lower late-season level. Over the last four periods (P38-P41), demand has been 72, 46, 38, and 37 respectively. The average of the most recent three periods (P39-P41) is 40.33 units, confirming the 'Late-autumn cooling' identified in previous carry-over insights. As of late November (P42), we are approaching the end of the game (P47) and there is no strong evidence yet for a significant Black Friday/Holiday uplift in this specific SKU's category based on the recent downward trend. I will set the demand parameters using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this stabilized lower regime (avg ~48, down from the peak of ~112). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn stabilization confirmed: Average demand for P39-P41 is ~40 units/period, establishing a consistent post-peak baseline for the remainder of November.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Ladies Denim' (Skinny High Waist Jeans). Period 43 (Dec 2) marks the beginning of the holiday shopping season. While the previous regime (P39-P41) stabilized at a lower mean of ~40, the most recent demand in P42 surged to 85, indicating the start of a December holiday uplift. Historical data from early 2019 shows demand can exceed 100 units during peak transitions. I am shifting the mu_hat forecast to account for this uplift by transitioning from the 'late-autumn cooling' regime back toward a higher 'holiday/winter' expectation. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the recent lift (46, 38, 37, 85), and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to incorporate the increased volatility seen during these seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand uplift detected at Period 42: Demand surged to 85 units from a previous post-autumn baseline of ~40, indicating the start of December retail seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in the peak holiday shopping season (December). Period 42 saw a significant demand surge to 85 units, signaling the start of the holiday uplift. While Period 43 demand dropped back to 47, we must anticipate continued volatility or further surges as we approach mid-December (Period 44 and 45). The current on-hand inventory is 58 units with no in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0, we can react quickly, but to avoid lost sales during potential peak weeks, I will set mu_hat to capture the recent holiday behavior while allowing for higher volatility (explicit sigma). I will use a window of the last 2 periods (P42, P43) to average the holiday start, resulting in an estimated mean of (85+47)/2 = 66. To be conservative against spikes like Period 42, I'll set mu_hat to 70 and increase sigma_hat to reflect the holiday variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Holiday demand uplift confirmed but volatile; Period 42-43 average is ~66 units/period, compared to the November baseline of ~40.

636323003: ordered=62, arrived=62 units (ordered on Period 44, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=120, demand=29, sold=29, ending on-hand inventory=91
Daily Profit: $551.00, Daily Holding Cost: $91.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the December holiday season (Date: 2019/12/16). Recent demand has been volatile: P42 (85), P43 (47), and P44 (29). The 'Holiday demand uplift' noted in previous periods appears to have peaked or is experiencing a mid-month dip before potentially rising again for the final week of the year. The current on-hand inventory is 91 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To account for potential late-holiday demand while avoiding excessive leftovers at the end of the year (only 3 periods remaining in the game), I will use a recent_N calculation for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3. This captures the active holiday regime (P42-P44) where the average demand is approximately 53.7 units, which is higher than the late-autumn baseline but accounts for the recent downward trend from the P42 peak.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peaked at P42 (85 units) and has since decelerated (P43: 47, P44: 29), suggesting a short-lived or front-loaded December spike for this denim SKU.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). Historical demand for this denim SKU shows a distinct seasonal pattern: a back-to-school/Autumn peak (P25-P35 avg ~112) followed by a late-autumn cooling (P39-P41 avg ~40). While Period 42 saw a holiday spike to 85, demand has since decelerated significantly over the last three periods (P43: 47, P44: 29, P45: 26), suggesting the holiday peak for this specific item was front-loaded in early December. With on-hand inventory at 75 units and the recent demand average (P44-P45) at 27.5 units/period, the current stock covers approximately 2.7 periods of demand. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (avg ~34) to reflect the deceleration into the final week of December and the likely early-January lull. Sigma_hat will use the same window to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand deceleration confirmed: After a peak in P42 (85), demand has declined for three consecutive periods (47, 29, 26), suggesting a return to the post-autumn baseline or lower for the year-end transition.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019, which is the final week of the year. Demand for this denim SKU has entered a post-holiday trough. Following the early December peak of 85 units (P42), demand has declined significantly over four consecutive periods: 47, 29, 26, and finally 13 units in P46. This confirmation of a 'deceleration cycle' signals a return to at or below the late-autumn baseline (~40 units). With current on-hand inventory at 62 units and the most recent demand being 13, the SKU is currently overstocked for the expected low-velocity period in early January. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent window of 4 periods (P43-P46 = 28.75 avg) to proactively adjust down from the higher annual and mid-regime averages, while allowing the OR backend to draw down the existing 62 units of stock with minimal new ordering. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand trough confirmed: Demand has declined for four consecutive periods (P43-P46) from 85 to 13 units, signaling a transition to a low-velocity year-end/early-January regime.
