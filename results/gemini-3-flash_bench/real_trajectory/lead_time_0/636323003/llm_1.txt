Historical demand shows a clear upward trend from January into February (19, 46, 48, 62, 85), indicating a transition from post-holiday lows into the spring fashion season. For the current date (Feb 11), we are moving into the mid-February peak and approaching Valentine's Day/early spring shopping. Promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival). My goal is to cover Period 1 demand and establish a buffer. Given the recent demand of 85 units and the strong growth trend (+20-30 units per week recently), I forecast Period 1 demand at approximately 100-110 units. Since on-hand is 0, I will order 130 units to satisfy immediate demand and build a small safety stock for the continuing upward trend.",

Historically (late Jan/early Feb), demand was in the 40-80 range before the initial spring peak in February.

Looking at the history, demand was high throughout February (P2: 173, P3: 156) and March (P4: 110, P7: 121), which aligns with the start of the spring fashion season. However, P8 (74) and P9 (22) indicate a sharp, unexpected decrease in demand as we enter mid-April. This sudden drop might be a volatility outlier or a signal that the initial spring rush for this specific SKU has peaked. Given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the risk of lost sales is more severe than the cost of excess inventory. However, with 109 units already on-hand and recent demand dropping to 22, I must avoid aggressive overstocking. I will forecast a 'safety' demand level of approximately 60 units (halfway between the recent low and the early-April average) to hedge against a potential rebound. Since Lead Time = 0, the order calculates as: Expected Demand (60) - On-hand (109) = -49.
