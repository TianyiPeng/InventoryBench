Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a steady range between 145 and 196, with a five-week average of approximately 173 units. Looking at the calendar, mid-February is the start of the spring fashion season where corporate/tailored wear often sees consistent demand. As this is Period 1, I need to establish a baseline stock. Promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive in the current period to satisfy this week's demand. To cover the current period's expected demand (~173) plus a safety buffer for the high end of historical variance (~200) and prepare for next week, I will order 200 units. Since current on-hand and in-transit are both 0, this order will be the primary source for satisfying Period 1 demand.",

The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). I need to forecast demand for Period 3 (Feb 25) which is entering the peak spring retail window. Given the growth from 227 to 284 (~25% increase), I expect demand to be around 320-350.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in Period 47 (Dec 30). Historical data and recent trends show that professional tailoring demand drops significantly during the late December holiday period. In Period 46 (Dec 23), demand was 128, down from the mid-December recovery of ~260-300. Period 47 (Dec 30) is expected to follow this low-demand holiday regime before potentially rebounding in January as customers refresh work wardrobes. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Starting on-hand inventory is 114 units. Given this is the final period for which I am making a decision (Period 47 out of 47) and the current on-hand inventory of 114 already covers the likely holiday/New Year's Eve demand (consistent with the P46 result of 128), I will place a conservative order to ensure availability for any minor New Year's spike without incurring excessive holding costs on the final inventory balance. An order of 50 units brings total availability to 164, providing a safe buffer above the most recent demand observation.",
