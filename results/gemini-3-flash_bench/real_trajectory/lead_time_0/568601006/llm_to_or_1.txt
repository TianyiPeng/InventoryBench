Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 568601006 is a 'Mariette Blazer', which is a 'Womens Tailoring' item. Analysis of the 5 historical samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows demand ranging from 145 to 196, with a mean of 173.4 and a standard deviation of 19.8. There is a slight upward trend in the early historical data, likely reflecting the transition into the spring shopping season for office wear/tailoring. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now should arrive within the same period. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, we must order to cover the current period's expected demand plus a safety margin. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available history) to capture the current demand level, as it better reflects the recent volume than a longer-term average might (though here they are the same).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', which is a tailored women's item. Historical data (Jan to early Feb) showed demand ranging from 145 to 196 (avg ~173). In Period 1, actual demand was 227, which exceeded the on-hand inventory of 191 (ordered in Period 1 and arrived same-period due to L=0), resulting in 0 ending inventory and lost sales. The transition from early February to mid-February shows a demand uptick, possibly due to spring season preparation or professional wardrobe updates. With a promised lead time of 0 and confirmation of actual lead time being 0 in Period 1, I will use lead time 0. To capture the recent demand surge and ensure sufficient service level for this profitable item ($4 profit vs $1 holding), I will use the mean of the last 4 periods (including Period 1's 227) which is (179+196+186+227)/4 = 197. Given the high Period 1 demand, I'll set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*197 = 197 to avoid stockouts while maintaining a lean inventory. The standard deviation will be set to explicitly cover the recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', a professional women's garment. Current data shows a significant demand trend: historical samples (Jan/early Feb) averaged 173.4 units, but Period 1 (Feb 11) saw demand of 227 (stockout) and Period 2 (Feb 18) saw demand of 284 (stockout). This upward trend correlates with the transition into spring/pre-Easter business attire demand. I am currently holding 0 inventory due to these stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 is being met (orders arrive same-period). To capture the recent demand surge and mitigate further stockouts, I will use recent_N=2 to weight the February peak more heavily. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 300 (per period, so 300 for L=0) to account for the latent demand missed during stockouts and the continuing upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 11 (Period 1): Average jumped from ~173 to >250 (+44%). High stockout risk; existing demand samples likely underestimate true latent demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a high-demand phase following a regime shift in mid-February. History shows that in Periods 1 and 2, demand significantly exceeded expectations (227 and 284 units), leading to stockouts despite lead time being 0. Period 3 demand settled at 198, but the average across the recent 3-period regime is approximately 236 units per week. Given the product is a 'Womens Tailoring Blazer' in early March, we are entering the Spring retail season, making sustained demand likely. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to set parameters that maintain a base stock high enough to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1/unit holding cost. I will use the recent 3 periods (the new regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the pre-February data (avg ~173) is now obsolete and would pull the forecast too low. L is kept at default (0).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer', a seasonal women's tailoring item. Period 5 is March 11, moving into the peak spring fashion season. Historical samples (Jan) averaged 173, but since Feb 11 (Period 1), demand has spiked and fluctuated significantly: 227 (stockout), 284 (stockout), 198, and 214. The 'carry-over insight' correctly identified a regime shift. Average demand over the last 4 periods is 230.75. Given the stockouts in P1 and P2, latent demand is likely higher than observed sales. I will target a mean demand of 240. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent arrives in the same period (L=0) are confirmed by history. I'll use recent_N (N=4) for sigma to capture the current volatility while explicitly setting mu_hat for the (1+L) period to reflect the spring demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $803.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a higher demand regime compared to the pre-February period. Demand in Periods 1-5 averaged 227.6 units, significantly higher than the initial samples (~172). Observed demand in the last three periods (P3-P5) has stabilized somewhat (198, 214, 215), averaging 209 units. Since the promised lead time is 0 and history confirms actual lead time is consistently 0, the OR engine needs to cover one period of demand (L+1=1). Profit ($4) vs Holding Cost ($1) suggests a target service level of 80% (z\u22480.84). Current on-hand is 57. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma to capture this new stabilized regime while ignoring the pre-February data, ensuring we maintain enough stock for typical weekly fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Feb 11 shift: Recent 3-period average is 209 units (standard deviation ~9.5), down from the initial burst in P1-P2 but 20% higher than pre-February levels.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25. Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear shift starting February 11. Initial demand spiked (227, 284), likely due to early spring office wardrobe updates, but has since stabilized around 215 units over the last three periods (P4: 214, P5: 215, P6: 215). The standard deviation in this stabilized regime is extremely low (<1 unit). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time = 0). Since the product is a blazer, demand is expected to remain steady or slightly increase as spring progresses. To minimize holding costs while meeting this very consistent demand, I will use recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-stability regime (mean \u2248 215), effectively targeting a base stock that covers the 215 expected units for Period 7 plus a small safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at ~215 units/week from Period 4 to Period 6 with near-zero variance; previous high-volatility regime (P1-P3) is no longer representative.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' is a blazer, a seasonal item that typically sees demand shifts during spring transitions. Current history shows lead time has consistently been 0 periods. After a surge in Period 1 and 2 (avg ~255), demand stabilized between Periods 4-6 at exactly 215 units, before dropping to 186 in Period 7 (2019-03-25). This drop might signal the end of the early spring office-wear peak or a temporary dip. On-hand inventory is low (30 units). Given the transition into April, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent stabilized regime (Periods 4-7) for mu_hat, which averages 207.5. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility seen recently but still account for the Period 7 shift. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for high-profit items while reacting to the recent volume decrease to avoid excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand transitioned from a high-plateau (215 units/period) to a lower level (186 units) starting Period 7 (late March).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a women's blazer ('Mariette Blazer'). We are currently in early April (Period 9: 2019/4/8). Historical demand shows several distinct phases: an initial surge in Feb (P1-P2: ~255 avg), a plateau in March (P4-P6: 215 units), followed by a dip in late March (P7: 186 units), and a sharp rebound last period (P8: 249 units). The P8 surge likely reflects spring seasonality as customers refresh office/tailored wardrobes for warmer weather. Current inventory is 0 (stockout in P8). Lead time (L) has consistently been 0. To capture the recent spike without overreacting to possible March fluctuations, I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat (avg of P6-P8: 216.6) and sigma_hat. Using N=3 (P6=215, P7=186, P8=249) appropriately captures the current rebound and volatility while supporting the 80% target service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand rebound confirmed: April 1st (Period 8) demand surged to 249 units (+34% from P7), suggesting a move past the late-March lull.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15. The product is a 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring), which typically sees demand spikes in early spring (April) for professional/social events. Historically, we saw a surge in Period 8 (April 1) to 249 units, followed by a drop in Period 9 (April 8) to 178 units. This volatility is characteristic of the spring season. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), so L=0 is appropriate. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), the last two weeks (249 and 178) average 213.5 units. Given the seasonality and the Carry-Over Insight regarding a 'spring demand rebound', I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture this higher mean while acknowledging the recent dip. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility observed since mid-March compared to the static 'plateau' phase in early March.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in April: following a surge to 249 (P8), demand normalized to 178 (P9). Avg of last 2 weeks (213.5) is more representative of the current spring regime than historical averages.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (April 15), demand dropped significantly to 130 units, down from 178 (P9) and 249 (P8). This suggests the late April/post-Easter period is seeing a lull in blazer sales. The current on-hand inventory is 108 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 100% reliable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To avoid overstocking during this apparent downward trend while maintaining a base level of service, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P8-P10, mean ~185.6) to capture the recent deceleration, rather than the long-term or high-spike averages. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to reflect current volatility (std ~60), ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the recent high variance in April demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed in late April: Period 10 demand fell to 130 units, marking a 27% decrease from Period 9 (178) and a 48% decrease from the Period 8 peak (249).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29 (Period 12). Demand for the Mariette Blazer has decelerated significantly over the last two periods, dropping from a spring peak of 249 (P8) and 178 (P9) to 130 (P10) and 127 (P11). This suggests a cooling demand regime as we move into late spring/early summer for this specific tailored blazer. The average demand of the last two periods (128.5) is much more representative of the current trend than the volatile April average. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying holding safety stock for about 80% service level. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since on-hand inventory is 110, and my target base stock will be slightly higher than the recent 128.5 average (once accounting for variance), I will use N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the recent downward trend while maintaining enough buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a lower level: Late April (P10-P11) demand has settled around 127-130 units, a ~48% decrease from the early April peak of 249.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (April 29), demand surged unexpectedly to 191 units from a previous low plateau of ~128. This represents a 50% increase in demand compared to the last two periods, causing a stockout (on-hand 0). This volatility aligns with the 'Mariette Blazer' seasonality, where May typically sees a rise in demand for women's tailoring/blazers due to spring business attire or events. Given this shift, I am moving away from the 'low level' regime observed in late April. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent volatility and the demand jump while excluding the extreme late-March/early-April peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: End-of-April demand spiked to 191 units (+50% vs P10-11 avg of 128.5), ending the late-April lull and signaling a potential May seasonal upturn.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13, 2019. The product is a women's blazer, which typically exhibits seasonality. Looking at the recent demand history: Period 12 saw a spike to 191 units (though sales were capped at 170 due to inventory), and Period 13 saw 160 units. This follows a late-April lull (P10-11 at ~128 units). The 'Mariette Blazer' is a 'Dressed/Womens Tailoring' item, which often sees demand during mid-spring graduation and wedding seasons. The last two periods (P12-13) average approximately 175 units (uncalculating the stockout at P12, the latent demand was likely higher). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 13 concluded periods. I am setting L to 'default' (0) and using a recent_N of 2 for mu_hat to capture the current May demand regime (avg ~175.5), while using recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed throughout April and May. This configuration helps the OR backend target a service level appropriate for a $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical ratio 0.8) while reacting to the recent seasonal upturn.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime: Following the late-April lull, demand in May (P12-13) has returned to a higher average of ~175 units, consistent with seasonal tailoring peaks.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees sustained demand during spring. Looking at the recent history, a new demand regime emerged starting Period 12 (late April), moving away from the late-April lull (127-130 units). Demand for the last three periods (P12-P14) has been 191, 160, and 196, averaging 182.3 units. This aligns with the 'May demand regime' noted in carry-over insights. Stockout occurred in P12 due to under-ordering, and ending inventory is currently very low (4 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stabilized 'May regime' while ignoring the lower late-April figures. This will set a base stock level sufficient to handle the current 180+ unit pace and prevent stockouts given the minimal on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime stabilized: Periods 12-14 show an average demand of 182 units (range 160-196), confirming a recovery from the late-April 130-unit floor.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a women's blazer, which typically shows seasonal demand fluctuations. Over the last four periods (P12-P15), demand has been 191, 160, 196, and 143, averaging 172.5 units per period. The recent drop to 143 in P15 suggests the high mid-May peak may be cooling off as we enter late May/early June. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for seasonal variability, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current May regime (average ~172.5). For sigma_hat, I will use the recent volatility (N=4) to account for the fluctuations seen recently (143 to 196 range).

Carry-over insight: May demand regime concluded with an average of ~173 units (P12-P15), showing higher volatility than the April lull but lower than the early spring peak.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, marking the start of a new month. Historically, the 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring) has shown a demand recovery in May after an April lull, stabilizing around 165-170 units. The most recent demand (P16) was 168 units. Given the transition into June, I expect demand to remain in this stable regime or potentially see a minor seasonal shift. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history. The ending inventory of 26 units is low, so I need to set parameters to ensure availability for the current period's demand. I'll use a recent window (N=5) to capture the May stabilization (average ~171.6) while excluding the deeper April volatility. Setting L to 0 (promised) and using N=5 for both mu and sigma will allow the OR backend to target this recent stable regime effectively.

Carry-over insight: June transition: Demand has stabilized into a May average of ~172 units following the April volatility. Last 5 periods (P12-P16) average 171.6 units, compared to the wider spring variation.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 10, 2019. In Period 17 (June 3), demand dropped significantly to 118 units, compared to the May average of ~172. This follows a high inventory position from the previous order. The product is a women's blazer (tailoring), which remains relevant but may be entering a mid-summer lull or stabilized lower demand regime after the spring peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will adjust the demand forecast to reflect this recent downturn by using a shorter window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the potential downward shift (averaging P15-P17: (143+168+118)/3 \u2248 143), while using a slightly longer window (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen throughout May and early June.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: June demand started at 118 units, a 30% decrease from the May average of 172 units, potentially signaling a summer seasonal slowdown for tailoring.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, demand was 139 units, which is a slight recovery from Period 17's 118 units, but still significantly lower than the May average of ~172 units. The current 2-week average is ~128.5 units. This confirms the summer seasonal slowdown noted in the previous carry-over insight. Given the product is a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer, demand typically cools during warmer summer months (June/July). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels, I will base mu_hat on the most recent 2-period regime (N=2) to capture the current lower demand level accurately. Sigma_hat will also use N=2 to reflect the recent localized volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Period 17 and 18 show a sustained decrease in demand (avg 128.5) compared to the May average of 172 units (-25% shift).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The 'Summer demand regime' identified in the carry-over insights is well-established. Over the last three periods (P17-P19), demand has been 118, 139, and 122 respectively, resulting in a stable mean of 126.3 with a standard deviation of approximately 11.2. This represents a significant and sustained drop from the May average of ~172. The promised lead time of 0 remains accurate as per the 'conclude' messages, which show orders arriving in the same period they were placed. I will use recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to align specifically with this lower summer plateau, ensuring we don't over-order based on the busier spring season while maintaining a 0.8 service level (profit/(profit+holding)).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of July 1st (Period 21), we are firmly in a summer seasonal slowdown for this blazer SKU. Demand has dropped from May averages of ~172 units to a much lower level. Looking at the last 4 periods (P17-P20), demand has been 118, 139, 122, and 73 units. The most recent observation (73) is particularly low, marking a 40% drop from the previous week. This suggests a potential deep-summer lull in tailoring demand. To calculate mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture this summer descent (average ~113 units). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to reflect the recently increased volatility (73 to 139 units range), which ensures a safer base stock level against sporadic spikes. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: July retail period started with a significant demand drop to 73 units, a 40% decrease from the late-June average of ~126 units, confirming a deep summer seasonal lull.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, reflecting a deep summer seasonal lull for the 'Mariette Blazer'. Analysis of the recent history confirms a significant demand drop: the last five periods (P17-P21) have an average demand of 113.6 units, compared to the May average of ~172 units. The most recent period (P21) saw a demand of 116 units, recovering slightly from P20's low of 73, but still far below spring levels. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time remains 0), I will set L to 'default'. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this summer regime (averaging 113.6 units per period). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility within this lower-demand period, allowing the OR backend to maintain an appropriate service level while minimizing holding costs on a declining seasonal item.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P17-P21) average confirmed at 113.6 units, a ~34% reduction from the May average of 172 units. Recent volatility (StDev ~25) is higher than the stable June plateau.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical data for this 'Womens Tailoring' item (SKU 568601006) confirms a deep summer seasonal lull. Demand has transitioned from a May average of ~172 units to a summer average (P17-P22) of 114.7 units. The most recent demand samples are 73, 116, and 120, showing some recovery from the early July floor but remaining significantly lower than spring peaks. On-hand inventory is very low at 15 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while respecting the current lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (the start of the summer transition in June) to capture this lower average of ~115 units per period. I will use the same window for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed during this transition (stdev ~24).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is currently in a stable summer demand regime (July). Looking at the history, demand has plateaued significantly since Period 21. Specifically, the last three periods (P21, P22, P23) have shown remarkably consistent demand values of 116, 120, and 120 units respectively (Average = 118.7, Std Dev = 2.3). This represents a clear stabilization following the high volatility observed in late June (P20 demand was only 73). Period 24 (July 22nd) is within this late summer period where tailoring demand typically remains suppressed compared to spring. Given the high stability (low variance) of the last 3 samples, I will use a recent_N approach with N=3 to capture the current mean and the significantly reduced volatility. This will prevent over-ordering based on the higher variance observed in previous months (June/May). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued in late July: Periods 21-23 show a highly stable regime with an average of 118.7 units and minimal variance (StDev < 3), confirming the end of early-summer volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $194.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a late-summer lull, characterized by significant volatility. After a stable plateau of ~119 units in Periods 21-23, Period 24 demand plummeted to 63 units, a 47% drop. This matches the pattern seen in Period 20 (73 units) and suggests we are in a low-demand, high-variance regime as we approach August. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs during this downturn, I will use a recent_N method focused on the last 4 periods (P21-P24) to capture this lower average (~105 units) and accurately reflect the increased volatility in the sigma calculation. This ensures we don't over-order based on the earlier June/July plateau while still maintaining enough stock for periodic spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in late July: following a stable period (avg 119), Period 24 demand dropped to 63 units. Current 4-period average (P21-P24) is 104.75 units with significantly higher variance than the mid-July plateau.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is August 5th (Period 26). Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Demand is currently in a summer seasonal lull for this product (Mariette Blazer). After a very stable period in mid-July (avg ~119), demand surged and dipped (63, then 94), indicating increased volatility at a lower overall level. The last 5 periods (P21-P25) have a mean demand of 102.6 units. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach to capture this specific summer-regime mean and volatility, which provides a more accurate base stock for the current lower-demand environment than the long-term history or the previous May peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P21-P25) stabilized at a lower mean of 102.6 units, reflecting a seasonal lull for tailoring products compared to the May average of 172 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has shown a significant rebound at the start of August. Period 26 demand spiked to 146 units, a 55% increase over the previous week and 42% higher than the recent 5-period average (P21-P25) of 102.6. This likely signals the start of the 'Pre-Fall' shopping season, where consumers begin purchasing tailoring and light outerwear. Given that the system stocked out in Period 26 (sold 124, demand 146), the current on-hand inventory is 0. With a promised and historical lead time of 0 periods, I must ensure inventory covers the immediate shift. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the immediate surge while acknowledging the low July floor, and using an explicit sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed during seasonal transitions. This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock to meet the increasing demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: August demand started at 146 units, a 55% increase from Period 25 (94) and 42% above the July average (102.6), signaling the start of the Pre-Fall seasonal rebound for tailoring.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring) has entered a significant upward regime shift correlating with the late August/Pre-Fall retail season. Following the July/early August lull (avg ~100), demand surged to 146 in Period 26 and doubled again to 301 in Period 27. This represents a clear seasonal rebound as customers return to work/school and update wardrobes for autumn. My previous order of 140 was completely sold out, resulting in a stockout. To capture this sustained momentum and prevent further lost sales, I am increasing mu_hat using a recent 2-period window (avg 223.5) to capture the current spike, while setting L to 'calculate' as historical lead times consistently show 0 periods. I am resetting on-hand to 0 and aiming to cover the expected high volume for the upcoming week.

Carry-over insight: Significant Pre-Fall seasonal surge confirmed: Period 27 demand reached 301 units, a 106% increase from Period 26 (146) and 200% above the July average (~100).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019 (Period 29). We are in the midst of a significant Pre-Fall seasonal rebound for 'Womens Tailoring'. After a deep summer lull (July avg ~100), demand surged to 146 (P26), peaked at 301 (P27), and remained high at 251 (P28). This confirms a sustained high-demand regime as customers prepare for the autumn season. The average demand across these last three weeks is ~233 units. Given the previous peak of 301, the OR backend's safety stock calculation needs to account for this recent high volatility (StDev ~79 over last 3 periods) to prevent stockouts during this critical window. On-hand inventory is currently low (65), meaning we need to order aggressively to cover the anticipated continuation of this high-demand stage. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Fall demand regime confirmed (P26-P28): Demand has shifted from a summer average of ~100 units to a sustained high average of 232.7 units (range 146-301), signaling the peak seasonal window for blazers.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has successfully entered a Pre-Fall peak as of late August (Period 26+). The most recent four periods (P26-P29) show demand figures of 146, 301, 251, and 231, resulting in a regime average of 232.25 units. This is a dramatic increase from the summer lull average of ~103 units. The stockout in P27 indicates that the actual latent demand during this peak can exceed 300 units. To maintain high service levels during this crucial seasonal window, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new elevated mean of ~232. Based on the high volatility observed in the transition (StDev ~65), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 65 to ensure the safety stock is sufficient to prevent further stockouts. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a significant Pre-Fall peak. Recent demand values are 301 (P27), 251 (P28), 231 (P29), and 357 (P30). The stockout in Period 30 (sold 287 out of 357 demand) underscores that the current mean is likely higher than the last 4-period average. We are currently in early September (2019-09-09), which is prime season for women's tailoring. The confirmed Pre-Fall regime shift (P26-P30) shows an average demand of 257.2 units, but the most recent pulse (P30) at 357 suggests manual adjustment is necessary to avoid persistent stockouts. I will set mu_hat to 320 to reflect this upward seasonal momentum while being mindful of the capping logic. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal peak confirmed: Period 30 demand reached 357 units, a 54% increase over the P26-P29 average (232), indicating the strongest phase of the Pre-Fall tailoring season.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak of the September seasonal period (Pre-Fall tailoring). Period 31 demand was 328 units, and Period 30 reached 357. The current demand regime (P27-P31) shows a significant step-up from summer lows, with an average of 293.6 units per week. Although lead time is promised at 0, the backend caps inventory based on historical statistics. Since the most recent demand is consistently above 300 units, I'm using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime specifically. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current September peak rather than being diluted by the low-demand July/August samples.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (P30-P31) maintains a peak level above 320 units, confirming the strongest seasonal phase observed to date for this blazer.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in its peak Pre-Fall/September tailoring season. Period 32 demand was 341 units, continuing a sustained peak regime where demand has exceeded 320 units for the last three periods (P30: 357, P31: 328, P32: 341). This confirms the September seasonal peak identified in earlier carry-overs. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 32 due to strong demand outstripping stock. To maximize profit during this high-demand window, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this specific peak average (approx. 342 units per period). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility within this peak window. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a high service level, ensuring we capture the remaining seasonal demand while minimizing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: September peak demand regime (P30-P32) confirmed: Average demand is 342 units, a significant increase from the August average of 232 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its peak seasonal window. Period 33 witnessed a massive demand surge to 612 units, which is nearly double the average of the previous 'September peak' regime (~342 units). This spike is likely driven by a specific late-September/early-October retail event or the final transition into the Fall/Winter season. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the stockout in Period 33 where 612 units were demanded but only 355 were available. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this surge and prevent further stockouts while recognizing it might be an outlier or the start of a hyper-peak, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. Given the jump from ~340 to 612, a conservative but responsive estimate is 550 units. High volatility is expected as demand hits these ceilings, so I will set sigma_hat explicitly to 100 to ensure a robust safety stock via the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-peak detected at Period 33: Demand surged to 612 units, a 79% increase over the previous September peak average (342) and a 160% increase over the August average (232).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its peak fall season. In Period 33, we saw a hyper-peak of 612 units, followed by a regression to 313 units in Period 34. This suggests that while demand remains high (consistent with late September/early October tailoring seasonality), the 600+ spike may have been an outlier or a concentrated bulk purchase. The current average of the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 390 units, which more accurately captures the September-October peak regime than a longer-term average. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (approx 390) and the lead time of 0 (calculation: (1+0)*390 = 390). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the significant volatility observed during this hyper-peak window without over-penalizing the base stock for the rest of the season.

Carry-over insight: Post-hyper-peak stabilization: After the 612-unit surge in Period 33, demand returned to 313 units in Period 34. The current peak-season average (P30-P34) is approximately 390 units per period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 36 (mid-October). The 'Mariette Blazer' is in its peak/late-peak seasonal window. After a hyper-peak in P33 (612 units), demand has stabilized over the last two weeks (P34: 313, P35: 283). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 375.4 units, which reflects the current September-October peak regime more accurately than the long-term history. The on-hand inventory is 213 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts in this high-demand phase while managing holding costs, I am targeting a base stock level that covers the expected demand plus a small buffer. Using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat captures the current regime (avg 375.4), and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat captures the recent high volatility (StDev ~135) caused by the P33 spike.

Carry-over insight: Mid-October demand (P34-P35) has stabilized at an average of 298 units after the September hyper-peak, suggesting a high-level plateau for the women's tailoring peak season.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized at a high-level plateau following the September hyper-peak. The last three periods (P34-P36) show remarkably consistent demand of 313, 283, and 282 units (average ~293 units). This indicates we have moved past the extreme volatility of late September (612 units) into a steady mid-October tailoring peak. My current on-hand inventory is 207 units, which is below one week's expected demand. Given the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, I need to ensure the order this period, combined with current stock, covers the expected demand for Period 37. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture this stable plateau (N=3 reflects the post-hyper-peak regime). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the current low volatility, which prevents over-ordering due to the outlier in P33. L remains at 0.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its peak fall tailoring season. Demand has been consistently strong throughout October, with the last four periods (P34-P37) averaging 297.75 units. Despite high order quantities, we ended Period 37 with 0 on-hand inventory due to demand (313) slightly exceeding available stock (308). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maximize reward while avoiding stockouts during this high-demand window, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the current plateau (approx 298 units/period). I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 20 to account for recent demand stability while providing enough safety stock to cover small fluctuations from the 300-unit mark. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that replenishes the full expected demand for the upcoming period.

Carry-over insight: October demand plateau confirmed: Period 34-37 demand is highly stable, averaging 297.75 units (StDev ~15) following the September hyper-peak. This represents the core fall tailoring season level.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the first week of November (Period 39). The October demand plateau (P34-P37) averaged ~298 units, but Period 38 showed a significant uptick to 385 units (+29% above that plateau). Historical data from January shows demand around the 150-200 level, suggesting we may be nearing the end of the Fall peak but still experiencing late-season strength. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the recent surge in Period 38 and the high stockout frequency in the last few periods (P37 and P38), I will set mu_hat to capture this recent spike by focusing on the immediate trend while maintaining a buffer for volatility. Using recent_N=5 for demand (covering October plus the start of November) provides a robust average of ~315 units, which aligns with the demand levels just before the hyper-peak's tail. I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the increased volatility seen in the transition from October's stability to the recent surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Late-season demand surge detected in early November (P38); demand jumped to 385 units, a 29% increase over the October plateau of ~298 units, potentially signaling a secondary peak or late-fall clearing phase.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late-fall season for the Mariette Blazer. Period 38 saw a significant demand surge to 385 units, but Period 39 demand moderated to 231 units, suggesting the surge was either a temporary peak or the start of higher volatility as we enter November. The October plateau (P34-P37) averaged ~298 units, while the very recent 2-week average (P38-P39) is 308 units. Given the transition into late fall/winter, I will forecast using a recent_N window that captures this late-autumn behavior. I'll use N=6 (P34-P39) to anchor the demand mean around the established fall level (~293 units) while accounting for the recent spike's impact on volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by 'arrived=ordered' within the same period throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: Late-fall demand (Nov) shows increased volatility vs October: Period 38 surge (385) followed by Period 39 moderation (231). Mean remains near the October plateau of ~298 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019). The current demand context is the late-fall/early-winter peak for women's tailoring. Recent demand for the Mariette blazer indicates a high-level plateau with some volatility. The October average (P34-P37) was 297.8 units. November demand has been 385 (P38), 231 (P39), and 278 (P40), maintaining a three-week average of 298 units, which aligns perfectly with the October mean. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the OR backend, I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the stability since mid-October (P34-P40), providing a robust mean estimate of ~298 units. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to capture the variance across this stable fall regime, ensuring enough safety stock to handle the noted November volatility (highs of 385) without excessive holding costs given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Fall tailoring regime consolidated (P34-P40): Seven-period average stabilized at 298 units with consistent volatility, confirming a sustained plateau following the September hyper-peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (Period 42). Historical data shows the 'Fall Tailoring' regime (P34-P41) has been remarkably stable, averaging 291 units per period (last 8 samples). However, a more recent 3-period lookback (P39-P41) shows a slight deceleration (avg 251 units). Given the high cost of holding ($1/unit) relative to unit profit ($4/unit), the OR backend's service level target is roughly 80%. With 93 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to order to cover the next period's demand. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking during a potential late-November/early-December slowdown (a common pattern after the October/early November peak), I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent stabilization around 290 units while weighting the most recent trend more heavily than the full-year history.

Carry-over insight: Late November demand (P39-P41) shows a slight deceleration to ~251 units compared to the October plateau of ~298 units, suggesting the end of the peak fall tailoring season.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A massive demand spike occurred in Period 42 (733 units), which is more than double the previous October/November average of ~250-300 units. This is likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday (Dec 2, 2019, is the current date, meaning Period 42 covered late November). As we are now in early December, demand is expected to remain high during the holiday shopping season but may moderate from the absolute Black Friday peak. The current stock is 0. I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to capture the expected December holiday demand level (estimated at 450 units to balance between the recent 733 spike and the 300-unit fall baseline) and high 'explicit' sigma_hat (150) to protect against stockouts during this volatile high-volume period. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Significant Black Friday demand spike detected in Period 42 (733 units), a 200% increase over the late November average. Transitioning to holiday season regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Black Friday week), demand spiked to 733 units, followed by a sharp drop to 169 units in Period 43. This pattern is characteristic of a major retail event where demand is pulled forward. The current date is December 9th (Period 44), placing us in the post-Black Friday/early December corridor. Historically, this SKU (Mariette Blazer) sees a cooling off after peak periods. With 408 units on hand and 0 in-transit, and given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio suggests a target service level of 80% (z\u22480.84). The OR backend's default base stock calculation will favor recent high demand if not adjusted. To prevent excessive overstocking during the post-event lull, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P41-P43), which averages 382.3 units. This N=3 captures the spike and the subsequent drop, providing a more balanced view of 'current' demand than the long-term fall average (~298) or the outlier spike itself. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the extreme volatility experienced during the holiday transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand drop confirmed: Period 43 demand (169) fell 77% from the P42 spike (733), marking the transition from the fall peak to the holiday wind-down.

Daily Reward (R_t): $880.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand in Period 44 was 304 units, which is higher than the post-Black Friday dip of 169 (P43) but consistent with the late-fall plateau observed earlier (~298 units). With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47), we must transition from peak-season stocking to a wind-down phase to avoid excessive holding costs and leftover inventory. Current on-hand inventory is 336 units. Lead time is solid at 0 periods. Based on the last two periods (mean 236.5), the current stock covers slightly more than one period of demand. I will set mu_hat using the last 2 periods to capture the post-holiday moderation, and use a narrow recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility shift away from the Black Friday outlier. The high holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4) suggests a service level of 80%, so we should avoid over-ordering as we approach the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Holiday transition confirmed: P43-P44 average demand of 236.5 units is 20% lower than the Oct-Nov plateau of ~298, signaling the start of the end-of-year seasonal wind-down.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the week of December 23rd (Period 46), approaching the year-end transition. Following the massive Black Friday spike (P42), demand has entered a holiday wind-down phase. The last three periods (P43-P45) show a lower average demand of 243.7 units compared to the peak fall average of ~300. As we approach Christmas and the New Year, demand for dressy tailoring/blazers typically softens as retail focus shifts to sales and new collection transitions. The current on-hand inventory is 192 units. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3-period average (N=3) to focus on the post-Black Friday holiday level, reflecting this gradual seasonal deceleration. Sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the current volatility without being skewed by the outlier spike in Period 42. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday wind-down confirmed: Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P45) has settled at an average of 243.7 units, a 18% reduction from the Oct-Nov plateau of 298 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $338.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 coincides with the final week of December, following the holiday wind-down. Demand in Period 46 dropped to 128 units, reflecting the post-Christmas seasonal trough for women's tailoring. The holiday transition regime (P43-P46) shows an average demand of 214.75 units, but the most recent figure (128) suggests a further contraction as the year ends. To avoid excessive holding costs in January's typical retail lull, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P43-P46) to capture this downward trend while weighting the most recent low demand. Sigma_hat is set to the same period to reflect the volatility of the post-Black Friday period. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: End-of-year demand trough confirmed: Period 46 demand (128) fell 50% from the P43-P45 average (243), signaling a deep post-holiday seasonal lull for tailoring.
