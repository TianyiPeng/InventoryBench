Historical demand for the last five weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows values of 24, 44, 55, 64, and 42. The mean demand is approximately 45.8 units per week. The date is Feb 11, 2019. This is a basic apparel item with relatively stable demand, though February can see a slight uptick as customers prepare for spring. Given the promised lead time is 0 periods, an order placed now should arrive in the same period to satisfy Period 1 demand. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there is no pipeline, I need to order enough to cover Period 1 demand plus a safety stock for Period 2, considering the volatility seen in January.
