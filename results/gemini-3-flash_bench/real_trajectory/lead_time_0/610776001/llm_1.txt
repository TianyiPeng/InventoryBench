There is a notable upward trend in the last two weeks, likely due to the approach of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, which fits the t-shirt category. Current date is Feb 11. Since this is Period 1, I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. To maximize reward, I must cover Period 1 demand immediately. Given the rising trend (212 in the most recent historical week) and the seasonal nature of the product, I will forecast Period 1 demand at approximately 220 units. I will order 240 units to ensure high service level given the zero starting inventory and the potential for continued growth as spring approaches, while keeping holding cost risk manageable.",

This is a staple item, but lightweight jersey suggests increased relevance as we move into Spring (March/April). Calendar/World Knowledge: Current date is March 4, 2019. Spring fashion demand usually picks up in March. Demand Analysis: Historical samples (Jan-Feb) hovered between 105-212. Recent periods (Feb 11 - Feb 25) show a significant upward trajectory: 206, 239, and 350. The jump to 350 in Period 3 indicates a demand surge, likely seasonal or due to the item's 'Everyday Basic' nature. Lead Time Analysis: History confirms lead_time=0 (orders placed arrive in the same period). Inventory Assessment: Current 'On-hand' is 0. Last period sold 261 units but demand was 350, meaning we lost 89 units of potential sales due to insufficient stock.

The most recent three periods (P12-14) show demands of 345, 280, and 309, averaging 311 units. However, there is a recurring pattern of spikes above 400 (P7, P8, P11). Given the current date (May 20), we are in the peak season for lightweight jersey basics. With a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, the strategy is to carry enough stock to meet a potential high-end spike (~410-450) without incurring excessive holding costs. Current on-hand inventory is 171. To target a service level that covers recent high demand (using ~420 as a safe upper-mid target), I need to order approximately 249 units (420 - 171).

Demand has been steadily declining since the summer peak, reaching a stable low-volume regime in late autumn/early winter. Recent demand figures for November and early December are consistently low: P40 (30), P41 (25), P42 (47 - slight outlier), P43 (20), and P44 (19). The current 5-week average is approximately 28 units. We are now in Period 45 (mid-December), approaching the final periods of the game (total 47). Given the current on-hand inventory of 44 units and the lead time of 0 (same-period arrival), the existing stock already covers approximately 1.5 periods of the current demand regime (~28 units/period). Ordering additional units would likely result in unnecessary holding costs as the game nears its end. Therefore, I will place an order of 0 to deplete the existing inventory while still maintaining a sufficient service level for Period 45.",
  "carry_over_insight": "December demand stabilization: Demand has further contracted in late Q4, averaging ~28 units over the last five weeks (P40-P44), down from the November average of ~40 units.",
