Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the SKU '605094001' (Fred Shortie 3 pack). Historical demand data shows five samples: 158, 154, 201, 140, 103 (Mean: 151.2, Std: 35.8). The demand shows a slight downward trend in the last two weeks, but we should start by covering the observed average. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no on-hand inventory and no in-transit units, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the available history. I'll use 'default' for L since we have no reason yet to suspect the lead time differs from the promise of 0.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster briefs, a staple item. Initial data from Jan/Feb shows demand ranging from 103 to 201. Period 1 demand was low (33), but this may be an outlier or a post-holiday lull. Historical samples (158, 154, 201, 140, 103) average ~151. Including Period 1 (33), the 6-sample average is ~131. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0 (ordered 210, arrived 210 in the same period). Inventory is currently 177. I will use a recent_N approach for demand to account for the current lower levels while maintaining enough stock to cover the historical average of ~150 units/period, given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1). Setting N=6 to use all available recent data points.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for SKU 605094001 has shown a significant downward trend compared to January performance. While demand in January averaged ~163 units/week, the last three observations (Period -1, 1, and 2) were 103, 33, and 21 respectively. This suggests a post-season demand shift for this basic underwear pack. Currently, we have 206 units on hand with no units in-transit. Given the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, our current inventory is sufficient for roughly 6-8 weeks of current demand levels. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (including the transition week of 103) to reflect the lowered demand regime while maintaining a small buffer for variance, as N=3 is the minimum recommended for a regime shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th, 2019. This product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster briefs (Divided Basics). Looking at the historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 11), there was a higher demand period in January (mean ~163) which dropped significantly in February (mean ~45). The most recent three periods (P1-P3) show a further decline to an average of 25 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with arrivals occurring in the \u0647\u0645\u0627\u0646 period they are ordered. Given the drop in demand, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the current low-demand regime (approx. 25 units/period). Since L=0, mu_hat should target (1+0)*25 = 25. Sigma_hat is also set using the recent 3 samples to account for current volatility. This will prevent overstocking as we transition from winter to spring.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected in February: demand dropped from Jan average of ~163 to Feb/March average of ~25 (-85% change).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 605094001 showed a high average in January (~163), which dropped significantly in February and early March. Recent demand samples show: P1=33, P2=21, P3=21, P4=56. The average demand over the last four periods is 32.75 units. Although P4 saw a slight uptick (56), it remains well below the January levels. The promised lead time is 0, and observed lead times for P1 and P2 were indeed 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 129 units, which is approximately four weeks of stock at the recent demand rate. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level (profit/ratio = 19/20 = 95%), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (N=4) to capture this lower demand regime. I will use the recent 4 samples for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in P4. L remains at the promised 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Fred Shortie 3 pack' (Underwear) is currently in a low-demand regime. Historical demand in January averaged 163 units, but since early February (Period 1), demand has dropped significantly. The last five periods show demands of 33, 21, 21, 56, and 29, averaging 32 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 100 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of demand at the current rate. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (as seen in Periods 1 and 2). To reflect this lower demand regime and avoid overstocking while holding 100 units, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the period since the drop began) and keep L at the default (0).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product (cotton jersey hipster briefs) shifted from a high-demand regime in January (avg ~163) to a significantly lower demand regime starting in February. Over the last 6 periods (since Feb 11), the average demand has been approximately 28.5 units per week, which is much lower than the initial historical data. The most recent demand (Period 6) was only 11 units. We currently have 89 units on-hand, which covers roughly 3 periods of demand at the current average. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (observed in Periods 1 and 2). Given the on-hand inventory level and the low-demand regime, current stock is sufficient. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the high January historical samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 605094001 (Hipster briefs) showed a significant drop starting in February, shifting from a Jan average of ~163 to a Feb/Mar average of ~27.6. In Period 7, demand was 22, continuing this lower regime. The promised lead time is 0, and observed lead times for Periods 1 and 2 were indeed 0. On-hand inventory is 67, which covers over two periods of current demand levels. I will use the recent demand regime (last 5 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering based on the high January numbers, while keeping L at the default 0 as arrivals have been consistent with the promise.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 605094001 shows two distinct regimes: a high-demand period in January (avg ~163) and a significantly lower-demand period from February to early April (avg ~33). However, Period 8 (April 1) saw a spike in demand to 71 units, which depleted all remaining on-hand inventory (ending inventory 0). We are currently stocked out. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical observations confirm arrivals occurred within the same period (L=0). Given the stockout and the recent demand increase, I need to restock immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for mu_hat to capture the post-January average (approx 33 units) while accounting for the recent April spike, ensuring the OR backend orders enough to cover the immediate demand of ~35-40 units plus a safety buffer for volatility (sigma_hat).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing in April: Period 8 demand (71) is more than double the Feb/March average (33), leading to a stockout.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are observing a demand recovery following the low-demand regime of February and March. History shows January demand averaged ~163 units, February/March averaged ~33, and April (Period 8 and 9) is averaging 55.5 units (71 and 40 respectively). The product is cotton hipster briefs, which are a basic staple but can see late spring/Easter volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0. Since demand is currently trending upward from the winter low but remains below January levels, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent April activity (mu \u2248 44 per period). Given the previous stockout in Period 8, I will use a slightly higher N for sigma (N=5) to ensure we account for the volatility seen in the jump from 22 to 71. Setting L to default (0) as verified by recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: April demand recovery confirmed: Average demand increased from 33 (Feb/Mar) to 55.5 (April weeks 1-2).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/04/22), we are observing a sustained recovery in demand for SKU 605094001 (Underwear) following a low-demand period in February and March. The carry-over insights and recent history confirm that April demand has increased significantly. Specifically, demand in the last three periods (P8, P9, P10) was 71, 40, and 55, respectively, yielding a recent average of 55.3 units. This is a substantial increase compared to the February/March average of approximately 33 units. Historical lead time records consistently show a 0-period lead time (orders placed in Period N arrive and are usable in Period N). With on-hand inventory at 28 units and significant upward momentum in demand, our parameters must reflect this growth to avoid further stockouts (as seen in P8). I will set L to 'calculate' (which has consistently been 0), and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new April regime. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this transition.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1439.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. We are exiting the low-demand February/March regime (avg ~33) and entering a confirmed higher-demand April regime. The last four periods of demand are 71, 40, 55, and 76, averaging 60.5 units per week. The latest observation (76) suggests continued momentum. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all concluded orders (P1, P2, P9, P10, P11). On-hand inventory is very low at 5 units with nothing in transit. To prevent another stockout as seen in Period 8, I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the current period plus lead time (1+0 = 1 period). Since the April regime is well-established over the last 4 periods, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent mean of 60.5 and the increased volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current demand trend.

Carry-over insight: April demand regime confirmed: mean increased to 60.5 units (+83% vs Feb/Mar average of 33) with higher volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/6. In Period 12, demand spiked to 106 units (the highest since January), resulting in a stockout (sold 88, ending inventory 0). This confirms a strong upward trend spanning April into May. Demand for the last 4 periods (April) was 40, 55, 76, 106, averaging ~69 units, which is significantly higher than the Feb/Mar average of 33. Given the stockout and the rising trajectory, I will use recent_N=4 to capture this new 'Spring' regime. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. The OR backend needs to replenish inventory immediately to meet this growing demand and recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: May demand trajectory: Period 12 demand (106) marks a significant spike and stockout, confirming a sustained upward trend from the April average (69) compared to the Feb/Mar baseline (33).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Fred Shortie 3 pack' (Underwear) is currently in a sustained upward demand regime as we move into May. Historical data shows Jan: ~163, Feb/Mar: ~33 (drop), Apr: ~69 (recovery), and May starting with a surge (P12: 106, P13: 77). The average of the last 4 periods (April/May) is 78.5, and the average of the last 2 (May) is 91.5. A stockout occurred in P12, indicating that demand might have been higher than the sold units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this recent May acceleration and mitigate stockout risk, I will use recent_N with N=4 to set the forecast, which centers the mean around the recent April/May recovery levels (~78.5 per period). This provides a base_stock target of approximately 157 (assuming a 1-period demand window for L=0), which allows for the replenishment of current low stock (on-hand: 40).

Carry-over insight: May demand trajectory: Period 12-13 average is 91.5, confirming a seasonal peak shift compared to April's average of 69.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1847.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear upward trend from April into May. Demand for the last three periods (P12-P14) was 106, 77, and 98, respectively. The average for this most recent regime is 93.6 units, significantly higher than the April average (69 units). This matches the seasonal pattern for cotton underwear staples as summer approaches. Since Period 1, all orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, which is consistent with the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this elevated demand regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to account for the increased volatility seen since late April. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the current demand spike while the OR cap prevents excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime peak: Period 12-14 average demand is 93.7 units, a 35% increase over the April average (69.2) and a 184% increase over the Feb/Mar baseline (33).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late May (2019/5/27). Demand has shown a significant upward trend throughout May: Period 13 (77), Period 14 (98), and Period 15 (123). The average for the last 3 weeks is 99.33 units, compared to the April average of ~69. This confirms a sustained seasonal peak. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 12), and based on the recent trend, demand is expected to remain high or continue increasing as we enter June. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent high-demand regime, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover this elevated volume. Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime peak confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive weeks (77, 98, 123) with a 3-week average of 99.3 units, representing a ~44% increase over the April average (69.2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2622.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 3rd, 2019. We are entering June, a period typically associated with high demand for summer apparel like cotton 'Shortie' undergarments. In Period 16, demand reached 153 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 138, 0 remain). This confirms the sustained upward May trend identified in Carry-over Insights has now entered a June peak level. The historical samples for January (158, 154, 201, 140) suggest the SKU is capable of sustaining weekly demand in the 140-200 range. Consequently, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean and variance to capture this rapid seasonal escalation (Demand from Period 12-16: 106, 77, 98, 123, 153). Lead time has consistently validated as 0 periods (same-period arrival), so I will maintain 'calculate' for L. The backend will use these parameters to target a base stock covering the current June regime and the high profit-to-holding ratio (19:1), which supports a high service level.

Carry-over insight: June seasonal peak confirmed: Period 16 demand (153) returns volume to January levels (~160), marking a full recovery and expansion from the spring seasonal lows.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1701.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 605094001 (cotton underwear) shows a clear seasonal recovery from a low of ~33 units/week in February/March to a high of ~114 units/week over the last 5 periods (Periods 13-17: 77, 98, 123, 153, 93). While Period 17 saw a drop to 93 units, the overall trend since mid-April is strongly upward. January's historical data (pre-game history) showed demand levels around 160 units, which was nearly reached in Period 16 (153 units). Given the high service level requirement (Profit $19, Holding Cost $1), I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (~114) to capture this recent high-demand regime while accounting for the recent spike. Lead time calculation remains stable at 0. Increasing sigma_hat by using a recent window (N=5) captures the increased volatility observed during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: June demand stabilization: The 5-week average (Periods 13-17) is 108.8 units, confirming a sustained volume shift that is 57% higher than the April average (69.2) and approaching January's pre-game levels (~160).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical data for this SKU (605094001, Fred Shortie 3 pack) shows a significant demand recovery and peak in late May and early June, returning to levels seen in early January (~150+ units). However, the last two periods (Period 17 and 18) show a sharp deceleration to 93 and 50 units respectively. This suggests the seasonal peak may have passed or demand is stabilizing at a lower level than the peak. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time has consistently been 0, I will keep L at default. To capture the recent shift in demand while acknowledging the volatility of the past month, I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 (averaging 153, 93, 50 = ~98.7) to balance the high peak and recent drop. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-June demand correction: Following a June seasonal peak of 153 in Period 16, demand has dropped significantly to 93 and 50 in Periods 17-18, suggesting the peak has subsided.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand history shows a clear seasonal peak in late May/early June (peaking at 153), followed by a cooling trend in physical demand (93, 50, 68 in Periods 17-19). The 3-period average during this 'post-peak' phase is 70.3 units. Given the product is a staple item (3-pack cotton underwear), demand is stabilizing after the initial summer transition. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this recent stabilization at 70 units, which is a significant drop from the peak but remains higher than the early spring baseline of 33. This strategy prevents overstocking as the peak fades while maintaining sufficient service level for the current consumption rate.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: June demand cooling from seasonal high of 153 to a 3-week average of 70 units (Periods 17-19).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st. Looking at the demand history, we saw a clear seasonal peak in late May and June (averaging ~123 units in May/June weeks 1-3). However, demand has since contracted significantly. For Periods 18, 19, and 20, demand was 50, 68, and 53, respectively. This gives a 3-week average of 57 units, which is a sharp drop from the peak. The 'carry_over_insight' from Period 20 confirms this cooldown. Given this post-peak stabilization, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the current lower volume. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving immediately. The on-hand inventory is 63, which currently covers the anticipated demand, so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment or no order depending on the safety stock calculation based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: July start demand is averaging 57 units over the last 3 periods, down ~55% from the June peak of 153.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '605094001' (cotton hipster briefs) is currently in a post-peak stabilization phase following a high in late May (153 units). Period 21 saw a demand of 82 units, which is a jump from the previous three-week average of ~57, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). Although demand has cooled from the mid-year seasonal peak, the last period indicates that demand remains volatile and potentially higher than the late June lull. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (Periods 17-21) to capture this post-peak behavior, which averages 69.2 units. This N=5 window includes the most recent spike and the preceding cooling period, providing a balanced forecast for the current July regime. The observed lead time consistently remains at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime: Period 21 demand (82) suggests a stabilization level higher than the late June low (53), with a 5-period average (P17-P21) of 69.2 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical demand shows a mid-year peak in June (reaching 153 units) followed by a cooling period in late June and early July. Over the last six periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged 66.7 units (93, 50, 68, 53, 82, 54). The most recent demand was 54, reflecting a stabilization into a July regime following the higher spring/early summer volumes. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Given the high criticality (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), the backend will aim for a high service level. To optimize, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat based on the last 6 periods to capture the current post-peak stabilization level of ~67 units. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=6 to reflect the current volatility, which is significantly lower than during the May/June peak.

Carry-over insight: July demand stabilization confirmed: Period 17-22 average demand is 66.7 units, marking a sustained reduction from the June peak (~120-150 range) to a more moderate summer regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Inventory on-hand is 44 units with 0 in-transit. History shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high peak in late May/early June (reaching 153 units) followed by a cooling period in late June/July. The last seven periods (P17-P23) show demand of 93, 50, 68, 53, 82, 54, 52. This indicates a stabilized summer regime with an average of roughly 64.6 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (~95%), requiring us to cover the stabilized mean plus a buffer for recent volatility. I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) for demand and variance to capture this established post-peak regime while reacting slightly to the mid-July stabilization.

Carry-over insight: July demand stabilization confirmed: Period 17-23 average demand is 64.6 units, marking a stable summer regime significantly lower than the June peak (~120-150) but higher than the Feb/Mar lows (33).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 605094001 (Hipster briefs) has exited its June peak (max 153) and settled into a stable summer demand regime. Over the last four periods (P21-P24), demand has been 82, 54, 52, and 43, averaging 57.75 units. This is significantly lower than the June peak but holds higher than the early spring lows. The 'carry_over_insight' from Period 24 confirms a stable July regime. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this cooling phase while maintaining a high service level (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using a recent window that captures this stabilization. I will use N=8 (covering Periods 17-24) to calculate mu_hat, which captures the post-peak trend (avg ~62). This ensures the base stock reflects the current lower volume compared to the historical full-season average.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August. Analysis of the demand history shows a clear cooling trend following the June seasonal peak (P16 demand: 153). Since Period 18, demand has settled into a stabilized summer regime. Specifically, demand over the last four periods (P22-P25) has been 54, 52, 43, and 33, averaging 45.5 units per period. This confirms the earlier 'Carry-over Insight' regarding post-peak stabilization. The most recent demand of 33 matches the initial February levels, suggesting we are entering a secondary seasonal low or a very stable late-summer trough. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (Holding Cost = $1.0 vs. Profit = $19.0) while maintaining a sufficient service level for this staple underwear SKU, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this recent 4-week regime (N=4) to prevent over-ordering based on the high-volume June data.

Carry-over insight: August demand contraction: Demand has consistently declined over the last 4 periods (P22-P25), with the average dropping to 45.5 units, significantly below the June peak (~120) and July average (~65).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August. Analysis of recent demand shows a definitive contraction following the mid-June peak (~153 units). Over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 43.4 units, significantly lower than the July average of ~65 units and the June peak. Specifically, the last two periods recorded demand of 33 and 35 units, suggesting a return toward the early spring baseline or a stable late-summer low. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent contraction while maintaining enough buffer for minor volatility, as the product is a basic item (cotton jersey hipster briefs) which usually sees more stable demand than high-fashion items, but is currently in a downward seasonal trend.

Carry-over insight: August demand contraction confirmed: Demand has averaged 43.4 units over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), a ~33% decrease from the July average (~65) and a ~70% decrease from the June peak (~150).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical data and recent demand confirm a sustained contraction in demand following a June peak. Demand has transitioned from a June average of ~100+ units to a July average of ~65 units, and now an August average of ~41 units (P23-P27: 52, 43, 33, 35, 41). The last five periods show relative stability at this lower level. With on-hand inventory at 19 units and no units in transit, we need to maintain a safety buffer while reflecting this lower mean. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the last 5 periods of August stabilization) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this best captures the current demand regime while excluding the higher July and June volumes.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26). Demand for this SKU has significantly cooled from the June seasonal peak (~150) and the July average (~65). Over the last 4 periods (P25-P28), demand has been very stable, ranging between 33 and 41, with an average of 35.5 units. This indicates a sustained late-summer regime. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability and recent downward trend confirmed in carry-over insights, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this lower baseline accurately without over-ordering as we approach the end of summer. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to reflect the lower current volatility (+/- 4 units). This strategy balances the high service level requirement (95% critical ratio) with the current low-demand environment to minimize holding costs on the 21 units currently on hand.

Carry-over insight: August demand floor confirmed: demand has stabilized between 33 and 41 units over the last 4 periods (P25-P28), averaging 35.5 units, which is ~45% lower than the July average.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a floor level throughout August, with the last five periods (P25-P29) showing demand of 33, 35, 41, 33, and 26 respectively, averaging 33.6 units per period. This is a clear contraction from the July average (~65) and the June peak (~150). Given the product description (cotton hipster briefs), we are currently in a post-summer low before potential back-to-school or late-year seasonal shifts. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (critical as profit $19 vs holding $1), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) to reflect this lower stabilization floor. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to capture the current reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor confirmed: demand has entered a low-volume stable regime averaging ~34 units over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), down from the July average of ~65.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 605094001 (Underwear) is currently in a low-demand stabilization phase following a significant early-summer peak. In the most recent period (P30), demand dropped to 19 units, continuing a downward trend from the August average of ~34 units. The 5-period average (P26-P30) is approximately 30.8 units. As of Period 31 (Sept 9), we are entering the post-summer/back-to-school season where underwear demand typically remains stable or slightly increases, but current data signals a further floor. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this down-shift while maintaining sufficient stock. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 24 units, and with no units in transit, the system needs to maintain a base stock to cover demand for the next immediate interval.

Carry-over insight: September demand shift: Demand dropped to 19 units in Period 30, bringing the 5-period average (P26-P30) down to ~31 units, compared to the July average of ~65.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern: high volume in January (~160), a significant drop in Feb/Mar (~33), a spring recovery peaking in June (~153), and a subsequent decline through summer. We are currently in a stable low-volume regime that has persisted through August and early September. Over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), demand has averaged 29.5 units (35, 41, 33, 26, 19, 23). The most recent three periods (P29-P31) show even lower stability at 22.7 units. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19), the target service level is high (~95%), but we must avoid overstocking as we move further into the autumn. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the current stable floor of ~30 units while accounting for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime established: Demand has averaged 29.5 units over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), confirming a stable low-volume floor following the summer decline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Historical demand analysis shows a clear transition from a summer peak in June (~120-150 units) to a stabilized low-volume regime in late August and September. Since Period 25 (July 29), demand has consistently fluctuated between 19 and 41 units. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P25-P32) is approximately 30 units, which is significantly lower than previous months but has shown relative stability. Most recently, demand in Period 32 was 30 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To avoid over-ordering during this low-volume phase while maintaining a sufficient service level for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this specific post-summer stabilization regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent low of 19 with the slightly higher recent observation of 30.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 605094001 (Hipster briefs) has exited its summer low and is showing signs of a demand increase in late September, with Period 33 demand hitting 48 units, the highest since July. This follows a stable regime of ~25-30 units throughout August and early September. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in Period 33 where 42 units were available against a demand of 48. I am increasing the forecast to capture this upward movement. While the promised lead time is 0, recent history has shown it consistently remains 0. I'll use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the latest demand uptick while maintaining a baseline from the recent floor.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor of ~30 units ended in Period 33 with a spike to 48 units (+60% vs previous 3-week average), indicating a potential autumn seasonal shift.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a transition from a low-volume September floor (~30 units) to a potential autumn seasonal shift. Period 33 saw a significant spike to 48 units, while Period 34 demand was 32 units. The 2rd-week-of-October historical data from the pre-game samples (Jan/early Feb) showed demand levels in the 100-200 range, and while we aren't there yet, we must prepare for an upward trend as we move further into Q4. Lead time has consistently been 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the slight uptick from the floor (average ~33 units) while maintaining enough stock to avoid stockouts if demand continues to rise toward historical Q4 levels. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent volatility increase.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Potential autumn seasonal shift in progress. Average demand over the last two periods (P33-P34) is 40 units, a 33% increase from the September floor average of 30 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 605094001 (Hipster briefs) has moved out of its September floor (~30 units) and is showing early indications of an autumn seasonal shift. Over the last three periods (P33-P35), demand has been 48, 32, and 30, averaging 36.6 units. While the last two weeks were lower than the P33 spike, they are still above the average lows seen in late August/early September. As we move further into October (Date: 2019/10/14), a moderate increase in demand is expected. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. To capture the recent shift while mitigating the risk of over-ordering based on a single spike (P33), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 (covering the spike and the preceding period) to set a slightly elevated base stock level. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility observed since late September.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand shift confirmed: Period 33-35 average (37 units) is ~23% higher than the September average (30 units), indicating an end to the low-volume floor.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 605094001 (Hipster briefs) has stabilized into an autumn regime following the September low. Over the last four periods (P33-P36), demand has averaged 36.5 units (48, 32, 30, 36), which is approximately 22% higher than the September floor of ~30 units. The current date (Oct 21) suggests we are moving deeper into the autumn season. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend targets a high service level (~95%). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current mean and volatility of this autumn shift while ignoring the earlier summer decline. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime established (Oct): Average demand (P33-P36) is 36.5 units, representing a 22% increase from the September floor (30 units).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand has transitioned from the September floor (~30 units) to an October regime averaging 34.8 units over the last 5 periods (P33-P37). While individual weeks fluctuate (a spike of 48 in P33 followed by a range of 28-36), the overall trend is a ~16% increase from the September low. Actual lead time has remained stable at 0 periods throughout the game history. With on-hand inventory at 22 units and a slight upward trend in mean demand, I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=5 (covering the October shift) to capture the current demand level. sigma_hat will also use N=5 to account for the recent volatility seen during this transition.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a stable autumn demand regime. Over the last 6 periods (P33-P38), demand has averaged 36.0 units, which is significantly higher than the September floor of ~30 units. The most recent demand (P38) was 42 units, suggesting a potential further upward trend as we move deeper into November toward the holiday season. Given the high service level requirement (profit/holding cost ratio of 19:1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current autumn baseline. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the historical record consistently shows a 0-period lead time, allowing the backend to respond quickly to the current on-hand inventory of only 6 units.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Average demand for Periods 33-38 is 36.0 units, confirming a ~20% increase over the September floor (30 units).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 605094001 (cotton jersey hipster briefs) shows a confirmed autumn regime averaging approximately 36 units per period since early October. Specifically, the average demand from Period 33 to 39 is 35.3 units. Given the transition into mid-November, we should prepare for potential year-end volatility, although no definitive holiday spike is yet visible. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 12), and the last period demand was 37. To maintain a safe service level during this stable but slightly elevated autumn regime, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the mean (approx 35.3) and variance of the current period since the September floor ended. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected 35-40 units per period while accounting for recent fluctuations.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical data from Period 0 (Jan 2019) showed demand levels around 140-160 units. We are approaching that same timeframe. Demand has stabilized in an 'Autumn regime' since Period 33, with an average of approximately 36 units (P33-P40 average is 35.5). However, given the product (basic cotton hipster briefs) and the historical January data, a surge in demand as we approach the end of the year and transition into January is likely. The current on-hand inventory is 13 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid stockouts if demand begins to climb toward those Jan 2019 levels (approx 150), I will set mu_hat to be slightly higher than the recent autumn average to build a small buffer, while maintaining the recent 8-period window for variance to reflect the current stability.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (Oct-Nov) remains stable: average demand (P33-P40) is 35.5 units, significantly lower than the Jan 2019 baseline of ~150.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand in Period 41 dropped significantly to 14 units, whereas the average for the autumn regime (P33-P40) was ~36 units. However, given this SKU (basic cotton underwear) and the upcoming December holiday season, historical data from January 2019 (avg ~163) suggests that demand may soon ramp up rather than stay at this low level. Because the lead time is consistently 0, I will use a larger N for mu_hat (N=9, covering P33-P40 plus the current dip) to smooth out the Period 41 outlier while staying responsive to the established autumn baseline. I will maintain default lead time (0) and standard volatility calculations.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/2. A major demand spike occurred in Period 42 (143 units), significantly exceeding the autumn average of ~36. This coincides with the start of the holiday shopping season (post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday period). My on-hand inventory is depleted (0 units). Looking at the 2019-01-07 baseline of ~158, this product exhibits very high demand in December/January. I must immediately pivot to a 'recent_N' approach to capture this regime shift and avoid further stockouts during the peak holiday season. I will use N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent spike heavily while still considering the immediate prior context, ensuring the base stock level targets this higher volume regime (L=0 means we need to cover the current period's demand).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected: Period 42 demand spiked to 143 units, a 4x increase over the Oct-Nov average (36 units), signaling the start of the high-volume winter regime observed in Jan 2019 baseline data.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the December holiday season (Period 44, Dec 9th). Historically, January 2019 baseline demand was high (~150 units). Period 42 saw a major spike to 143 units, followed by a very low Period 43 (10 units), which is likely a synchronization artifact of a holiday surge or temporary stockout-induced demand shift. Given the product (3-pack cotton underwear) and the date (peak holiday shopping), I expect demand to remain high and volatile for the remainder of December. The current on-hand inventory is 168. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' (historically 0). For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'explicit' to forecast 160 units (reflecting the 143 seen in P42 and Jan baseline levels), as 'recent_N' would be heavily weighted by the anomalous 10 units in Period 43. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for the extreme volatility observed in recent weeks (143 vs 10). This ensures the base stock (approx mu + 2*sigma for this profit margin) covers the potential for another triple-digit demand week while protecting against stockouts during the final game periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (Dec): Significant volatility detected with a peak of 143 (P42) and a low of 10 (P43). Expecting mean demand to align with Jan baseline (~150) through year-end.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing the high-volume/high-volatility holiday period. Historic demand for January 2019 baseline was ~150 units/week. While recent actuals (P43=10, P44=35) have been lower than the P42 spike (143), the baseline data and seasonal context suggest a mean demand closer to 150 is the rational target. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the system should maintain high safety stocks. On-hand inventory is currently healthy (257), so we adjust parameters to maintain this buffer without excessive over-ordering. I'm choosing an explicit mu_hat of 150 based on the January baseline averages and the expected winter seasonal regime, with an explicit sigma of 50 to handle the observed holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (Dec): Initial spike in P42 (143) followed by lower readings (10, 35) indicates high variance. Expecting regression toward Jan baseline mean (~150) for the remainder of the winter season.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the December holiday season (Dec 23). The historical baseline (Jan 2019) shows demand around 150 units per week. Recent December performance has been highly volatile: a spike to 143 (P42) followed by 10, 35, and most recently 64 (P45). This volatility is common in holiday retail. With an on-hand inventory of 193 units and no in-transit units, we are currently covered for a demand scenario slightly above the January mean (1x150). However, the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) dictates a high service level (~95%). To handle potential late-December spikes while avoiding excessive holding costs for 193 units, I will set mu_hat to 150 (the expected January plateau) and maintain a robust sigma_hat to account for the observed holiday variance. Using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat ensures we don't under-order due to the recent low-demand weeks (10, 35) dragging down a recent_N average.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand stabilization: Demand is exhibiting high variance (10-143 range) as it transitions toward the 150-unit January baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1111.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the final week of the year. Historically, the January 2019 baseline demand for this SKU (605094001) was approximately 150-160 units per week. While December has shown significant volatility (ranging from 10 to 143), the last two weeks (P45-P46) have stabilized near 64-68 units. Given the transition into January, I expect a return towards the 150-unit baseline mean. Current on-hand inventory is 181 units with 0 in-transit. Since lead time is 0 (arriving within the same period), and this is the final decision phase, I must ensure the inventory is sufficient to cover the expected January-level demand. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 170 units (the high end of the January baseline) to ensure high service levels during the seasonal transition, and sigma_hat to 40 to account for the high variance observed in December.
