Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (58, 42, 40, 50, 60) and recent results (58, 70, 42) suggest a mean demand of approximately 52.5 units. The product is 20 denier silicone stay-ups, a staple hosiery item. Period 4 (March 4th) is approaching spring, which often sees stable or slightly increasing demand for legwear as weather shifts. OR Recommendation: The OR baseline suggests 41 units based on a capped base-stock policy. Strategy: Since current inventory (30) is below the expected single-period demand (~52) and the target base-stock level (calculated by OR as ~71), an order is necessary. While the OR recommendation of 41 units brings total availability to 71 (30+41), which covers the 95th percentile of historical demand, the 'sold' quantity in Period 2 (66) and the demand of 70 suggest that 71 might be slightly lean if a small spike occurs.

While early periods (1-6) saw high demand (averaging 64 units, peaking at 100), the last four periods (7-10) have shown a steady decline: 54, 57, 30, and finally 22. This SKU (20 denier stay-ups) is a spring-seasonal item often associated with events like Easter or warming weather, but the recent 50%+ drop suggests the peak has passed or a regime shift toward lower demand. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Currently, we have 62 units on hand. The OR recommendation is 22 units based on the most recent demand sample. Given the clear downward trend (30 to 22), ordering 22 units would bring the total available inventory for Period 11 to 84 units (62 current + 22 new). If demand continues to fall or stabilizes near 20-25, 84 units represents nearly 4 weeks of cover, which incur holding costs.

Given the date is early May, we are transitioning into late spring/early summer. High-denier tights usually drop off, but 20 denier stay-ups with lace trim are often preferred for spring events/weddings.

The product is '20 denier semi shiny stay-ups', which typically sees stable but weather-dependent demand in mid-May. Current on-hand inventory is 34 units.

To ensure service levels for a potential return to the ~50-60 unit range while accounting for the current 34 units on hand and 0-period lead time, I will order slightly above the OR recommendation to maintain a safe inventory buffer.

Given the recent demand average of ~27, 78 units represents nearly 3 periods of supply.

Analysis of the history shows a significant drop around Period 17 (June), where demand fell from an average of ~50 to ~23. Looking at recent trends (Periods 25-28), demand has been consistently rising or stable (30, 21, 26, 30), with an average of 26.75. As we enter late August, demand for hosiery typically begins a seasonal recovery for the fall.

With a lead time consistently observed as 0 periods, I need to ensure sufficient stock to cover this period's demand and potential early-fall upticks. While OR suggests 49, it may be overreacting to older high-demand samples or volatility. I will adjust the order to 40 units.
