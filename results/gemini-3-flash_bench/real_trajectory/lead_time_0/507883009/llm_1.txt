The average demand across these five weeks is approximately 153 units per week. However, there is a notable drop in the most recent sample (Feb 4th, 99 units). The current date is Feb 11th, 2019, which is the week leading into Valentine's Day (Feb 14). Lingerie often sees a demand spike during this period. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive in the same period to satisfy this week's demand. To cover the current period's demand (which I estimate between 100-150 based on history, potentially higher due to Valentine's Day) and provide a small buffer for the next period, I will target a stock level of approximately 180 units. Since current on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will order 180 units.",

Since Valentine's Day has passed, demand might stabilize or slightly soften. Average historical demand is approx 146.

Analyzing the demand history, we saw a massive summer peak from June to mid-July (P18-P22), reaching 263 units. Since then, demand stabilized in a post-peak regime (P24-P29) averaging ~96 units. However, Period 30 (Sept 2) showed a significant jump to 144 units, causing a stockout. This timing aligns with 'Back to School' or early September retail cycles, where staple apparel often sees a secondary spike. Historically, we saw a similar 157-unit demand in late April (P12). Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I can react immediately to this trend. I need to cover Period 31 demand. Since the last demand was 144 and resulted in a stockout, the true demand may have been higher. I will target a safety stock level of approximately 160-170 units to prevent another stockout if this September surge continues, while balancing the $1.00 holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 507883009 (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a Post-Holiday low-demand phase. Recent demand for P43-P45 has been 49, 67, and 65 units respectively, averaging approximately 60 units. This follows a significant drop from the expected holiday peak. Historically, a recurring spike occurs every 5-6 weeks (P17, P33, P38). The last spike was P38 (Oct 28), and a subsequent expected spike during Black Friday (P42) failed to materialize, likely due to a change in seasonal behavior or market fatigue. Period 46 is Dec 23 (Pre-Christmas/Christmas week). While lingerie can see gift-related demand, the recent trend is flat and inventory has been high. With on-hand inventory at 85 units and a stable lead time of 0, I have sufficient stock to cover the current demand regime (~60-70 units). I will place a small order to maintain a safety buffer without incurring excessive holding costs, as demand typically stays low until the next cycle or post-holiday clearance.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Product 507883009 (Ellen Thong L 3pk) is in Period 47 (Dec 30), representing the end of the calendar year and the transition into early January. Historical data for this specific SKU from early January (weeks of 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows demand levels of 124, 168, 190, 183, and 99. The current demand regime is characterized by a significant post-holiday slump, with recent demand settling between 49 and 67 units (P43-P46). However, the historical data suggests a possible surge in early January (New Year's resolutions/restocking). The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is 49. To prepare for the historical January levels (averaging ~150) while acknowledging the recent low-demand regime, I will target an order that brings availability to 150 units. This allows us to capture the potential January bounce without excessive holding cost if the slump continues.",
