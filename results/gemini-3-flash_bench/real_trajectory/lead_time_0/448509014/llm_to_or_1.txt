Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 448509014 (jeans). On-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 3, 175, 168, 106, 278. The mean of the last 3 samples (168, 106, 278) is 184, which reflects the current growth better than the full history average (~146). Given the product type (jeans) and the date (mid-February), we are entering a transition period towards spring fashion where demand for 'ankle-length jeans with raw-edge hems' often increases. The promised lead time is 0. I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and volatility to capture the recent high volume while maintaining responsiveness. The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on a high service level requirement (Profit $4 / Holding $1), which is approximately q = 0.8.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' (5-pocket jeans). Period 2 starts on 2019-02-18. Looking at the historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) and Period 1 (Feb 11), there is a clear upward trend: 3, 175, 168, 106, 278, and most recently 258 in Period 1. The mean of the last 3 periods (106, 278, 258) is 214 units. Given this is a denim product in February, demand is likely stabilizing at a higher volume than the January average. The actual lead time for Period 1 was 0, matching the promised lead time. However, Period 1 ended with 0 inventory (demand 258 vs 258 ordered), meaning there might have been unmet demand (stockout). I will set mu_hat more aggressively using the last 2 periods of high demand (278 and 258) to ensure we capture the current growth, while sigma_hat will use the recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS', a staple fashion item. Examining the demand history (175, 168, 106, 278, 258, 315), there is a clear upward shift starting around early February (278, 258, 315) compared to January. The most recent demand was 315, and the previous period's order was slightly insufficient as we sold out (sold 294 against demand of 315). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Period 1 and 2 confirms the actual lead time is indeed 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand regime (periods starting 2019-02-04), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this new regime. Lead time remains 'default' since it is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting 2019-02-04: average weekly demand increased from ~150 to ~280 units.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 448509014 is currently in a high-demand regime that began in early February. Based on historical data and the last three periods (258, 315, 291), the average demand is approximately 288 units per week. The date is early March, which typically maintains steady demand for 'slim mom denim' jeans. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Current on-hand inventory is 18 units, with no units in transit. To maintain a sufficient service level given the profit ($4.0) vs. holding cost ($1.0) ratio, I will set mu_hat based on the recent N=3 periods to capture this higher demand level (~288 per period). Lead time will stay at the default (0). Sigma_hat will also use the recent 3 samples to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1252.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509014' (Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS) shows a strong and sustained demand regime since early February. Over the last 4 periods (P1-P4), demand has been 258, 315, 291, and 335, averaging approximately 300 units per week. This aligns with the carry-over insight of a shift to ~280+ units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed, as seen in the 'conclude' messages for P1 through P4. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0 and there is nothing in transit. To maximize profit while managing holding costs (profit/holding_cost ratio is 4:1), I will use the recent 4 periods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting this high-demand spring period for denim trousers. L is set to explicit 0 to match observed behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 1-4 average demand is 299.75 units, significantly higher than January's average. Lead time consistently observed at 0 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509014' (Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS) has entered a stable high-demand regime since early February. Over the last five periods (Period 1-5), the average demand is 306.2 units (258, 315, 291, 335, 332), which is significantly higher than the January seed data. The demand in the last two periods (Period 4 and 5) has stepped up slightly further to ~333 units. Actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all 5 concluded periods. Inventory is currently at 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, which is risky given the high stockout rate (sold < demand in 3 of the last 5 periods). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand regime while excluding the irrelevant low-demand January samples. L is set to default as the lead time is reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 300-330 units/period since February 2019. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product (Slim Mom Denim TRS) has entered a stable demand regime since early February. Historical demand from Period 1 to Period 6 shows values of 258, 315, 291, 335, 332, and 294. The average of these 6 samples is 304.17 with a standard deviation of 28.52. This period (Period 7) is the Monday before April, and there are no immediate major calendar spikes expected for denim trousers beyond the sustained spring demand already observed. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods (same-period arrival), which I will continue to assume. Using recent_N=6 captures the entire new regime effectively, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~304 units while maintaining a safety buffer based on recent volatility. With on-hand inventory at 40 and 0 in-transit, the OR engine will likely order around 270-300 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 8 (2019-04-01). The product (Denim Trousers) has entered a sustained high-demand regime since February, with a significant spike in Period 7 (413 units), likely tied to spring seasonality. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I am setting L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, the mean demand over the last 7 periods (since the regime shift confirmed in Carry-over Insights) is approximately 320. However, given the recent jump to 413, I will use an explicit forecast of 360 units to account for momentum while the OR backend applies the 0.8 service level target. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the volatility of this more active sales period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased further in late March (Period 7): demand spiked to 413 units, raising the 7-period average to 320 units (+7% vs previous 300 avg).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1608.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS has seen significant growth recently, coinciding with the transition into spring (April). Specifically, demand jumped to 413 units in Period 7 and further spiked to 521 units in Period 8. The average demand over the last 3 weeks is 409.3 units, compared to the February/March average of approximately 310 units. This suggests a seasonal demand shift as denim is a core spring fashion item. Lead time is consistently observed to be 0 periods across all 8 periods of history. To prevent stockouts, I am increasing the forecast (mu_hat) by using the most recent 3-period demand average to capture this sharp upward trend, while increasing sigma_hat using the same window to account for the heightened volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated in Period 8: demand jumped to 521 units (+26% vs Period 7's 413), establishing a new high-demand regime for the spring season with a 3-period mean of ~409 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $595.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15) follows a period of significant demand volatility. After a spike to 521 units in Period 8, demand dropped to 220 units in Period 9. This drop likely represents a correction or stabilization after the spring peak, rather than a permanent downward shift. The product is a 'sturdy cotton denim' (5-pocket jeans), which generally has stable spring demand. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high variance (peaks of 413, 521 and a trough of 220), I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the average of the current high-volatility phase (mean of 413, 521, 220 = 384.6) while using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed recently. The current on-hand of 285 units is substantial, but since L=0, the OR backend will calculate the order as (base_stock - 285). This strategy balances the risk of a demand bounce-back against the holding cost of the current excess.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility significantly increased in April (Period 8-9), with a peak of 521 followed by a drop to 220. The 3-period average (P7-P9) is 385 units, but with a high standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/22. Demand analysis shows a significant shift: after a spring peak (P7-P8 reaching 413-521 units), demand has dropped sharply in P9-P10 (220 and 199 units respectively). This suggests a post-peak stabilization or downward trend following the early spring surge. The on-hand inventory is currently high (312 units) due to the sudden demand drop. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the current regime, I am shifting to a recent_N (N=3) calculation for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This focuses on the most recent three weeks (P8-P10), which captures the end of the peak and the start of the lower demand period, averaging approximately 313 units per period. Using N=3 prevents over-reacting to the single lowest point (199) while allowing the model to adjust down from the peak mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Peak spring demand (P7-P8 avg 467) has subsided. New demand level (P9-P10) averages ~210 units, a -55% decrease from the peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS has stabilized after the early April peak. Actual demand for the last three periods (P9-P11) was 220, 199, and 176, showing a continuing downward trend as the peak spring season subsides. The current mean for this new regime (N=3) is approximately 198.3 units. On-hand inventory is 289 units, which already exceeds the current demand levels. Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, the system should only order enough to cover the current period's demand (base_stock = (1+L) * mu). By setting mu_hat using the recent 3-period average, the OR backend's calculated base stock will likely be below current on-hand levels, resulting in zero new orders to avoid incurring additional holding costs while the existing stock is sold off.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward continues: Period 9-11 average demand is 198.3 units, reflecting a post-peak stabilization following the April surge.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 448509014 indicates a clear downward trend and stabilization following the April peak. Demand for the last four periods (P9-P12) has been 220, 199, 176, and 169 units, respectively. This shows a steady decline towards a new baseline. The current average of the last three periods (P10-P12) is 181.33 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 120 units, we need to order enough to reach a target base stock that reflects this lower demand regime. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR engine will target a service level of 80%. I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-peak stabilization while providing enough data points to account for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Period 10-12 average demand is 181.3, indicating a post-spring peak level significantly lower than the April surge of 500+ units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 448509014 (perrie slim mom denim) continues its downward trajectory following the April peak. Demand has dropped from 176 to 169 to 111 over the last three periods. The post-peak regime (Periods 10-13) shows an average demand of 163.75. Using a Recent_N approach with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this stabilization at a lower volume while acknowledging the downward trend. This prevents overstocking as we enter mid-May (Period 14), which typically sees a shift away from heavy denim in favor of lighter seasonal wear. Lead time is consistently 0, so I will use 'calculate' to reflect the observed history.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: Average demand from Period 10-13 has declined to 164 units (a -68% drop from the Period 8 peak of 521). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 448509014 (Slim Mom Denim TRS) is currently in a stable post-spring demand regime after a significant peak in early April (Period 8). The demand for the last three periods (P12-14) was 169, 111, and 107 units, respectively, showing a clear downward trend that is now stabilizing around the 110-unit level. The average demand over the last four periods (P11-P14) is 140.75, but the most recent two periods (P13-P14) average 109. This suggests a new baseline for the late May/early June season. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. I will use the recent_N method with N=4 for mu_hat to capture this lower volume while maintaining some buffer, and recent_N with N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility in the current regime. This approach will balance the service level without accumulating excessive holding costs as the collection moves past its peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at a lower level: Period 13-14 average demand is ~109 units, a significant decrease from the spring peak of 521 units in Period 8. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 448509014 (Slim Mom Denim TRS) continues its downward trend following the mid-spring peak. Recent demand samples show a stabilization at lower levels: P13 (111), P14 (107), and P15 (84). The average demand of the last three periods (N=3) is 100.67 units, compared to the P10-12 average of 181. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Given the seasonality of high-waist denim, we are moving into a summer plateau or further decline. To prevent excess inventory and minimize holding costs ($1.0/unit vs $4.0 profit), I am adjusting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 using a recent window of N=3 to capture the most current demand regime. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue leveraging the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward continues: Period 13-15 average demand dropped to 100.7 units, a significant decrease from the P10-12 average of 181.3 units (-44% change).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' has continued to decline after its spring peak in April (Period 8, demand=521). In the last 4 periods (P13-P16), demand has dropped significantly, averaging approximately 94 units (111, 107, 84, 75). This indicates a post-peak stabilization or a shift into a lower summer-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed throughout the game history. With an current on-hand inventory of 38 units, I need to adjust the OR parameters to reflect this lower demand regime to avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the Profit ($4) vs Holding Cost ($1) ratio. I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent downward stabilizer, as using a longer window would overestimate current demand due to the massive April surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward stabilized further: Period 13-16 average demand is ~94 units, reflecting a post-peak decline of approximately 82% from the Period 8 peak. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 448509014 (jeans) continues to stabilize at a lower level following its spring peak. In Period 17, the demand was 60 units, down from 75 in Period 16 and 84 in Period 15. The average demand for the last four periods (P14-P17) is approximately 81.5 units, while the most recent three periods average 73 units. This downward trend suggests a transition into a summer regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this lower volume accurately while providing enough stability to the OR backend. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the high April/May peaks. This strategy balances service levels with minimizing holding costs as the product exits its peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward stabilized further: Period 14-17 average demand is ~81.5 units, continuing the post-spring decline. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS', a pair of jeans, which usually sees a peak in spring and a decline towards summer. We are now in Period 19 (mid-June). Looking at recent demand history from Period 13 to Period 18, the weekly demand has consistently dropped: 111, 107, 84, 75, 60, 46. The moving average of the last 3 periods (P16-P18) is ~60 units, significantly lower than earlier months. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this clear downward trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=4 to capture the most current, lower demand regime (averaging ~66 units) while still accounting for recent volatility. The L is set to calculated as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Period 16-18 average demand dropped to 60.3 units, continuing the post-spring decline as summer approaches.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' has been in a sustained decline since the spring peak (Period 8). In the most recent four periods (P16-P19), demand has stabilized at a low level, averaging 59 units (75, 60, 46, 55). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory while maintaining a sufficient service level for this current regime, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the most current average demand (~59 units) and sigma_hat similarly to capture the current volatility. This approach balances the risk of stockouts against the relatively high holding cost ($1.00 relative to $4.00 profit) in a declining market.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a low summer level: Period 16-19 average demand is 59 units, representing a -88% decrease from the Period 8 peak.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509014' (Slim Mom Denim TRS) is experiencing a sustained summer decline in demand. The recent demand (Period 16-20) follows a low-volume trend: 75, 60, 46, 55, 38. The mean demand for the last 5 periods is 54.8 units, while the mean for the most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) is 46.3 units, signaling a continued gradual decline as we enter July. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory during this low-demand summer phase (on-hand is 32), I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the most recent downward movement. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 samples to account for current volatility levels. This should allow the OR backend to maintain a lean inventory while still covering immediate demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a low summer level: Period 18-20 average demand dropped to 46.3 units, reflecting a continued gradual decline into July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' has reached a summer stabilized phase, though Period 21 saw a unexpected spike to 109 units (the highest since Period 14), which resulted in a stockout. This spike may indicate a minor summer promotional event or a local peak in demand. The recent 4-period average (P18-P21) is approximately 62 units, significantly lower than the spring peak but higher than June's lows. Given the stockout (on-hand is 0) and the high service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use recent history to capture this slight uptick while remaining cautious of overstocking during the low-demand season. I set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include the recent spike while maintaining context of the preceding low demand. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Minor demand spike observed in Period 21 (109 units), deviating from the ~40-50 unit June average. Sustained summer low remains the primary regime, but volatility has increased.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 448509014 (Slim Mom Denim TRS) showed a significant upward shift over the last two periods (Period 21: 109, Period 22: 165), breaking the previous summer low regime of ~50 units. This likely indicates a mid-summer clearance or a pre-fall interest surge. Given the recent volatile increases, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on the last 3 periods to capture this momentum while maintaining some caution. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in both of the last two periods despite ordering, so I am increasing the demand estimate to avoid further lost sales. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-volatility, high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward detected: Period 21-22 average demand is 137 units, a significant increase from the June average of ~50 units. Potential early pre-fall or clearance activity.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509014' (Mom Denim Trousers) has entered a clear upward demand regime starting in July (Period 21). Historical demand for the last three periods has been 109, 165, and 222, showing a steep accelerating trend (+45% to +50% weekly growth). This aligns with a pre-fall retail ramp-up. We have been under-ordering and stocking out since P21. The period 23 demand was 222 units. To capture this growth and avoid further stockouts, I am switching to an explicit mu_hat forecast. I estimate Period 24 demand will continue this trend, reaching approximately 300 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Choosing sigma_hat recent_N=3 to capture the high volatility associated with this sharp regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime confirmed since Period 21 (July): weekly demand increased from ~50 to 222 (+344% cumulative increase in 3 weeks), likely reflecting pre-fall seasonality for denim.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 448509014 (Slim Mom Denim) is currently in a pre-fall demand surge. After a summer low of ~50 units, demand spiked to 109, 165, and 222 units in Periods 21-23. Period 24 saw a slight cooling to 164 units, but the overall trend since late July indicates a sustained higher regime compared to June. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. The current on-hand inventory is 184 units. Given the transition into late July/early August, demand is expected to remain elevated near the recent average. I will use a recent_N calculation for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (capturing the surge from Period 21 to Period 24) to ensure the OR backend captures this new, more volatile demand level while maintaining a sufficient service level for the upcoming autumn transition.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime since Period 21 confirmed (average ~165 vs summer low of ~50). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 448509014 (Perrie Slim Mom Denim) has shown a significant upward demand shift since Period 21 (July), moving from a summer low of ~50 units to a sustained pre-fall regime averaging ~166 units over the last 5 periods (P21-P25: 109, 165, 222, 164, 170). The most recent two periods (P24-P25) have stabilized at an average of 167 units. This matches the 'pre-fall denim' seasonal pattern identified in Carry-Over Insights. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this new established regime while being sensitive to the volatility seen in P23 (222 units), I will use the last 5 periods (the start of the upward trend) for Mu and Sigma calculations. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the currently observed demand level of ~170 units.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall demand regime for denim confirmed: Period 21-25 average demand is 166 units, a 230% increase from the summer low (~50 units).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is currently in a sustained upward regime as we approach the peak fall season (August). Period 26 saw a demand of 242 units, which is a significant increase from the Period 21-25 average of 166 units. This confirms that the pre-fall surge is intensifying. The inventory is currently at 0 (on-hand + in-transit), meaning we stock out if we don't order enough to meet this week's demand. I am using recent_N (N=6, covering Period 21 to 26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward trend and increased volatility while staying responsive to the August sales peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Fall denim demand surge intensified in Period 26: demand rose to 242 units (+45% vs previous 5-week average of 166). The current regime (since Period 21) averages 178.6 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is currently in a sustained upward regime, which aligns with pre-fall seasonality for denim. Demand in Period 27 reached 294 units, confirming a continuing acceleration (Period 26 was 242). The average demand over the last three periods (P25-P27) is approximately 235 units, and over the last five periods (P23-P27) it is approximately 218 units. Given the momentum and the fact that we have stocked out in four of the last seven periods (under-selling potential demand), I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this peak. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use a recent_N of 5 to prioritize the current growth phase while maintaining enough history to estimate variance during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand regime for fall denim intensifies: Period 26-27 demand averaged 268 units, a +60% increase over the Period 21-25 average of 166 units. Stockouts in 4 of the last 7 periods indicate latent demand exceeds recent sales.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is currently in a strong 'pre-fall' upward regime, driven by late August seasonality. Since Period 21, demand has surged from ~50 units to an average of ~185 units over the last 8 weeks. However, very recent demand (Periods 26-28) is significantly higher, averaging 245 units. Although Period 28 saw a slight drop to 200 units, the frequent stockouts in Periods 21, 22, 23, 26, and 27 indicate that true latent demand often exceeds recorded sales. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this high-demand trajectory and ensure service levels during this seasonal peak, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most intense period of fall denim shopping. This sets a base stock level that targets approximately 245 units (current mean) plus a buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Fall denim demand regime shifted significantly higher from mid-August (Period 26): average demand for P26-P28 is 245 units, despite stockouts suppressing actual sales in 2 of those 3 weeks.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is in a fall denim regime that intensified starting Period 26. While demand in the last two periods (P28: 200, P29: 175) has moderated slightly compared to the surge in P27 (294), it remains significantly elevated compared to the summer lows (~50). The average demand over the last four periods (P26-P29) is approximately 228 units. Given upcoming September seasonality (Period 30), I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this current fall regime while respecting the slight moderation. This balances the risk of stockouts (seen in 4 of the last 9 periods) with the risk of carrying excess inventory. Lead time is stable at 0. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated using the recent 4-week window to prioritize the most relevant data for the current season.

Carry-over insight: Fall denim demand regime (starting P26) is sustained, averaging ~228 units/period, despite slight moderation in late August (P28-P29).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 448509014 (Slim Mom Denim) is in its fall peak season (September). Period 31 results showed a demand of 286, closely following Period 30's 282. The current regime (since Period 26, the start of the fall surge) has an average demand of 246.5 units. However, the most recent sequence (Periods 30-31) indicates demand has stabilized at a higher plateau between 280-290 units. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (6 units). To prevent stockouts during this high-demand period while accounting for the recent plateau, I am using a recent_N approach with N=6 (covering the fall regime start at Period 26) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the slightly lower values from late August with the current September peak. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall denim demand stabilized at a peak plateau in September (Period 30-31), with average demand increasing to ~284 units from the August average of ~228.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is currently in a sustained fall peak regime. Over the last three periods (P30-P32), demand has averaged 272.3 units (282, 286, 249), reflecting consistent seasonal strength in September. While the Period 32 demand (249) was slightly lower than the preceding two weeks, it remains significantly elevated compared to August levels. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 0 periods through historical 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture this stabilized high-demand level while sigma_hat is set using the same window to reflect recent volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the immediate demand without over-ordering as we move further into the season. The backend OR logic will apply the profit/holding cost ratio to determine the safety stock above this mean.

Carry-over insight: Fall denim demand plateau confirmed: Period 30-32 average demand is 272.3 units, maintaining the high-demand regime established in late August.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 448509014 (Slim Mom Denim) is currently in its peak 'fall denim' season. Period 33 witnessed a massive demand spike to 482 units, which is significantly above the recent plateau of ~272 units (P30-P32). This resulted in a complete stockout (on-hand is 0). While some of this might be a single-week anomaly, the broader trend from late August (Period 26) through September shows a sustained high-demand regime. Analyzing the last 8 weeks (P26-P33), demand has averaged approximately 276 units per week, but the most recent 4 weeks (P30-P33) have surged to an average of 324 units. Given the seasonality of denim in the fall (September-October), I will prioritize the most recent regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the shift toward >300 units, while sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to account for the heightened volatility (482 vs 249). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall denim demand spike intensified in Period 33: demand reached 482 units (+77% vs P30-P32 average of 272). The 4-week average (P30-P33) is now 324.75 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 448509014 (Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS) is in a high-demand fall denim season. Recent demand has been volatile but sustained at a high level: Period 33 peaked at 482, followed by 262 in Period 34. The 4-week average (P31-P34) is 319.75 units. I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 to capture this current fall plateau while accounting for the recent spike and subsequent stabilization. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility seen in September and October. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, allowing for just-in-time replenishment. We currently have 153 units on-hand, which is significantly below the expected weekly demand, necessitating an order to maintain service levels during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Fall denim demand remains in a high-regime plateau; Period 31-34 average is ~320 units, despite significant weekly volatility (range 249-482).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Perrie Slim Mom Denim Trout (448509014) is in a post-peak autumn phase. After a significant spike in Period 33 (482 units), the last two periods have shown a cooling trend (262 and 156 units). This aligns with the seasonal transition in mid-October. The current on-hand inventory is 256 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand observation of 156. Since lead time is consistently 0, I want to avoid overstocking as we move further into October and potentially toward the end of the fall denim peak. I will use a recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most recent post-spike demand levels (P33-P35: 482, 262, 156), which averages to approximately 300 units. While this is higher than the last observation, the OR backend's inventory-depletion logic (base_stock - on_hand) coupled with the cap will prevent excessive ordering while ensuring we can meet demand if it stabilizes at the 250-300 range rather than continuing to fall sharply.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward detected in October: Period 34-35 average demand is 209 units, a -35% decrease from the September (P30-P33) average of 324.75 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' has entered a downward regime in October 2019. The post-summer/fall peak (Sept) seen in periods 30-33 averaged ~325 units, but the last three periods (P34-P36) show a decline to 262, 156, and 174 respectively (average ~197). This confirms the 'Period 36' insight that demand is subsiding from its seasonal high. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 266 units. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR target service level is 80%. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To align with the current lower demand level and prevent excess holding costs as the season winds down, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the October trend, reflecting the most recent stabilization around 200 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed in October: Period 34-36 average demand is 197.3 units, a ~39% decrease from the September (P30-P33) average of 324.8 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS has transitioned from its September peak (average ~324 units) to a lower October regime. In the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has been 262, 156, 174, and 166 respectively, averaging approximately 189.5 units. The Carry-over Insights for Period 36 and 37 correctly identified this downward shift. Period 37 concluded with 100 units on hand and 0 in transit. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To better align with the current late-October demand level and avoid excessive holding costs as the season progresses, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the specific post-peak behavior observed throughout October (P34-P37) while still acknowledging the slightly higher demand at the very start of the month.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in October at a lower level: Period 34-37 average demand is 189.5 units, a -42% reduction from the September peak average of 324.8 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a post-peak autumn demand phase for denim. Historically, demand for this SKU peaked in September (P30-P33 avg: ~325) and has slowed down in October (P34-P38 avg: ~189). Looking at the calendar, we are approaching the holiday season (mid-to-late November into December), which often triggers a secondary demand spike for fashion items. Period 38 saw a demand of 189, slightly higher than the preceding three weeks (range 156-174), suggesting stabilization or the beginning of a pre-holiday uptick. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To balance the risk of a November spike against the recent lower October average, I will use a recent_N window for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I'm selecting N=5 for mu_hat (covering the entire October stabilization period P34-P38) to capture the current baseline of ~189 units. I will use N=10 for sigma_hat to incorporate the higher volatility seen during the transition from the September peak. This approach allows the OR engine to maintain a service level appropriate for potential year-end demand while respecting the demonstrated cooling of the fall peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in October (P34-P38) at an average of 189.4 units, representing a significant but stable reduction from the September peak. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' has reached a stable post-peak phase in late autumn. Since the significant September surge (P33 reached 482 units), demand has consistently moderated. For the most recent six-period block (P34-P39), demand has averaged approximately 179 units (262, 156, 174, 166, 189, 126). Period 39 (126 units) is on the lower end, but consistent with the general October/November stabilization pattern observed in the carry-over history. Actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking as we move further into November, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current stable regime average of ~179 units. This balances the higher levels of mid-October with the recent softening, providing a responsive base stock level for the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized in the post-peak autumn period (late Oct-early Nov). Period 34-39 average demand is 178.8 units, showing consistent moderation from the September high-demand regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has shown a consistent downward trend since the September peak. The last four periods (P37-P40) show demand of 166, 189, 126, and 119, averaging 150 units. This suggests the autumn regime is subsiding as we move further into November. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=4 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the most recent stabilization at the lower ~150 unit level. This approach balances the risk of overstocking in a declining demand phase while maintaining enough inventory to satisfy regular demand. On-hand inventory is 99, so provided L=0, the OR backend will order approximately 50-70 more units to reach a base stock level covering current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed in November: Period 37-40 average demand is ~150 units, a -16% decrease from the late-October average (P34-P39) of 178.8 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is currently in a late-fall downward trend as we approach late November (Period 42). Historical data shows demand has dropped from a September peak (~320 units) to an average of roughly 138 units over the last five periods (P37-P41: 166, 189, 126, 119, 82). The most recent demand (82 units) is the lowest in this regime, suggesting a continued decline as the season transition progresses. The service level requirement is high (q \u2248 0.8), but with a holding cost of $1.0 vs. $4.0 profit, we must avoid overstocking in a declining market. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining a buffer. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed in late November: Period 37-41 average demand is 136.4 units, with the most recent period dropping to 82 units, indicating a continuation of the post-fall seasonal decline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), we observed a massive demand spike in Period 42 (289 units) following a consistent downward trend (Period 41 was 82 units). This spike likely coincides with 'Cyber Monday' or early December shopping, a common seasonal peak for 'Mom Denim' as gift-giving and winter shopping commence. Because Period 42 resulted in a stockout (sold 172 of 289 demand), the 289 figure represents true latent demand. I will shift the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this recent spike while acknowledging the higher volatility (sigma_hat). I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to average the steady decline with the sharp spike, effectively preparing for continued December strength. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward detected in Period 42 (Dec 2019): Demand spiked to 289 units (+252% vs Period 41), likely driven by early December/Cyber Monday retail activity, breaking the previous two-month downward trend.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), a demand spike of 289 units occurred, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales, breaking the previous downward trend. However, Period 43 saw a significant drop to 69 units, which is typical for the post-promotion 'lull' before the final Christmas surge. The item is a 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim', which has shown high seasonality throughout the year (spring and fall peaks). Given the current date of December 9th, we are approaching the final peak of the holiday season. The spikes in Periods 8 (521) and 33 (482) suggest that this product can experience very high volatility. I am choosing an EWMA method for mu_hat with a gamma of 0.5 to catch the holiday trend without overreacting to the single low Period 43, while setting an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during peak gift-giving seasons. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility detected: Period 42 spike (289) followed by Period 43 drop (69) indicates high variance in December retail patterns. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday period (Date: 2019/12/16). Demand for denim has been volatile recently: a large spike in Period 42 (289 units), followed by a significant drop in Periods 43-44 (69 and 85 units). This likely reflects the transition from Cyber Monday peaks to steady mid-December sales, potentially followed by a pre-Christmas bump. The mean demand for the last 3 periods (P42-P44) is 147.7 units, and since the promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be confirmed as the actual lead time, our inventory target (base stock) only needs to cover the current period's demand. With 151 units on hand, we are currently positioned to meet a demand level close to the recent average. However, given the high volatility (sigma) observed during holiday spikes, I will use a conservative mu_hat based on the last 3 weeks to account for recent volume while maintaining a higher sigma_hat to protect against another holiday-related spike before the game ends in Period 47.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. Historical data for the 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' suggests a significant demand surge occurred in early December (Period 42/Nov 25: 289 units), followed by a notable decline and stabilization in the subsequent three weeks (Period 43-45: 69, 85, 56 units). This pattern is consistent with post-Cyber Monday and mid-December retail lulls before the final Christmas surge and post-holiday clearance. The 3-period average (P43-P45) is 70 units. Given the seasonality of denim (often a gift item or purchased for post-holiday refresh), demand may remain low or slightly increase for year-end sales. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect this current post-peak stabilization. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the reduced volatility after the Period 42 spike. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Period 43-45 demand averages 70 units, a significant decrease from the Period 42 surge of 289 units. Holiday volatility confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 43-46) shows a stabilization at a lower level following the early December spike (Period 42). The last four weeks of demand are 69, 85, 56, and 43, averaging approximately 63 units. This reflects the typical end-of-year/post-holiday decrease for non-winter-specific apparel like denim. Given the current on-hand inventory of 126 units and the observed mean demand of ~63, the stock levels are sufficient to cover the next two periods without a new order, especially since the lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower late-December regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility in recent weeks. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the downshift and avoids over-ordering, keeping holding costs low while maintaining a safe service level.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization confirmed: Period 43-46 demand average is 63.25 units, showing a sustained decrease from the early December surge.
