Today's date is 2019-02-11. We are in the late winter season where sweatshirt demand typically remains steady or starts to slightly taper as spring approaches, but historical data shows a slight upward tick recently (88 units). The promised lead time (L) is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now arrives in time to satisfy Period 1 demand. To maximize profit and avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs, I need to cover Period 1 demand. Given the average is 82 and the most recent value is 88, I will forecast 88 units for this period. Since on-hand inventory and in-transit units are currently 0, I will order 88 units to meet the expected demand immediately.",

Given historical data averages around 80 units and the recent P1 demand was 51, I will forecast Period 2 demand at approximately 75 units (averaging the historical 81 and the recent 51 with a weight toward history). Since I have 37 units on-hand and lead time is 0, I need to bring my total inventory to 75-80 units to cover Period 2's demand and avoid stockouts.

Historically, this item saw high demand (average ~94) in mid-February, likely due to colder weather or early spring shopping. However, demand has since cooled down: P4 (76), P5 (74), and P6 (61). This downward trend aligns with seasonal shifts as weather warms up in late March/April, reducing the need for sweatshirts. The average demand over the last three periods (P4-P6) is 70.3 units. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to maximize profit (R_t = $4 * sold - $1 * ending_inventory). Current on-hand inventory is 29.

{
  "rationale": "The product is a 'Top in soft sweatshirt fabric', which is highly seasonal towards cold weather. Period 46 is Dec 23, 2019, covering the Christmas week. Historical data shows demand spikes around key calendar events (e.g., Black Friday Period 42: 420 units). While sweatshirt demand remains in a high winter regime (avg ~180-200 units excluding peaks), the Christmas/Late December period typically sees a final surge for gifts or cold-weather essentials followed by a potential post-holiday slump in early January. In Period 45 (last week), demand was 163. I expect Period 46 (Christmas week) to be slightly higher, potentially around 180-200. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Current on-hand is 72. I need to order enough to fulfill this week's demand while maintaining a buffer for the first week of Jan (Period 47), though I should begin being cautious about overstocking as mid-winter peaks may subside later in January. Targeting an inventory position of ~220 units to cover Period 46 demand and provide safety stock for the end of the game.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The current date is December 30, 2019 (Period 47). This period represents the transition from the Christmas/New Year holiday peak into early January. Historically, the 'Petar Sweatshirt' saw a pre-game demand of ~80 units per week in January 2019. In the most recent period (P46, Dec 23 week), demand dropped significantly to 87 units from the mid-December levels of ~160-210, signaling the end of the holiday shopping surge and a return to the winter baseline. For Period 47, demand is expected to remain in the 75-90 range as shoppers return to normal winter patterns and post-holiday clearance begins. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 133 units. Since projected demand (approx. 85) is well-covered by the existing stock (133), and holding costs are $1/unit, I will place a zero order to draw down the surplus inventory while maintaining a sufficient safety buffer for the next period.",
