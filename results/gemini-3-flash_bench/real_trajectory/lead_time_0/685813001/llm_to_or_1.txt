Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' (Men's Sweater). Historical demand samples for the last 5 weeks are [75, 84, 83, 80, 88], showing a stable mean of around 82 units per week with relatively low variance. The promised lead time is 0. Since this is the first period and the demand is steady, I will use a conservative approach (default methods) to establish a baseline. The 'default' method for mu_hat will use the mean of all samples (82) multiplied by (1+L) = 1, setting the base stock to cover current period demand. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level q is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), which the OR backend will calculate automatically. No changepoints are detected yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand for Period 1 was 51 units, which is lower than the initial historical data average (82 units). This suggests the sweatshirt might be exiting its peak season as we move further into February. However, with only one period of data, I will use a conservative approach (N=5) to capture the trend while still respecting the provided history. Lead time remains 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples to slightly adjust for the lower initial observation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a soft sweatshirt (Jersey Basic). Historical demand (Jan-Feb) was [75, 84, 83, 80, 88]. Period 1 demand was 51 (unexpectedly low) and Period 2 was 96 (lost 6 sales due to stockout). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on Period 1 and 2 'conclude' messages. We are entering late February/early March; demand remains steady for basics. Given the stockout in Period 2 (96 demand vs 90 available), I need to ensure the mu_hat reflects recent higher demand levels and the volatility. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent mean (~83-84) and variance, rather than the lifetime average which includes the lower P1. Period 3 decision occurs before arrival/demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th, 2019. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a basic cotton jersey top. We are entering early March, where demand for sweatshirts typically remains steady before transitioning into spring. Observed demand for the first three periods has been 51, 96, and 92. The starting samples (Jan/early Feb) were in the 75-88 range. There is a visible step-up in demand starting from Period 2 (averaging ~94 in the last two weeks). Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). On-hand inventory is very low (2 units), so we need to ensure the order covers the expected demand for the current period. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the higher recent demand levels while keeping L at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P2: average demand increased from ~82 to ~94 (+15%).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' (Men's basic jersey top). Current date is March 11, 2019. Observed demand history: [75, 84, 83, 80, 88] (prior) and [51, 96, 92, 76] (live). While the carry-over insight noted a shift in Period 4, the demand in Period 4 actually dropped back to 76. Looking at the aggregate, demand is volatile but generally hovers around 80. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all 4 concluded game periods. The target service level (q) is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), and the OR engine will use this to set safety stock. Given the slight volatility and the drop in P4, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the live performance while smoothing the P2/P3 spike, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance observed in live play compared to the prior samples.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th (Period 6). The SKU (Petar Sweatshirt) belongs to the 'Jersey Basic' category. Historical demand analysis shows a baseline of ~82 units initially, which shifted to an average of ~94 units between P2 and P3, followed by a stabilization/dip in P4-P5 (average 75 units). Since mid-March is the transition from late winter to early spring, sweatshirt demand may experience volatility or a slight seasonal decline compared to the peak winter/transition weeks. Observed lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory currently stands at 22 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs (given the lower demand in the last two weeks), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the shift from the high P2-P3 peak toward the more moderate recent demand, providing a balanced forecast for mu_hat. This targets roughly 85 units for the single-period window (L+1=1).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is a Men's sweatshirt. Historically, demand was around 82 in the first few samples, peaked during Feb/early March (Periods 2-3 at 96 and 92 units), and has since shown a downward trend (76, 74, 61) as we move further into spring. This downward trend is seasonally expected for a sweatshirt. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period. On-hand inventory is currently 33. To prevent overstocking in a cooling demand phase, I will use recent history (N=4) to calculate mu_hat, which captures the peak and the subsequent cooldown (avg 75.75). Setting N=4 for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent local volatility. These parameters will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected lower demand while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend observed: demand dropped from peak ~94 (P2-P3) to avg ~70 over the last 3 periods (P4-P6), aligned with seasonal shift into spring.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 1st, 2019. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' with a soft brushed inside, which is seasonally transitioning out of peak demand as spring progresses. Historical demand shows a clear cooling trend: after a peak in February (P2-P3 avg ~94), demand has steadily declined in March (P4-P7: 76, 74, 61, 54), with the most recent three periods averaging 63. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 8, I will align parameters with this 'cooling' regime. I'm using N=3 for demand and volatility to capture only the post-peak trend (P5-P7), as earlier data is now unrepresentative of the spring slowdown. This will prevent over-ordering as temperatures rise.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline confirmed (March): demand dropped from Feb peak of ~94 to a 3-period avg of 63 (-33%) as product enters the low season.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8, 2019. The SKU is a 'Petar Sweatshirt', a seasonal item that typically peaks in late winter and declines as spring progresses. Recent demand history shows: P1-P4 (Feb/early Mar) avg ~80, P5-P7 (mid/late Mar) avg ~63, followed by a sudden spike in P8 (April 1st) to 84. This spike is likely a deviation or a short-lived spring promotional event rather than a regime reversal, as sweatshirts generally lose relevance in April. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the P8 spike exceeding expectations. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the P8 outlier while acknowledging the low inventory, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the lower late-season average (~68 units/period) while providing enough safety to recover from the stockout. I will use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat as well to reflect the recent volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets an appropriate service level.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is entering a low-demand season as spring progresses (April 15th). Historically, demand peaked in February (avg ~94) and has trended downward. Recent demand shows significant volatility: Period 8 spiked to 84 (resulting in a stockout), while Period 9 dropped to 62. The average of the last 4 periods (P6-P9) is 65.25. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in the history. To handle the recent volatility while acknowledging the seasonal decline, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to calibrate the safety stock to the current volatility (std dev in this regime is approx 13), ensuring we cover a potential spike like Period 8 without excessive holding costs for a seasonal item.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', a warm garment with a soft brushed inside, which is seasonally entering its low-demand period as spring progresses. Demand in Period 10 dropped significantly to 32 units, following a trend of decline identified since March. The average demand over the last three periods (P8-P10) is 59.3, but the most recent observation (32) suggests the decline is accelerating as temperatures rise. On-hand inventory is 45 units. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods (same-period arrival). Given the clear seasonal downward trend for a sweatshirt in late April, I will use a short window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the model to react to the slowing demand while maintaining a buffer, as use of the full history would significantly overestimate current needs.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand collapse confirmed in late April: Period 10 demand (32) is 50% lower than the March average (~63), reflecting the transition out of sweatshirt weather.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is highly seasonal. As of Period 12 (late April), demand is strictly declining as the weather warms. Historical data shows demand was ~80-90 in Feb, dropped to ~60-70 in March, and has averaged ~41 in the last two periods of April (P10: 32, P11: 50). Carry-over insights confirm this seasonal collapse. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs in a low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current late-April demand level (~48 average), which is more representative than the historical average. This will lower the base stock to match current demand while maintaining the required service level.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813001 is a 'Petar Sweatshirt', a seasonal item. As of Period 13 (May 6th), we are moving deep into the warmer spring/summer season when demand for sweatshirts typically hits an annual low. While Period 12 saw a sudden spike in demand (98 units), this likely represents a final 'stock-up' or promotional clearing rather than a sustained trend, as the prior three periods averaged only ~38 units. Inventory is currently 0 with no pipeline. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'order-up-to' behavior within the same period. I will use a recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the generally lower late-spring demand (averaging ~53 units including the spike) while maintaining a safe buffer for the observed volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the recent variance between low demand and the Period 12 outlier.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813001 is a 'Petar Sweatshirt', a seasonal item. As of Period 14 (mid-May), demand continues to show high volatility (Period 12 spiked to 98, while Period 10 was 32). The carry-over insights indicate a general downward trend as we move into warmer months, but recent data suggests a stabilization around a mean of 60. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P10-P13) had demands of 32, 50, 98, and 62, averaging 60.5. Although P12 was high, it was likely an outlier or a clearance-driven spike since on-hand inventory was exhausted (sold 61/demand 98). The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations consistently show a 0-period lead time. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current stabilized 'post-collapse' demand levels, which helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering based on the much higher February/March peaks (80-90+). A sigma estimate set to recent_N (N=4) will account for the recent high volatility (SD \u2248 27).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late May (Period 15). The product is a soft sweatshirt, which is entering its off-season. Demand has been highly volatile but generally declining since the peaks in February/March. Recent demand history shows: P10 (32), P11 (50), P12 (98 - potential outlier/clearance spike), P13 (62), and P14 (35). The average demand over these last 5 periods is 55.4 units per week. Given the on-hand inventory of 49 units and the clear downward seasonal trend for a sweatshirt in late spring/early summer, the goal is to maintain lean stock to minimize holding costs while covering immediate needs. The observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current lower demand regime while accounting for the recent volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the current date (May 27) represents the cusp of summer in many regions, which explains the low demand for a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT'. Historical demand has been highly volatile but generally trending downwards from its February peak. The last two periods (P14 and P15) showed demand of 35 and 26 units respectively, confirming a low-season floor. However, a significant spike occurred in Period 12 (98 units), suggesting potential residual volatility or localized events. With 52 units currently on-hand and 0 in-transit, our current stock covers approximately two periods of the current low-demand average. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs ($1/unit/period) while maintaining coverage against occasional spikes, I will use a recent demand window to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=5 captures the late-spring collapse (averaging ~50 units) while accounting for the Period 12 spike. This ensures we don't over-order into a summer slump where holding costs would erode the $4 profit.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is entering a clear low-demand seasonal phase in June. Historical demand over the last 3 periods (P14-P16) has been consistently low (35, 26, 23), averaging 28 units per period, which is a significant drop from the March/April averages. Previous carry-over insights confirmed a seasonal collapse transitioning out of sweatshirt weather. On-hand inventory is currently 55 units, which is approximately double the current average weekly demand. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments have arrived with actual lead time 0. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low seasonal demand, the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a small safety buffer. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand regime, and L will remain at default (0).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813001 (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) is in a clear seasonal decline as June (summer) begins. Demand has steadily dropped over the last four periods from 35 (P14) to 16 (P17). Currently, there are 39 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given the recent demand average (last 4 periods mean \u2248 25) and the most recent observation of 16, the 39 units on-hand likely cover at least 1.5 to 2 weeks of expected demand. Because the profit per unit ($4) is only 4x the holding cost ($1), the backend OR logic will naturally favor leaner inventory. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the summer low-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat reflects the current downward trend while sigma_hat handles the moderate volatility seen in May/June. No new carry-over insight is needed as the seasonal decline was previously noted and is simply continuing as expected.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT', which is highly seasonal. As of Period 19 (June 17), demand has hit a significant low as temperatures rise. The last four periods show demand of 26, 23, 16, and 12, clearly trending downward into mid-summer. The average demand over these last 4 weeks is 19.25. Historically, lead time (L) has remained consistently at 0 periods. Given the low profit margin relative to holding cost (4:1 ratio) and the high stock on-hand (27 units) relative to recent demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect the current floor of the demand regime. I am targeting a base stock level that aligns with the current low-demand trend to avoid excess holding costs for a seasonal item entering its off-peak period.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-season demand regime confirmed (June): Demand dropped below 20 units/period (avg 14 last 2 periods), representing a >80% decrease from February peaks.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Petar Sweatshirt) is in a deep low-season phase as we enter late June. Demand has consistently declined from February peaks (>90 units) to single digits (8 units in P19). The 3-period average (P17-P19) is 12 units, and the 5-period average (P15-P19) is 17 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. With 19 units currently on-hand and 0 in-transit, we are already carrying enough inventory to cover the anticipated very low demand for the next 1-2 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this sustained low-demand regime while maintaining a small buffer for residual sales. No order is expected from the OR backend because on-hand (19) > base_stock (estimated < 19).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. The product (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) is in a deep low-demand regime characteristic of the summer season. Recent demand observations for Periods 17-20 are 16, 12, 8, and 6 respectively, showing a continuous downward trend that has now stabilized at single digits. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs ($1.0/unit/period) relative to profit ($4.0/unit), I am narrowing the demand estimation window to the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this low-season baseline. This will set a lower base stock level that aligns with current consumption (mean ~10 units) rather than the historical average (~50+ units). On-hand inventory (18) currently covers approximately three weeks of current demand, so the OR engine should correctly trigger small or zero orders based on the current parameter settings.

Carry-over insight: Sustained summer low-season demand confirmed (July): Demand has stabilized in the single digits over the last two periods (avg 7 units), approximately a 90% reduction from February peak levels.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'PETAR SWEATSHIRT' (soft sweatshirt fabric), currently at Period 22 (July 8). We are in the depths of the summer low season. Demand peaked in February around 90 units and has steadily declined through spring and summer, hitting single digits in late June. Period 21 saw a temporary spike to 20 units (possibly due to a minor clearance event or localized weather shift), but the broader trend remains extremely low. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 following the stockout in P21. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' (historically 0 periods). For demand, I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the summer regime (averaging approx 11 units/period), which prevents overreacting to the single P21 spike while accounting for the low-demand environment. This ensures the OR backend orders enough to meet this minimal demand without accumulating excess holding costs.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813001 (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) is currently in a deep summer low-season, but Period 22 observed a sudden and significant demand spike to 46 units, which is a major outlier compared to the single-digit demand seen in previous periods (average of ~10 units from P17-P21). This spike could be a mid-summer promotion or a temporary clearing event. Given that sweatshirts are typically a cold-weather garment, I must balance the risk of missing another spike against the high holding cost ($1.0/unit vs $4.0 profit). The promised lead time is 0 and consistently arrives in the same period. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to account for this recent uptick while remaining cautious that demand might return to low-season levels quickly. Sigma_hat will be set via recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility introduced by the Period 22 spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Significant mid-summer demand spike observed (46 units), diverging from the established single-digit summer low-season regime (avg ~10).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant and sustained departure from the summer low-season. After Period 21, demand spiked to 46 (P22) and remained elevated at 35 (P23), following a period of single-digit demand. This suggests a new demand regime or a mid-summer peak for the PETAR Sweatshirt. For Period 24, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=2 to capture this specific shift (avg ~40.5). Lead time remains consistently at 0 based on history. These parameters will allow the OR engine to increase the base stock significantly to cover the new higher demand volume while maintaining the required service level, despite the high relative holding cost (25% of profit).

Carry-over insight: Sustained mid-summer demand increase confirmed starting P22: Demand shifted from single digits (avg ~10) to a new regime (avg 40.5 over P22-P23), a 300% increase.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The sweatshirt SKU is currently in a period of late-summer volatility. After a significant demand spike (avg ~40 units in P22-P23), Period 24 demand softened to 18 units. This likely represents early back-to-school interest or periodic promotions rather than a return to the single-digit mid-summer lows seen in June/July. Given the current date (late July), we are entering the pre-autumn transition where demand for sweatshirts typically begins a more consistent upward trend. I am using a recent_N window of 3 periods (P22-P24) for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture this new, higher regime (avg 33.0, std ~14.1) compared to the summer floor. Moving to this recent window ensures the OR backend raises the base stock to protect against further spikes while acknowledging the lower demand in P24. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813001 (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) is entering August (P26). Historical demand samples from January/February 2019 (75-88 units) and recent carry-over insights suggest that sweatshirts experience a significant mid-to-late summer buildup as retailers prepare for autumn/back-to-school seasons. Since Period 22, we've seen a volatile but higher demand regime (46, 35, 18, 36) compared to the single-digit June/July lows. The average demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 33.75 units. Given the transition into August, I expect demand to continue trending upward toward the early-year levels. I am setting L=0 based on the consistent observed history of 0-period lead times. \u03bc\u0302 is set using a recent_N of 4 to capture the summer-end shift while remaining adaptive to the volatility seen in P24 (18 units). \u03c3\u0302 is set using recent_N=4 to reflect the current high variance in this regime shift.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813001 (Petar Sweatshirt) is currently in a mid-to-late summer phase (Mid-August). A significant demand shift was previously noted around Period 22 (July), where demand jumped from single digits to a higher, more volatile regime. Looking at the last 5 periods (P22-P26), demand has been: 46, 35, 18, 36, 24. This yields an average of 31.8 units. This increase likely reflects early back-to-school shopping or late summer preparation for autumn, as sweatshirts are categorical 'Jersey Basic' items. The lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent sustained shift without over-indexing on the single peak of 46, I am using recent_N=5 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This aligns the base stock calculation with the current seasonal uptick observed over the last month.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the PETAR sweatshirt (SKU 685813001) is entering a new phase. After a summer lull, demand spiked significantly in Period 27 to 73 units (a 200%+ increase over the previous period), likely signaling the beginning of late summer/early autumn sweatshirt sales as temperatures start to drop or back-to-school shopping commences. The current on-hand inventory is 0, making this a critical restock point. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the upward demand regime that started around Period 22 (avg ~39 units), while allowing the latest spike (73) to pull the mean higher to protect against lost sales. Lead time (L) remains 0 as confirmed by recent history.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge starting P27 (73 units): Likely start of pre-autumn/back-to-school seasonality for sweatshirts, breaking the mid-summer plateau (~30 units).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26), which marks the beginning of the autumn/back-to-school transition for apparel like sweatshirts. Historical data shows a clear demand surge starting at Period 27 (73 units) and continuing at Period 28 (55 units), following a mid-summer average of approximately 30 units. This is a sustained upward shift in demand. The carry-over insight from Period 28 identifies this as the pre-autumn seasonality shift. Current inventory is near zero (1 unit), and lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this growth while maintaining an appropriate service level for a higher-margin item ($4 profit vs $1 holding), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window of 2 periods (P27 and P28) to reflect this new high-demand regime. This provides a forecast mean (calculated as (1+L) * average demand) centered around the recent ~64 units/period pace, which is significantly higher than the previous low-season averages.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn transition confirmed: demand in late August (P27-P28) averaged 64 units, a 100% increase over the mid-summer average of 30 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (2019/09/02), moving into early September. The product (685813001, Petar Sweatshirt) is a seasonal item that saw a demand surge starting in mid-August (P27: 73, P28: 55), signaling the transition to the cooler autumn season. However, P29 showed a drop to 34 units. Averaging the last three periods (P27-P29) gives a mean demand of 54.0. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this recent autumn upturn while acknowledging the P29 dip. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by recent history. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility during this seasonal transition. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a clear autumn transition for a sweatshirt product. Historical demand over the last 4 periods (P27-P30) shows values of 73, 55, 34, and 88, averaging 62.5 units despite stockouts in P27 and P30 which suggest trailing demand is likely higher (~70+). The high demand in P30 (88) follows a pattern seen in P27 (73), indicating that demand is volatile but trending upward as the weather cools. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this autumn regime, while using explicit L=0 as historical lead times have consistently been 0. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current high volatility (std dev of 73, 55, 34, 88 is ~24). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, so the backend needs to order enough to cover the immediate demand of this emerging high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn demand volatility confirmed: Demand in early September (P30) reached 88 units, matching early spring peaks and confirming a return to high-season sweatshirt demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (sweatshirt) has entered its peak autumn season. Demand in Period 31 reached 106 units, following a high in Period 30 of 88 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in transit. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I need to ensure the order placed this period (Period 32) covers the current period's demand. Based on the demand in P30 (88) and P31 (106), the market is trending strongly upwards. I will use the last 5 periods (P27-P31) to capture this surge, which gives an average demand of approximately 71 units, but given the acceleration to 106, I will use an explicit forecast of 110 units for mu_hat to avoid stockouts in this high-growth phase. Sigma_hat is set using recent volatility (N=5) to reflect the current high-demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn peak confirmed: Demand accelerated from ~70 (P27-P30) to 106 (P31), indicating a return to maximum seasonal capacity.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '685813001' (PETAR SWEATSHIRT) is entering its peak autumn/winter season. Demand has rapidly accelerated from ~34 units in late August to 88 (P30), 106 (P31), and 142 (P32). Period 32 demand (142) significantly exceeded the previous spring peak (~98), confirming a new high-season regime. In the last three periods (P30-P32), we stocked out completely each time despite increasing orders, indicating that historical averages and the current order cap are under-forecasting the actual demand trajectory. Given the product's seasonal nature (soft brushed inside sweatshirt) and the calendar date (late September), demand is expected to remain high or continue rising. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the most recent demand of ~142, and increase sigma_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the high volatility seen during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-season peak confirmed in late September: demand reached 142 units in Period 32, a 34% increase over the previous autumn peak (106) and a 45% increase over the spring peak (98).

The demand for the Petar Sweatshirt is experiencing a massive seasonal surge as we enter peak autumn (late September). Period 33 demand reached 261 units, which is a 84% increase over Period 32 (142 units) and significantly higher than any previous peak. We are currently out of stock (ending on-hand = 0). Given the sharp upward trajectory into October, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 300 to anticipate further growth in this peak period. Sigma_hat is also set explicitly to 60 to account for high volatility during this rapid scaling phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so the 'calculate' method is appropriate for L.

Carry-over insight: Sustained hyper-growth autumn peak: Demand in Period 33 (261) nearly doubled the previous week's record (142), indicating a high-velocity transition into the season's maximum demand period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813001 (sweatshirt) is in its peak autumn demand phase. After a extreme peak in Period 33 (261 units), demand cooled to 156 units in Period 34. This likely indicates a 'stabilization' at a high level rather than a collapse, as October usually maintains strong sweatshirt demand. The current on-hand inventory of 195 units covers the most recent demand (156) but may be insufficient if demand spikes again or even remains steady, given the lead time mechanism. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the high-velocity autumn period (avg ~186), which balances the extreme peak and the recent correction. I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (standard deviation > 50 in recent weeks) seen during this seasonal transition, ensuring the OR backend targets a robust base stock.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-season plateau: After the hyper-growth peak (261), demand stabilized at 156 units (Period 34), establishing a high-volume autumn baseline (avg ~186 over P32-P34).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October (2019-10-14), and demand for sweatshirts is consistently in its high-season plateau. Demand over the last four periods has been 142, 261, 156, and 191, yielding a recent average of approximately 188 units. While Period 33 was a hyper-peak (261), the subsequent periods (156 and 191) suggest a stabilization at a high volume baseline rather than a continued exponential climb. Given the product's peak seasonality in late autumn, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current plateau (~188 units per period). I am using recent_N for sigma_hat as well to account for the high volatility observed during this seasonal ramp-up (std is significantly higher than earlier in the year). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-season demand plateau confirmed for October: average demand over P32-P35 is 187.5 units, representing the established autumn baseline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late October (P37), which is the peak high-season for sweatshirts. Demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P33-P36) following a significant spike in P33 (261). The demand values for P34-P36 are 156, 191, and 137 respectively, resulting in a recent 4-period average of 186.25 units. This matches the 'autumn baseline' identified in previous insights. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the high volume and some volatility (standard deviation is significant), I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the most current seasonal volume while smoothing out the P33 outlier's influence. I will use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect the current high-season variance. This approach ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level that covers the 180-200 unit demand range expected for late October.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019, which is deep into the autumn/winter sweatshirt season. Demand remains high but appears to have moved past the hyper-growth phase seen in late September (P33: 261 units) to a stable, high-volume plateau. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P34-P37) is 159.75 units, closely matching the latest observation of 155. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs for this sweatshirt SKU, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current plateau, as the overall historical mean is still depressed by summer low-season data. Sigma_hat is also set using N=4 to capture the high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn plateau confirmed for late October: Demand has stabilized around 160 units (avg P34-P37 is 159.75), representing a high-season steady state after the September peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 39 (early November), which is the peak high season for core sweatshirt products. The most recent demand was 230 units (P38), which exceeded the recent autumn plateau of ~160 units (as noted in Period 38's insight). Looking at the transition from P31 (106) to P32 (142) to P33 (261), we observed a hyper-growth phase. While demand dipped slightly after that, the P38 jump to 230 suggests a secondary November peak or sustained high volatility as temperatures drop further. With on-hand inventory at 0 and lead time consistently at 0 periods, we must ensure the base stock is high enough to cover this elevated demand. I will use the last 5 periods (P34-P38) to calculate mu_hat, as this captures the post-peak stabilization and the recent re-acceleration (avg for P34-P38 = 192.8). I will set N=5 for sigma_hat as well to account for the high variance (ranging from 137 to 230).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-season demand re-acceleration (November): Period 38 demand reached 230 units, a 44% increase over the late-October average plateau of ~160 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a soft sweatshirt, currently in the high-demand autumn/winter season (mid-November). Recent history shows a high-volume demand plateau with volatility. Period 38 saw a spike to 230 units, followed by 163 units in Period 39. The average demand over the last four periods (P36-P39) is approximately 171 units. Given the transition into late autumn/early winter, demand is expected to remain high or potentially increase toward holiday peaks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure adequate service levels during this high-utility period while managing holding costs, I will use a 4-period moving average (recent_N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the most recent autumn plateau while responding to the recent re-acceleration in November.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-season demand plateau in November: average demand over P36-P39 is 171 units, maintaining the elevated autumn baseline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a sweatshirt, which is currently in its peak autumn/winter season (mid-November). Recent demand (P34-P40) has stabilized into a high-volume plateau with an average of 170 units. Specifically, the last four periods (P37-P40) show demands of 155, 230, 163, and 158. This confirms the 'autumn plateau' identified in the carry-over insights. To capture this current demand regime while accounting for recent volatility (the 230 spike in P38), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 (covering P34-P40) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the stabilization after the hyper-peak in P33. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which I will continue to use. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects the high current seasonal demand while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the observed late-season spikes.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is just before the major retail event of Black Friday (Nov 29). As the product is a 'soft sweatshirt', we anticipate a significant demand spike due to holiday shopping and colder weather. Looking at the history, Period 38 (Oct 28) saw demand hit 230, and Period 41 (Nov 18) saw 195. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P38-P41) is approximately 186.5. Given the upcoming Black Friday week, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-season baseline, while the OR backend's service level logic (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) and safety stock will provide a buffer for the expected volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-season demand confirmed through November: average demand over P38-P41 is 186.5 units, maintaining the peak autumn/early winter baseline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 42 reached 420 units, more than double the average of the preceding four periods (~186.5). This spike aligns with the 2019/11/25 date, which is Black Friday week, a major seasonal peak for apparel like sweatshirts. Given the transition into early December (holiday shopping season), I expect demand to remain significantly elevated above the autumn baseline of ~170. I am choosing an explicit mu_hat of 300 to capture the expected post-Black Friday but high-season December demand, which is higher than the October/November average but likely lower than the extreme Black Friday peak. sigma_hat is set explicitly higher (100) to account for the increased volatility seen during recent peak periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 based on historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Sustained holiday season peak confirmed: Period 42 demand (420) represents a 125% increase over the November baseline (~186), driven by Black Friday.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685813001 is a sweatshirt, which is currently in its peak winter demand period (December). Historically, we saw a massive spike in Period 42 (Nov 25) to 420 units, coinciding with Black Friday. Period 43 demand settled to 166 units, which is consistent with the late-autumn baseline (avg ~170-190). As we are now in December, demand is expected to remain high due to holiday shopping and cold weather, though potentially lower than the Black Friday peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To manage the current high-season volatility and ensure sufficient stock while honoring the OR backend's inventory calculation, I will use a recent_N strategy for both demand and sigma. Specifically, I'll use N=6 (P38-P43) for mu_hat to capture the elevated November-December regime (avg ~222 units, heavily influenced by the P42 spike) and sigma_hat (std ~98). This covers the extreme volatility seen recently while preparing for sustained winter demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained post-Black Friday demand stabilization: Period 43 demand (166) returned to the established high-season baseline after the outlier peak of 420, confirming the ~170-190 range for late Q4.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), following the Black Friday peak (P42 demand: 420) and the subsequent stabilization phase. Demand in Period 44 was 211, following 166 in Period 43. The current average demand over the last three non-outlier periods (P41, P43, P44) is approximately 190.6 units, which is consistent with the established high-season baseline for December sweatshirt sales. As the game ends in Period 47, we have 3 periods of demand remaining (P45, P46, P47). Given the current on-hand inventory of 96 and a lead time of 0, we need to ensure the base stock covers the demand for the current period. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the stable late-Q4 demand (P41-P44) while smoothing the Black Friday outlier, providing a robust mean for the final weeks of the year.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), which is right at the peak of the winter holiday season and the high-demand period for sweatshirts. Historically, we saw a massive demand spike at Period 42 (Black Friday, 420 units) followed by a stabilization in the 160-210 range (Periods 43-45). Given the holiday week, demand is expected to remain firm or potentially spike again before the typical post-holiday drop-off in January. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. Based on the last 4 periods (P42-P45), the average demand is 240 units, but this is heavily skewed by the Black Friday peak. Removing the outlier (420), the average for P43-P45 is 180 units. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the high-velocity Q4 baseline while allowing the OR engine to buffer against the high variance observed in late November. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to account for the heightened volatility of the holiday season.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-season holiday baseline confirmed: Average demand for December (P43-P45) is 180 units, maintaining the elevated autumn/winter regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Historical demand for the PETAR SWEATSHIRT shows a significant seasonal peak in late autumn/early winter, specifically spiking at Period 42 (Black Friday, 420 units). Post-holiday demand (P43-P45) averaged 180 units. However, Period 46 shows a sharp decline to 87 units, which is consistent with the post-Christmas slowdown in footwear/apparel. Given that we are now entering the final week of the year and heading into January, I expect demand to continue receding from the high-season baseline toward the early spring levels observed at the start of the year (~75-85 units). On-hand inventory is currently high (256 units), which already covers nearly three weeks of the current reduced demand level. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the recent downturn while maintaining some weight on the December throughput, but avoid ordering more until inventory burns down.

Carry-over insight: Sustained post-holiday demand decline observed: Period 46 demand (87) is approximately 50% lower than the December average (~180), signaling the end of the winter peak season.
