This is a maternity staple, suggesting relatively stable demand, but potentially higher during nesting phases or seasonal shifts. Calendar: Period 1 is 2019-02-11. Valentine's Day is coming up, though its impact on maternity leggings is likely neutral. Historical Demand: The provided samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) are [73, 48, 65, 94, 49], with a mean of ~66 units per week. Lead Time: Promised L=0, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period and be available for this period's demand. Current Inventory: 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Order Logic: I need to cover Period 1 demand. Since the mean is 66 and the standard deviation is relatively high (varied between 48 and 94), I will aim for a buffer to avoid stockouts. I will target approximately 85 units to ensure high service level given the lack of initial stock.",

Assuming a safe demand buffer around 75 units, and considering I have 22 on-hand, an order of 63 would bring me back to 85.

Forecasting: I expect demand for P16 to be around 67 units. To optimize for a 0-day lead time where the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, I aim to keep inventory lean to avoid the equal holding charge. A target inventory of ~75 units (on-hand + order) covers the expected demand with a small safety buffer for variance (sigma in this regime is approximately 6-8 units), specifically targeting an ending inventory of ~8 units to match holding cost against potential lost sales risk.",

Recent demand (P43-P46) has been: 43, 54, 47, and 42 units respectively. This represents a post-holiday stabilization at a lower late-winter level, averaging approximately 46.5 units per week over the last four periods. Given that the lead time is 0 periods (same-period arrival), I only need to cover the demand for the current period (P47). As this appears to be the end of the year/beginning of the new year, demand is expected to remain in this stable 40-50 unit range. On-hand inventory is currently 28 units. To meet an expected demand of ~50 units while maintaining a small buffer (targeting ~55 units total availability), I will order 27 units. This minimizes holding costs (which equal the profit margin) while mitigating the risk of stockouts during the final period.",
