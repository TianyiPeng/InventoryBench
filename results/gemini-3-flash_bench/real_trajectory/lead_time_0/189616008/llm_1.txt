I will forecast a 'return to high seasonal mean' rather than the 342 anomaly, but with enough buffer for the Christmas week. I'll target 100 units to cover expected high demand while mitigating the risk of post-holiday excess, as Period 47 will be late December/early January where demand for heavy jersey typically starts a slow seasonal decline.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Significant demand anomaly detected in Period 45 (342 units), representing a 1120% increase over the previous week. This is likely an outlier due to specific late-December promotional or climatic events and should not be used as the new baseline mean.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is 'Heavy jersey' leggings. We are currently in Period 47 (Dec 30, 2019). Reviewing history, we see a massive demand spike in the last two periods (P45: 342 units, P46: 210 units), following a winter regime that averaged ~71 units in early December. This recent surge is likely driven by post-Christmas sales and extreme winter weather. In both P45 and P46, we stocked out at 100 on-hand, missing significant sales (total demand 552, total units sold 200). Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Inventory is currently 0. While the 342/210 figures include some outlier/holiday event intensity, late December/early January for 'heavy jersey' items remains a high-demand period. I will forecast demand for P47 at a more conservative level than the extreme peak but significantly higher than the early winter average to capture the remaining surge without excessive holding risk. I estimate P47 demand at 150 units. Since on-hand is 0 and lead time is 0, I will order 150 units to meet this expectation.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Significant year-end demand surge confirmed: P45-P46 showed demand of 342 and 210 units respectively (vs Dec avg of ~72), likely due to holiday sales and peak winter seasonality for heavy jersey items.",
