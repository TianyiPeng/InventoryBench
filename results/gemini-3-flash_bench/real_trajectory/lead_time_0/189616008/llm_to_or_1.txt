Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of the observation period (Period 1, 2019-02-11). The product is 'Heavy jsy long leg' (Leggings), which typically sees steady demand for basic apparel. Historical samples (N=5) from January/early February show demand ranging from 42 to 89, with a mean of 72.6 and standard deviation of 19.3. The promised lead time (L) is 0. Since there is no prior 'conclude' message yet to evaluate actual lead time performance, I will use the 'default' lead time (0). Given the low sample size (5) and relatively stable demand across the provided history, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent mean and volatility. This helps the OR backend establish an initial base stock level that balances the $19.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a basic legging. Historical demand shows a slight upward trend in recent weeks (P1 demand was 63, following historicals of 89, 42, 81, 71, 80). The average demand across all 6 data points is 71. The promised lead time is 0, and the observation from Period 1 confirms an actual lead time of 0 (ordered in P1, arrived in P1). Therefore, the supply chain is highly responsive. We will use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the most recent behavior while maintaining the lead time at 0. Since we have a total of 6 data points now (5 historical + 1 from P1), N=5 is chosen to capture the most recent trend while smoothing outliers like the '42' observed in Jan.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Heavy jersey long leg' legging (Divided Basics), which is a stable wardrobe staple. Current date is Feb 25th. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) show a mean of 72.6 units. Period 1 demand was 63 and Period 2 saw a spike to 93. The promised lead time of 0 is being realized (confirmed by arrivals in P1 and P2). The on-hand inventory is currently very low (1 unit). Given the recent demand volatility (high of 93, low of 42), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (including the 3 most recent samples provided in the prompt + Periods 1 and 2) to capture the current demand level which is slightly higher than the initial Jan/Feb average. Setting L to default (0) as it is consistent. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N to balance the older Jan data with the fresh Feb spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1043.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a basic jersey legging, which typically shows steady year-round demand but may experience slight fluctuations. Currently, we are in early March. Historical data from Jan/Feb shows demand samples of [89, 42, 81, 71, 80], averaging ~72.6. Recent game history performance in Periods 1-3 shows demands of [63, 93, 57], averaging ~71. The promised lead time is 0, and observations from Periods 1-3 confirm that orders arrive in the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since the demand remains relatively stable around 71-72 units per week, I will use recent_N with N=5 (combining historical and game data) to captures the mean and variance. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level q is 0.95 (19/20), which the OR backend will calculate using these parameters.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a 'Divided Basics' jersey legging, a high-frequency staple item. Based on the 5 pre-game historical samples (89, 42, 81, 71, 80) and 4 in-game demand observations (63, 93, 57, 80), there is no clear evidence of a significant demand regime shift or seasonal spike yet. The average demand across all 9 data points is approximately 72.8 units per week. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (all available data) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this variability and ensure sufficient coverage for the next period, as on-hand inventory is currently low (17 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1900.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189616008 (Divided Basics Leggings) has just completed 5 periods of play. The current date is 2019/03/18. Reviewing the historical data (Jan-Feb) and the game history (Feb-Mar), demand is showing a steady upward trend: Period 1-5 demands were 63, 93, 57, 80, and 114. The record of 114 in Period 5 caused a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). Looking at seasonal context, we are moving into spring, which often sees stable or increasing demand for basic jersey leggings. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 5 trials. Given the stockout and the clear recent demand spike, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture the upward trajectory (avg of 57, 80, 114) rather than the long-term average, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to prevent further stockouts. I will use 'calculate' for L as the 0-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 5: weekly demand increased to 114 (+42% vs previous average of 80), resulting in an inventory stockout.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product 'Heavy jsy long leg' (Leggings) has shown a recent demand shift. In Period 5, there was a significant spike (114) that led to a stockout. However, Period 6 saw a regression towards the historical mean (69). Analyzing the history (63, 93, 57, 80, 114, 69), the average is roughly 79 units per period. The carry-over insight noted a shift at P5, but given the volatility (CV ~ 0.25), I will use a window of the last 4 periods (P3-P6) to capture the recent higher variance and the slight upward trend (mean of 80) while acknowledging the spike in Period 5. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (100% reliability over 6 periods), so L remains at 'default'. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 covers the current demand profile while balancing the holding cost ($1) against unit profit ($19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1219.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 begins on April 1st. Analysis of the demand history shows a baseline average of approximately 80 units (Weeks 1-4). Week 5 saw a jump to 114 units, but Weeks 6 and 7 have stabilized lower at 69 and 67 units respectively. The carries 54 units on-hand. Lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed arrive in the same period). Given the product is 'heavy jersey long leggings' (a basic item), the spike in Week 5 (mid-March) might have been a minor seasonal or promotional bump. Since the last two weeks have returned to values near 70, I will use a recent_N calculation with N=3 to capture the most recent regime which reflects a mean demand of ~83 units ( (114+69+67)/3 ). This provides a balanced forecast that accounts for the recent volatility without overreacting to a single spike. Profit/Holding cost ratio is high ($19 vs $1), targeting a high service level.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-08. Analysis of the product (Jersey Leggings) and recent demand shows that the surge observed in Period 5 (demand=114) was a temporary outlier rather than a sustained regime shift, as demand in Periods 6, 7, and 8 stabilized at 69, 67, and 67 units respectively. This stabilization is consistent with the early historical average (~72). Actual lead time consistently remains at 0 periods. Since the 'regime shift' at Period 5 did not persist, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4: Periods 5-8) to capture the current stable demand level (average ~79) while accounting for the Period 5 volatility in sigma calculations. This provides a safe buffer against recent peaks while acknowledging the return to lower volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-Period 5 peak: average demand for P6-P8 is 67.7 units, effectively nullifying the previous regime shift insight of 114/week.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand for the last four periods (P6-P9) has been 69, 67, 67, and 44, showing a cooling trend compared to the P5 peak of 114. The average demand since the peak subsided (P6-P9) is 61.75 units. I am using recent_N=4 to capture this stabilization and slight downward trend. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 74, with no units in transit. The OR backend will use these parameters (L=0, mu_hat based on the last 4 periods) to determine the order quantity needed to cover next period's demand while balancing the high profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand has settled into a lower regime post-P5 peak, with the last 4 periods (P6-P9) averaging 61.75 units, a decrease from the initial samples and the mid-cycle spike.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 189616008 shows a clear downward trend following the Period 5 peak (114). The demand over the last four periods (P7-P10) has been 67, 67, 44, and 35, averaging 53.25 units. This is significantly lower than the overall historical mean. Given the current date (April 22), the product (Heavy jersey leggings) may be entering a lower-demand seasonal phase as weather warms. The promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met in every period without delay. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this declining demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent stabilized demand pattern (avg ~53), and maintaining L=0.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward trend confirmed: Last 4 periods (P7-P10) average 53.25 units, significantly below original samples (avg 72) and previous spike.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189616008 (Leggings/Tights) is experiencing a period of declining demand as it moves deeper into the spring season (late April). Historically, demand peaked in mid-March (P5: 114 units) and has since trended downwards, with the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaging 52.6 units (67, 67, 44, 35, 50). The most recent period (P11) saw a slight uptick to 50 units, but the overall trend remains significantly lower than the early-season peaks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. To avoid overstocking and excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level (governed by the high profit/holding cost ratio), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5. This capture the post-peak downward regime while being responsive to the slight recovery seen in the most recent week.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed post-peak: 5-period average (P7-P11) is 52.6 units, reflecting a lower seasonal demand regime compared to the early-March peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Heavy jsy long leg' (189616008) has transitioned into a lower, stable regime following a peak in early March. The last six periods (P7-P12) have shown demand values of 67, 67, 44, 35, 50, and 48, establishing a clear downward shift compared to the initial samples (average 72) and the Period 5 spike. Specifically, the last 4 periods average 44.25 units. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this stabilization around 50 units while maintaining enough variance (sigma_hat) to avoid stockouts during minor fluctuations. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. I am targeting an inventory level that covers the current period's demand (L+1=1) at a 95% service level (Profit $19/Holding $1 ratio implies a very high critical fractile of 0.95).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Last 6 periods (P7-P12) average 51.8 units, marking a consistent lower-demand regime for late Spring compared to late Winter/early Spring levels.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-13. Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward trend and stabilization since the peak in early March (Period 5). Demand over the last 7 periods (P7-P13) has averaged 49.5 units, significantly lower than the initial sample average (~72) and the Period 5 spike (114). The most recent demand was 36 units. As we move further into late Spring, demand for 'extra sturdy leggings' appears to be settling into a lower, stable regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N window (N=7, covering the stabilization period from P7 to P13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this lower-demand regime while maintaining a responsive service level to manage potential volatility at this lower level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Last 7 periods (P7-P13) average 49.5 units, establishing a late-Spring baseline for this heavier fabric SKU.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a 'Heavy jersey long leg' legging SKU. Historically, demand for this heavier fabric peaked in March (P5: 114 units) and has since shown a steady downward trend as the weather warms into late spring/early summer. The last 4 periods (P11-P14) have seen demand of 50, 48, 36, and 29 units respectively, averaging 40.75. The most recent period (P14) hit a low of 29 units. Given this cooling trend for a 'heavy' garment, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (N=4) to capture this latest stabilization at a lower level, effectively lowering the base stock to prevent excessive holding costs during the off-season. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages in history arriving within the same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward trend continuing as summer approaches: 4-period average (P11-P14) is 40.75 units, significantly lower than the previous late-Spring baseline of ~50 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is 'Heavy jersey long leg' leggings. There is a clear downward demand trend as the weather warms up, corroborated by the Carry-Over Insights. Demand has dropped from an early March peak of 114 to a recent 4-period average (P11-P14) of 40.75, with the most recent Period 15 demand at 40. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Given the seasonal nature of 'heavy jersey' entering summer, a lower demand regime is expected to persist. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized lower-demand regime (P11-P15 average is roughly 40.6 units), ensuring we avoid overstocking a winter-weight item as summer begins.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward trend continuing as summer approaches: 5-period average (P11-P15) is 40.6 units, reflecting a clear seasonal decline for heavy jersey leggings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $305.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Heavy jersey long leg leggings', which is seasonally entering the low-demand summer period (Current Date: June 3, 2019). Historical data shows a clear downward trend: demand in Period 16 was just 18 units, the lowest to date. The carry-over insights confirm this decline, with the recent 5-period average (P11-P15) at 40.6 units, but the most recent two periods (P15-P16) averaging only 29 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid high holding costs during this off-peak season while maintaining a sufficient service level (95% target given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 to capture the most recent downward trend (P13-P16 demand: 36, 29, 40, 18). This focuses the forecast on the current lower-demand regime (~30 units/period) rather than the higher spring levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward trend continuing as summer approaches: 4-period average (P13-P16) is 30.75 units, reflecting a further contraction for heavy-duty legwear in June.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Heavy jsy long leg' (heavy jersey leggings), which is highly seasonal and currently in a clear downward trend as we enter mid-June (Period 18). Demand in the last 4 periods (P14-P17) has been 29, 40, 18, and 16, following a steady decline from the early spring peaks. The most recent 3 periods average 24.6 units. Given the 'heavy sturdy' description, demand is expected to remain low or continue dropping during the summer months. To prevent overstocking and excessive holding costs, I am reducing mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 4-period window (P14-P17) to capture this low-demand regime (avg ~25.75). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward trend continuing as summer approaches: 3-period average (P15-P17) is 24.7 units, showing a sustained low-demand regime for heavy leggings in June compared to May average (~40).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616008' (extra sturdy jersey leggings) continues its expected seasonal decline as we move further into June (Period 19, Date 2019/6/17). Demand over the last 3 periods (P16-P18) has averaged 20.33 units (18, 16, 27), which is a significant drop from the May average (~40) and April average (~60). The current inventory of 17 units is nearly sufficient to cover the expected demand for one period at this new regime, but given the service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), a small buffer is appropriate. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will set N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent, lower demand levels (average 20.3, std 5.8) to prevent overstocking of this 'heavy' winter/spring product during the summer months.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for mid-June: 3-period average (P16-P18) dropped to 20.3 units (-34% vs late-May average of 30.75), signaling the end of seasonal relevance for heavy-duty leggings.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Heavy jersey leggings) continues its clear seasonal decline as we enter late June (Period 20). Period 19 demand was 13 units, following a trend of 27 and 16 units in previous weeks. The 3-period average (P17-P19) is 18.7 units. As the product is 'extra sturdy jersey', it is becoming seasonally irrelevant for summer. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering during the off-season. Lead time L=0 remains consistent throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late June: 3-period average (P17-P19) dropped to 18.7 units reflecting a continued seasonal contraction for heavy leggings in summer.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616008' (extra sturdy jersey leggings) has shown a consistent seasonal decline as we enter July (Summer). Historical data from Period 1 to now shows demand peaking in early March (P5: 114) and steadily dropping through June (P17-P20 demand: 16, 27, 13, 15). The current 3-period average is approximately 18.3 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19), the service level remains high, but mu_hat must be adjusted down to reflect the summer trough to avoid excess inventory of heavy-fabric items. I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this low-demand regime (avg ~17.75 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at low summer trough: 4-period average (P17-P20) is 17.75 units, reflecting minimum seasonal demand for heavy-duty leggings in July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is extra sturdy 'heavy jersey' leggings, which aligns with the observed seasonal decline in demand as summer progresses. The last 3 periods (P19-P21) show very low demand values of 13, 15, and 9 respectively (average 12.33). The 4-period average (P18-P21) including the slightly higher P18 is 16.0. Given this product category and the current heat of July, demand is expected to remain at this low trough. I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized summer low regime while ignoring the higher Spring data. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at summer trough: 3-period average (P19-P21) is 12.3 units, signaling the expected minimum seasonal relevance for heavy-duty leggings in July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Heavy jsy long leg' (extra sturdy jersey leggings) is in a deep summer trough, as evidenced by the seasonal decline from March (avg ~80-114) to July (avg ~12-15). Current date is July 15, 2019. The last 3 periods (P20-P22) have seen demands of 15, 9, and 15, resulting in a 3-period average of 13.0. Lead time remains stable at 0. Since the inventory is 14 units and the demand regime is consistently low (approx 13 units/period), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current trough. This ensures we don't overstock during the minimum demand window while maintaining on-hand inventory roughly equal to one period of demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616008' (heavy jersey leggings) is currently at its seasonal demand trough in late July (Period 24, 2019/07/22). Recent demand history shows a consistent decline: P19-P21 averaged 12.3 units, but P23 saw a slight relative uptick to 24 units, causing a stockout of the small safety cushion (5 units ordered, 0 remaining on-hand). The 5-period average (P19-P23) is 15.2 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the overall low seasonal demand for heavy leggings in summer, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the current trough while reacting slightly to the P23 demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the variability seen in the last few weeks (range 9 to 24). This strategy ensures enough stock for the current localized demand while keeping holding costs low during the off-season.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in summer trough but showed a brief fluctuation in P23 (24 units), resulting in a stockout. Period (P19-P23) average is 15.2 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189616008 (Heavy jersey leggings) is currently in a summer demand trough, with recent demand (P19-P24) averaging 14.7 units per period. Although P23 saw a minor spike to 24 units causing a temporary stockout, P24 returned to the low-demand regime with 12 units. Given the date (July 29), we are at the peak of summer where heavy-duty leggings have minimal seasonal relevance. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6, P19-P24) to capture this stabilized low-demand regime (average ~15) while maintaining enough stock to prevent another minor stockout. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The parameters will target the lower seasonal baseline while acknowledging the volatility observed in P23.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189616008 (Heavy jersey leggings) is currently in a sustained summer trough. Period 25 demand was 15 units, consistent with the low-demand regime observed since mid-June (avg ~15 units). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Given the date (August 5th), we are reaching the end of the peak summer heat, but major seasonal transitions to fall demand typically occur later in August. Currently, I will maintain the summer baseline parameters. I'll use recent_N (N=6, covering Periods 20-25) to capture the current low-demand stability (avg 15.0). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the reduced volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough stability confirmed: Period 20-25 average demand is 15.0 units, defining the minimum seasonal baseline for heavy-duty leggings in July/August.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616008' (heavy sturdy jersey leggings) is currently in its summer trough, but Period 26 showed a significant demand spike to 33 units (the highest since Period 15), causing a stockout. This spike, along with the previous fluctuation in Period 23 (24 units), suggests that while the seasonal baseline is low, volatility is increasing as we approach late August/early September, likely due to 'Back to School' interest in basic apparel like extra sturdy leggings. The current date is August 12. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while demand begins its transition out of the summer minimum, I am shifting from the long-term summer average to a more recent window (N=5), which captures the recent 33-unit spike. This will raise the inventory target to accommodate the emerging upward trend and increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing in August: Period 26 spike (33 units) and Period 23 (24 units) suggest an early transition out of the summer trough, likely driven by 'Back to School' seasonality for sturdy basics.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616008' (extra sturdy jersey leggings) is entering the 'Back to School' season (mid-to-late August). Historical data from similar apparel cycles suggests demand will shift from the summer trough (avg ~15) back toward autumn levels. Period 26 (33 units) and Period 27 (24 units) confirm this upward trajectory. To avoid the stockouts experienced in P23 and P26, I am increasing \u03bc\u0302 to reflect a 4-period recent average (P24-P27) of 21 units, which captures the immediate momentum better than the summer average. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I'll maintain a slightly higher \u03c3\u0302 using the same 4-period window to buffer against the observed volatility as demand scales back up.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition from summer trough to autumn baseline confirmed: Period 26-27 average demand is 28.5 units, compared to the P20-P25 average of 15.0 units, indicating 'Back to School' seasonal recovery.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616008' (heavy jersey leggings) is exiting its summer trough and entering the 'Back to School' and autumn ramp-up period. Historically, demand for this sturdy basic item was high in February/March (avg ~75-80) and hit a minimum in July (avg ~15). Recent data shows a confirmed upward shift: demand in Period 26 was 33, Period 27 was 24, and Period 28 was 30. This averages to 29.0 units over the last 3 periods, nearly double the summer baseline. Given the date (August 26) and the product's heavy fabric description, I expect this upward trend to continue or stabilize at a higher baseline as cooler weather approaches. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back to School / Autumn ramp-up confirmed: Demand for heavy leggings increased from a summer trough of 15 units to a 3-period average (P26-P28) of 29 units (+93%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $703.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, marks the peak of the 'Back to School' season and the transition into Autumn. Demand for this SKU (extra sturdy/heavy leggings) has consistently ramped up from its summer trough (~15 units) to a much higher level. The last four periods (P26-P29) show demands of 33, 24, 30, and 37, averaging 31 units per week. The most recent demand (37) resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0), suggesting that the upward trend is accelerating as weather cools. I am setting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this recovery while keeping sigma_hat reflective of recent volatility (N=4). The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. This strategy ensures we maintain a high service level for a high-profit item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) during a confirmed seasonal upturn.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp-up accelerating: Demand in Period 29 reached 37 units (highest since Period 11), confirming that the 'Back to School' recovery seen in late August is trending toward the higher Autumn/Winter baseline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 189616008 (heavy jersey leggings) is in a significant 'Back to School' and Autumn ramp-up phase. The period 30 demand reached 47 units, the highest since early March (Period 4/5), and we have experienced two consecutive stockouts despite increasing orders. This confirms a clear upward regime shift as we transition from the summer trough (avg ~15) to a cooler-season baseline. The product description of 'heavy sturdy jersey' is highly seasonal for the current date (September 9). To capture this accelerating trend and avoid further lost sales, I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P26-P30) to focus on the ramp-up periods (mean ~34.2, implying mu_hat for L=0 of 34.2), but because P30 reached 47, I'll use an 'explicit' value of 50 to stay ahead of the curve. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp-up accelerating: Demand in Period 30 reached 47 units (matching the high levels seen in P4/P5), confirming a full return from the summer trough and suggesting a sustained Autumn/Winter demand regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616008' (extra sturdy jersey leggings) is experiencing a sharp seasonal recovery. Demand has increased for five consecutive periods (P27-P31), rising from a summer trough of ~15 units to 56 units in the most recent period. This aligns with 'Back to School' and the transition to Autumn, where heavier-weight basics become more relevant. Significant stockouts occurred in P29 and P30 due to underestimating the ramp-up speed. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (average ~39 units per period) to capture the trend while remaining slightly conservative, but I will increase sigma_hat using an explicit value of 15; this higher volatility estimate will push the base stock higher to protect against further demand spikes during this accelerating regime. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp-up confirmed: Demand has increased for 5 consecutive periods (P27-P31), reaching 56 units. The product is entering its peak seasonal window for the Autumn/Winter period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'heavy sturdy jersey' legging, which strongly correlates with Autumn/Winter seasonality. After a summer trough in July (avg ~15 units), demand has followed a clear 'Back to School' recovery trajectory: P29 (37), P30 (47), P31 (56). While Period 32 demand cooled slightly to 35 units, the overall trend since mid-August confirms a higher demand regime. Given the date (late September) and the product description, we are entering the peak sales window. To capture this, I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering P27-P32) to calculate mu_hat, which yields a mean of ~38.2 units per period. This balances the recent peak of 56 with the more moderate P32 reading. I will use the same N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed during this ramp-up phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand regime established: Demand transitioned from a summer trough (~15 units) to an Autumn baseline averaging 38.2 units (P27-P32), consistent with the 'heavy jersey' product profile.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616008' (heavy sturdy jersey leggings) is entering its peak seasonal window (Autumn/Winter). Period 33 demand spiked to 71 units, the highest since the March peak (P5), which resulted in a total stockout (on-hand is 0). This confirms the 'Autumn ramp-up' noted in carry-over insights is accelerating. The last 4 periods (P30-P33) show demand of 47, 56, 35, and 71, averaging 52.25 units per period. Given the product's description and the current date (late September), demand is expected to remain high or increase as weather cools. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand regime, I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated volume and volatility, rather than the lower long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Period 33 demand (71 units) is the highest since Period 5, confirming the seasonal transition for heavy jersey leggings; 4-period average (P30-P33) is now 52.3 units vs summer trough of 15.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616008' (heavy jersey leggings) is in its peak Autumn/Winter demand regime. Period 34 demand was 69 units, following a peak of 71 units in Period 33. The last 4 periods (P31-P34) average 57.75 units, confirming a sustained high-demand level significantly above the summer trough. The product reached a stockout in Period 33 and ended Period 34 with only 9 units on-hand, indicating a need for aggressive replenishment. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current high-demand baseline while allowing for the observed weekly volatility (ranging from 35 to 71 in the last month). This approach ensures we maintain sufficient stock for the seasonal peak while managing the holding cost of this established regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak sustained: 4-period average (P31-P34) is 57.75 units, confirming a high-demand regime for heavy-duty leggings that matches the initial Spring levels (P1-P5).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product, heavy-duty jersey leggings, is in its peak Autumn/Winter demand regime. Period 35 demand (67 units) remains strong and aligned with the established high-demand regime observed over the last several periods (P33: 71, P34: 69, P35: 67). The current 5-period average (P31-P35) is 65.6 units, reflecting a stabilization at the upper end of the seasonal range. Given the consistently high demand and recent stockouts (P33), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (Period 31-35) to capture this current peak level without inclusion of the late-summer transition data. Since the promised lead time of 0 has been consistently met (actual lead time = 0 across all concluded periods), L will remain at default. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand volatility during this high-volume period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak stabilized: 3-period average (P33-P35) is 69 units, confirming a consistent high-demand plateau for heavy leggings in October.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Heavy jersey long leggings', which is seasonally strong in Autumn/Winter. Demand significantly peaked in Period 33-35 (averaging 69 units) but showed a sharp drop in Period 36 to 29 units. Given the late October date (2019/10/21), this drop might be a temporary fluctuation or the start of a new plateau after the initial Autumn surge. However, looking at the early year history (Period 1-4), demand sustained between 57-93 units. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture the current peak regime (averaging 59 units over P33-P36) while accounting for the recent low sample. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 56 units. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods, the OR engine will determine if the current 56 units sufficiently cover the immediate demand or if a small replenishment is needed to protect against the high volatility (sigma) observed during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand volatility observed in late October; Period 36 dropped to 29 units after a 3-period peak average of 69 units. Monitoring if this is a temporary dip or a regime shift.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is an extra sturdy jersey legging, a product highly sensitive to cooler weather. We are currently in late October, which is peak season for this heavy-duty basic. Historically, demand spiked in Period 5 (114 units) and recently reached high levels again in Periods 33-35 (averaging 69 units). Period 36 and 37 showed a temporary dip (29 and 41 units), but given the product type and calendar date (late Oct/early Nov), this is likely volatility within a high-demand regime rather than a downward shift. The last 5 periods (P33-P37) show an average demand of 55.4 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (N=5) to capture this current high-demand baseline while smoothing the recent volatility. This provides a safety buffer against stockouts as we enter November. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased variance seen in recent weeks (highs of 71 and lows of 29). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Autumn demand volatility noted; despite a dip in Periods 36-37 (avg 35), the 5-period average (P33-P37) of 55.4 units confirms a sustained late-Autumn high-demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Heavy jersey leggings', which is seasonally relevant for the Autumn/Winter period. Current date is Nov 4th. Historically, demand peaked in early October (P33-P35 avg ~69) but has recently cooled to a more stable late-Autumn level. The 3-period average (P36-P38) is 35.3 units, significantly lower than the October peak but consistent with a mid-season plateau before potential late-year surges. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized late-Autumn demand (avg ~35) rather than being skewed by the high October peak, while maintaining enough stock to cover for moderate volatility. On-hand is 51, and with L=0, the order will arrive in time to satisfy Period 39 demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in late October: 3-period average (P36-P38) of 35.3 units reflects a mid-Autumn plateau for heavy leggings, down from the early-October peak of ~69 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is entering mid-November. Historically, demand for 'heavy sturdy jersey leggings' peaked in early October (P33-P35) and has recently stabilized at a mid-Autumn plateau. The last four periods (P36-P39) show demand values of 29, 41, 36, and 41, averaging 36.75 units per week. This reflects a consistent demand regime as we approach the winter season. The lead time remains 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals in the historical conclude messages. Although Period 39 resulted in no order being placed by the OR engine (due to high existing inventory and a projected lower demand compared to the October peak), the current on-hand inventory of 10 units is insufficient for the expected demand of ~37 units. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized Autumn regime (P36-P39) and ensure the base stock covers the anticipated demand plus a safety buffer for late-season volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Autumn demand regime stabilized: 4-period average (P36-P39) is 36.75 units, reflecting a post-peak plateau for heavy-duty leggings in November.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product (heavy jersey leggings) is in its stable Autumn/Winter regime. We've observed a post-peak plateau (P36-P40) following the early October peak. The 4-period average (P36-P39) was 36.75, and Period 40 demand was 31. The 5-period average (P36-P40) is 35.6 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Seasonal knowledge suggests that demand for heavy basics like these leggings should remain stable or potentially increase slightly as temperatures drop further in late November. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this stable post-peak plateau (P36-P40) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the most current demand behavior for the late-Autumn season.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Autumn demand regime stabilized: 5-period average (P36-P40) is 35.6 units, reflecting a post-peak seasonal plateau for heavy-duty leggings in November.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (heavy jersey leggings) is currently in a stable late-autumn demand regime. For the last 6 periods (P36-P41), demand has averaged 35 units (29, 41, 36, 41, 31, 32), showing significant stabilization after the October peak of 69-71. The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the holiday season. While many categories see a December spike, heavy jersey basics often maintain a steady plateau or slight uptick. Given the stability over the last 6 periods, I will use recent_N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this mid-autumn regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Nov 25) saw a significant demand surge to 84 units, likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales for this 'heavy jersey' staple. This is a 162% increase over the previous 5-period average (~32 units). I am treating this as a verified seasonal holiday regime shift. Demand is expected to remain high during the early December holiday shopping window. With on-hand inventory currently at 0 due to the P42 stockout and a promised lead time of 0, I must set mu_hat to cover this new peak. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat based on the P42 spike (84) and general holiday expectations, while using 'recent_N' with N=7 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility without over-penalizing for a single-week event.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand surged to 84 units (+162% vs Nov average of 32), signaling the start of the peak December retail window for heavy-duty leggings.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/09), we are in the peak holiday season for 'heavy jersey leggings'. Period 42 showed a massive holiday surge to 84 units, and Period 43 demand remained high at 59 units. The 2st week of December usually sees sustained high demand as part of the Christmas shopping peak. Average demand for the last two periods (P42-P43) is 71.5 units, which is a significant increase from the November plateau of ~33 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts during this high-profit window ($19/unit profit vs $1/unit holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the immediate holiday demand level (approx 71.5 units per period). I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the increased volatility of the holiday season.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge sustained: Average demand for early December (P42-P43) is 71.5 units, a +116% increase over the November baseline of 33 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing significant seasonal demand volatility for heavy jersey leggings. Last period saw a sharp drop to 28 units, contrast to the previous spike of 84 and 59 units in early December. This volatility makes fixed averages risky. The product category ('extra sturdy jersey') suggests demand may continue until year-end but could drop immediately after Christmas. Given on-hand inventory is 86 units and the recent average (P42-P44) is 57 units, we are currently covered for roughly 1.5 periods. However, to buffer against a final December surge without overstocking into January (when demand for heavy leggings historically starts a slow decline as seen in early samples), I will use an EWMA with gamma=0.5. This allows the model to react quickly to the recent surge while also weighing the most recent dip. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: December demand fluctuated significantly (84, 59, 28) vs November baseline of 33. Demand is expected to remain volatile through the end of the year.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1634.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (late December) experienced an extreme demand surge of 342 units, which is far beyond the 57-116% increases typically seen in the holiday window. This spike likely represents a significant late-holiday 'Divided Basics' rush or clear-out. Because it is now December 23 (Period 46), demand is expected to either peak again for the final shipping window before Christmas or drop sharply as the holiday ends. Given the massive stockout where we sold 86 units against a demand of 342, we are currently at 0 inventory. To maximize profit while respecting the OR backend's attempt to avoid massive holding costs if demand collapses post-Christmas, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I'll forecast a mean of 150 (blending the high demand of P45 with a potential cool-down) to ensure the base stock calculation triggers a robust order that doesn't overreach based on the 342-unit outlier alone. Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand surge in Period 45: Demand reached 342 units (+482% vs previous holiday average), likely representing a final pre-Christmas peak for basics.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616008' (heavy jersey leggings) is at the conclusion of the peak December holiday window. Period 45 saw an extreme outlier demand of 342, followed by a high but reduced demand of 210 in Period 46 (Dec 23). As the current date is Dec 30 (Period 47), demand is expected to drop sharply post-holidays, reverting toward the established winter baseline seen in November and early December (~35-60 units). Using the outlier-skewed mean of the last 5 periods (which includes the 342 and 210) would lead to massive overstocking and high holding costs in the quiet New Year/January period. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 70 units to bridge the gap between the holiday peak and the expected January decline, and use a recent_N sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility seen in December.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand contraction confirmed: Following the extreme spike in P45-P46 (average 276 units), demand is expected to sharply decline toward the Autumn/Winter baseline (~40-60 units) starting P47.
