  "rationale": "Product 253448001 is a 'Push-up bra in microfibre'. Demand history from Jan-Feb 2019 shows a mean of approximately 56 units/week (51, 39, 58, 70, 62). The current date is Feb 11, 2019, which is the week leading up to Valentine's Day (Feb 14). This category (Lingerie/Bras) typically sees a significant seasonal spike during this week due to gifting and retail promotions. Recent history shows an upward trend (70, 62) compared to early Jan. Given the Valentine's Day factor, I anticipate demand for Period 1 to be higher than the historical average, likely in the 70-90 range. Lead time is promised at 0 periods, meaning an order placed now arrives in time for Period 1 demand. To ensure a high service level for this peak week while accounting for the target mean, I will order 85 units. This covers the expected spike and provides a small buffer for variance, minimizing lost sales on a high-margin event.",

Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (order placed in P1 arrived in P1). Current on-hand is 11 units. To cover expected demand of ~60 units and maintain a small safety buffer, I need approximately 70-75 units total available.

In the retail calendar, late February/early March (Period 4, March 4) is a transitional period between Valentine's Day demand and Spring season shopping. Given the lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (orders arrive same-period), the goal is to cover the upcoming Period 4 demand.

I need to order enough to cover Period 46 demand (which happens after this decision) and maintain some safety stock for the transition into January. I estimate Period 46 demand will be around 65-75 units. Ordering 60 units ensures a total available inventory of 110, which comfortably covers a potential peak (like the May/August peaks of ~110 units) while minimizing excess holding costs if demand mirrors the previous week's 65.",
  "carry_over_insight": "December holiday peak confirmed at Period 45: Demand reached 65 units (+44% from previous week), continuing the late Q4 upward trend.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The current date is December 30, right after the Christmas peak. Looking at historical seasonal behavior for this push-up bra, demand peaked in May and August (both around 111-113 units) followed by sharp contractions. The December peak has been more gradual, rising from 45 to 71 units over several weeks. Historically, the periods following a peak show immediate cooling (May peak of 113 dropped to 80/63; August peak of 111 dropped to 68/62). Given the post-Christmas/New Year's timing, I anticipate a drop in demand as the holiday shopping season concludes. Looking at last year's start (Jan 7), demand was 51 units. I expect Period 47 demand to be lower than the P46 peak of 71, likely in the 45-55 range. Current on-hand is 39. With a 0-period lead time, I will order 21 units to bring total inventory to 60, which should comfortably cover the expected post-holiday demand while avoiding excessive holding costs for 39 units that are already on hand.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-Christmas cooling confirmed: Demand rose to 71 in P46, following a 5-week upward holiday trend. Historical patterns suggest a 30-40% drop immediately following major seasonal peaks.",
