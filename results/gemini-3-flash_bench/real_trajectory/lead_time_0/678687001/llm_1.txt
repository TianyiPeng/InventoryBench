The date is Feb 11, which is early spring/late winter, a period typically seeing sustained fitness-related demand following 'New Year's Resolutions'. b) Demand Regime: The five historical data points show a slight softening from mid-January (136) to early February (103), but it remains stable around the 100-110 range. I will forecast demand for Period 1 at approximately 110 units. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now should arrive in the current period's arrival resolution phase and be available for the current period's demand. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 0. e) Order Logic: Since lead time is 0, I must order enough to cover Period 1 demand immediately. To minimize risk of stockouts while considering the $1.00 holding cost (which is equal to the profit per unit), I will target an order slightly above the average to cover potential demand variance without over-committing. An order of 120 units covers the recent average and provides a small buffer.",

Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal strategy for a 0-lead-time environment is to satisfy the current period's demand without carrying over excess stock, as every unit left at the end of the period cancels out the profit of one unit sold. Given the historical mean (~114) and recent variability, I will target an order that brings total available stock (On-hand 40 + New Order) to 120 units.

Moving into late May/early June, demand for sportswear usually remains steady or slightly increases due to outdoor fitness activities. Given the recent average demand of ~90 units and the high target of maximizing profit with a 1:1 Profit-to-Holding ratio, I want to stock enough to cover immediate demand while minimizing excess.

  "rationale": "The SKU '678687001' (Karin Sports Bra) is currently experiencing a massive seasonal demand surge. This is highly consistent with New Year's fitness resolutions, where sports apparel demand typically peaks in late December and January. Period 45 demand was 409 and Period 46 demand was 338. We have stocked out for two consecutive periods despite significant ordering, indicating the regime is far higher than late-autumn averages (~30-50 units). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. For the upcoming Period 47 (Dec 30), we must anticipate continued high volume as consumers enter the first full week of January fitness goals. Given the previous two realizations (409, 338), a forecast of approximately 350-400 units is appropriate. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no in-transit units, I will order 400 units to capture this peak while mitigating stock-out risk, as the holding cost is balanced by the immediate arrival and high probability of sale.",
  "carry_over_insight": "January fitness resolution peak confirmed: Demand surged to 409 (P45) and 338 (P46), representing a 10x increase over the November average.",
