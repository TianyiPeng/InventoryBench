Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the Karin Sports Bra. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 111.2 and a standard deviation of 16.5 over the last 5 weeks. February typically sees stable demand for activewear before the spring ramp-up. The on-hand inventory is 0. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive within the same period (L=0). I will use the baseline statistics from the 5 available samples to set the parameters, targeting a service level of 50% (as Profit=HoldingCost=1.0 results in q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which is what the OR backend's z-score logic will naturally aim for. I am using recent_N=5 to capture the most relevant demand regime.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a sports bra. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) show a mean of 111.2 with a standard deviation of 16.9. In Period 1, actual demand was 99, which is consistent with the pre-game distribution. The promised lead time is 0, and the Period 1 conclusion confirms an actual lead time of 0 (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). Since demand has been stable across the 5 historical samples plus the first period (total 6 observations), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses a localized but sufficient sample size for forecasting while respecting the 0-period lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678687001 (Sports bra) is entering Period 3 (Late February). Historical demand samples (Early Jan to Early Feb) were relatively stable, averaging 111.2 units per week. However, the first two periods of gameplay showed a significant demand increase: Period 1 (99) and Period 2 (141, which resulted in a stockout). February/March often sees a 'New Year/Spring' fitness demand spike for sportswear. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on Period 1 and 2 completions. Current inventory is 0. I will use a recent_N approach to capture the upward demand trend (avg of last 5 historical samples + 2 game samples \u2248 118, but Period 2 was 141 and likely higher if not for the stockout). To prevent further stockouts while balancing high holding costs (equal to profit), I will set mu_hat more aggressively using the last 3 observed demand points to reflect the recent surge.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a sports bra. Historical data and recent periods (P1: 99, P2: 141, P3: 117) show a mean demand of approximately 119 units since Feb 11. Demand is higher than the initial January samples (avg ~111), likely due to a mid-February seasonal pickup in fitness/sportswear (post-New Year momentum). Actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same-period). Currently, on-hand is 0. My goal is to set parameters to satisfy demand for the upcoming period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current February/March trend, and N=4 for sigma_hat to include one more sample for volatility. L remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678687001 (Sports bra) shows stable demand around 110-120 units per week. The date is March 11, heading toward spring where health-conscious and fitness trends typically drive steady or increasing interest in sports apparel. Historical samples (Period 1-4 demand: 99, 141, 117, 112) show a mean of 117.25 and a standard deviation of 17.5. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (P1-P4) confirm actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Based on the profit/holding cost ratio ($1.0/$1.0), the backend calculates a 50% service level base stock (z=0). Currently, inventory is low (7 units on-hand, 0 in-transit). To prevent stockouts for the upcoming period's demand, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current demand level since the pre-game samples (Feb start) and game samples (Feb-March) are consistent. Choosing N=4 for mu_hat captures the specific behavior during the game weeks (mean 117.25) which is slightly higher than the pre-game average (~111).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a sports bra. Demand history shows relatively stable numbers around 110-120 units. Current date is mid-March, which typically shows consistent demand for activewear post-New Year peaks but ahead of summer transitions. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). The inventory currently stands at 0 with no in-transit units. To satisfy upcoming demand, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent behavior while including historical context. Specifically, for Period 6, I rely on the last 5 periods of demand (avg ~117) to set mu_hat, ensuring sufficient stock for same-period arrival. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is approximately 50%, which the OR backend will calculate via the base stock formula.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Sports bra in fast-drying functional fabric', an item typically seeing stable demand but prone to seasonal upticks as spring progresses (March/April). Current demand (Period 1-6) has been relatively stable with a mean of 114.5 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), which implies an optimal service level (q) of 0.5 (z* = 0). The OR backend calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z* * sigma_hat. Since z* = 0, the order targeting will follow mu_hat. I will set L to 'default' (0) as verified by history. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current demand level. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to account for the observed volatility (std ~15.5) which ensures the safety stock calculation is grounded in recent evidence.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Sports bra in fast-drying functional fabric', a seasonal activewear item. Demand history shows a mean of approximately 115 units per week (Samples: 118, 136, 104, 95, 103, 99, 141, 117, 112, 118, 100, 123). Spring (April) typically sees a rise in fitness-related purchases ('New Year resolution' second wave or pre-summer fitness). Current on-hand is 0, having stocked out in Periods 2, 3, 5, and 7, indicating we are under-ordering relative to demand spikes. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 7 ended with 0 inventory and a stockout (demand 123 > available 115), I will use the recent 7 periods of operational history to better capture current demand volatility and prevent stockouts while balancing the high holding cost (Ratio 1:1).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'KARIN SPORTS BRA' is a functional sports item. History shows demand has been relatively stable around 110-120 units, but Period 8 saw a significant spike to 182 units (nearly 50% increase), likely due to a seasonal shift toward spring fitness activities in early April. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. However, inventory has frequently hit zero, indicating missed sales (e.g., Period 8 demand was 182 but only 116 units were available). To accommodate the recent demand surge and prevent stockouts while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $1.0 profit), I am increasing the forecast using the most recent 3 periods to capture the upward trend. This results in an explicit mu_hat reflecting the increased demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 8: demand increased from an average of ~115 to 182 (+58%) likely due to spring seasonality for sportswear.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a Sports Bra, which typically sees fluctuating demand in spring. Previous history showed a baseline demand around 115, followed by a significant spike in Period 8 (182) and then a drop in Period 9 (101). Given these fluctuations and the 0-period lead time, we have a 'lost sales' environment where starting inventory must cover the current period's demand. Average demand over the last 3 periods is approx 128, but the high variance suggests we should maintain a robust safety stock. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent volatility and the higher demand regime seen in April more heavily than the earlier Q1 baseline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand analysis shows a significant spike in Period 8 (182) which was previously flagged as a regime shift. However, demand in Periods 9 (101) and 10 (85) has dropped back significantly, suggesting the Period 8 spike may have been a one-time event (perhaps an Easter-related promotional burst) rather than a sustained plateau, or that demand is highly volatile. The carry-over insight from Period 9 noted a 58% increase, but the last two periods averaged only 93 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining coverage for potential volatility, I will use a recent window (N=3) which captures the high demand of Period 8 and the lower demand of Periods 9-10. This results in a mu_hat of (1+0) * (182+101+85)/3 = 122.6, which is safer than the older average (~115) but more realistic than assuming a sustained 180+ level.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Previously, I identified a demand regime shift starting in Period 8 (April 1), likely due to spring fitness trends. However, demand in the last three periods (P9: 101, P10: 85, P11: 99) has trended back towards the levels seen in February and March (averaging 115) rather than the isolated spike of 182 in Period 8. The 'Karin Sports Bra' likely experiences volatility but is currently stabilizing around its baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Based on the most recent 5 samples (P7-P11), the mean demand is approx 118 units. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this stabilization while acknowledging the volatility observed recently. This should prevent overstocking if the P8 spike was an outlier, while maintaining enough stock (around 118-120 units) to meet current demand trends.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a sports bra. While a previous insight suggested a demand regime shift in Period 8 (April 1st, demand=182), the subsequent data (Periods 9-12) shows demand returning to lower levels (101, 85, 99, 93), averaging 94.5 over the last 4 periods. The spike in Period 8 appears to be an outlier or a very short-lived boost rather than a sustained shift. Given the sports bra category, late spring usually sees stable or slightly increasing demand, but the recent data suggests the 'new' regime of 182 did not hold. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current stabilization around 95 units per period. The promised lead time of 0 is confirmed as accurate across all 12 concluded periods. Mu_hat will be set for (1+L) = 1 period of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift noted in Period 9 (avg 182) was temporary; demand has stabilized back to an average of ~95 over the last 4 periods (P9-P12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. Historical demand shows a brief spike in early April (Period 8: 182 units) followed by a stabilization phase. Over the last five periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged 91.4 units (101, 85, 99, 93, 79), significantly lower than the P8 spike. The carry-over insight from Period 13 confirms this return to a lower baseline (~95 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages for all historical periods. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the OR backend's service level target is 50%, making accurate mean estimation critical. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'post-peak' regime while ignoring the outlier in P8.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a sports bra. Historical analysis shows that the demand spike in early April (Period 8, demand=182) was an outlier or a temporary seasonal peak. Since Period 9, demand has stabilized at a lower level. Specifically, from Period 9 to Period 14, the average demand is (101+85+99+93+79+92)/6 = 91.5. The most recent demand (Period 14) was 92. Inventory is currently 0. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use a recent_N method with N=6 to capture this stabilized post-spike regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we don't over-order based on the Period 8 spike while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current steady demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a Karin Sports Bra. Historically, demand for this SKU showed a brief spike around early April (Period 8, demand=182) but has since stabilized. Over the last three concluded periods (P13-P15), demand has been 79, 92, and 95, averaging approximately 88.6 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Since both profit and holding cost are $1.0/unit, the target service level q = 0.5, meaning the base stock (mu_hat) should target the median demand. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-spike stability (P10-P15) while filtering out the volatile spring period. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized after the early April spike; avg demand for P10-P15 is approx 90 units compared to P1-P7 avg of ~115.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a sports bra. Demand for this SKU has stabilized following a temporary spike in early April (Period 8). Analysis of the last 7 periods (P10-P16) shows a consistent demand mean of approximately 92.4 units per period (85, 99, 93, 79, 92, 95, 97), which is lower than the initial P1-P7 average and significantly lower than the P8 burst. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 (arrivals occur in the same period as ordering). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this stabilized post-spike demand regime, which accurately reflects the current trend moving into June. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=7) to capture the current volatility. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a sports bra. Demand has stabilized after the early April spike (P8). Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has averaged 89.8 units (79, 92, 95, 97, 86), which is consistent with the 'Period 16' carry-over insight of ~90 units. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is low (6 units) with 0 in-transit. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit), I will use the recent stable regime (N=5) to set demand parameters. This captures the current post-spike stability while allowing for recent variability.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a sports bra. Historical data shows that after an early April spike, demand has stabilized in a lower regime. Specifically, over the last 9 periods (P10-P18), demand has averaged approximately 92.2 units (ranging from 79 to 101). The most recent period (P18) showed a demand of 101, leading to a stockout. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Given the high criticality of stockouts (profit=1, holding=1, implying a 50% service level target in a classic newsboy, but the capped policy suggests we should aim for stability), I will use the recent demand regime from Period 10 to Period 18 to set the parameters. This N=9 sample captures the post-spike stability and includes the recent slight uptick to ensure we don't under-order during the mid-summer fitness season.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a sports bra. Demand history shows a brief spike in early April (Period 8, demand 182), but since Period 9, it has settled into a stable regime. Over the last 10 periods (P10-P19), the mean demand is approximately 90 units (sum=901, avg=90.1). Recent trends (P17-P19) show demand of 86, 101, and 72. There is no evidence of upcoming summer seasonality shifts based on the last few weeks' performance. Actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0 periods in every concluded observation. To optimize the order for the OR backend, I will use a 10-period window to capture the stable post-spike regime while providing enough samples for a reliable sigma calculation. This ensures the base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) covers current demand while limiting excess holding costs for a product with an equal profit/holding cost ratio ($1:$1), which targets a 50% service level offset by the safety factor in the cap.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historically, demand for this sports bra peaked in early April (Period 8, demand 182) but has since stabilized and gradually declined as the summer progresses. Recent demand (P17-P20) averages 81.5 units, which is lower than the P10-P15 average of ~90. The most recent four periods show demand values of 86, 101, 72, and 67. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this slow summer phase, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this localized cooling (mean ~81.5). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to capture recent volatility (std dev ~16.5). No shipments are missing, and ending on-hand inventory is 23, which is sufficient for high service levels given the 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift noted: Period 17-20 average demand has decreased to 81.5 (-10% vs P10-P15), reflecting a mid-summer cooling for this category.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 678687001 (Sports Bra) shows a clear cooling trend as we move through summer. The demand in Period 21 dropped to 50 units, significantly lower than the P17-P20 average of 81.5. Currently, we have 32 units on-hand. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Given the declining trend (Period 19: 72, Period 20: 67, Period 21: 50), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this deceleration (P17-P21 average is approx 75 units). This allows the OR engine to calculate a base stock that covers the expected lower demand while preventing excessive holding costs. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the lowered volatility in this quieter sales period.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Average demand has transitioned from ~81 (P17-P20) to 50 in Period 21, indicating a deeper mid-summer low than previously noted.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678687001 (Karin Sports Bra) is experiencing a significant downward trend in demand, consistent with a mid-summer seasonal low. Current date is July 15. Realized demand dropped from an average of ~81 (P17-P20) to 50 (P21) and most recently to 25 (P22). This represents a clear regime shift compared to previous months. The on-hand inventory is 51, which already covers more than two weeks of the most recent demand level. To prevent excessive holding costs (which are $1.0 vs $1.0 profit, a 50% service level target), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this sharp decline. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'calculate' for L. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the lower volatility at these lower volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand collapse confirmed: Period 22 demand fell to 25, continuing the downward trend from 50 (P21) and 81 (P17-20 avg). Current demand is ~70% lower than the early spring peak.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Karin Sports Bra (678687001) has entered a significant mid-summer slump. Observation of the last few periods shows a sharp decline: Period 21 (50), Period 22 (25), and Period 23 (37). The average demand over these last 3 periods is approximately 37 units, which is significantly lower than the P17-P20 average of ~81. Current on-hand inventory is 14 units. Lead-time has remained consistently 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs (which equal the profit margin), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this lower demand regime. This will prevent overstocking during this low-demand phase while maintaining a sufficient base stock for the next period, given that profit and holding costs are balanced (target service level = 50%).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Karin Sports Bra (SKU: 678687001) has significantly decreased during the mid-summer period (late July), consistent with recent carry-over insights. Demand shifted from ~80-100 units in the spring/early summer to an average of ~37 units over the last 4 periods (P21: 50, P22: 25, P23: 37, P24: 35). Current on-hand inventory is 3 units with no units in transit. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs in this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new mean demand of approximately 37 units. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' (N=4) to reflect the current volatility of this lower regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate rather than the higher historical spring averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a low-summer regime; average demand for P21-P24 is ~37 units, representing a sustained ~60% drop from the spring average.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678687001' (Sports Bra) is in a significant low-demand summer trough. Current date is August 5th. Demand in the last period (P25) was extremely low at 13 units, following a period of 35. The carry-over insights indicate a stabilized low-summer regime around ~37 units (avg of P21-P24), but the most recent result (13) suggests a potential further dip or high volatility at these low levels. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. With 24 units currently on-hand and recent demand dropping to 13, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the full scope of the summer low (P21-P25 avg = 32), which carefully balances the 37 average with the recent 13 result. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent volatility in this low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand low further decreased: Period 25 demand dropped to 13 units, bringing the P21-P25 average to 32 units, reinforcing the sustained low-summer regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Karin Sports Bra is currently in a sustained mid-to-late summer low-demand regime. Analyzing the last 6 periods (P21-P26), demand has been 50, 25, 37, 35, 13, and 25 respectively. This yields a recent mean of approximately 30.8 units per week. The Carry-over insights confirm this drop from the earlier spring average of ~115 and the early summer average of ~82. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. We are currently at August 12th; while a late-summer/back-to-school uptick is possible in the coming weeks, the immediate data suggests maintaining a lean inventory to avoid high holding costs relative to the current low sales volume. I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable, low-demand state.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The Karin Sports Bra has experienced a significant and sustained mid-summer demand decline. Recent demand for P21-P27 has averaged approximately 31.6 units, a sharp drop from the spring average of ~115 and even the early summer average of ~85. The most recent demand (Period 27) was 36, confirming that demand is currently oscillating in a low regime (range 13-50) after the summer collapse. Inventory is currently at 0 following a stockout in P27. Given the consistent 0-day lead time observed throughout the history, I will continue to use L=0. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current low-demand summer regime (P21-P27) while ignoring the higher-demand periods earlier in the year, ensuring we minimize holding costs during this slow season.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26). Demand for the Karin Sports Bra has shown significant variability over the last several months. After a mid-summer bottom in July/early August where demand dropped to as low as 13 units, the last two periods (P27 and P28) show a recovery trend with demands of 36 and 44 respectively. This likely signals the end of the summer low and potentially a 'back-to-school' or late-summer fitness surge. The previous regime (P21-P26) had an average demand of approximately 31 units. The average of the most recent 3 periods (P26-P28) is 35 units, but specifically, the last 2 periods suggest a move back toward the 40+ range. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this transition upward from the summer floor while remaining cautious of the high volatility (sigma). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovering from summer low: P27-P28 demand (avg 40) is significantly higher than P21-P26 low-summer average (~31).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Historical demand data shows a recovery from the mid-summer low (approx. 32 units). Demand in the last three periods (P27-P29) has increased to 36, 44, and 45 respectively, averaging 41.6 units. This indicates a late-summer/early-fall recovery phase. Based on the Carry-Over Insights, the product (Sports Bra) exhibits strong seasonality. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this upward recovery trend specifically. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the consistent '0 periods' reported in the conclude messages throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P27-P29 average demand is 41.6 units, compared to the P21-P26 low-summer average of 30.8 (+35%).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Karin Sports Bra is experiencing a recovery from its mid-summer demand low. Period 30 demand was 29, which is a slight dip from the previous weeks (P27-P29 average was ~41.6), but remains above the deep summer lows seen in P25 (13). The average demand for the recovery phase (P27-P30) is approximately 38.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 13 units. The lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To capture the current stabilized recovery regime while acknowledging the slight cooling in the most recent period, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (the recovery window since P27). Sigma_hat will also be adjusted using the last 4 periods to reflect current volatility. This approach balances the need to fulfill recovery demand without overstocking if the growth plateaus.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Karin Sports Bra (SKU: 678687001) is currently in a post-summer recovery phase. Historical data shows a clear mid-summer demand collapse (P21-P26 average ~31), followed by a moderate recovery starting around late August (P27-P31 average ~36.4). The last two periods (P30-P31) saw demand of 29 and 28, respectively, suggesting the recovery has flattened or stabilized at a level lower than the initial P27-P29 bounce (avg ~41). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. With on-hand inventory at 11 and recent demand averaging ~34 units per period across the last five periods (N=5), I will set mu_hat based on this recent window to capture the stabilization after the recovery spike. Sigma_hat is also set using N=5 to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand for the upcoming period while accounting for the recent cooling of the recovery trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery stabilization: After an initial late-August bounce to ~41 units (P27-P29), demand has stabilized at a lower recovery level of ~28.5 units (P30-P31).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Historical demand for the KARIN SPORTS BRA shows a stabilization phase after the late August recovery peak (avg ~42 in P27-P29). Over the last three periods (P30-P32), demand has averaged 25.6 units (29, 28, 20), consistent with the 'demand recovery stabilization' recorded in Carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilization while remaining responsive to potential late-September volatility, I will use a recent_N method with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent regime (P30-P32). The OR backend will use these values to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period plus a safety buffer, accounting for the equal profit and holding cost ($1.00), which implies a target service level of 50% (base stock = mu_hat).

LLM Rationale:
The Karin Sports Bra (SKU: 678687001) is entering late September/early October (Period 34). Recent history shows a period of volatility following a summer low. While Period 30-32 indicated a stable recovery level of ~28.5 units, Period 33 witnessed a sudden demand spike to 46 units, resulting in a stockout. This spike suggests either a late-month surge or the start of a new autumn/winter training regime demand shift. Over the last 4 periods (P30-P33), average demand is 30.75; however, given the stockout at 46 units, the true demand potential is likely higher. I will set N=4 for mu_hat to capture the recent recovery average while acknowledging the upward volatility, and N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance seen in the last period. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late September; Period 33 spike of 46 units suggests a potential shift away from the late-summer recovery average (~28.5) toward a higher autumn regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678687001 (Karin Sports Bra) is entering October. Historically, demand for sports bras showed a significant spike in early spring (April), followed by a deep summer low (July/August), and is currently in a recovery/stabilization phase. Recent demand for Period 33 was 46 (a spike) and Period 34 was 24. While Period 34 suggests a return to the late-summer 'recovery' level (~28 units), the volatility observed in the last two periods (46 followed by 24) suggests that the previous stable regime of ~28.5 (P30-P31) has shifted. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) is 33.4 units, which better captures the current autumn trend and recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to prioritize this new environment while maintaining sigma_hat on the same window to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation has increased due to the P33 spike).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Autumn demand is showing higher volatility and a slightly higher mean (avg 33.4 for P30-P34) compared to the late-summer recovery average (~28.5).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/10/14 (mid-October). Carry-over insights and recent history show that demand has transitioned from its summer lows (avg ~31) to an autumn regime. While Period 33 saw a spike of 46, the subsequent two periods (P34-P35) have been lower (24 and 19 units), bringing the recent autumn average (P30-P35) to approximately 27.7 units. This is slightly below the 'late-summer recovery average' of 28.5 but higher than the mid-summer collapse levels. The product is a sports bra, which typically sees steady demand but can fluctuate with fitness cycles (e.g., autumn resolutions). On-hand inventory is 11, with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels while accounting for the recent demand volatility (19-46 range), I will use the recent_N method based on the autumn regime (last 6 periods, P30-P35) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current seasonal stabilization better than the full history or the volatile summer data.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand for this sports bra SKU has stabilized significantly since the mid-summer low. For the most recent 7 periods (P30-P36), demand has averaged 26.6 units (29, 28, 20, 46, 24, 19, 20). The spike in P33 (46 units) appears to be an outlier in an otherwise stable but low-demand autumn regime. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I will use recent_N=7 to capture this current stable regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), as it balances the recent low demand with the P33 spike to ensure a safe but efficient service level. On-hand inventory is currently 8 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at autumn levels: P30-P36 average demand is 26.6 units, reflecting a post-summer recovery that is lower than spring (115) but higher than mid-summer lows (31).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Karin Sports Bra has shown a significant spike in Period 37 (54 units), compared to the recent autumn average of approximately 26.6 units (P30-P36). This corresponds with the end of October, potentially signaling the start of a pre-holiday or winter indoor sports season increase. Given the previous period ended with 0 inventory due to this spike, I need to raise the base stock level. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering P30-P37) to capture this latest upward volatility while balancing it against the lower autumn baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand spike detected in Period 37 (54 units), which is >100% higher than the P30-P36 autumn average (26.6). This suggests a potential early-winter/holiday regime shift or increased late-autumn volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The session is in Period 39 (early November). Demand for the Karin Sports Bra has shown significant recent volatility. After the autumn stabilization at ~26.6 units (P30-P36), Period 37 saw a sharp spike to 54 units, followed by Period 38 with 37 units. This represents a clear upward shift in mean demand as we enter the holiday/winter season, which typically drives increased interest in fitness apparel. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 30.8 units, while the very recent 2-period average is 45.5 units. Given that on-hand inventory is currently 0 and sales have been frequently capped by stockouts (P37, P38), I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 45 units to proactively cover the emerging peak demand. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased volatility observed in the last 5 weeks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on the historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand surge confirmed: P37-P38 average demand (45.5) is ~70% higher than the P30-P36 autumn average (26.6).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, which is just before the peak holiday shopping season (Singles' Day, Black Friday). Historical demand for this SKU shows a clear surge starting around Period 37 (Oct 21). The average demand for the last 3 periods (P37-P39) is 45.7 units (54, 37, 46), which is nearly double the previous autumn average. Given the product is a sports bra in fast-drying functional fabric, this likely reflects early gift-buying or preparation for New Year fitness resolutions. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this holiday surge mean, but will use an explicit sigma_hat set to a slightly higher value (10.0) to account for high volatility seen in the 54 unit spike. On-hand and in-transit are currently 0, so the base stock level calculated from these parameters will drive the net order. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019 (Period 41). Recent data shows a confirmed holiday/winter demand surge. While Period 40 demand (29) was lower than P37-P39 (avg 45.7), it still remains elevated compared to the autumn floor of ~27. We are in a holiday regime where demand is higher and more volatile. The average demand for the current regime (P37-P40) is (54+37+46+29)/4 = 41.5 units. Given that we have exactly 4 periods of evidence for this holiday surge, I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific seasonal behavior. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 17, and there is no in-transit inventory. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 will allow the OR engine to maintain a base stock that accounts for the higher seasonal mean and the increased volatility observed during the Nov/Dec holiday period for sports apparel.

Demand history shows a holiday surge started around Period 37, but the last two periods (P40-P41) have seen a slight softening, with demand at 29 and 26 units respectively. The average demand from P37 to P41 is 38.4 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this holiday regime while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The goal is to maintain enough stock to cover the current holiday demand without overstocking as we approach the end of the year (Period 47).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 678687001 (Karin Sports Bra) experienced a massive surge in Period 42 (136 units), coinciding with the start of the holiday season/Black Friday week. This is consistent with a seasonal peak similar to the spring surge but higher in magnitude. Since on-hand inventory is depleted (0 units) and the last several weeks (P39-P41) averaged around 33 units before this spike, I must pivot to a forecasting method that captures this new high-demand regime immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to prioritize the most recent observed demand of 136, but since 'recent_N' for mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * mean of last N samples and L=0, this will set the base stock level to 136. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1)). To protect against stockouts during this high-demand holiday period, I will set 'mu_hat' explicitly to a value reflectively higher than the spike to ensure the base stock is sufficient to meet continued holiday demand and replenish inventory.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand confirmed at Period 42: Demand spiked to 136 units, significantly exceeding the previous holiday build-up average of ~33 units (P39-P41). This represents a 4x increase and indicates a regime similar to or greater than the spring peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/09), we are in the post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday window and approaching the Christmas/New Year holiday peak. Period 42 saw a massive demand spike (136 units), but Period 43 immediately dropped to 18 units, likely due to a post-event demand lull or timing of the retail cycle. Historically, this SKU (Karin Sports Bra) showed a spring peak in April (Period 8 demand reached 182). Given we are now in the primary December holiday season, we should expect high volatility. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering the shift starting around Period 37) to capture the holiday regime's higher mean and variance while smoothing the extreme P42/P43 fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is high (122) due to the large order arriving just as demand dipped in P43; the OR backend will naturally reduce the order size this period to reach the base stock target.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December period (P45, 2019/12/16). The holiday season has shown extreme volatility: P42 saw a massive spike to 136 units (Black Friday week), followed by a significant drop to 18 (P43) and 32 (P44). This pattern suggests that while the peak has passed, demand remains unpredictable compared to the autumn floor. The current on-hand inventory is 90 units, which is high. Given the proximity to the end of the simulation (P47) and the recent drop in demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (P42-P44) which averages 62 units, capturing both the extreme spike and the subsequent cooling. I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 60 to account for the high variance observed during this holiday window. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday volatility confirmed: P42 spike (136) followed by P43-P44 cooling (avg 25). The regime is characterized by high variance but declining mean as the peak season concludes.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (2019/12/16), we observed a massive demand spike of 409 units, which corresponds to the week before Christmas. This significantly exceeded the previous holiday peak of 136 in Period 42. Since the current period is 46 (Dec 23), we are likely still in the peak Christmas/post-Christmas sales window. However, looking at the previous year's early data (Jan/Feb samples), demand eventually settles back to a mean of ~115. For Period 46, I must account for the high volatility and the possibility of another surge or high clearance volume. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 (Periods 42-45) to capture this extremely high-demand holiday phase. This N includes the 136, 18, 32, and 409 data points, which will result in a high mu_hat and sigma_hat, providing the necessary buffer for the current peak while acknowledging the erratic nature of holiday sales. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Christmas peak demand confirmed: Period 45 demand spiked to 409 units, following a Period 42 spike of 136, indicating intense but volatile holiday seasonality for the sports bra category.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678687001 (sports bra) is currently in a high-volatility holiday demand regime. In Period 45 (mid-December), demand spiked significantly to 409 units, and in Period 46, demand remained extremely high at 338 units. These peaks represent the Christmas/New Year holiday rush, often associated with health and fitness 'New Year's resolutions' in this category. Period 47 (starting Dec 30) is the final segment of this peak. Given the start of the year typically maintains high demand for sports apparel, I must set mu_hat to reflect this sustained high-demand regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is 186.6 units, but the last two periods averaged 373.5 units. To avoid drastic over-ordering as the immediate holiday spike potentially tapers but stays above the autumn baseline, I will use a recent_N average focused on the current high-volatility window. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: New Year's fitness regime shift: Demand in P45-P46 (avg 373.5) confirms an extreme holiday/New Year spike for the sports bra category, significantly exceeding the spring peak of 182 and earlier holiday levels.
