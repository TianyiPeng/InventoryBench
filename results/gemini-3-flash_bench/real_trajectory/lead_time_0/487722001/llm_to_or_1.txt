Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is a 'Lace push-up body' (Womens Lingerie). Current date is Feb 11, 2019. In lingerie retail, demand typically spikes around Valentine's Day (Feb 14). Historical data shows a stable base demand (avg ~46 units/week). However, given Feb 11 is the week of Valentine's Day, I anticipate a significant seasonal surge. The lead time is promised at 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Since on-hand inventory is 0, I must order enough to cover the expected Valentine's Day peak plus safety stock. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a forecast of 80 units for this specific peak week (approx 75% increase over base), while using 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the historical volatility of the available 5 data points.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Examining Item 487722001 (Women's Lingerie), the historical demand data shows a steady range between 42-56 units per week in January and early February. Period 1 demand was higher at 63 units, likely due to Valentine's Day seasonality (Feb 14 is in Period 1). With Valentine's Day passed, I expect demand to regress toward the historical mean (approx 46). On-hand inventory is 17 units. Lead time analysis: The Period 1 order arrived in Period 1 (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the demand for the current period (1+L=1 period). I will use the mean of the 5 historical samples plus Period 1, which is approximately 48 units. Given the high stock-out risk from Period 1's low ending inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected mean demand and maintain a safety buffer.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lingerie lace push-up body. We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25), post-Valentine's Day. History shows a demand of 63 in P1 and 68 in P2, which is higher than the pre-Feb samples (avg ~46). In P2, we stocked out with on-hand ending at 0 and lost 20 units of demand (sold 48 of 68). The promised lead time of 0 periods has held true for both P1 and P2 orders. Since demand has shifted from the initial historical mean (~45.8) to a higher recent average (~65.5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture this higher regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 2019: average demand increased from ~46 to ~65 (+40%) likely due to seasonality/product lifecycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-10.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Lace push-up body'. Period 4 is March 4, transitioning from late winter to early spring, which often sees stable or slightly increasing lingerie demand. Reviewing historical samples (P-3 to P1): 42, 56, 47, 42, 42 (Mean: 45.8). Recent demand history (P1 to P3): 63, 68, 28 (Mean: 53.0). Period 3 showed a significant drop (28), but Periods 1 and 2 were quite high, suggesting a new mean significantly higher than the initial samples. The previous 'carry_over_insight' noted an increase to ~65 (based on P1-P2), but P3 suggests that estimate might be high or volatility is significant. Promised lead time is 0 and has consistently been 0. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this higher but volatile demand regime (avg 53) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the high variance (std dev ~21.7). With L=0, base stock = mu + z*sigma. q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, so z=0. The OR backend will aim for the mean demand, while the cap protects against over-ordering if Period 3's drop is a trend.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. Historical demand for this lace push-up body transitioned from an average of ~46 (Jan) to a higher level in Feb (avg ~65 in the first two weeks), but has slowed significantly in the last two weeks of the period (avg ~31). The previous carry-over insight noted a regime shift up, but recent data shows a cooling off. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which implies a target service level q = 0.5, we must avoid overstocking. Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods across all four samples. Demand samples are: 42, 56, 47, 42, 42 (Jan); 63, 68, 28, 34 (Feb/Mar). The 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat will use N=4 to capture the recent month's volatility and mean shift (avg 48.25), while sigma_hat will use the same for local consistency.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: post-peak February (demand ~65), March has started significantly lower (avg ~31), suggesting the push-up body may have passed its seasonal peak or initial launch surge.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18, 2019. The product is a Women's Lace push-up body (Lingerie). Historical data shows two distinct demand regimes: an initial high-demand phase in February (average ~65 units in Periods 1-2) followed by a significant decline in March (average ~29 units in Periods 3-5). The most recent samples (28, 34, 25) confirm this lower demand level. As the product is a specialty lingerie item, the February peak was likely tied to Valentine's Day seasonality, and March represents a post-holiday normalization. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 3, the demand mean has stabilized around 29. Given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.00), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, meaning base_stock will target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (March) and prevent overstocking based on the February peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-Valentine's Day demand normalization confirmed: March demand (Avg 29) is ~55% lower than February (Avg 65).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is a lace push-up body (womens lingerie). Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Demand context: We saw a peak in February (Periods 1-2, demand ~65) likely driven by Valentine's Day. Since then (Periods 3-6), demand has settled into a lower, stable regime. March demand samples are 28, 34, 25, and 30, averaging 29.25. The stockout in Period 6 (sold 29 with 30 demand) indicates we need to be careful with service levels since profit/holding ratio is 1:1 (suggesting a 50% critical ratio target for base stock). To avoid overstocking while covering the current baseline, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (post-peak regime) and use a recent Window for variance to reflect current stability.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a lace push-up body (lingerie). Historical demand analysis shows three distinct phases: initial pre-Feb mean of ~46, a high-demand February peak around Valentine's Day (Weeks 1-2, avg ~65), and a post-peak March stabilization. In March (Periods 3-7), demand has stabilized significantly, showing a mean of 29 units/week (samples: 28, 34, 25, 30, 28) with very low volatility (std \u2248 3.4). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory is currently very tight (2 units on-hand, 0 in-transit). I will use a window of the last 5 periods (the March stabilization phase) to set the base stock, ensuring we cover this new lower-demand regime without overstocking, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1), making overstocking as expensive as understocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in March (Periods 3-7) at an average of 29 units/week with low volatility (std ~3.4), confirming the expiration of the February seasonal peak.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Charlotte Body Push' SKU shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high-demand period in February (Avg ~65) driven by Valentine's Day, followed by a lower, stable regime in March (Avg ~29). The most recent demand samples (Periods 3-8: 28, 34, 25, 30, 28, 25) yield an average of 28.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 3.3. This indicates the demand has successfully settled into a post-peak plateau. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time 0 observed in all 8 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 0-period arrival. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture this stabilized March/early-April regime, ignoring the February spikes. The equal profit and holding cost ($1.0) implies a target service level of 50%, so the backend will aim for the median demand, which fits the current low-volatility stability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Charlotte Body Push Melbourne' (Women's Lingerie) has transitioned out of its mid-February peak and settled into a stable demand regime. Analyzing the last 7 periods (from P3 to P9), demand has hovered around a mean of 27.0 units per week with relatively low volatility. Specifically, the last three weeks show a slight downward trend (25, 25, 19). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a 50% service level (since Profit ($1) = Holding Cost ($1)), I will use a 'recent_N' approach focusing on the last 7 periods to capture this stabilized post-peak regime. This balances the higher March average with the more recent April decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further in April: 3-week average is ~23 units, compared to the March average of ~29, showing a gentle glide path downward from the seasonal peak.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. The product (Charlotte Body Push-up) has shown a consistent decline in demand following its February seasonal peak/launch. The most recent three periods (P8-P10) show demand values of 25, 19, and 16, resulting in a three-period average of 20 units. This confirms the 'glide path downward' noted in the previous carry-over insight. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Given the 1:1 ratio of Profit ($1.0) to Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend OR engine will target a 50% service level (z=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is 11 units. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture this recent low-demand regime and prevent overstocking as the product enters a slower period. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower volume phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed in late April: 3-period average (P8-P10) dropped to 20 units/week, down from the March average of ~29 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Charlotte Body Push Melbourne' is showing a continued downward demand trend as it moves further from the February peak (Valentine's Day seasonality). Period 11 demand was 24 units, but based on the last 3-4 periods (16, 19, 25, 24), the average demand is approximately 21 units. The carry-over insights confirm a sustained drop from the March average (~29) to a late-April average (~20). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, targetting the mean. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average, as the product is clearly in a post-peak decline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Charlotte Body Push Melbourne' (lace push-up body) has shown a sudden and significant spike in Period 12 (47 units) after a period of steady decline. This jump coincides with the first week of May, which often sees increased demand for lingerie in various markets (e.g., preparation for Mother's Day). The previous regime (Periods 10-11) averaged 20 units/week, making Period 12's 47 units a clear outlier or regime shift (+135% vs previous average). Given on-hand inventory is 0 and we are entering May, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this higher volume. I'll use recent_N (N=3) to capture the blend of the previous low levels and the new high level (Avg = (16+24+47)/3 = 29), but since Period 12 was so high, I will use an explicit forecast of 40 units/week to ensure we don't stock out during this potential May surge. Lead time remains stable at 0. Sigma will also be set explicitly to accommodate the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: sudden spike to 47 units (from ~20 average) coinciding with early May, suggesting a new seasonal driver.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (Apr 29), we saw a demand spike to 47 units, which was initially interpreted as a new seasonal driver for May. However, Period 13 demand (May 6) dropped back to 28 units, which is closer to the March/April average of ~25-29 units. The May spike was likely a transient event rather than a sustained regime shift. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 50%, meaning we want to target the median demand to minimize total costs. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (Periods 11-13 demand: 24, 47, 28) which averages to ~33 units. This allows us to capture some of the recent volatility without overreacting to the single spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. This is post-Mother's Day (May 12). Demand history shows a spike in Period 12 (May 6 conclude, demand 47) followed by a return to lower levels in Periods 13 and 14 (demand 28 and 25 respectively). The 'carry_over_insight' regarding a May spike is confirmed but appears to have been localized to early May. The current average over the last 3 weeks (P12-P14) is 33.3 units, but the last two weeks suggest a stabilization around 25-28 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. With Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the OR backend targets a service level of 50% (base_stock = mean). To prevent stockouts seen in Period 12 while not over-ordering now that the peak has passed, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (average ~33) to capture the recent higher activity while sigma_hat will be set explicitly to reflect the recent volatility (std of {47, 28, 25} is ~12). This provides a base_stock of ~33 units, which after subtracting on-hand (8) will trigger an order of ~25 units, aligning with recent demand.

Carry-over insight: May seasonal spike (centered around Mother's Day) confirmed: demand peaked at Period 12 (47 units) and is normalizing back toward ~25-28 units per week in the second half of May.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Charlotte Body Push Melbourne spiked to 42 units in Period 15, exceeding the previous normalization trend (25-28 units) and resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests that while the Mother's Day peak (Period 12-13) ended, demand remains volatile and higher than the April average. Looking at history, demand has fluctuated between 25 and 47 units over the last 4 weeks. Given the zero on-hand inventory and the demonstrated high service-level risk (stocking out 3 times in the last 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the recent 4-week average (approx 35.5 units) to capture this higher activity level compared to the longer-term historical mean. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use the recent 4 periods for sigma_hat to account for the current demand swings (47, 28, 25, 42).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '487722001' (Charlotte Body Push Melbourne) is experiencing a sustained increase in demand as we enter June. Demand in the last two periods (P15 and P16) has risen to 42 and 38 units respectively, significantly higher than the 25-28 unit average observed in mid-May. This suggests a start-of-summer regime shift or sustained lifecycle growth. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid the stockouts seen in P11, P12, P15, and P16, I am adjusting \u03bc\u0302 using the most recent 4 periods (P13-P16: 28, 25, 42, 38) to capture this upward movement (average ~33.25 units). I am also using a recent window for \u03c3\u0302 to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher demand levels. Setting L=0 ensures the OR engine aims to cover the current period's demand requirements.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Average demand increased from ~27 to ~40 units (+48%) entering June, potentially due to summer seasonality or sustained product popularity.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. Reviewing the recent demand history since the June regime shift (Period 15 onwards), observed demand values are 42, 38, and 25. While Period 17 saw a dip to 25, the overall average since Period 15 is 35 units per week, significantly higher than the April/May baseline of ~23. The product is a lace push-up body, which aligns with summer/bridal seasonality in June. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this elevated June demand (avg ~35) while allowing for the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The 9 units on hand are insufficient to cover the expected demand for the upcoming week (Period 18), so the OR backend should trigger an order to reach the base stock level calculated from the current mu and sigma.

Carry-over insight: June demand regime remains elevated compared to May: average demand (Periods 15-17) is 35 units/week (+35% vs prior steady state), likely driven by summer seasonality.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand tracking shows a regime shift in early June (starting Period 15, May 20), where demand jumped significantly. Specifically, demand in Periods 15-16 averaged 40 units/week. However, the last two periods (17-18) have cooled slightly (25 and 22 units). While June was expected to be stronger due to summer seasonality for lingerie/bodies, the most recent data suggest the 'peak' may be settling into a lower plateau or was concentrated earlier in the month. Reviewing the last 4 periods (P15-P18), mean demand is 31.75 units. I will use N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current June performance while acknowledging the recent cooling. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With profit=$1 and holding cost=$1, the target service level q is 0.5 (Base Stock \u2248 median demand). I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent, and recent_N for mu and sigma to adapt to the June seasonality.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for this SKU (lace push-up body) has shown significant volatility throughout the year, with a strong February peak and another spike in mid-May. In the last three periods (P17-P19), demand has been 25, 22, and 26 units respectively, which is a stabilization compared to the earlier June surge to ~40 units. The average for these last three periods is 24.3 units. Given the transition into late June, demand appears to be returning to a baseline level seen in April-May. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering as the 'summer surge' potentially wanes, I will use a recent N window of 5 periods (P15-P19) to capture the trend while allowing for sufficient safety stock. This window includes the high demand of P15 and P16 (42, 38) and the moderation of P17-P19 (25, 22, 26), averaging approximately 30.6 units per period. Setting L to the promised 0 will allow for same-period replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime normalized in late June (P17-P19): Average demand decreased to ~24 units/week from the mid-June peak of ~40 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/07/01), the product (Charlotte Body Push Melbourne) has moved past its June peak and stabilized. Demand over the last four periods (P17-P20) has been: 25, 22, 26, 22. This shows a very consistent recent average of 23.75 units per week with extremely low volatility (std \u2248 2). The 'on-hand' inventory is currently 9 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history (P1 to P20). I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 to capture this localized stability in demand and variance, as the earlier June/May volatility is no longer representative of the current steady post-solstice demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late June/early July: 4-period average (P17-P20) is 23.75 units/week with low volatility (std ~2), confirming a return to the baseline observed in April.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical data and Carry-over Insights indicate that the SKU has exited the June peak and has stabilized into a baseline demand regime. The last 5 periods (P17-P21) show demand of [25, 22, 26, 22, 29], resulting in a mean of 24.8 units/week. While the most recent demand was 29, the preceding weeks were very stable around 22-26. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period). Inventory currently stands at 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit because the P21 order (delivered same-period) was fully consumed by higher-than-expected P21 demand. To maintain the service level while minimizing holding costs (equal to profit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) to capture this post-June stabilization.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 487722001 (Lace Push-up Body) spiked dramatically in Period 22 (Date: 2019/7/8) to 75 units, far exceeding the previous stable average of approximately 24 units observed in late June/early July. This represents a new demand regime shift (+212% vs the P17-P20 average). The product (womens lingerie body) may be experiencing a summer mid-July peak or a specific promotional surge. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time is consistently 0, I must aggressively increase the base stock to capture this higher demand level and avoid stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 for mu_hat to react immediately to the 75-unit signal, while using a wider N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this transition.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift at Period 22: demand spiked to 75 units from a prior 4-period baseline of ~24 units, indicating a mid-summer seasonal peak or promotion.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a significant mid-summer demand spike. Demand jumped from a baseline of ~24 units to 75 units in Period 22 and 87 units in Period 23. This suggests a strong seasonal peak for the 'Charlotte Body Melbourne' lingerie item during July. As we are in Period 24 (late July), I expect this high-demand regime to persist for at least one more period before potentially tapering off, as seen in previous spikes (February lasted 2-3 weeks, May peaked and then normalized). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit because the Period 23 order was fully consumed by demand in the same period (same-day lead time). To capture this peak and avoid stockouts (like the 12 unit loss in P23), I will set mu_hat explicitly based on the recent average of the spike (mean of 75 and 87 is 81). I will use a conservative sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike confirmed for July: Demand increased from baseline ~24 units to 75 (Period 22) and 87 (Period 23), representing a 3.5x increase likely due to peak summer seasonality.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand summer peak, likely driven by hot weather and July sales cycles. Demand over the last three periods (P22-P24) skyrocketed to an average of 76.3 units, compared to the late June baseline of ~24 units. Specifically, Period 24 saw 67 units of demand, which is slightly down from the peak of 87 but still very elevated. Historically, this product (lace push-up body) has seen rapid transitions between regimes (e.g., February surge vs. March normalization). Given we are at the end of July, I expect demand to remain high but potentially begin a slight regression toward the mean. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new July volume while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit/Holding ratio of 1:1 suggests a target service level of 0.50, which the OR backend will calculate via the base stock model.

Carry-over insight: July high-demand regime confirmed: demand jumped from June baseline (~24) to July average of 76 units (P22-P24), a ~3x increase reflecting peak summer seasonality.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering Period 26 (August 5). Historical data shows a massive July seasonal peak (Periods 22-25) with demand values of 75, 87, 67, and 103 (average ~83). Recent demand peaked in late July (P25 demand was 103). Given August usually follows peak summer sales, I expect demand to remain high but potentially begin a slight normalization. However, the last recorded demand (103) significantly exceeded the inventory available (77). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts in this high-demand regime, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current July/August peak high-volume behavior specifically. This provides a balance between the very high 103 units and the slightly lower 67-87 units earlier in July.

Carry-over insight: July/August peak confirmed: Demand averaged ~83 units/week (P22-P25), a 3.5x increase from June baseline. Period 25 reached a record high demand of 103 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand summer peak, with Period 26 demand hitting a new high of 129 units. The July/August average (P22-P26) has climbed to approximately 92 units per week, significantly higher than the early July estimate. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts during this sustained peak, mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted using a 5-period window (recent_N=5) to capture this regime shift accurately. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that reflects the current 90-130 unit demand range rather than the much lower historical annual average.

Carry-over insight: August demand surge confirmed: Period 26 demand reached 129 units, increasing the high-season average (P22-P26) to 92 units/week, up from ~83 units/week previously.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Charlotte Body Push has stayed in an extremely high-demand regime throughout August (P26: 129, P27: 109). As of Period 28 (Aug 19), we are in the peak summer/late summer retail window. The high-season average (P22-P27) is now 95 units/week. Since the product has consistently sold out every unit arriving for the past two weeks, a significant stock-out is occurring, and we must increase the mu_hat to capture the true latent demand. Although P27 demand (109) was slightly lower than P26 (129), it is still substantially higher than the 70-80 unit range seen in July. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent 6-period high-season mean (approx 95) and sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (std dev is ~23) observed during this peak to ensure sufficient stock for potential 120+ unit weeks.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand regime remains at extreme peak levels: Average demand (P22-P27) is 95 units/week, with the last two weeks (P26-P27) averaging 119 units, indicating sustained high season demand significantly above the July average of 76.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Charlotte Body Push Melbourne' is currently in an extreme summer seasonal peak. Historical demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) has consistently stayed very high, averaging 117 units/week (129, 109, and 113 respectively). The 'Carry-over insights' highlight this sustained peak in late August. My goal is to prevent stockouts while balancing the risk of a sudden seasonal drop-off as we enter September. Using recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat accurately captures this latest hyper-demand regime (avg ~117), providing a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time + the immediate demand period. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility experienced during this peak phase (std ~10 during these three weeks). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Sustained hyper-peak demand in late August confirmed: Periods 26-28 averaged 117 units/week, up significantly from July's average of 76.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. We are exiting the 'hyper-peak' August demand regime (which averaged 117 units/week in P26-P28). Period 29 showed a significant cooling to 74 units, suggesting the end of August peak seasonality. However, demand is still substantially higher than the June baseline (~24 units). Historically, the product shows strong seasonality (February peak, May peak, July/August peak). September demand is expected to normalize further but remain above baseline. Using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) captures the high August volume while starting to weight the recent drop (Avg P26-P29: 106 units). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 43 units, so the OR engine will order the difference between the base stock (calculated from mu and sigma) and these 43 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease at Period 29: Demand dropped to 74 units from the late August average of 117 (-37%), signaling the conclusion of the summer peak and a transition into September seasonality.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Charlotte Body Push Melbourne' is currently transitioning from its peak summer seasonality (July/August) into September. In August (Periods 26-28), demand averaged 117 units. However, the last two periods have shown a distinct downward shift: Period 29 (74 units) and Period 30 (92 units), averaging 83 units. This suggests the hyper-peak is over but demand remains relatively high compared to the spring baseline. With a profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should align with the median demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture the recent downward trend without over-reacting to a single week, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the shift from ~117 down towards the ~80-90 range, while using recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility during this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak contraction: Demand in late August/early September (Periods 29-30) has decreased to an average of 83 units/week from the late-August hyper-peak of 117 units/week.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Charlotte Body Melbourne has entered a clear downward trajectory as it moves into mid-September, marking the definitive end of the summer peak. Demand in Period 31 was 53 units, a significant drop from the high-season average (>90) and the previous week (92). This aligns with seasonal patterns for summer lingerie/bodies as the school year starts and weather cools. Current on-hand inventory is 40 units. With lead time remaining consistent at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P29-P31) to capture this decelerating trend (average ~73) while allowing it to glide down toward the spring baseline of ~30-40. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to account for the heightened volatility observed during the transition out of the hyper-peak. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed in early September: 2-period average (P30-P31) dropped to 72.5 units/week, down from the August hyper-peak of 117 units, signaling the end of summer seasonality.

Demand over the last four periods (P29-P32) has been 74, 92, 53, and 66 units, respectively, averaging 71.25 units/week. This confirms a downward shift from the hyper-peak. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this post-peak regime (approx 71 units/week). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 7, and since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. Using recent data balances the risk of overstocking during seasonal decline with the need to serve the stabilized autumn baseline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Charlotte Body Push Melbourne spiked significantly in Period 33, reaching a record 154 units. This occurs at the end of September/beginning of October, suggesting a potential autumn promotional spike or 'Golden Week' style seasonal effect. The previous regime (Periods 30-32) averaged around 70 units/week, but the latest observation of 154 units is more than double that. Given that the product description is a 'lace push-up body', it is prone to high-volatility seasonal peaks. Because lead time is 0, I must ensure base stock covers this peak immediately. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 140 to balance the extreme outlier while still providing a buffer against stockouts during this high-demand burst. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the high variance observed in transition periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: sudden spike to 154 units (from ~70 average in early September), suggesting a late September/early October seasonal peak or promotion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Charlotte Body Push Melbourne SKU in period 33 spiked to 154 units (a new record high), potentially driven by late-September or early-October seasonality. However, period 34 saw a sharp cooling to 58 units, suggesting the spike was a concentrated event (likely a promotion or a short-lived seasonal peak). The current on-hand inventory is 82 units. Given the transition from a hyper-peak (P33: 154) to a moderate level (P34: 58), I need to set parameters that protect against further volatility while avoiding overstocking as we enter October. I will use a recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current volatility across the last few periods (averaging the 154 and 58) which results in a mu_hat calculation of (154+58+66)/3 = 92.6 units. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the service level q = 0.5, meaning base_stock will target the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in Oct/late Sept: Period 33 reached a record 154 units followed immediately by a drop to 58 units in Period 34, indicating high-impact, short-duration demand spikes.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Charlotte Body Push Melbourne SKU continues to exhibit high volatility following the significant late September spike. Period 35 demand was 86 units, which is a considerable rebound from Period 34's 58 units, but much lower than Period 33's record of 154. We are currently in mid-October. Historically, demand has shown several regimes: a stable baseline of ~25 units (April/June), summer peaks of ~80-120 units (August), and these recent high-volatility spikes. Given the current on-hand inventory of only 7 units and recent demand averaging 99 units over the last three periods (154, 58, 86), we must maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts. I will use the average of the last 3 periods (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this recent high-volatility regime, while using a larger N (N=10) for sigma_hat to capture the broader volatility seen since the peak of summer, ensuring the OR backend sets a sufficient safety stock. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: October high-volatility regime: Demand is fluctuating wildly between 58 and 154 units (Periods 33-35), averaging 99.3 units, significantly higher than early September levels (~72 units).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21. The product is experiencing high volatility in October, with demand over the last 4 periods (P33-P36) being 154, 58, 86, and 110. This averages 102 units/week. The last period (P36) resulted in a stockout (sold 100 on demand of 110). While there were significant spikes in late September (P33), the current regime seems to have stabilized at a higher level than early September but with continued fluctuations. The Mother's Day and summer peaks are past, but we are entering late October/November where pre-holiday or mid-autumn lingerie demand can be strong. Given the 100% stockout in P36 and the high volatility (std ~40), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (~102) to ensure enough stock to cover these frequent spikes while maintaining a 50% service level target (as profit and holding cost are equal). Historical lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed as high-volatility/high-volume: Average demand (P33-P36) is 102 units/week, a significant increase from the early September baseline of ~72 units/week (+42%), characterized by sharp weekly fluctuations.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Charlotte Body Push Melbourne has entered a high-volatility, high-volume regime in October. Recent weekly demands have been 154 (P33), 58 (P34), 86 (P35), 110 (P36), and 149 (P37). The 5-period average (P33-P37) is 111.4 units, representing a significant step up from the early September baseline of ~72. This period (P38, late October) precedes potential November sales events (Singles Day/Black Friday), so maintaining a robust stock level is critical. Period 37 ended with zero on-hand inventory due to a 149-unit spike, indicating we are under-ordering relative to the current peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility and elevated volume without over-weighting the outlier from P33 (154). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed as high-volatility peak: average demand (P33-P37) increased to 111.4 units/week with individual peaks up to 154 units. Stockouts occurred in 2 of the last 3 periods due to unexpected spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 487722001 is in a high-volatility peak demand regime during October and early November. Demand in the most recent period (P38) reached a record high of 183 units, leading to a stockout as the system only had 112 units on hand. This follows a pattern of high-demand spikes (P33: 154, P37: 149, P38: 183). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P33-P38) is approximately 123 units, but the trend is clearly upward. To prevent further stockouts during this volatile period, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) which averages 147 units/week, capturing the most recent acceleration. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to reflect the extreme volatility (std of ~37 units in that window). Since Lead Time is consistently 0, the base stock formula (L+1) simplifies to 1 * mu + z*sigma. This aggressive approach prioritizes stock availability given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1 implies a target service level of 50%, but the backend cap and our previous stockouts demand a robust safety buffer).

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand surge confirmed in late October: Demand reached 183 units in Period 38, significantly exceeding the previous October average of ~102 units and causing a total stockout.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Charlotte Body Push Melbourne has entered an extremely high and volatile regime starting in late September (Period 33), with demand peaking at 183 units in Period 38 and remaining high at 131 units in Period 39. This volatility is characteristic of peak season/promotional activity. The last 7 periods (P33-P39) have averaged 110.1 units/week, but the most recent 3 periods (P37-P39) have averaged 154.3 units/week. Given the trend of stockouts and the high variance, I am using recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this intense, immediate peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in late October/early November: the 3-period average (P37-P39) reached 154 units/week, significantly higher than the previous October average of ~102 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Charlotte Body Push Melbourne SKU entered a high-volume, high-volatility regime in October/November. The last three periods (P38-P40) show sustained high demand with an average of 146.7 units/week (183, 131, 126), significantly higher than the early October average. Given the current date is mid-November, we are likely in a pre-holiday ramp-up or sustained high season for this product category. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). To prevent stockouts seen in P37 and P38 while managing holding costs (which equal the profit margin), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this most recent high-demand level (approx 147 units). Sigma_hat is set to explicit because the backend's standard deviation calculation on a small N may not fully reflect the sharp 183-unit peak potential; a value of 30 provides a sufficient buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed for November: average demand (P38-P40) is ~147 units/week, up from the October average of ~102 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a high-demand regime for November, sustained for the last 4 periods (P38-P41) with an average demand of approximately 142 units/week (183, 131, 126, 128). This segment is significantly higher than the October average of ~102. Although P38 was an extreme outlier at 183, the subsequent three weeks have stabilized between 126-131. Given that we are approaching the end of November and heading into December, demand for lingerie/bodies often remains high due to holiday gift-giving and festive attire. I will focus on the most recent 4 periods (P38-P41) to capture this higher stable baseline while smoothing out the extreme peak from P38. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect this recent 4-week average will ensure the base stock levels remain sufficient for the holiday season without over-ordering based on the single extreme spike.

Carry-over insight: November demand stabilized: Periods 39-41 show highly consistent demand averaging 128.3 units/week, establishing a new stable high-demand baseline following the late October surge.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are entering the peak holiday season. Period 42 saw a significant demand spike to 183 units, identical to the previous record peak in Period 38, resulting in a total stockout. While November (P39-P41) showed stabilization around 128 units, the jump in late November (P42) suggests that December demand will be aggressively higher due to holiday gift-giving and festive wear (this is a lace push-up body). Historical lead time remains consistently 0. To prevent stockouts during the December peak while respecting the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), I will base mu_hat on an explicit forecast that accounts for this seasonal acceleration. I'll use the peak value of 183 as the base mean for the upcoming periods to ensure high service levels during the most critical shopping weeks, with a high sigma_hat (recent_N=5) to handle the volatility seen in October/November.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: December holiday surge confirmed starting P42 with demand returning to peak level (183 units), indicating a significant move above the November baseline of 128 units (+43%).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019, which is peak holiday season for lingerie. Period 43 demand dropped to 66 units after a peak of 183 in Period 42. However, this is likely a short-term fluctuation or 'breather' during the December surge rather than a regime shift downward, as historical holiday patterns often show high volatility between weeks. With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level by default. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the risk of stockouts during the final weeks of December, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the high-demand environment while acknowledging the latest dip. I'll set N=5 for mu_hat (covering Periods 39-43) to average the late November/early December activity (approx 127 units), and use N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the significant current volatility (std approx 44), ensuring the base stock level remains robust against another potential pre-Christmas spike.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December period (Period 45). Historical data shows a significant demand surge in Period 42 (183 units), followed by a sharp drop in Periods 43 (66 units) and 44 (83 units). This mirrors the high-volatility pattern seen in October/November, suggesting a 'lumpy' holiday demand profile where peak weeks are separated by lower-demand intervals. The December holiday surge noted in carry-over insights manifests as high variance rather than a sustained flat peak. Transitioning into the final weeks of December, I will use a recent_N calculation (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current post-spike average (~111 units), but use 'explicit' for sigma_hat with a value of 60 to protect against another potential 180+ unit spike before the game concludes. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: December demand volatility confirmed: Following early-Dec peak (183 units), mid-Dec demand dropped to an average of 74.5 units (P43-P44), indicating highly concentrated holiday purchasing rather than a sustained plateau.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-Christmas/Holiday week. Historically, specifically in Period 42 (Nov 25) and Period 43 (Dec 2), we saw a significant demand surge (183 units). Since then, demand has cooled to 83 and 87 units in the last two weeks (P44-P45), suggesting the peak holiday shopping for this item (Melbourne Lace Body) may have occurred earlier in the month or late November. For Period 46, I expect stable or slightly declining demand as shipping windows for Christmas close. I will use a 3-period average (P43-P45) for mu_hat, which captures the post-peak normalization (~78.6 units), rather than the full seasonal average which is skewed by the 183-unit outlier. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. sigma_hat is set using the same 3-period window to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization: Following the late Nov/early Dec peak of 183 units, demand in mid-to-late December (P44-P45) has stabilized at an average of 85 units/week.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. We are entering the post-holiday period. Historically, such as in Period 3 (late February), demand dropped significantly after seasonal peaks. Looking at recent trends, demand peaked in Period 42 at 183 units and has consistently cooled down over the last four periods (66, 83, 87, 44), with Period 46 showing a sharp drop to 44 units as the holiday season concludes. The 3-period average (P44-P46) is approximately 71 units, while the very latest observation is 44 units. To avoid overstocking during the post-holiday slump, I will shift to a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward transition. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand contraction confirmed at Period 46: Demand dropped to 44 units, a 50% decrease from the mid-December average (~85 units), signaling the final end of the 2019 holiday peak.
