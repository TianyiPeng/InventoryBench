The most recent three-period average is approximately 130 units. Given the date (mid-February), we are entering the spring season where demand for 'fast-drying functional' sports tights typically increases due to fitness resolutions and milder weather. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period's arrival phase and be available to satisfy this period's demand. To cover this period's expected demand (approx. 130 units) and protect against variability while considering a 1:1 Profit-to-Holding-Cost ratio (which favors avoiding overstock but requires meeting demand), I will target an order that covers the current period plus a small safety buffer.",
