Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical data (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a clear downward trend in demand: 49, 47, 19, 15, 14. This suggests a transition from a high-demand period (possibly post-holiday or specific promotion) to a lower baseline demand regime. The most recent three samples (19, 15, 14) indicate a mean of ~16. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no transit history, I'll use the 'calculate' method for lead time to let the backend observe performance once it starts. For demand (mu_hat), the 'recent_N' with N=3 captures the current low-demand regime (avg ~16) better than the full history (avg ~28.8). Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1:$1), minimizing excess inventory is critical. The OR backend will target a 50% service level (q = 1 / (1+1)), placing the base stock at approximately the median demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a jersey T-shirt (Divided Basics), which is a high-volume, relatively stable item. History shows a clear downward demand trend from early Jan (mid-40s) to Feb (mid-10s). Period 1 actual demand was 21, but we only sold 16 because we stocked out (on-hand was 16). The actual lead time for Period 1 was 0, matching the promised lead time. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the lower demand regime seen since late January (19, 15, 14, 21), which averages around 17.25 units per period. I am choosing N=4 to exclude the higher early January samples (49, 47) and focus on the current post-holiday/early-year level. mu_hat will be set via recent_N (N=4) and L will be kept at 'default' since the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Jersey T-shirt, which typically has steady demand. In Period 1 and 2, demand was 21 and 43 respectively, significantly higher than the initial historical samples from late January/early February (range 14-19). This suggests a demand regime shift as we move further into the spring season. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals in Periods 1 and 2 confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods. However, the system is currently stocking out (sold = actual starting inventory), which means the OR engine is under-ordering because 'mu_hat' hasn't adjusted to the recent spike. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent uptrend in demand (Period 1: 21, Period 2: 43, plus the last historical sample: 14) to lift the base stock level and prevent further stockouts while lead time remains at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from an average of ~16 in late Jan to ~32 in mid-Feb (Periods 1-2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 717490003 (Cat Tee) is experiencing a severe stockout as demand has surged significantly beyond previous levels. Since mid-February, actual demand has risen from 21 to 43 to 79. Comparing this to the historical pre-Feb data (average ~28), we are in a high-growth regime likely driven by the lead-up to spring/summer seasons for basic jersey t-shirts. My previous 'recent_N' approach and carry-over insight identified a shift to ~32, but Period 3 demand of 79 indicates the trend is accelerating faster than simple averages capture. Observation of game history confirms the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales and capture this momentum, I am using an explicit mu_hat based on the observed Period 3 demand (79) plus a small buffer for continued growth, setting it at 85 for the next period. I will also increase sigma_hat explicitly to 25 to account for the high volatility seen in this upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly at Period 3: 1-week demand reached 79, up from 43 in Period 2 and 21 in Period 1. Historical pre-game average was ~28.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Divided Basics' jersey T-shirt showed a significant spike in Period 3 (79 units) followed by a moderation in Period 4 (39 units). The carry-over insights correctly identified a regime shift, but the extreme peak in Period 3 appears to be a pulse rather than a new sustained level, as Period 4 dropped back significantly. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. We are currently holding 46 units. Given the high volatility (39 to 79 in two weeks) and the product's basic nature, I will use a recent window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the low early-Feb demand with the more recent high-demand periods (Average of P1-P4 is ~45.5). Using N=4 captures the recent surge while smoothing the Period 3 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Mean demand shifted from ~28 (pre-game) to ~45 (P1-P4 avg), with a high-variance spike of 79 in Period 3 followed by a correction to 39 in Period 4.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt,' which is entering the spring season (mid-March). Historical demand from the provided sample in early 2019 (Jan-Feb) was low (avg ~28), but recent game data shows a significantly higher and volatile regime. Demand peaked at 79 (P3), settled to 39 (P4), and was 48 (P5), suggesting a new 'spring' baseline. However, we have experienced consistent stockouts (ending on-hand=0 in 4 out of 5 periods), leading to lost sales and censored demand observations. In Period 5, we sold 46 units but demand was 48, indicating we are still under-ordering relative to actual customer interest. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on history (P1-P4). For Period 6, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~55) while acknowledging the high variance (sigma_hat) to protect against stockouts during this seasonal transition. Setting L to calculate since history confirms the 0-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher spring baseline (approx. 45-55 units/week) compared to the Jan-Feb pre-game average of 28. Consistent stockouts in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 5 indicate actual demand is likely higher than sold units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490003' (Divided Basics Jersey T-shirt) is experiencing a massive demand surge as spring arrives (late March). Last period (Period 6), demand spiked to 122 units, far exceeding the order of 56 and leading to another total stockout. Historical demand has shifted drastically from a January/early February mean of ~28 to a March average (Periods 4-6) of 69.6 units per week. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-growth phase, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (N=3: Periods 4, 5, 6) which includes the 122-unit spike. Given the high volatility (39, 48, 122), a recent_N sigma_hat is also necessary to increase the safety stock buffer. The OR engine needs high base stock to capture these lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand for March (Periods 4-6) is ~70 units, significantly higher than the February average of ~45. Period 6 saw a surge to 122 units during the start of the spring season.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, coinciding with the peak spring season for apparel (Cat Tee). Historical demand shows a consistent pattern of stockouts and increasing demand: March demand jumped from 39 (P4) to 122 (P6) and 148 (P7). The 'sold' units in periods 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 were capped by on-hand inventory, meaning true demand is significantly higher than historical mean sales. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To recover from back-to-back stockouts (ending Period 7 with 0 units after demand of 148 far exceeded the 70 ordered), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 160 to capture the current high-demand momentum and account for lost sales. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to provide a robust safety buffer for the high volatility observed in P6 and P7.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime expansion: April starts with a confirmed demand acceleration (March demand rose from 39 to 148). Constant stockouts (6 out of 7 periods) confirm that historical 'sold' data severely underestimates true market demand during the spring transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is April 8, 2019. Historical data shows a clear seasonal transition for this 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt). Demand transitioned from a January/February average of ~28 to a March/early April surge, with demand peaks of 122, 148, and 108 units. The actual demand consistently outstrips inventory (stockouts occurred in 6 of the last 8 periods). Period 8 finally saw a full fulfillment of 108 units due to a larger order, confirming that true demand is currently hovering around 100-150 units per week. Given the seasonality of a jersey T-shirt in April, demand is likely to stay elevated or continue increasing. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts and maximize profit (since profit equals holding cost, the OR engine service level will be 50%, but the cap protects against over-ordering), I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focusing on the last 3 periods which represent the high-demand spring regime (Periods 6, 7, 8). This targets a mean of approx 126 units/period (122+148+108)/3.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand plateau confirmed: Demand for Periods 6-8 averaged 126 units, representing a 4.5x increase over pre-game Jan/Feb levels and a 2.8x increase over mid-Feb levels.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490003' is a jersey t-shirt, which is currently in a high-demand spring phase. Historical data shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 6 (March 18), where demand reached levels of 122 and 148, significantly higher than earlier months. However, the last two weeks (Periods 8 and 9) have shown a demand deceleration from 108 down to 60. This suggests we have passed the initial spring peak and are entering a more stable, yet still elevated, plateau. Looking at the history, stockouts occurred in 6 out of the 9 periods, meaning 'sold' units underrepresented 'demand'. I will use a 4-period recent average (N=4) for Mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 6-9: 122, 148, 108, 60; Mean \u2248 110) which is safer than the long-term average. Lead time (L) is consistently 0. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to account for the high volatility observed in this spring period, ensuring the backend calculates a sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the recent dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction: After peaking in Periods 6-7 (avg 135), demand has declined for two consecutive weeks in mid-April (Periods 8-9 avg 84), suggesting the peak spring surge has concluded.

The current date is April 22nd. Demand for the 'Cat Tee' has shown a distinct downward trend since the late March/early April peak (148 units). The last three weeks have recorded demand of 108, 60, and 74 units respectively. While the most recent week saw a minor bounce (74 vs 60), the overall trajectory suggests the spring surge has stabilized or is cooling as we head into late April. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this cooling phase while maintaining responsiveness to the high-variance nature of this SKU (which has suffered frequent stockouts in the past), I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period window (Periods 7-10). This period includes both the peak of 148 and the lower values of 60 and 74, averaging approximately 98 units per week. This provides a safe buffer against the high stockout risk seen previously, while acknowledging the decreasing demand trend. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this 4-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed post-spring peak: Demand has averaged ~80 units over the last 3 periods (Periods 8-10), down from the ~135 units seen at the peak (Periods 6-7).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), we are in late spring. Analysis of the recent demand regime (Periods 8-11) shows an average demand of approximately 86.5 units, which is a stabilization after the peak spring surge in March/April. Period 11 saw a slight increase to 104 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The item is a 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt, which typically maintains significant baseline demand throughout the warmer months. Given the stockout in Period 11, the 'sold' units (98) once again underestimate true demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure we capture the demand without excessive holding cost (where profit and holding cost are equal), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4-period regime (Avg: 86.5) but adjust slightly upward via explicit estimation to 95 to account for the Period 11 stockout signal. Sigma_hat is set using the last 4 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization regime (Periods 8-11): Average demand is ~87 units, significantly lower than the March peak (~135) but over 3x higher than the Jan/Feb baseline. Stockout in Period 11 confirms demand still frequently exceeds 100 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Period 12 showed a massive demand spike (160 units), the highest since March, resulting in a complete stockout. This indicates the May 'summer' transition is driving demand significantly higher than the April 'post-peak' average (~87 units). Historic spring peaks reached 148, and Period 12 exceeded that. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and we are entering May (a peak season for 'Cat Tee' T-shirts), I must aggressively increase the base stock. The recent average (Periods 8-12) is ~101 units, but the last two observed demands have been 104 and 160. Setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) captures this immediate upward momentum (avg ~113 units per period). Due to the high volatility seen in spring transitions, I will use an explicit sigma_hat to provide a buffer against the 160+ demand levels, aiming to prevent the frequent stockouts observed throughout the game history.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime expansion for May: Demand spiked to 160 units in Period 12, surpassing the March peak of 148. This confirms that the post-spring stabilization was temporary and demand is accelerating into the summer season.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (717490003, Divided Basics T-shirt) is exhibiting high demand volatility as it transitions into May. We recently saw a peak in demand at Period 12 (160 units) followed by a sharp drop to 45 units in Period 13. This pattern mirrors the behavior observed in April (Periods 7-9), where a peak (148 units) was followed by a significant drop (60 units). The product has suffered stockouts in 8 out of 13 periods, indicating that we are consistently underestimating peak demand. With the current date of 2019/05/13, we are entering the warmer summer season where demand for basics like jersey T-shirts is expected to remain high and potentially spike again. Although Period 13 saw only 45 units sold, the historical average for the late spring/early summer regime (Periods 6-13) is approximately 102 units. Lead time is stable at 0. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture this entire high-demand regime for mu_hat (covering the transition from March to May) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility (standard deviation > 40) seen in the last 5 weeks. This should set a base stock level that protects against a return to the >140 units level while acknowledging the recent dip.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand volatility: Pattern of sharp demand spikes (>140 units) followed by corrections (~45-60 units) observed in both April (P7-9) and May (P12-13).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, moving deeper into the summer season for a 'Cat Tee'. Historical patterns show significant demand volatility in April and May, with peaks exceeding 140 units (P7, P12) followed by sharp corrections (P9, P13). Period 14 (last week) saw demand of 70 units, reinforcing the volatile nature of this SKU. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level q = 0.5, meaning it aims to satisfy the median demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for the observed May stabilization and recent volatility, I will use a recent window (N=3: Periods 12-14) to capture the current regime which includes a major spike and subsequent lower demand weeks. This results in a mu_hat reflective of the current average (~92 units) while acknowledging the high variance (sigma_hat).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Divided Basics' T-shirt has shown significant volatility throughout May, with a massive spike to 160 in Period 12 followed by a correction to the 45-72 range in Periods 13-15. We are currently in a post-spike stabilization phase. The last three periods (P13-P15) show an average demand of approximately 62 units (45, 70, 72). However, given the product type (T-shirt) and the approaching peak summer season (June/July), demand is likely to remain higher than the spring baseline but lower than the anomalous Period 12 spike. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for summer demand variance, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the immediate stabilized trend, while keeping L=0 and standard sigma calculation to manage the known high volatility of this SKU.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490003' is a jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its peak summer season (June 3rd). Inventory reached zero at the end of Period 16 due to a demand of 120 units, confirming the 'Summer Demand Volatility' pattern where demand spikes significantly above recent averages. Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), demand has been highly variable: 160, 45, 70, 72, and 120 (Avg: 93.4). The most recent demand (120) and the early summer date suggest that demand is entering a high plateau or another spike phase. To prevent continued stockouts (which have occurred in 10 out of 16 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the 93.4 average) but will use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (Standard Deviation of P12-P16 is ~44). Setting sigma_hat explicitly at 100 for a 1+L=1 period horizon ensures the inventory position covers these 120-160 unit spikes. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (June): Demand maintains high volatility with recurring spikes exceeding 120 units (observed P12: 160, P16: 120). Average demand for the May/June transition (P12-P16) has settled at ~93 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10), we are in a high-demand summer regime for this jersey t-shirt. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which simplifies inventory management, but frequent stockouts (Periods 11, 12, 16, 17) indicate that historical 'sold' data remains a lower bound for actual demand. Demand over the last 6 periods (P12-P17) shows high volatility with spikes up to 160 and an average demand of approximately 94.3 units. Given the summer season, high demand is expected to persist. In the last period (P17), demand was 99 units, leading to a stockout. To ensure we capture the full demand spike potential while balancing the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each, implying a 50% target service level), I will use the recent 6 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this window captures the modern summer volatility and prevents over-reliance on the lower post-spring stabilization data.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019, which is deep into the summer t-shirt season. Historical demand for this 'Cat Tee' has shown significant volatility throughout the spring and early summer, with frequent spikes exceeding 120 units and periodic stockouts when inventory was insufficient. Most recently, demand in Period 17 was 99 units (effectively 100) and Period 18 was 62 units. The 'Carry-Over Insights' indicate a mid-summer demand regime (P12-P16) averaging around 93 units. Given that Profit equals Holding Cost ($1.00), the backend OR engine will target a 50% service level (q = 0.5), which results in a base stock equal to the mean lead-time demand. However, historical data suggests that during peaks, keeping only the 'mean' leads to immediate stockouts and lost profit. To capture the upside of potential summer spikes while acknowledging the recent dip to 62 units, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 periods (P14-P18), which averages approximately 85 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. This strategy allows the engine to maintain enough inventory to cover the current average demand while the cap prevents excessive over-ordering if demand remains at the lower end of the volatile range.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, reflecting late-June peak summer demand. The product is a basic jersey t-shirt, which is currently in high seasonal demand. Analysis of recent history shows significant volatility with high spikes (e.g., Period 12: 160, Period 16: 120, Period 17: 99, Period 19: 94). Average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 89 units. However, frequent stockouts (Periods 16, 17, and 19) indicate that actual demand often exceeds available stock, meaning the true mean is likely closer to 95-100 units. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. Given the recurring stockouts and the upcoming peak summer weeks, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 105 to capture the true demand mean and prevent stockouts, while using 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain standard volatility coverage. Lead time is kept at 0 (promised).

Carry-over insight: Late June demand (Periods 17-19) remains strong with an average observed demand of ~85, but consistent stockouts confirm true market demand for this basic t-shirt often exceeds 100 units during the summer peak.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/07/01), we are in the peak summer season for this basic T-shirt. Historical data confirms a high-demand, high-volatility regime. Over the last four periods (Periods 17-20), the average demand was approximately 88.75 units, with a standard deviation around 18.2. However, frequent stockouts (Periods 17, 19, and nearly 20) indicate that true latent demand often exceeds 100 units. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which would suggest setting the base stock near the mean. However, given the zero lead time and the consistent underestimation of demand due to stockouts, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the summer baseline, while maintaining a default sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to handle recent variance. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8th, the peak of the summer season for a jersey t-shirt. Period 21 saw a massive demand spike of 211 units, leading to a complete stockout (sold 89). This follows the pattern described in Carry-Over Insights of 'summer peak' volatility where demand frequently exceeds 100-150 units. The previous estimate (Period 20/21) was too low to capture this July surge. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.50, which is naturally conservative; however, given the extreme demand spike (211 vs recent average of ~85), I must shift to an 'explicit' forecasting method to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture this seasonal peak without over-relying on historical averages that include low-demand spring/late-winter data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat to 160 (reflecting the recurring high-end demand peaks seen in P12 and P21) and sigma_hat to 50 to handle the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand spike confirmed: Period 21 demand reached 211 units, a seasonal high surpassing the previous summer peak of 160. Conservative estimation during July leads to high stockout costs.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic soft jersey t-shirt which exhibits high demand volatility during the summer months. Recent peak demand levels (Period 21: 211 units, Period 22: 146 units) confirm the garment is in a high-demand regime for July. Period 22 starting inventory of 160 was almost entirely exhausted (ending inventory 14), indicating that true demand remains significantly elevated over historical averages. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, but because stockouts have been frequent and severe during this period (e.g., selling only 89 when 211 were demanded in P21), I will use an explicit forecast to ensure the base stock covers a likely high-demand scenario. I'll set mu_hat based on the average of the last two high-demand weeks (~178 units) to ensure we capture the remaining summer peak while hedging against a potential high-holding-cost scenario if demand reverts to the 80-100 range.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand remains at seasonal peak: Average observed demand for Periods 21-22 is ~178 units, significantly higher than the June average (~85). Sustained lead time of 0 periods confirmed.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-to-late July (2019/07/22), which is the seasonal peak for a soft jersey t-shirt. The recent demand history shows high volatility with significant spikes: Period 21 saw a demand of 211 units, while the average demand for the last three periods (P21-P23) is approximately 154 units. Despite a slight cooling in Period 23 (demand=106), we must remain prepared for mid-summer surges. On-hand inventory is 72 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 23 conclude' message. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period average (~154) to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture remaining summer demand while accounting for the high volatility observed (sigma_hat).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July) average is ~154 units (Periods 21-23), significantly elevated from the June average of ~85.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, which is the very end of the summer season (the peak demand period for this jersey basic t-shirt). Historically, we observed that demand surged significantly in July, with peaks reaching 211 units (Period 21) and an average of approximately 154 units during the mid-July regime (Periods 21-23). However, the most recent observation in Period 24 shows a demand of 103 units, similar to the 106 units in Period 23 and down from the earlier July peaks. This suggests a potential stabilization or a slight cooling as we move toward the end of summer. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a decent service level for late summer demand, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture the July average (Periods 21-24: 211, 146, 106, 103; Average ~141.5). Setting mu_hat to this recent average and using recent_N for sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the remaining high-demand weeks of the season while accounting for the high July volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand (Periods 23-24) shows stabilization at ~105 units, lower than the early July peak of 211 but still significantly elevated compared to the June average of ~85.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). For this product (Cat Tee - Jersey Basic T-shirt), demand is entering the late summer/early fall transition. Historical demand patterns show a peak in July (Period 21: 211 units), followed by a cooling trend in late July (Periods 23-25 averaged 98 units). However, demand is still substantially higher than the Jan/Feb baseline (~28 units). Based on the last 3 periods (P23-P25), demand has stabilized around ~98 units with lower volatility (86-106). Since lead time has consistently remained 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' (which results in 0). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=4 (covering the last month of July) to capture the current post-peak stabilization level, ensuring we carry enough stock for a potential baseline of ~100 units while avoiding overstocking as the peak summer heat fades. The sigma_hat will also be set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to reflect the reduced volatility observed in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak summer demand stabilization: Demand has transitioned from a July peak (avg ~150) to a late July/early August baseline of ~100 units (Periods 23-25).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 27 (mid-August). The product is a basic jersey t-shirt. Historical data and carry-over insights show that demand peaked in July (avg ~150 units, peak 211) and has since stabilized in the 80\u2013100 unit range during late July and early August (Periods 24-26 demand: 103, 86, 82). The average demand for the last 3 periods is 90 units, while the average for the last 5 periods (since the July peak subsided) is 91.6 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts against holding costs (Profit $1 vs Holding Cost $1), I will use the recent stabilization regime (N=5) to set the parameters, capturing the current late-summer baseline while remaining responsive to the high historical variance of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand stabilization confirmed: Following the July peak, demand has settled into a 80-100 unit range (Periods 24-26 avg: 90 units).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are in the late-summer period for this 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant July peak (reaching up to 211 units) followed by a stabilizing trend in August. Demand in the last three periods (P25-P27) was 86, 82, and 59, respectively. The average for this late-summer stabilization period is approximately 76 units, which is a notable decrease from the July average (~150) but still much higher than the early-year baseline. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking as we exit the summer season, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent downward trend in the August cooling-off period, while maintaining sufficient stock for lingering summer demand. sigma_hat is set using a slightly longer window (N=5) to account for the volatility seen during the transition from the July peak.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand cooling confirmed: Demand decreased from a July average of ~150 units to an August average (P25-27) of ~76 units, indicating the seasonal peak has passed.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019/8/26). Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that we are past the July summer demand peak (~150 units/week) and have entered a late-summer cooling phase. Demand over the last 4 periods (P25-P28) has been 86, 82, 59, and 90, resulting in an average of approx. 79 units. The stockout in Period 28 (demand 90, on-hand 76) suggests that while demand is cooling, it still periodically exceeds the current inventory levels. Since the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat using a recent window of N=4 to capture this August baseline (~80 units) while maintaining enough safety stock (sigma_hat) to cover fluctuations back toward 100 units. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the $1 profit vs. $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level) but the safety stock will protect against the volatility seen in Period 28.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Demand for this jersey basic t-shirt showed a late-summer surge in the last two periods, with demand reaching 90 in Period 28 and 118 in Period 29, resulting in stockouts. This contradicts the previous 'cooling' trend observed earlier in August where demand was in the 60-80 range. Since we are entering the post-summer/back-to-school transition, and the last two periods averaged ~104 units, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods to capture this recent volatility/upturn (P27-P29 avg: 89, but the last two are 104). Using N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a balance between the late August cooling and the unexpected end-of-month spike. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand volatility: An unexpected demand spike occurred in late August (P28-P29 average: 104 units), reversing the early August cooling trend of ~70 units. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (2019/09/09), demand for this jersey basic t-shirt is entering the post-summer/early-autumn cooling phase. Over the last three periods (P28-P30), demand has been 90, 118, and 51, averaging 86.3 units. The late August spike (~104 avg) appears to have subsided, as evidenced by the sharp drop to 51 in the most recent period. However, given that this product often stocks out (most recently in P29), the 'sold' data remains a floor for true demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. I will set the lead time method to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period history. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent cooling trend (averaging 86.3 per period, or 86.3 for 1+L periods), which balances the high volatility seen in August with the recent low observation. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current elevated variance (std of [90, 118, 51] is ~33.8) caused by the fluctuating end-of-summer sales.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: Demand dropped to 51 in P30 after an end-of-summer spike in P28-29 (avg 104). Transitioning to early autumn baseline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering mid-September (2019-09-16). Demand for this basic jersey t-shirt has shown a clear decline as the summer peak ended. In the most recent period (P31), demand dropped to 28 units, following a cooling trend starting in P30 (51 units). This aligns with the transition from late summer into early autumn. The carry-over insights confirm that the end-of-summer spike (P28-P29) has passed. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 4 (covering periods 28-31) to capture this cooling trend (average demand ~72) while remaining responsive to the lower volumes observed in the last two weeks. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for agile adjustments. Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which naturally favors lean inventory when demand is falling.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand cooling confirmed: Demand decreased from an August average of ~85 units (P25-29) to a September average of ~40 units (P30-31), indicating the transition out of the summer/back-to-school peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Historical demand data and carry-over insights indicate that the high-demand summer and back-to-school periods have concluded. For September (Periods 30-32), demand has significantly cooled, recording values of 51, 28, and 37 (average of ~39). This aligns with the 'Autumn demand cooling' insight. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the recent regime shift to lower autumn demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-volume baseline (approx. 40 units/week) while avoiding being skewed by the much higher August/July data.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. We are in an autumn cooling phase for this basic jersey t-shirt. Period 33 demand was 51 units, which resulted in a stockout (on-hand was 39). This indicates that while demand has cooled from the summer peaks of 150+ units, it remains higher than the very low September troughs observed in Period 31 (28 units). The average demand for September (Periods 30-33) is 41.75 units. However, given the stockout in Period 33, the true market demand is likely closer to 55-60 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the specific September behavior, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect current volatility. This configuration aims to ensure we meet the current demand baseline without overstocking as we move further into the off-season.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a post-summer cooling phase where demand for this basic jersey t-shirt has transitioned from its summer peak (~150+ units) to an autumn baseline. Over the last five periods (P30-P34), demand has averaged 41 units (51, 28, 37, 51, 38). Although there was a stockout in Period 33, demand remained within the 30-50 range. The seasonal trend suggests stability or slight further cooling as we leave the 'back-to-school' window. Recent N=5 captures this post-summer regime (P30-P34). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The base stock level will target approximately 40-50 units total coverage (1.0 profit / 1.0 holding cost results in a 50% service level target by the OR backend, meaning the base stock will be roughly the mean demand for the lead time + review period).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime established (Oct): Average demand for Periods 30-34 settled at ~41 units, down from the August average of ~85 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. We are in the mid-autumn regime for this basic jersey t-shirt. Historical demand analysis shows a significant cooling trend since the summer peaks (which were >150 units). Demand over the last 6 periods (P30-P35) has been: 51, 28, 37, 51, 38, 26, averaging approximately 38.5 units per week. The most recent demand (P35) was 26, continuing a gradual decline. Stockout in P33 suggests true demand was slightly higher than 39, but P34 and P35 results (38 and 26 sold with ending inventory) confirm demand is currently stable around the 30-40 mark. I will set the demand mean (mu_hat) using the last 6 periods to capture this autumn baseline. Sigma_hat is also set via the last 6 periods to capture current volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand for this jersey basic t-shirt has continued to cool significantly from its summer peak of ~150 units to an autumn baseline. Over the last 4 periods (P33-P36), observed demand has been 51, 38, 26, and 18, showing a clear downward trend towards the winter season. The average demand over these last 4 periods is approximately 33 units. Given the transition into late October, I expect demand to stabilize at or slightly below this level. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this current downward-sloping autumn regime, which correctly reflects the transition from the ~40 unit average observed in September to the lower levels seen in the last two weeks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand cooling confirmed: Demand decreased from a September average of ~40 units (P30-P34) to an October average (P35-P36) of ~22 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the late-autumn period (late October) has stabilized significantly compared to the summer and early autumn peaks. Over the last three periods (P35-P37), observed demand has been 26, 18, and 24, averaging approximately 22.7 units per week. This aligns with the 'carry-over insight' from Period 37. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory holding costs while maintaining service levels for this basic t-shirt SKU, I will use a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on the last 5 periods (P33-P37) to capture the current lower-demand regime while accounting for the slight volatility seen in Period 33 (51 units) and Period 34 (38 units). This provides a conservative but responsive buffer as we head into November.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/4. We are in the late autumn regime. Over the last four periods (P35-P38), demand has been consistently low and stable, with values of 26, 18, 24, and 17, averaging 21.25 units. This confirms the cooling trend noted in Carry-Over Insights. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Since lead time is 0, the base stock (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) should cover the current period's demand. With profit ($1.0) equal to holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR backend will set the base stock close to mu_hat. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this current late-autumn demand regime (approx. 21 units/week) while ignoring the higher volatility of the early autumn and summer peaks. This will minimize holding costs while providing sufficient coverage for the current low-demand environment.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Historical data and recent 'conclude' messages indicate a stable late-autumn demand regime. Demand since Period 35 (early October) has consistently remained in the 15-26 units/period range, with an average of approximately 20 units per week. Specifically, the last five periods (P35-P39) show demand values of 26, 18, 24, 17, and 15 respectively. No upcoming major retail spikes for this specific item (a basic jersey t-shirt) are anticipated in mid-November before the holiday rush likely begins in late November/December. The lead time has remained consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Therefore, I am selecting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this localized autumn baseline, ensuring the OR backend targets a level appropriate for current market conditions while minimizing holding costs for the 7 units already on hand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has shifted into a low-volume late autumn/early winter regime. For the last 6 periods (P35-P40 corresponding to mid-October through mid-November), the average demand has dropped to approximately 18.5 units per week (values: 26, 18, 24, 17, 15, 11), consistently lower than the previous September/early October average of ~40 units. Specifically, the most recent 3-week average is ~14 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. We are approaching the holiday season (late November/December), which may see a slight lift for basic t-shirts due to gifting or indoor apparel needs, but there is no evidence of this yet in the data. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.5 critical ratio as 1/(1+1)), I will use a recent_N (N=6) approach for both mean and sigma to capture this lower baseline while maintaining enough safety stock for the high volatility observed in this SKU throughout the year.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand stabilization (Nov): Demand for Periods 36-40 averaged ~15 units, indicating a further decline from the October average of ~22 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 42 (late November). Demand for this basic jersey t-shirt has steadily declined from its summer peak (~150-200 units), stabilized in October (~22 units), and has further settled into a late-autumn/winter baseline. Over the last five periods (P37-P41), observed demand values were 24, 17, 15, 11, and 12, resulting in an average of 15.8 units per period. The demand regime appears stable at this low level. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which corresponds to setting the base stock at the median (\u03bc\u0302). I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this most recent late-autumn stabilization regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we don't overstock based on older, higher-demand data from October or September.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019. We are in the late autumn/early winter season. Historically, demand for this basic jersey t-shirt has been steadily declining since the summer peak, stabilizing at a low baseline. However, Period 42 showed a demand of 22, which is a slight increase compared to the previous four weeks (average ~13). This could indicate early holiday gift-buying or simply random variation. Because the stock ran out in Period 42 (on-hand 0), actual demand might have been higher than 22. To avoid stockouts while acknowledging the overall downward trend, I am using a recent window of 5 periods (Periods 38-42) to capture the most recent activity. This N=5 window includes the low points (11, 12, 17) and the recent uptick (22), creating a balanced mean. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019 (Period 44). The product is a basic soft jersey T-shirt. Historical data from early 2019 (pre-game) and the most recent periods (P36-P43) show a low-demand winter baseline. Demand for the last 8 periods (P36-P43) has averaged 15.75 units, significantly lower than the summer peak of >150 units. Recent periods (P41-P43) show stable demand around 13-14 units (observed: 12, 22, 7), with P42 showing a minor spike likely due to late November promotions/Black Friday. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. Given the winter seasonality for a t-shirt, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current stable low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 0.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December (2019-12-16). Demand for this basic cotton t-shirt has stabilized at its lowest seasonal level, averaging 12 units/week over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). This is significantly lower than the summer peak of ~150 units. While there was a slight uptick in demand during late November (P42 demand: 22), demand has since retreated to single digits (P43: 7, P44: 8). Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will use a short lookback window (recent_N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current winter baseline and avoid over-ordering based on older, higher-demand data from October/November. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime confirmed: Average demand for Dec (P43-P44) has settled at ~8 units/week, down from the Nov average of ~15 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), which coincides with the Christmas holiday period. Historically, for this SKU (Cat Tee, a basic jersey t-shirt), we've seen a sharp decline from summer peaks (>150 units) to a stable winter regime of ~8-15 units. However, Period 45 showed a demand spike to 16 units, causing a stockout. Period 42 also saw a spike to 22 units. Given the Christmas holiday week, there is a likely temporary surge in gifting or basic replenishment demand. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods (confirmed throughout history, including recent periods), I will set L to 'default'. To manage the holiday volatility while respecting the low winter baseline, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (averaging P41-P45 demand: 12, 22, 7, 8, 16 -> approx 13 units) to capture the slight uptick without over-ordering for the post-holiday January lull. I will set sigma_hat to recent_N=5 to account for the increased variance seen in the last 5 periods (std approx 6).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: December demand shows periodic spikes (P42: 22, P45: 16) despite a low seasonal average of ~8-10 units, likely due to holiday shopping.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 47 (2019/12/30), which is the final period of the year. The product is a basic jersey t-shirt. Historical data from early last year (Jan/Feb 2019) shows demand in the range of 14-49 units as the spring season approached. Currently, we are in a low-demand winter regime, with the last 4 periods (P43-P46) averaging ~11.75 units, although recent stockouts in P45 and P46 suggest actual demand is slightly higher than the sold units. Given the transition from late December into January, I anticipate a gradual increase in demand as we move towards the spring season, mirroring the trend seen at the start of the historical data provided. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of 5 periods (P42-P46) to capture the current holiday/winter baseline while accounting for recent volatility, but I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure we have enough stock to meet a potential early January uptick (forecasting ~20 units) and avoid a third consecutive stockout.
