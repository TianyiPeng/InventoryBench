Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is 'Madison skinny HW', a staple denim item. Observed historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 157.2 units (168, 172, 173, 123, 150). There is a slight dip in late January, but demand remains relatively stable. Promised lead time is 0. Since we have no on-hand inventory and no in-transit units, we need to establish a base stock immediately to meet demand for the current period and the immediate future. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they represent the most recent demand regime leading into February. Method 'default' for L is appropriate as we have no historical lead time evidence to suggest otherwise yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 203, which is significantly higher than the initial historical average (mean ~157). The actual lead time was confirmed as 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we are in a high-demand phase (potentially due to the 'Womens Everyday Collection' trousers seeing early spring interest in February), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the upward trend (using the last 2 historical arrivals plus the Period 1 actual demand). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to incorporate the recent volatility while maintaining a reasonable safety stock to prevent another stockout. Lead time remains 'default' at 0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/02/25). The SKU 573085004 (Women's denim) is experiencing significant stockouts. In P1, demand was 203 (inventory was 193). In P2, demand spiked to 283 (inventory was 208). The historical pre-game samples (avg ~157) are no longer representative. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on P1 and P2 arrivals. The current trend suggests a demand regime shift likely driven by early spring shopping for staples. To address the persistent stockouts, I will use recent_N=2 for demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the sharp increase (avg 243) and set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high volatility shown in the P2 jump. This will raise the base stock level to better meet the 95% service level target (implied by the high profit/holding cost ratio) and prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: Demand increased from historical avg ~157 to ~243 (+55%) over the last 2 periods; stockouts occurred in both P1 and P2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demand (pre-game) averaged 157. Game history shows a significant shift: P1 (203), P2 (283), and P3 (235). The 'Carry-over insight' correctly identified a regime shift starting 2019-02-11. The mean demand for the last 3 periods is approx 240 units. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period). We are currently holding 91 units. Since demand is significantly higher than the training mean, using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the current higher volume and volatility. Since L=0, the backend will calculate base_stock for (1+0)=1 period of demand (mu_hat is defined as (1+L)*mean). Using N=3 (all game periods) is the most reactive approach to the observed regime shift while avoiding stockouts seen in P1 and P2.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (2019-03-11), we continue to observe a sustained demand regime shift for the 'Madison skinny HW' jeans. While the initial jump in Period 1 and 2 was extremely high (203, 283), leading to stockouts, demand has stabilized over the last two periods (Period 3: 235, Period 4: 228). The carry-over insight noted a shift from ~157 to ~243. Given the last four actual demand samples (203, 283, 235, 228), the mean is 237.25 with a standard deviation of 33.7. The promised lead time of 0 periods is consistent with historical arrivals (all arrived in the period ordered). I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this 'high demand' regime accurately for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L calculated automatically. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for this higher plateau while avoiding the skew of the lower pre-game historical samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand for the period 2019-02-11 to 2019-03-04 is 237 units, significantly higher than the 123-173 range observed in Jan/early Feb.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th, 2019. This product (women's skinny HW jeans) has shown a sustained demand regime shift starting in mid-February. The historical demand (Jan) averaged ~157, while the recent 5 periods (Feb 11 - Mar 11) have averaged 231.4 units (203, 283, 235, 228, 208). Although demand has softened slightly from the peak in Period 2 (283), it remains consistently above the initial Jan baseline. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on five consecutive cycles of same-period arrival. Inventory is currently 85 units on-hand with zero in-transit. To maintain a high service level amidst this higher demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the full scope of the current post-February 11th trend, ensuring the OR backend calculates mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the localized mean (~231) rather than the lower long-term average.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085004' (womens skinny jeans) experienced a significant demand jump in mid-February, which has now stabilized at a lower but still elevated level compared to January. Over the last three periods (P4-P6), demand was 228, 208, and 193 respectively, averaging 209.7 units. This represents a cooling from the initial spike (P2-P3 avg ~259) but remains higher than the Jan average (~157). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (q = 0.95), I am setting mu_hat to cover (L+1)=1 period of demand using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this stabilized post-spike regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-February spike: Period 4-6 average demand is 210 units, compared to the initial Period 2-3 spike average of 259 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/1. Historical analysis shows demand for this SKU peaked in February (avg ~243) and has been steadily declining since: Period 4-6 averaged 210, and Period 7 dropped significantly to 137. This suggests the post-winter/early spring surge is tapering off. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods as seen in all 7 concluded periods. With on-hand inventory at 102 and the most recent demand at 137, we are approaching a lower demand regime. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the downward trend in both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level adjusts to the reduced demand to minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level (~95% implied by the profit/cost ratio).

Carry-over insight: Demand downtrend confirmed: Period 7 demand (137) is significantly lower than Period 4-6 average (210), suggesting the seasonal peak has passed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1864.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has shown a clear downward trend since its peak in February and early March. The most recent demand figures (137 in Period 7 and 106 in Period 8) confirm a return to levels closer to the pre-spike baseline (Jan/Feb range was 123-173). Given that we are now in early April, the post-winter/early spring peak period seems to have concluded. Observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering and incurring unnecessary holding costs on a declining trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3. This focuses on the most current demand signals (avg. 145 units) while acknowledging the volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the current variability in this cooling phase. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the current lower demand regime rather than the historical highs.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Period 7 and 8 (avg 121.5) show demand returning to late-Jan baseline levels, ending the Feb/March high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $862.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has significantly declined over the last three periods (137, 106, 54), confirming the end of the February/March high-demand regime. The current date is April 15th, and the most recent demand (54) is substantially lower than the previous historical averages. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. With 164 units on-hand and a current demand trend averaging around 54-80 units, we are overstocked. I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 samples (Periods 7, 8, 9) to capture this downward momentum and prevent further inventory accumulation. The 'explicit' sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility observed during this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: Demand has significantly cooled post-peak, with the last 3 periods averaging 99 units and the most recent demand hitting a series low of 54.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for these 'Madison skinny HW' trousers has seen a significant decline from the February/March peak (~200-280 units) to a much lower level. Over the last three periods (P8-P10), demand has been 106, 54, and 60 respectively, averaging approximately 73 units. This suggests the high-demand regime is over and we have entered a stable low-demand phase. On-hand inventory is currently 114 units, which is already higher than any recent single-period demand. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently shows orders arrive in the same period (L=0). To prevent further accumulation of excess inventory and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient safety buffer, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (N=3) of the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime stabilized: Average demand for the last 3 periods (P8-P10) is 73 units, a significant decrease from the early spring peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has significantly cooled as we move further into spring, dropping from a peak average of ~237 units in February/March to an average of 52.6 units over the last three periods (54, 60, and 44). The current date is 2019-04-29. This downward trend is sustained and suggests the product is entering a low-demand baseline regime. My previous carry-over insight noted a shift at P10, and recent data confirms this. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this new baseline (approx 53 units per period). Although the promised lead time is 0, history shows arrivals are consistent with this, so I will continue using L=calculate to monitor for any shifts. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the reduced volatility associated with the lower volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new low baseline: Average demand for the last 3 periods (P9-P11) is 52.7 units, down from the P10 status and significantly below the spring peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is women's 5-pocket stretch denim jeans. Demand has consistently declined since the peak in mid-February/March, stabilizing at a much lower baseline. The demand for the last four periods (P9-P12) was 54, 60, 44, and 35 units respectively. The average demand over the last three periods (P10-P12) is 46.3 units, signaling a continued cooling trend compared to previous carry-over insights. Total on-hand inventory is 42 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0, we only need to cover the current period's demand. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new low-demand baseline (approx 46 units), which suggests very little to no inventory needs to be ordered given the current 42 units on hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new low baseline: Average demand for the last 3 periods (P10-12) is 46.3 units, continuing the post-peak decline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the product (Women's high waist skinny jeans) has reached a new low baseline following a post-February/March seasonal peak. The most recent demand figures are 60, 44, 35, and 22, showing a consistent decline. The average demand over the last three periods (P11-P13) is 33.7 units. The current on-hand inventory is 46 units, which already covers the current expected demand given the cooling trend. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game history. I will set mu_hat to reflect this new lower demand regime using the last 3 samples, and maintain a 0 lead time. This approach ensures we don't overstock during this low-demand phase while maintaining a service level consistent with the profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new low baseline: Average demand for the last 3 periods (P11-P13) is 33.7 units, down from 46.3 in the previous period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019-05-13 was 19 units, continuing a long-term cooling trend from the spring peak. For the current decision (Period 15, 2019-05-20), we observe that demand has been consistently low for the last 4 periods (avaging approximately 25 units). The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To manage holding costs effectively while maintaining a sufficient service level for this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 4-period window (P11-P14). This timeframe captures the stabilized low-demand state (44, 35, 22, 19). Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat will set the base stock to cover the expected demand of approximately 30 units, preventing overstocking as the product enters its late-spring/early-summer phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at low baseline: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P11-P14) is 30 units, confirms a sustained move from the P7-P10 transition phase.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-27, and the SKU is a pair of high-waist skinny jeans. Historical data and recent demand history show a significant seasonal cooling following a peak in February and March. Demand has stabilized at a new low baseline, with the last five periods (P11-P15) recording demands of 44, 35, 22, 19, and 19 units, respectively. The average demand for the most recent four periods is approximately 23.75 units. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current low-demand regime while maintaining a small buffer for slight fluctuations. This approach prevents over-ordering and minimizes holding costs as the product moves through its post-peak phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new low baseline: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 27.8 units, confirming the end of the spring seasonal peak.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 573085004 (women's jeans) has stabilized at a very low baseline as we enter June. Demand over the last 5 periods has been consistently low (22, 19, 19, 13), averaging 18.25 units. The most recent demand of 13 units marks the lowest in the recorded history. This confirms the previously identified end of the spring seasonal peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs in this low-demand environment, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-volume regime. This will set a base stock level that reflects the current mean of ~18 units per period plus a small safety buffer for volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Madison skinny HW 5-pocket jeans' has reached a stable low-demand regime following its spring peak. In the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has consistently ranged between 13 and 22 units, with the most recent two periods (P16 and P17) both recording exactly 13 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods is 15.2 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the remaining baseline demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stabilized low-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at baseline: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is 15.2 units, significantly lower than the previous transition period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has stabilized at a low baseline as we enter mid-June. Demand over the last five periods (P14-P18) has been 19, 19, 13, 13, and 6, averaging 14 units per period. The most recent demand (6 units) confirms a continuing downward trend as the peak spring season for this specific 5-pocket jeans SKU has passed. On-hand inventory is currently 18 units, which covers more than one period of the current average demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the current low-demand regime, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the most recent demand behavior (averaging ~14 units) to set the base stock level appropriately for the next period, ensuring the OR backend targets a level that reflects the current cooling market.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has stabilized at a very low summer baseline compared to the spring peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is 12.6 units. Specifically, the most recent demand values are 19, 13, 13, 6, and 12. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat accurately captures this 10-15 units/week regime without over-reacting to the single low of 6 in P18. The actual lead time consistently confirms the promised lead time of 0. Current on-hand of 11 units is slightly below the expected weekly demand, so a small restock is appropriate to maintain the desired service level (calculated as q = 19/20 = 0.95) while minimizing holding costs for this low-velocity period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085004 (Womens skinny jeans) is currently in a very low-demand summer phase. Over the last three periods (P18-P20), actual demand has been [6, 12, 3], averaging only 7 units per period. This follows a significant and sustained decline from the spring peak observed in February and March. The carry-over insights confirm this stabilization at a low baseline. The lead time has consistently remained at 0, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is to maintain just enough inventory to satisfy this low demand without overstocking. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this most recent low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculations are based on the current 7-unit average rather than the much higher historical data.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is a staple item (5-pocket jeans) which saw a significant seasonal peak in Feb/March and has since stabilized at a much lower baseline. Over the last 4 periods (P18-P21), demand has consistently remained in the single or low double digits (6, 12, 3, 5), averaging 6.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 13 units, which is approximately twice the current average weekly demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this low-demand phase, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the current stabilized baseline of approximately 8 units per period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a staple item (5-pocket jeans) which saw a significant seasonal peak in Feb/March and has since stabilized at a very low summer baseline. Analysis of the last 5 periods (P18-P22) shows demand values of 6, 12, 3, 5, and 2, resulting in a mean of 5.6 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 14 units, which covers approximately 2.5 periods of the current average demand. Since the lead time remains consistently 0 (as confirmed by the 'Period 22 conclude' message showing the P22 order arrived in the same period), and demand is currently very stable at this low level, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current summer baseline. This will target a base stock level sufficient to cover the low demand while minimizing holding costs on the 14 units already on hand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (2019-07-15), demand spiked unexpectedly to 109 units, far exceeding the recent baseline of ~10 units. This suggests a new demand regime or a seasonal event (e.g., Back-to-School or summer sale), resulting in a stockout (on-hand is now 0). Given the inventory is depleted and demand has shifted, I need to react to this spike while remaining cautious. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To address the new volatility and higher mean, I will use a recent window that captures the spike (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=3 (Periods 21, 22, 23) balances the low demand of the previous weeks (5, 2) with the high spike (109), averaging out to approximately 38.7 units per period. This provides a buffer for potential continued high demand without over-ordering excessively if the spike was a one-off anomaly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 23: Demand spiked to 109 units from a previous 5-period average of ~6 units (+1700%), resulting in a stockout.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand shift was detected in Period 23 (July 15), where demand spiked to 109 units from a very low summer baseline. Period 24 demand followed at 73 units, confirming that this is not a one-off outlier but a sustained regime change, likely a late-summer/back-to-school or promotional push for denim. The average demand for these two high-activity periods is 91 units. Following the rule for recent_N (N = max(min(regime_length, 20), 3)), I will use N=3 to capture this new regime while including the transition. Observed lead time consistently remains 0. The objective is to maintain high service levels during this new spike while managing holding costs as on-hand inventory is currently 66.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (Period 23-24): Demand spiked from <10 avg to ~91 avg, indicating a secondary seasonal peak for denim products starting late July.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085004 (Womens denim jeans) is currently in a secondary seasonal peak (Back-to-School/Late Summer) that began in late July (Period 23). In Period 25 (July 29), demand was 89 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime compared to the early summer lull. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P23-P25) is approximately 90.3 units (109, 73, 89). Given the product category and date (August 5), demand is expected to remain elevated. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To ensure adequate local stock for this spike while minimizing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this new regime, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2299.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Madison skinny HW' (denim) is experiencing a sharp secondary peak, likely driven by 'Back-to-School' shopping in August. Demand in Period 26 surged to 204 units, more than double the previous two periods (73, 89) and causing a stockout despite an arrival of 59 units. The actual lead time remains 0 (consistent since Period 1). Given this significant spike and the stockout in Period 26, I need to raise the base stock level significantly to capture this high-demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the shift from Period 23 onwards (avg demand: (109+73+89+204)/4 = 118.75). Setting mu_hat using N=4 will target this new level (approx 237.5 for L+1), and N=4 for sigma_hat will account for the high volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peak confirmed: Period 26 demand spiked to 204 units (+130% vs Period 25), leading to a stockout. High-demand regime for late July/August now averages 118.8 units (P23-P26).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085004 (high-waisted jeans) is experiencing a severe Back-to-School demand peak in mid-August. Demand surged from 204 in Period 26 to 440 in Period 27, resulting in a total stockout (sold 216 of 440). This follows a established pattern where August denim demand significantly exceeds July levels. Given the current date is 2019-08-19, we are in the heart of the peak season. Since the last two periods (P26-P27) averaged 322 units and the trend is sharply upward, using a recent_N (N=2) for mu_hat would lead to 644 (1+L * 322), which might still be conservative if the trend continues. However, consistent with the OR engine's mechanics and the goal to maximize profit while managing the stockout, I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for this peak. P27 demand was 440; I will forecast the next period at 450 to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture remaining peak demand. L remains 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School peak intensified at Period 27: Demand hit 440 units, a 115% increase from Period 26 (204) and a 400%+ increase from the late July average (~90). This confirms a late August hyper-peak for this product category.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the midst of a significant Back-to-School demand peak for denim products. Period 27 saw a massive spike to 440 units, and Period 28 remained extremely high at 414 units. Although demand dropped slightly from P27 to P28, it remains roughly 4x higher than the late July average. The on-hand inventory of 331 units is less than the demand observed in either of the last two periods, necessitating a strategy that maintains high service levels while acknowledging we may have passed the absolute hyper-peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 26, 27, and 28 average: 352.6) while being responsive to the slight downward turn from 440 to 414. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, but I will continue using 'calculate' to benefit from historical stability. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for the heightened volatility observed during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peak appears to have plateaued or slightly peaked: Period 27 (440) and Period 28 (414) show sustained hyper-demand compared to the early August average of ~118.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085004 (Madison skinny jeans) is currently experiencing a Back-to-School seasonal peak. Following the hyper-peak in Periods 27 and 28 (demand 440 and 414), demand has started to decelerate in Period 29 (329), suggesting the peak has passed and we are entering the post-labor day cooling phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid significant overstocking as demand regresses toward the mean, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to a more recent window (N=3) to better capture this downward trend (average of P27-P29 is ~394, whereas the full regime since the spike is lower). Sigma_hat is set to a wider window (N=7) to maintain a safety buffer against the high volatility observed during the August peak.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peaked at Period 27 (440 units) and has begun a downward trend as of Period 29 (329 units), signaling the end of the hyper-peak phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8487.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' denim trouser, which experienced a massive 'Back-to-School' seasonal spike throughout August. Contrary to the previous observation in Period 30 suggesting a downward trend, Period 30 demand actually hit 457 units (a new series high), indicating that the hyper-peak is sustained into early September. The average demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) is approximately 410 units. With current on-hand inventory at 196 units and no units in transit, we are significantly under-stocked for a 400+ unit demand regime. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this sustained high-demand phase (410 average x (1+0) = 410) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility during this peak. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School hyper-peak sustained: Demand in Period 30 hit a new series high of 457 units; the average demand for Period 27-30 is 410 units, showing no significant drop-off yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5616.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Back-to-School hyper-peak (late August/early September) is showing signs of moderate cooling, with demand dropping from a peak of 457 (Period 30) to 306 (Period 31). However, historical patterns from the spring peak (Feb-Mar) suggest that demand often plateaus or declines gradually rather than crashing instantly. The current on-hand inventory is 198 units. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally aim for a high service level. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (P28-P31: 414, 329, 457, 306) to capture the current high-demand context while acknowledging the recent decrease, resulting in a mean of approximately 376.5. This ensures the base stock is high enough to satisfy remaining seasonal demand without excessive overstocking as we enter mid-September.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School peak is transitioning: Period 31 demand (306) is the lowest in 4 periods, down 33% from the P30 peak (457), indicating the hyper-peak is cooling but remains elevated compared to early August.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2686.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Back-to-School seasonal peak is clearly receding. Demand in Period 32 (159 units) dropped significantly from the Period 27-30 hyper-peak average (~410 units) and the Period 31 level (306 units). The product, being 5-pocket denim, is likely transitioning into a more stable autumn demand profile. Currently, we have 335 units on hand with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs as the peak ends, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent cooling trend (avg of last 2 periods is ~232, but P32 specifically is 159). I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (averaging 306, 457, 159 is still too high at 307) so I will choose explicit for mu_hat to target a more conservative estimate closer to the current P32 real-world observation (160) to prevent overstacking. Sigma_hat will use recent_N=3 to reflect the high but decreasing volatility of this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-peak ended at Period 31; Period 32 (159 units) shows a 48% decrease from Period 31 (306 units), signaling a transition to a lower autumn demand regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Back-to-School seasonal peak (which saw demand reach 457 units in early September) has clearly passed. Recent demand has been volatile but trending downward: P32 was 159, and P33 was 284. The product, 'Madison skinny HW jeans,' is a staple 'Womens Everyday' item. While the hyper-peak is over, late September and early October typically maintain a medium-high baseline for denim compared to mid-summer. Given the transition, I'll use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this step-down from the 400s while acknowledging the current demand is still significantly higher than the spring/summer baseline (~250 avg across the last 3 periods). Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility seen during this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School transition confirmed: Demand has shifted from a hyper-peak (avg ~410) to a medium-high autumn regime, averaging 250 units over P31-P33.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The 'Back-to-School' hyper-peak (late August/early September) has definitively passed. Historically, this product (women's skinny jeans) saw a significant peak in late Feb/March (Regime 1) followed by a sharp decline in April/May. We are now seeing a similar post-peak cooling pattern after the late August hyper-peak (P27-P31: avg ~390 units). Demand in the last three periods (P32-P34) has been highly volatile but trending downwards (159, 284, 126), averaging 189 units. This is a 50%+ reduction from the hyper-peak. Given the current on-hand inventory of 255 units and a lead time of 0, the objective is to prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for the stabilization phase of the autumn season. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this downward momentum, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility (126-284 range). No new orders are likely necessary given on-hand inventory exceeds the 3-period average, but the OR engine will determine the precise amount based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School cooling trend established: Period 32-34 average demand (189 units) is significantly lower than Period 27-31 hyper-peak average (391 units).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has exited the Back-to-School hyper-peak and is now stabilizing in a lower post-peak autumn regime. Demand in the most recent period (P35) was 95 units, following a cooling trend (159, 284, 126, 95 in P32-P35). The average of the last three periods (P33-P35) is 168 units, which represents the current 'medium-low' status more accurately than the long-term history or the recent hyper-peak. With on-hand inventory at 232 units and a promised lead time of 0 periods, we currently have enough stock to cover the expected demand for the upcoming period without placing a large order. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward stabilization while maintaining enough safety stock to handle minor volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand reached a new stabilized baseline: Period 33-35 average demand is 168 units, down from the P31-P33 transition average of 250 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has continued its post-back-to-school cooling trend. As of Period 37 (October 21, 2019), demand has fallen from the August/September hyper-peak (avg ~400) to a much lower baseline. The last three periods (P34-P36) show demands of 126, 95, and 79, averaging 100 units. The current on-hand inventory is 257 units, which is significantly higher than the most recent demand signals. Given the seasonal nature of denim, we expect demand to remain at this lower level or continue a slight decline as we head further into autumn. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safe service level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this new stabilized low-demand regime. This will likely result in a very small or zero order this period, allowing current excess inventory to clear.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a new low autumn baseline: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P34-P36) is 100 units, significantly lower than the P31-P33 transition average of 250 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for 'Madison skinny HW' jeans has stabilized at a lower autumn baseline following the significant Back-to-School hyper-peak (August/September). The last four periods (P34-P37) shows demand values of 126, 95, 79, and 80. This averages 95 units per period, consistently lower than the transition average of ~168 observed in the previous three periods. There is no evidence of lead-time deviation (actual remains 0). With on-hand inventory at 177 units, which is approximately two units of forecasted demand (95 * 1.86), and a 0-period lead time, the inventory is currently sufficient. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this stabilized lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the high summer historical data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new low autumn baseline: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P34-P37) is 95 units, confirming a shift from the post-peak transition phase.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for the product (Madison skinny jeans) has stabilized into a lower autumn baseline following the significant Back-to-School peaks of August and September. Demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) has been 126, 95, 79, 80, and 67, representing a consistent cooling trend with a 5-period average of 89.4 units. Although earlier insights suggested a regime around 95-100 units, the most recent three periods (P36-P38) average 75.3 units, indicating the baseline is still slowly descending as we move deeper into Q4. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining demand environment, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current lower baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at the promised default of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower autumn levels: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 89.4 units, down from the post-peak transition average of ~168.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 573085004 (women's skinny jeans) continues to stabilize at a post-peak autumn baseline. The most recent demand was 66 units, mirroring the previous period's 67. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 77.4 units. Since there are no new seasonal indicators or calendar drivers for a spike in mid-November for this specific basic denim item, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this stable, cooling regime. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to ensure the OR engine maintains an appropriate buffer for this moderate volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical data for this Women's denim SKU shows two major peaks: a spring peak (Feb/Mar) and a significant back-to-school peak (Aug/Sep). Currently, demand is in a sustained cooling phase following the autumn transition. The last 3 periods (P38-P40) demand values are 67, 66, and 26, averaging 53 units. The most recent demand (26) suggests a further step down as we approach the end of the year, potentially aligning with the low baseline observed in the early summer (P18-P22). I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the cooling trend while smoothing the volatility of the most recent low data point. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect current variance. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: Demand has significantly cooled further, with Period 40 (26 units) being the lowest since July, confirming the continuation of the post-autumn decline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (2019-11-25). Historical demand data and carry-over insights show a significant and sustained cooling trend since the mid-September peak. Demand has dropped from a weekly average of ~410 units to a very low level, with Period 41 recording only 19 units. Analysis of the last 4 periods (P38-P41) yields an average demand of 44.5 units per period. Given the current on-hand inventory of 81 units, we are already holding nearly two weeks of stock relative to recent demand. A lead time of 0 is consistently observed. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current low-demand regime, ensuring we don't over-order during this quiet seasonal period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at late-autumn low: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P38-P41) is 44.5 units, confirming a continued decline from the October average.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Recent demand history indicates a late-autumn cooling, but Period 42 showed a significant spike to 83 units, departing from the previous 4-period average of 44.5. This spike likely corresponds to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (late November). As we move into December, I expect demand to remain slightly elevated due to holiday shopping before tapering off. The 3-period average (P40-P42) is now 42.7 units, but given the recent 83-unit demand, a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 will capture the transition from the low-40s to the holiday-influenced levels. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Parameters are set to ensure the OR engine maintains enough stock for the next period of holiday demand while respecting the holding cost for the current low on-hand stock (4 units).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand jumped to 83 units from a previous 4-period average of 44.5 units (+86%), likely reflecting Black Friday effects.

This was followed by a sharp drop to 35 units in Period 43 (2019-12-02), suggesting the immediate holiday peak has passed. Historically, this product (Womens Everyday Jeans) saw its primary hyper-peak in August (Back-to-School) and a secondary peak in Spring (February/March). Early December demand is expected to be moderate but stable compared to the late-autumn lows. The current on-hand inventory is 65 units. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=3: Periods 41-43) which averages ~45.7 units per period. This captures the post-spike stabilization while acknowledging the slightly higher floor compared to the October/November troughs. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike observed at P42 (83 units) was short-lived, with P43 returning to a stabilized level of 35 units, consistent with the pre-holiday mean.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. Historical data and recent demand samples (P43: 35, P44: 32) indicate that the brief holiday demand spike observed in P42 (83 units, likely Black Friday) has passed. We are now in a stabilized post-spike/pre-Christmas period. The carry-over insights confirm that the demand regime is currently at a low autumn/winter baseline, with the last two periods averaging approximately 33.5 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all recent concluding messages. To optimize inventory and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the remaining three periods of the game, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of 3 samples (P42, P43, P44) to capture the current mean while accounting for the recent spike's volatility in the safety stock calculation. L is set to default (0).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). Historical lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. Demand has stabilized at a low winter baseline following the brief Black Friday spike (Period 42). The last three periods (P43-P45) show demand of 35, 32, and 15 units respectively (average ~27.3). We are in the pre-Christmas/Boxing Day week; while a minor late-December gift-buying uptick is possible, the 'Everyday Collection' high-waist jeans typically see their primary peaks in February and August. Given the current on-hand inventory of 83 units and the recent cooling trend, the priority is to maintain a lean stock to minimize holding costs while providing a safety buffer for potential end-of-year volatility. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect this most recent low-demand regime, and using recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at low winter baseline: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P43-P45) is 27.3 units, confirming the end of the holiday spike and a return to late-autumn levels.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Historical demand for the last four periods (P43-P46) has been consistently low (35, 32, 15, 13), averaging 23.75 units. This confirms the stabilization and end of the minor holiday spike (P42), settling into a low mid-winter baseline. The product (women's skinny jeans) typically sees seasonal spikes in February (Spring) and August (Back-to-School), neither of which are imminent. With on-hand inventory at 70 units and current demand significantly below that, the priority is to avoid accumulating holding costs while maintaining a slim safety stock. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized low-demand regime.
