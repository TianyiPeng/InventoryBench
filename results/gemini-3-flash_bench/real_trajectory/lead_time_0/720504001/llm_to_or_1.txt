Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 720504001, which is a pair of skinny 5-pocket denim trousers for men. The historical demand samples provided (33, 41, 28, 20, 52) show a mean of approximately 34.8 and a standard deviation of 12.3. Given the date in February, we are approaching the spring season which often sees a steady demand for apparel, but there are no immediate major retail holidays indicated. I will use a 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand volatility and mean, ensuring the system calculates a base stock that covers the lead time (promised as 0) plus the current review period. Since there are no concluded periods to evaluate actual lead time drift, I will use the 'default' lead time method (promised 0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a staple item: 5-pocket skinny denim jeans. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a mean of approximately 34.8 units, but the most recent period (Period 1) saw a significant spike to 49 units, which aligns with the early February sample of 52. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time=0 confirmed). Since the product is denim, demand is relatively steady but can fluctuate with weekly retail cycles. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent upward trend in demand (49, 52, 20) while balancing the older lower samples. My goal is to ensure the base stock covers the demand for the current period given the immediate arrival (L=0).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is skinny denim trousers for men. Current period is 2019/02/25. Looking at the historical demand (Jan-Feb), demand has moved from the 20-40 range to the 40-55 range recently (Period 1: 49, Period 2: 54). February 4th also showed a spike to 52. The observed lead time for both Period 1 and Period 2 was 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Given the clear recent shift towards higher demand in February, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the higher mean and variance seen in the last two game periods and the late January/early February spike, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current regime of ~50 units per week rather than the lower January average.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic 'Skinny 5pkt Lowprice' denim trousers product. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) and in-game performance (last 3 weeks) show a mean demand around 40-42 units (Samples: 33, 41, 28, 20, 52; Game: 49, 54, 35). Current date is March 4th. There is no evidence of a lead time shift; 'Period conclude' messages confirm lead time = 0 for periods 1, 2, and 3. For Period 4, I will stick to the promised lead time of 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8 total samples including pre-game) to capture the current stable demand regime. Average demand of the 8 available points is 39, which implies a base stock around that level per period. Since L=0, base_stock = mu + z*sigma covers the current period's demand.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Skinny 5pkt Lowprice' denim jean. We are currently in early March (Period 5). Historical data shows demand samples ranging from 20 to 52, with recent game periods (P1-P4) showing demand of 49, 54, 35, and 24. There is a noticeable downward trend in demand over the last four weeks (from 54 to 24). The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by the game history (P1-P4 all arrived same-period). Given the recent drop in demand, using 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will better capture the current lower demand level (mean ~40.5) compared to the 'default' which would include higher historical samples. This prevents overstocking as we move further into March. L is set to 'default' as the lead time is consistently 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Skinny 5pkt Lowprice' denim, a staple item. Current period 6 is mid-March 2019. Initial demand showed a spike in early February (P1-P2, avg ~51.5) likely due to post-winter sales or spring catalog launches, but has since stabilized to a lower level (P3-P5, avg ~27). Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 5 completed periods. Pipeline inventory is currently 0, with 41 units on hand. To prevent overstocking as demand cools from the initial peak, I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (avg 27.0, std ~7.0) rather than the all-time average which is inflated by February's high demand. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: P1-P2 averaged 51.5 units/week; P3-P5 stabilized to 27.0 units/week (-47.5%).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU 720504001 (Skinny Denim) shows a significant demand shift. My carry-over insight noted a drop to ~27 units/week in Period 3-5, but Period 6 demand spiked back to 34 units. Analyzing the full history: initial samples (33, 41, 28, 20, 52) mean is 34.8. Observed demand in game: P1=49, P2=54, P3=35, P4=24, P5=22, P6=34. The average of all samples (historical + game) is approximately 34.2. Historically, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives and is used in the same period). Inventory is currently very low (on-hand: 7). Given the recent bounce in P6 (34 units) and the product type (year-round denim), I will use the last 6 game periods to capture the recent mean demand (36.3) while recognizing the volatility. I will set L to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to cover the entire in-game history, which balances the early high demand and mid-game lull, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to handle the recent demand increase.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/01. We are managing skinny 5-pocket denim jeans. The historical demand shows a clear two-part regime: high initial demand in February (Avg: 51.5) followed by a significant drop and stabilization in March (Avg: 29.0). Periods 3 through 7 show demand values of 35, 24, 22, 34, and 30, which average to 29.0. This lower regime persists as we enter April. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 28 units, which is roughly one week's worth of demand in the current regime. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (Profit: $19 vs Holding: $1), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand mean and volatility, focusing on the last 5 periods (P3-P7) which capture the current stabilized regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: From Period 3 onwards, demand leveled at an average of 29 units/week compared to the initial 51.5 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $741.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), there was a sudden demand spike to 55 units, far exceeding the average of 29 units observed since Period 3. This resulted in a stockout (sold 39, ending inventory 0). The item is 'Skinny 5pkt Lowprice' denim, and April/May often sees a shift in apparel demand. I need to increase safety stock to account for this recent volatility while respecting the 6-period stabilized regime that preceded it. I will use recent_N with N=6 for demand (covering Periods 3-8) to incorporate the spike into the average, and explicit sigma to handle the increased uncertainty from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased dramatically in Period 8 (demand 55 vs. prior 6-week avg 29), suggesting a possible seasonal shift or promotion for the low-price denim category.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we observe significant demand volatility in the 'Skinny 5pkt Lowprice' denim category. While P3-P7 averaged approximately 29 units/week, P8 saw a spike to 55 units (leading to a stockout), followed by a drop back to 22 units in P9. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time (L) consistently equals 0. Given the recent variability (P8 spike vs. P9 drop) and the mid-April date (which can see shifting spring fashion demand), I am using a recent window to capture both the baseline and the recent volatility. Setting L to default (0), mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the mix of low and high demand periods (P5-P9 average is 32.6), and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to account for the heightened variance seen in P8.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: P8 spike (55) followed by P9 drop (22) suggests a non-stable demand regime despite the earlier P3-P7 stabilization.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny 5pkt Denim) is exhibiting high volatility in the current spring season. Recent demand since Period 7 has fluctuated significantly: 30, 55, 22, 39. This suggests a shift away from the earlier period of stability (Approx 29 units/period) found in Periods 3-7. The lead time has consistently behaved as 0 periods throughout the history. Given the recent high-low-high pattern, I will use a short-window evaluation (recent_N=4) for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture this increased average activity (approx 36.5 units), and a slightly longer window (recent_N=6) for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed over the last month and a half. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the erratic demand while minimizing lost sales, which occurred in Period 8.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed sustained from Period 8-10: range [22, 55], mean shifted up to approximately 36.5 units/period compared to the P3-P7 baseline of 29 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '720504001' (Skinny 5pkt Lowprice Denim) is currently in a high-volatility regime that began around Period 8 (April 1st). Observations from Period 8 to Period 11 show demand values of 55, 22, 39, and 45. The average demand over these last 4 periods is 40.25 units, which is a significant increase from the P3-P7 baseline of 29.0 units. Given that the product is a low-priced denim staple, this uptick likely reflects a spring seasonal shift or sustained promotional activity. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). To address the recent increase in both the mean and the variance of demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to calculate base stock levels that are responsive to the current 40.25 unit mean and the heightened standard deviation, ensuring better service levels during this volatile phase while accurately reflecting the 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained shift to higher-demand/higher-volatility regime confirmed since Period 8 (April): Mean demand increased from 29.0 to 40.25 (+38%) with observations ranging from 22 to 55.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/05/06). The product is a low-price denim item, which has shown a confirmed shift in demand characteristics starting around Period 8 (beginning of April). The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 38.4 units, compared to the P3-P7 average of 29 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 12 concluded periods. Current on-hand inventory is 33 units. To capture the recent higher demand and the increased volatility (ranging from 22 to 55 in the last 5 periods), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5. This aligns the OR backend's base stock calculation with the current higher-demand regime while accounting for the increased variance to maintain service levels.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is mid-May (2019/5/13). Historically, this SKU (Low-price Denim) has seen two distinct regimes: P1-P2 (high, mean 51.5), P3-P7 (low, mean 29.0), and a third shift starting in P8 (April/May), characterized by higher volatility and a slightly higher mean. Specifically, demand from P8-P13 has been [55, 22, 39, 45, 31, 24], averaging 36.0 units. The most recent demand (24) is lower than the P8-P13 average but aligns with the variance seen in this current regime. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the current volatility and mean accurately while acknowledging the slight downward cooling from the late April/early May peaks, I will use a N=6 period window (P8-P13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire duration of the latest regime shift. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a low-price denim SKU. My carry-over insights indicate a sustained higher demand and volatility regime since Period 8 (April), with mean demand increasing approximately 38%. Looking at recent performance, Period 14 saw a high demand of 51 units, leaving on-hand inventory low at 7 units. Historically, April-May shows higher volatility (range 22-55). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this recent regime characterized by increased volatility and a higher mean compared to the P3-P7 baseline, I am using recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the period from P8 through P14, reflecting the most recent market behavior while providing enough data to smooth out the weekly fluctuations (22 to 55).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is May 27th (Period 16). Since Period 8 (April), demand has transitioned into a higher-volatility regime. Over the last 8 periods (P8-P15), the mean demand has been 37.8 units, compared to the early-period stability of 29 units. Individual demand values show significant swings (ranging from 22 to 55). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current high-volatility/high-demand regime while excluding the very early data that no longer reflects the current market behavior.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P8-P15) mean confirmed at 37.8 units with high volatility (STD ~11.8), significantly higher than the P3-P7 period (mean 29).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The SKU 720504001 (Skinny 5pkt Lowprice Denim) has shown a sustained demand regime shift since Period 8 (April). Analysis of samples from P8 to P16 shows a mean demand of 37.89 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.23. The last two periods (P15 and P16) had demands of 36 and 48 respectively, confirming that demand remains significantly higher and more volatile than the P3-P7 baseline (mean 29). History confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). With current on-hand inventory at 10 units and 0 in-transit, I need to set parameters that cover the expected demand for the current period. I will use a recent_N approach with N=9 (P8-P16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, higher-demand regime while the OR backend handles the high service level (q=0.95) implied by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product (Skinny 5pkt Lowprice Denim) has entered a sustained high-demand regime since early April (Period 8). In the last 10 periods (P8-P17), the mean demand has risen to 40.4 units/period with an increased standard deviation of approximately 11.5. Most recently, demand in P16 and P17 has been consistently high (48 and 53 units). Inventory is currently very low (6 units on-hand), and there is 0 in-transit because lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to reflect this higher mean and volatility while setting L to 'calculate' as lead times have been reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P8 to P17 (last 10 periods) shows a mean of 40.4 units, up from the previous regime of ~29 units, with significant volatility (highs of 55, lows of 22).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a low-price denim item, which has shown a sustained higher demand regime starting from Period 8 (April). Analysis of the last 11 periods (P8-P18) shows a mean demand of 39.9 units, significantly higher than the mid-regime (P3-P7) average of 29 units. The most recent demand (P18) was 36 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as per the history of conclude messages. The on-hand inventory is 25 units with zero units in-transit. Given the high volatility (sigma) observed since Period 8 (ranging 22 to 55), I will use N=11 to capture this current regime's mean and variability, ensuring the OR backend's inventory target (base stock) accounts for the recent shift in both volume and volatility to prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 8.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny Lowprice Jeans) is currently in a higher-demand and higher-volatility regime that began around Period 8 (April). Analyzing the most recent 12 periods (P8-P19), the mean demand is approximately 38.6 units per period, with significant fluctuations ranging from 22 to 55. The most recent demand (P19) was 28, following a 36 in P18 and 53 in P17. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history concluding within the same period. For Period 20 (late June), there are no immediate seasonal peaks anticipated, but the sustained volatility requires a robust mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this elevated demand regime and its associated volatility since Period 8, ensuring the OR backend maintains a base stock that accounts for the current 38.6 unit average and high standard deviation (approx 10.9) to provide sufficient service levels while managing holding costs.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny Lowprice Denim) is in Period 21 (2019/07/01). Historical data since Period 8 shows a high-volatility regime with demand ranging from 13 to 55. The most recent demand in Period 20 was significantly lower (13) compared to the Period 8-20 average of ~36.9. I am using a regime length for the current period (N=13, covering P8 to P20) to capture the current mean and volatility while recognizing the recent drop. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent delivery history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will calculate a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate for managing the observed volatility and avoiding stockouts seen earlier in Period 8.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand regime (P8-P20) maintains higher volatility (range 13-55) with a slightly adjusted mean of 36.9 units. Period 20 recorded the lowest demand (13) in the current regime, indicating potential tail-end seasonality or high randomness.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny Lowprice Denim) has shown a downward shift in demand over the last two periods (P20: 13, P21: 18), compared to the prior regime average of ~37 units. This drop aligns with early July, potentially indicating a post-sale slump or a seasonal cooling for this specific denim SKU. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the recent significant drop below the previous mean, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=4 to capture the recent sharp decline while still accounting for the volatility observed in early June. This will allow the OR controller to lower the base stock level to avoid high holding costs while on-hand inventory is currently high (41 units).

Carry-over insight: Sustained downward demand shift observed starting Period 20 (July): Mean demand for P20-P21 is 15.5 units, significantly lower than the P8-P19 average of ~39.9 units (-61%).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '720504001' (low-price skinny jeans) has entered a clear downward demand regime starting in late June/early July (Period 20). Demand for the last three periods has been 13, 18, and 17, which is significantly lower than the previous regime (Period 8-19) mean of ~40 units. This drop likely reflects a post-spring/early summer seasonal decline for this specific denim SKU. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is necessary to capture this lower mean (16 units) and reduced volatility, preventing excess inventory buildup during this slow period. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustment. Setting parameters based on this recent 3-period window (P20-P22) aligns the OR backend with the current low-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime confirmed (Period 20-22): Mean demand dropped to 16.0 units/period from a prior regime mean of ~40.0 units (-60%), likely seasonal.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny Low-price Denim) has entered a sustained low-demand regime starting around Period 20 (late June/July). Demand for the last four periods (P20-P23) has been 13, 18, 17, and 20, averaging 17.0 units per period. This is a significant drop from the previous regime (P8-P19) which averaged ~40 units. This decline is consistent with mid-summer seasonality for heavier denim products. With on-hand inventory at 4 units and a promised lead time of 0 (confirmed by historical arrival data), I need to set parameters to cover the current period's expected demand. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this new mean (~17.0) and associated volatility. This will ensure sufficient stock for the low-demand phase while minimizing holding costs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny Men's Denim) is in a volatile phase. Period 24 saw a sudden demand spike to 39 units, following a localized low-demand regime (Periods 20-23 mean ~17 units). This suggests the previous 'regime shift' insight (P20-P22) may have been premature or influenced by temporary fluctuations, as the most recent demand (39) is near the previous long-term average (P8-P19 mean ~40). Given the inventory is currently 0 and lead time is 0, I must ensure enough stock to cover the upcoming period. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (covering Periods 20-24, mean ~21.4) to stay responsive to recent levels while acknowledging the latest spike. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility (Std Dev ~10.9). Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent history.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand remains highly volatile in late July; the low-demand regime (P20-P23 avg 17) was interrupted by a spike to 39 in P24, suggesting unstable seasonality.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Period 20-25 shows a significant shift and increased volatility compared to earlier periods. Looking at the last 6 periods (late June through July), demand values were [13, 18, 17, 20, 39, 28]. While early July was very low (avg ~17), the last two weeks have seen a rebound (39 and 28), suggesting the 'low-demand regime' might be ending or was simply highly volatile. The mean for these last 6 periods is approximately 27.5. Considering the product is 'skinny jeans' and we are moving into August, we should anticipate a potential back-to-school demand lift. I am choosing recent_N = 6 to capture this current volatile stabilization and set the lead time to 'calculate' as historical lead times have consistently been 0. This approach balances the recent spike with the preceding lows while remaining responsive to the current upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in late July/early August; the low-demand regime (P20-P23 avg 17) has shifted upward with P24-P25 averaging 33.5 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny 5pkt Lowprice Denim) is currently in a high-volatility regime. After a significant demand drop in July (P20-P23 avg: 17), demand has rebounded in the last three periods (P24-P26: 39, 28, 38) with a mean of 35 units. This suggests the 'low-demand' regime was transitory or seasonal (early summer dip) and demand is returning to its spring/early summer average (~37-40 units). The current date is mid-August, which often coincides with 'Back to School' preparations, a peak period for low-priced denim. Lead time has consistently been 0. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit). I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (P20-P26) to capture both the recent dip and the current recovery (N=7, mean ~28). However, given the strong recent rebound (avg 35) and seasonal context, I will use a slightly larger N for sigma to buffer against the high recent volatility seen in the spikes to 38-39.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound confirmed: After a 4-week dip in July (avg 17), demand for P24-P26 has recovered to an average of 35 units, signaling a return to higher activity levels likely associated with late summer/back-to-school seasonality.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny Men's Denim) has transitioned from a seasonal low in July back to a high-demand regime in August, likely driven by back-to-school shopping. The last four periods (P24-P27) show a mean demand of 36.25 units (39, 28, 38, 40), which is significantly higher than the July dip (avg ~17). Current on-hand inventory is very low (6 units). Since the observed lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent demand recovery and the associated volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that satisfies the current upward trend while minimizing the risk of stockouts seen in P24 and P26.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny 5pkt Lowprice Denim) is in a clear late-summer/back-to-school demand recovery. Demand has increased sequentially over the last three periods: 38 (P26), 40 (P27), and 49 (P28). The average demand over these last three periods is 42.3 units, significantly higher than the July slump (avg ~20). Period 28 ended with zero on-hand inventory and lost sales (demand 49 vs 46 available), indicating that current stock levels are insufficient for the rising trend. Historical actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Based on the documented 'demand rebound' and the clear upward trend in the last three weeks, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this recovery momentum (42.3 units). Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to account for the increased volatility associated with the demand spike. L remains at the default (promised 0) as delivery reliability is high.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend confirmed for August: Mean demand for P26-P28 increased to 42.3 units/period, surpassing the spring regime mean (~38) and the July slump (~20).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Historical data and insights confirm a strong demand recovery since the July slump (which averaged 17 units). For the last 6 periods (P24-P29), demand has averaged 38.8 units (39, 28, 38, 40, 49, 39). This aligns with 'back-to-school' and early autumn seasonality for denim jeans. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations consistently show actual lead time is 0. With current on-hand inventory at 13 and recent demand showing a peak of 49, there is a risk of a stockout if demand stays high. I will set the demand forecast \u03bc\u0302 for the current period based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this established higher-demand regime while including the recent peak. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 6 periods to account for the increased volatility seen during this recovery (ranging from 28 to 49).

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (P24-P29) confirmed: average demand is 38.8 units/period, showing recovery from the July seasonal dip and aligning with autumn/back-to-school patterns.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30 (2019/9/2), we observed a massive demand spike of 90 units, which is significantly higher than the previous P24-P29 autumn/back-to-school average of ~39 units. This jump likely reflects a specific September promotion or peak season activity for denim. Because lead time remains stable at 0 periods (confirmed by all history), I am shifting the demand forecast to account for this higher regime. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 (covering the shift that began in P24) to capture the recovery and this latest spike, while allowing the OR engine to set a higher base stock to prevent the stockouts seen in Period 30 and Period 28. Standard deviation will also be calculated from this recent period to capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand spike detected: Period 30 demand reached 90 units, more than double the P24-P29 average (38.8). Current regime (P24-P30) mean is now 46.1 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a major seasonal demand surge associated with September 'back-to-school' and autumn trends. Demand skyrocketed from a pre-September average of ~39 to 90 units in Period 30 and 101 units in Period 31. Current inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-velocity phase, I am shifting mu_hat to an explicit value (110) based on the recent 100+ demand signal, rather than a mean of all historical data which would lag the trend. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to capture the increased volatility of this peak season.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: P30-P31 demand averaged 95.5 units, a 146% increase over the August average of 38.8 units. This represents a significant seasonal shift for the denim category.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late September (Period 33). The product, skinny denim jeans, is experiencing a major seasonal surge likely tied to 'back-to-school' and autumn retailing. Historical data shows Period 30 (90 units) and Period 31 (101 units) were massive spikes compared to the August average of ~42. In Period 32, demand remained high but moderated slightly to 70 units. The average for the current high-demand 'September Surge' (P30-P32) is approximately 87 units. With lead time consistently holding at 0 periods, we must set parameters that allow the inventory to cover this heightened demand immediately. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the OR system toward this new high-volume, high-volatility regime. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 to $1.0), the backend will naturally target a high service level (q\u224895%). A mu_hat based on the last 3 periods ensures we stay responsive to the 70-101 range without being overly reactive to a single outlier.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a major seasonal surge starting in September (Period 30). Demand has increased from an average of ~39 units (August) to an average of 103 units over the last 4 periods (P30-P33: 90, 101, 70, 151). The stockout in Period 33 (selling only 113 of 151 demanded units) confirms that current supply is trailing demand. We are currently in late September/early October, a peak period for denim. To prevent lost sales during this high-demand regime, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new mean (103 units). Although the promised lead time is 0, the actual lead time has consistently been 0, but since on-hand is currently 0, the system must order enough to cover the forecasted demand for Period 34.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge sustained (P30-P33): Mean demand increased to 103.0 units/period (range 70-151), a significant shift from the August/Late Summer average of 38.8.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '720504001' (Skinny Trousers Denim) is currently in a high-demand seasonal peak that began in September (Period 30). Demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) has been 90, 101, 70, 151, and 93, resulting in a mean of 101.0 units/period. The carry-over insights correctly identified this shift. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit while managing the high volatility (standard deviation ~30), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (capturing the full September/peak regime) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased variance. This ensures the base stock reflects the current high-velocity demand pattern and provides enough safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P30, P31, and P33.

Carry-over insight: September/October peak demand regime (P30-P34) confirmed: Mean demand is 101.0 units/period with high volatility (STD 30.6), compared to the August average of ~39.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is mid-October (2019-10-14). We are in a high-demand seasonal peak for denim, which began in September (Period 30). The demand regime from Period 30 to Period 35 shows a mean of 99.8 units/period (90, 101, 70, 151, 93, 94) with a standard deviation of approximately 27.2. Although demand has stabilized slightly in the last two weeks around 93-94 units, the overall volatility remains high. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this specific seasonal peak accurately while the OR backend calculates the base stock to maintain high service levels during this high-profit/low-holding-cost window.

Carry-over insight: October demand remains consistent with the high-demand regime identified in September; mean demand for P30-P35 is 99.8 units/period, confirming a sustained peak season for the denim category.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand peak season (September-October) for denim. In the last 7 periods (P30-P36), demand has averaged 96.7 units/period with significant volatility (reaching a peak of 151). The most recent demand was 78, showing a slight softening from the peak but remaining well above the pre-September baseline. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this sustained high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=7 to account for the high volatility observed during this peak season. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals in the history.

Carry-over insight: Mid-October demand (P36) slowed to 78 units, but the high-demand regime (P30-P36) remains sustained with an average of 96.7 units, compared to the August average of 38.8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2080.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand peak season (September-October), with Period 37 demand reaching 111 units. The mean demand for the current regime (P30-P37) is approximately 98.5 units/period. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed lead time of 0. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the length of the current high-demand regime) to capture the peak average of ~99 units per period. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=8 to account for the significant volatility observed during this peak (range 70-151). This ensures the OR backend targets a high service level to prevent stockouts while balancing against holding costs as we transition towards late autumn.

Carry-over insight: October demand remains strong: P30-P37 mean demand is 98.5 units/period, confirming a sustained peak regime since September with high volatility (STD ~25).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 is in a sustained high-demand regime that began in September (Period 30), corresponding with autumn/winter jeans seasonality. For the last 9 periods (P30-P38), demand has averaged 99.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 23.5. Recent demand remains strong (P37: 111, P38: 109). The observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this specific seasonal peak accurately while ignoring the lower-demand summer data. This will ensure the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) period demand requirements for this high-velocity period.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P30-P38) sustains a mean of 99.7 units/period, significantly elevated from the August average of 38.8, confirming peak autumn/winter seasonality for denim.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the peak autumn/winter demand regime for skinny denim jeans. Since Period 30 (September), demand has shifted significantly higher, averaging 99.7 units with a range of 69 to 151. Although Period 39 saw a dip to 69 units, this remains within the expected high-volatility range of the current peak season. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of this peak regime over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures this high-demand behavior while allowing for the observed volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the (~100 unit/week) demand plus a safety buffer for the high variance (STD ~25) seen in this category.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny 5pkt Jeans) has entered a high-demand regime since early September (Period 30), aligning with autumn seasonality. Over the last 11 periods (P30-P40), the mean demand has been significantly elevated at 94.5 units per period. Recently, demand has shown some moderation from the absolute peaks seen in September, settling into a range of 69-111 units over the last four periods. For Period 41 (mid-November), I am targeting a base stock that reflects this sustained high-demand regime while acknowledging the recent slight softening. I will use a recent_N (N=11) to capture the full autumn/winter peak mean of ~94.5 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The calculated profit ($19) and holding cost ($1) result in a high critical fractile (~0.95), meaning the OR engine will prioritize avoiding stockouts by maintaining a healthy safety stock. With 58 units currently on-hand and zero in-transit, an order will be triggered to bridge the gap to the base stock level calculated from the ~95 units/period forecast.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime for autumn/winter (P30-P40) confirmed with mean demand of 94.5 units/period (range 69-151), compared to the late summer average of ~39 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 (Skinny Lowprice Jeans) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in September (Period 30). For the last 12 periods (P30-P41), the mean demand has been 94.5 units per period. The most recent demand (P41) was 90 units, consistent with this regime. As we are now in late November (2019/11/25), this high demand is expected to persist through the holiday season. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=12 to capture the characteristics of this peak autumn/winter regime accurately while ignoring the lower-demand summer data. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the current mean (~94.5) and the observed volatility in this period (STD ~21).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 720504001 is in a sustained high-demand regime for the autumn/winter season (P30-P42). Recent demand in Period 42 spiked to 142 units, which is consistent with early December/holiday shopping trends for 'Skinny 5pkt Lowprice' jeans. Over the last 13 periods (P30-P42), the mean demand is 98.15 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22.8. Currently, there is 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, meaning an immediate order is required to meet Period 43 demand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical service level q is 0.95. I will use the recent high-demand regime (N=13) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure sufficient stock during this peak period. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 142 units, signaling the start of the December peak season for the denim category (mean demand P30-P42 is 98.2).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season. Period 42 showed a demand spike to 142 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday week), followed by a lower demand of 43 in Period 43. This high volatility is characteristic of the denim category in Q4. The high-demand regime since Period 30 has a mean of approximately 95 units. To capture the expected holiday demand while acknowledging recent fluctuations, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=14 (covering the entire autumn/winter high-demand regime). Lead time (L) consistently follows the promised 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period from P1 to P43. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=14 to reflect the elevated volatility of the current peak season.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility confirmed: P42 spike (142) followed by P43 dip (43) reflects seasonal promotional impact. Autumn/Winter regime (P30-P43) mean remains near 95 units with high volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing the high-demand denim peak season. Demand remains highly volatile as seen in the recent fluctuations (P42: 142, P43: 43, P44: 77). The mean demand for the current long-term regime starting at Period 30 is 94.1 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. However, we must account for high December volatility and potential end-of-year spikes. On-hand inventory is currently 64 units. Given a lead time of 0 periods, the system should aim for a base stock that covers the upcoming period's volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 (covering all data from the start of the September surge to provide a stable peak-season baseline) and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to ensure we carry enough safety stock (35 units) to handle the significant swings observed in December without over-ordering excessively as the game nears conclude (P47).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak holiday season (late December) for denim. The demand regime since Period 30 has maintained a high mean of approximately 95 units, but with significant Christmas/December volatility (recent demands: 142, 43, 77, 111). Period 42 showed a stockout with demand at 142, followed by a dip, then a sharp recovery to 111 in Period 45. Given the date is Dec 23rd, we are at the zenith of the holiday season. The current on-hand inventory is 40. With a realized lead time of 0 (confirmed consistently in history), I will set mu_hat using the last 15 periods (since P31) to capture the sustained high-demand regime while allowing for the high standard deviation observed during this period. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1399.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019, representing the post-Christmas and pre-New Year period. Historically, the high-demand regime for this SKU started in Period 30 (September) and has maintained a mean of approximately 95 units per period through December. Recent demand (P42-P46) has shown high volatility (142, 43, 77, 111, 77) with an average of 90.0 units. Given the transition into early January, demand typically softens following the holiday peak. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the broader autumn/winter performance (mean ~94) while acknowledging recent volatility. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time 0), I will stick with 'calculate' for L. The OR backend will use these parameters to balance the high profit margin ($19) against the low holding cost ($1), ensuring a high service level for the remaining high-season demand while adjusting for the expected post-holiday stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Period 42-46 average demand (90.0) is slightly lower than the P30-P41 average (94.5), reflecting the tail-end of the winter peak.
