  "rationale": "For Period 1 (2019/2/11), we are managing SKU 685814003, a men's hoodie. Historical demand from the previous five weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows values of 75, 51, 57, 123, and 84, resulting in an average of approximately 78 units per week. The date Feb 11 is mid-winter/early spring transition, a season where hoodies typically maintain steady demand. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand in this same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1 demand. Given the historical average (~78) and the spike seen in late January (123), I will target an order of 90 units to balance the risk of stockouts against the $1.00 holding cost. This provides a buffer over the mean without overcommitting in the face of 0-period lead time flexibility.",

As a 'Jersey Basic' hoodie, this item remains seasonally relevant in cold weather, but demand typically transitions from Christmas gifting peaks to late-winter utility and potentially early-season clearance. Recent demand since the Black Friday/Holiday spike (P44-P46) has stabilized: 129, 137, and 111 units, averaging approximately 126 units per period. The carry-over insights correctly identified a post-holiday stabilization around ~130 units. Given the transition into early January, I expect demand to persist at a slightly lower level or maintain the current average as people utilize gift cards or refresh wardrobes, though a moderate decrease is possible as the peak retail season ends. With on-hand inventory at 39 units and an inferred lead time of 0 periods, I need to order enough units to satisfy Period 47's demand. Targeting a safety stock based on the recent average (~126) plus a small buffer for volatility (to ~140 total) suggests ordering 101 units (140 - 39).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-holiday demand stabilization: Period 44-46 demand reflects a sustained winter regime averaging 126 units/period, down from peak November/Holiday levels but significantly higher than autumn averages.",
