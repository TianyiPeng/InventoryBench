Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019/2/11). The SKU '636323001' is 'Ankle-length jeans'. Historical demand samples are [117, 85, 225, 235, 244]. There is a clear upward trend/regime shift starting around 2019-01-21, possibly due to a seasonal ramp-up as spring approaches. The mean of the last 3 samples (234.6) is significantly higher than the all-time mean (181.2). I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this higher demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The promised lead time is 0, and since we have no delivery history yet, I will use the default lead time parameter. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) periods, which in this case is 1 period of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' (Ladies Denim). Reviewing the historical demand: [117, 85, 225, 235, 244]. Period 1's realized demand was 270, continuing a clear upward trend that began in late January. This suggests a transition from a low-demand period to a higher baseline, possibly due to spring fashion seasonality. Since the lead time is 0 (confirmed by P1 ordering 243 and receiving 243 in the same period), we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to satisfy this higher demand regime without stocking out. Period 1 ended with 0 inventory despite selling all 243 units (demand was 270), meaning we lost sales. To adapt to this higher demand, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the recent growth (225, 235, 244, 270) and a recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime. Lead time L is set to default (0).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans'. We are currently in late February (Period 3, 2019-02-25). Demand has shown a significant upward trend over the last 7 weeks: [117, 85, 225, 235, 244, 270, 334]. The mean of the first 5 samples was ~181, while the last two periods (P1 and P2) have jumped to 270 and 334 respectively. This suggests the start of a spring seasonal climb. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods for both P1 and P2 shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in P1 and P2 (demand exceeded supply). To capture this growth and prevent further stockouts, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to weigh the recent surge (avg ~283) more heavily than the early January lows. I am using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to provide a slightly higher buffer given the increasing volatility and recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Upward trend starting early February. Mean increased from ~181 to ~302 (+66%) over the last two periods as spring season approaches.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' is a spring/summer denim item. We are currently in early March (2019/3/4). Historical demand samples from January averaged 159 units, but demand in February (Periods 1-3) spiked to an average of 286 units (270, 334, 254). The Carry-over insight correctly identified a regime shift. Even though Period 3 saw a dip to 254, the overall trend since February is significantly higher than the January baseline. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while acknowledging the recent stabilization/slight dip in Period 3, I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=3, which covers the entire February regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that captures the sustained high-demand level seen in the last three weeks.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees a demand surge as spring arrives (March). Historical samples from January showed an average of 181, but the last four periods (Feb/early March) show a significantly higher mean of 268 (270, 334, 254, 214). While Period 4 saw a slight dip to 214, the overall trend since February indicates a higher baseline than the January data. The 'carry-over insight' from Period 3 correctly identified this shift. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this sustained higher demand level while incorporating the most recent stabilization. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to reflect the current volatility (std approx 50). This approach uses recent evidence to ensure the OR backend sets a base stock level that prevents stockouts during the spring transition.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' (Ladies Denim trousers). Current date is March 18, 2019. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Historical demand analysis shows an initial spike in early February (270, 334) followed by a stabilization in late February and March (254, 214, 209). The earlier carry-over insight noted a regime shift, but recent data shows a regression and stabilization around a mean of 225.6 for the last three periods (N=3). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand level rather than the volatile early February peak. On-hand inventory is 102, and lead time remains set to explicit 0 to reflect the actual observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in March: Following the late Feb peak, demand for the last 3 periods has averaged 225.6, retreating from the +300 units level.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), the product (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is entering late March. Historical data shows a demand spike in late January/early February followed by a moderate stabilization in March. The last three periods (P4-P6) show demand values of 214, 209, and 234, averaging ~219 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the stabilized March demand level (avg ~219) rather than the volatile early-year data. Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to reflect current demand variability, ensuring the inventory cap and base stock are appropriately sized for the current steady state without over-ordering based on the high February variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $924.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of April 1st (Period 8), demand for this skinny denim item surged significantly to 548 units in the previous period\u2014more than double the recent average of 225.6 units. This spike likely correlates with the spring retail season peak and professional/social wardrobe updates typically seen in April. Historical lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 with 317 units of lost sales. To respond to this regime shift, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (including the spike) to better weight the current seasonal demand while maintaining a buffer for high variance (sigma). L is kept at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Major demand surge detected in late March/early April (Spring season); demand jumped from ~225 to 548 units (+140%).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Reviewing history, the product ('Skinny H.W Ankle Queens') experienced a significant demand spike in Period 7 (March 25) with 548 units, which retreated to 264 units in Period 8. The Carry-over insight regarding a sustained 'surge' in late March/early April needs refinement: while P7 was very high, P8 showed a significant drop. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time = 0). Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1 ($4.0/$1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 80%. Given the recent volatility and the possibility that the P7 spike was a pre-Easter surge or a specific promotion, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current post-spike average (approx 348 units/period) while maintaining a balanced sigma_hat to protect against the high variability observed in the last three weeks (demand: 234, 548, 264).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/4/8), demand dropped significantly to 90 units, down from 264 in P8 and a peak of 548 in P7. This suggests the initial spring surge has subsided, or we are seeing a post-Easter/spring break lull. The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', which typically sees high demand in early spring, but the current volatility (CV is high) requires a cautious approach. We currently have 405 units on-hand, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand of 90. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 (averaging P7-P9: [548+264+90]/3 = 300.6) to bridge the high peak and the low valley, providing a balanced forecast that allows the OR engine to right-size inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak cooling: Periodic demand dropped to 90 units (P9) after the 548 unit peak (P7). Mean demand over the last 3 weeks is ~301, showing high volatility (90 to 548).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' has entered a post-peak cooling phase following the Spring rush in late March. Historical demand shows a significant drop from the peak of 548 (P7) to 264, 90, and most recently 82 units (P8-P10). The current date is April 22nd. Given the high on-hand inventory (414 units) relative to recent low demand (~86 average over the last two weeks), and the fact that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, we need to adjust parameters to prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~145) and sigma_hat to account for the recent extreme volatility (range 82 to 264). L remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction confirmed: Post-spring peak demand has dropped significantly, averaging ~86 units over the last 2 periods (P9-P10) compared to the prior 3-period average of ~301.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is ladies' denim, which has passed its spring peak (late March/early April). Current date is April 29, 2019. Demand has consistently dropped for the last three periods: 90 (P9), 82 (P10), and 64 (P11), averaging 78.67 units. This confirms a downward shift from the earlier regime. Starting inventory is 350 units (all on-hand), which is sufficient to cover more than 4 weeks of the current demand level. The promised lead time of 0 periods has remained consistent in history. Because existing inventory (350) far exceeds the required base stock for an lead time of 0 (approx 80-100 units), the OR backend's capped policy [min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)] will likely result in a zero order. To align the model with this new, lower demand level and minimize holding costs ($1/unit), I am selecting recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak contraction.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime contraction finalized: Average demand has fallen to ~79 units over the last 3 weeks (P9-P11), representing a significant drop from the spring peak average of ~300.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323001' (Skinny Ladies Denim) has entered a stable low-demand regime following the spring peak. The last four periods (P9-P12) show demand of 90, 82, 64, and 79 units respectively, averaging 78.75 units. This confirms the contraction noted in previous carry-over insights. With 271 units currently on-hand and a promised lead time of 0 (consistently observed as 0 in history), the existing inventory covers over three periods of current demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect this lower average (~79) and adjust sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the reduced volatility in this period. Since on-hand inventory is significantly higher than the calculated base stock for a lead time of 0, the OR backend will correctly refrain from ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. This product is a pair of ladies' skinny ankle-length jeans, which saw a significant demand surge in late March/early April (likely for the spring fashion season peak). Since that peak, demand has consistently cooled and stayed in a low-volume regime. Looking at the last five periods (P9-P13), demand units were 90, 82, 64, 79, and 101, averaging 83.2 units per week. The last observation of 101 suggests demand is stabilizing in this lower range rather than continuing to fall further. With an on-hand inventory of 170 units and zero in-transit, we currently have roughly two weeks of stock at the current run rate. Given the promised lead time remains 0 and has been consistently observed as 0 in history, the backend OR policy will generate a small order or no order to align with the target inventory. Setting mu_hat to the recent average (N=5) captures this post-peak stabilization. I am setting sigma_hat using the same window to capture the current week-to-week variability (std \u2248 14.5).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans', which experienced a significant demand surge during the spring peak (late March) reaching 548 units. Since then, demand has entered a sustained low-volume regime. For the last 6 periods (P9-P14), demand has been: 90, 82, 64, 79, 101, and 93. This averages approximately 85 units per period. The on-hand inventory has naturally depleted from its post-peak highs to 77 units, which is now slightly below one period's average demand in this current regime. Given that the promised lead time remains 0 and confirmed actual lead times have consistently been 0, a base stock policy covering the next period's demand is appropriate. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 samples (N=6) to capture this stable, post-peak demand level (~85 units). Sigma_hat will also use N=6 to reflect the current reduced volatility. This ensures we maintain high service levels while minimizing holding costs as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Post-spring peak demand has remained consistent for 6 weeks (P9-P14), averaging ~85 units (range 64-101), indicating the 'new normal' for late spring/early summer.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323001' (Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans) has transitioned into a stable late-spring demand regime after the volatility observed in March and April. Over the last 7 periods (P9-P15), demand has averaged 85.6 units with a relatively low standard deviation (approx. 12 units). Current on-hand inventory is very low (6 units) with 0 in-transit. Based on the consolidated history, the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts in Period 16, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable 'new normal' demand pattern since the spring peak ended. This N=7 covers the entire post-peak period (April 8th to May 20th), which provides a more accurate forecast for current late-May demand than using the full history which includes highly distorted peaks.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323001 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a stable demand regime following the spring peak. For the last 8 periods (P9-P16), demand has averaged 87.25 units (90, 82, 64, 79, 101, 93, 90, 99). The last two periods (90, 99) show a slight uptick but remain within the established range of 64-101. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain service levels for this 'new normal' demand while accounting for the recent slight increase in volume and the fact that we stocked out last period (sold 96 with demand 99), I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods of stable demand (N=8) and use recent volatility (N=8) for sigma_hat. This ensures we cover the expected mean of ~87 units plus a safety buffer for the current volatility, optimizing for the 80% critical ratio (4.0/(4.0+1.0)).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observation for Period 17 (203 units) shows a significant spike compared to the 'new normal' average of ~85-90 units established since Period 9. This jump aligns with early June (2019/6/10), often a period for summer promotions or pre-holiday shopping. While the long-term regime was stable at ~85 units, the sudden increase to 203 suggests a new seasonal shift or promotional event. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we stocked out last period. To respond to this possible new regime while protecting against volatility, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the blend of the previous stability and this new spike (averaging approx (90+99+203)/3 = 130.6 per period). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early June demand surge detected (Period 17: 203 units), breaking the 8-period stability streak of ~85 units. This suggests a shift into a summer demand regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June). Historical arrivals confirm the actual lead time (L) is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Following the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 18, we have clearly entered a summer demand regime. Demand for Period 17 jumped to 203 and Period 18 reached 235, breaking the previous 8-week stability phase of ~85 units. This represents a significant upward shift. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=2 to capture this specific summer regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current trend while acknowledging the volatility seen in the jump from 99 to 200+ units. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to stockouts in the last two periods, necessitating an order that reflects this higher demand level to capture profit while managing the risk of stockouts during this high-demand summer phase.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Demand has shifted from a stable ~85 units (late spring) to an average of 219 units (+157%) over the last two periods (P17-P18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20 (2019/06/24). Demand over the last three periods has been 203, 235, and 148, confirming a summer demand regime that is significantly higher than the late spring average (~85). The 3-period average is 195.3 units. Given the product (Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans), summer demand is expected to remain elevated compared to late spring but may show high weekly volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. I am setting L to default (0) and using mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to focus on the current summer regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility seen in the jump from 90s to 200s and then the dip to 148.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime established (Mid-June): 3-period average (P17-P19) is 195.3 units, compared to previous 8-week baseline of ~85 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01. Observed demand in Period 20 was 88 units, which is a significant drop after the three-week 'summer surge' (P17-P19) where demand averaged 195 units. We are now entering July. While the carry-over insight from P20 suggests a summer regime is established, the actual demand in P20 (88) is much closer to the previous late-spring baseline (~85). This volatility suggests that the 'summer surge' may have been a temporary spike (perhaps a seasonal sale or pre-vacation shopping) rather than a sustained shift to a higher mean. To balance the risk of overstocking (Holding=$1.0) against stockouts (Profit=$4.0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the entirety of this volatile June/July transition. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The chosen parameters lean on recent volatility to set a safety buffer while acknowledging the recent demand drop.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the summer demand regime (July). The 5-period demand average (P17-P21) is approximately 163 units, though recent weeks (P19-P21) have softened to an average of 125.7 units. The carry-over insights correctly identified a surge in early June (P17-P18), which appears to be normalizing but remaining well above the spring baseline of ~85 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With 82 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to maintain a base stock level that covers the current expected demand of ~125-160 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer regime while accounting for the recent slight decline from the June peak. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the mean and the volatility observed since the June regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (July) appears to be stabilizing at a lower level than the initial June surge: 3-period average (P19-P21) is 125.7 units compared to the surge average of 219 units (P17-P18).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323001 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a summer demand regime (July). Recent demand history from P19 to P22 shows demand values of 148, 88, 141, and 147. This averages to approximately 131 units per period, which is lower than the mid-June surge (~219) but significantly higher than the spring baseline (~85). The 4-period average (P19-P22) of 131 is used for mu_hat to reflect this stabilization. Although the official promised lead time is 0, historical data consistently confirms 0-period arrivals for all orders placed. Therefore, L is set to 'default'. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent 4 periods to capture the current volatility (std dev \u2248 29), ensuring the OR backend can accommodate the fluctuations seen between 88 and 148 units.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization (July): Demand has stabilized at a lower level (~131 units) compared to the June surge, with the last 4 periods (P19-P22) showing consistent activity between 88 and 148 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323001 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a summer demand regime (July). Demand in the most recent period (P23) was 175, which is higher than the previous 4-period average of ~131, but consistent with the volatility seen in June/July (ranging from 88 to 235). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we stocked out in P23. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods based on all history. To capture the current regime and account for the recent slight uptick without over-reacting to single-period spikes, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering periods 19-23), which results in a mean of (148+88+141+147+175)/5 = 139.8 units per period. Since L=0, the OR engine will target (1+0)*139.8. I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current regime's volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323001 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a late-July summer demand phase. Reviewing recent demand history: P24=73, P23=175, P22=147, P21=141, P20=88, P19=148. The last six periods average 128.6 units. While P23 saw a spike, P24 saw a significant drop to 73 units. The summer regime identified in previous carry-overs (~131 units) remains the most accurate description of current demand despite high week-to-week volatility. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. With on-hand inventory at 94 units and a target mean demand around 130 per period, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current stable summer level while smoothing the impact of the P23 spike and P24 dip. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=6) to capture current volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of ladies' skinny jeans, which typically experiences steady demand with seasonal fluctuations. Current observation for Period 26 (August 5) shows we are in the late summer season. Demand has been fluctuating around a mean of approximately 135 units over the last 7 periods (P19-P25: 148, 88, 141, 147, 175, 73, 142). Although the carry-over insight from P23 noted stabilization around 131 units, the recent 3-period average (P23-P25) is slightly lower at 130 units. However, given the high volatility (weekly swings from 73 to 175), a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 is most appropriate to capture the current summer regime's central tendency while smoothing out these fluctuations. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, ensuring same-period arrival. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the last 7 periods to reflect the stabilized summer demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $648.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a summer demand regime. Recent demand has shown some volatility but maintains a higher average than the late spring baseline. Specifically, Period 26 saw a demand of 204 units, which is close to the early summer surge levels seen in June. The average demand over the last four periods (P23-P26) is approximately 148.5 units. Given the date is August 12th, we are approaching the end of summer and the start of the 'Back to School' or transition to fall season, which often sees a secondary peak for denim products. Because lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this latest stabilization/upturn (P23: 175, P24: 73, P25: 142, P26: 204). On-hand inventory is currently 0, so the OR backend should trigger an order to meet the base stock requirements for this regime.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand surge: Demand in early August (P26) reached 204 units, the highest since mid-June, potentially indicating a late summer/back-to-school upward trend.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' denim is currently in a late summer/back-to-school phase. Recent demand has significantly increased, with Period 26 at 204 units and Period 27 at 191 units. This represents a sustained upward shift compared to the July average of ~131 units. The 2-period average (P26-P27) is 197.5 units. Given this clear regime change identified in Period 27's carry-over insight, I am selecting recent_N with N=3 to capture this elevated demand state while accounting for some volatility. The promised lead time continues to hold at 0 periods, with orders consistently arriving in the same period they are placed.

Carry-over insight: Late summer/Back-to-school demand regime confirmed: Demand has shifted from a July average of ~131 units to a mid-August average of 197.5 units (P26-P27), representing a ~50% increase.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323001 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a sustained late-summer/back-to-school demand regime. For the last three periods (P26-P28), demand has been consistently high (204, 191, and 219 units), averaging 204.7 units. This confirms the 'Late summer/Back-to-school' surge noted in carry-over insights. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0). The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. To ensure high service levels during this active sales window while minimizing stockouts, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the current regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the current volatility of this specific regime.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime solidified: Demand for the last 3 periods (P26-P28) has consistently stayed near or above 200 units, averaging 204.7 units, a significant step up from the July average of ~131 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' (Jeans) has transitioned into a 'Back-to-school' regime starting in early August (Period 26). For the last four periods (P26-P29), demand has been consistently elevated, with values of 204, 191, 219, and 187, averaging 200.25 units. This is a significant step up from the July average of ~131 units. The period date is 2019/09/02, which is the peak of the back-to-school and early fall fashion season in retail. Given the 100% arrival rate and 0-period lead time observed consistently, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this current regime mean and variance accurately for the OR backend. This ensures the base stock reflects the ~200 unit weekly demand level while accounting for the moderate volatility seen during this surge.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323001 is currently in a back-to-school/early autumn demand regime (avg ~210 units). In Period 30, demand was 246 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The 'back-to-school' surge identified since P26 is sustained, with the last 5 periods (P26-P30) averaging 209.4 units. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this heightened demand level for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages, so L is set to 'calculate'.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Autumn demand regime (P26-P30) consistently averaging ~210 units, compared to the July average of ~131 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323001' (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens) is currently in a stable Back-to-school/Autumn demand regime. Since Period 26 (early August), demand has consistently averaged approximately 212 units (P26-P31: 204, 191, 219, 187, 246, 225). The most recent period (P31) had a demand of 225 units, leaving only 5 units on-hand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this entire autumn regime. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the local volatility (standard deviation ~23 units). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current sustained demand levels rather than the lower summer averages.

The most recent demand (P32) was 159, which is slightly below this regime's average but within a reasonable range. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 0-period lead time. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the entirety of this current stable autumn regime (avg ~204.4 per period, totaling ~408.8 for 1+L periods). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to account for the current regime's lower volatility relative to the full history. This approach ensures high service levels for the steady autumn demand while avoiding overstocking from previous high-volatility peaks.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. We are in the post-Back-to-School transition into autumn. Demand has cooled slightly from the late August peak (~210 units) to a steadier level over the last four periods (P30-P33), which averaged 197.5 units. The most recent two weeks (P32-P33) show a further settling to ~160 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking as the peak season passes, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the shift from the ~210 average to the current ~197 average, while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen during this transition. This balances the risk of stockouts against the holding cost for a product with a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: Post-Back-to-School demand has stabilized at a lower level, averaging ~198 units over the last 4 periods (P30-P33) compared to the previous ~210 peak average.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows a clear decelaration as we move through October. Period 34 demand was 102 units, a significant drop from the ~198 unit average observed over Periods 30-33. Historically, we saw a similar cooling effect following the Spring and Summer peaks. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough stock to cover the previous month's baseline, and using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Autumn demand cooling: Demand dipped to 102 units (P34), breaking the ~198 unit stabilization seen in September. This may signal the end of the back-to-school/early autumn sales regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' (denim) is cooling as we move into mid-October. Historically, demand was elevated (~210 units) during the late summer and back-to-school season (August-September). However, the last two periods have seen a significant drop to 102 units (P34) and 79 units (P35). This suggests a transition from the autumn peak to a stabilized late-autumn/winter baseline. The current on-hand inventory is 148 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand of 79. Since L=0, I will use a short window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent cooling trend (Avg P33-P35 = 113.6 units) and ensure sigma_hat reflects the volatility of the recent transition. This approach helps reduce the risk of overstocking and further increasing holding costs while demand is declining.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Autumn demand cooling confirmed: Demand has dropped for two consecutive periods (102 and 79 units), significantly lower than the ~210 unit late-summer average.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 37 (Oct 21). The product is 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans'. Demand analysis shows a significant cooling trend in Oct compared to the high-demand back-to-school/Sept regime. Specifically, the last three periods (P34-P36) have seen demand levels of 102, 79, and 99 units respectively, averaging 93.3 units. This is a sharp drop from the ~210 avg seen in early Sept and the ~198 avg in late Sept. This cooling is consistent with seasonal transitions for denim before the potential winter/holiday shifts. Since this new lower demand regime has persisted for three periods, I am shifting N to 3 to reflect this 'new normal' and avoid overstocking based on the high September volume. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (ordered and arrived same period). On-hand inventory is 50 units. Setting parameters to target this lower mean while maintaining sufficient service level for the upcoming late autumn window.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Autumn demand regime established (October): Demand has settled into a lower stable range, averaging 93.3 units over the last 3 periods (P34-P36), a ~50% decrease from the September average.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' denim has entered a lower-volume mid-autumn regime. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has averaged 97.5 units (102, 79, 99, 110), confirming a significant drop from the September average of ~200 units. The current date is October 28, moving into late autumn; typically, denim demand remains relatively stable before any potential holiday spikes. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with no in-transit units. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To optimize for this current lower-demand regime while maintaining a high service level given the low $1.0 holding cost vs $4.0 profit (q=0.8), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the recent stabilization around ~100 units.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Autumn demand regime stable: The last four periods (P34-P37) show consistent demand averaging 97.5 units, down from the ~210 early-autumn peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early November. Historically, the mid-autumn period (Oct) saw a stabilized demand regime averaging ~97.5 units. However, the most recent two periods (P37-P38) show a slight upward tick to 110 and 124 units (average 117), which may signal early pre-holiday/November demand increases. Lead time consistently remains 0. I will adjust the mu_hat to reflect the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) which cover the transition from the mid-autumn cooling to this slight uptick, capturing the current mean of ~103 units. Given the higher volatility in recent demand (79 to 124 units) compared to the stable early-autumn period, using recent_N for sigma_hat is also appropriate to ensure the OR backend provides sufficient safety stock for potential November surges.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323001' (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens) is currently in a stable Mid-Autumn demand regime. Since Period 34 (late September), demand has consistently averaged around 100 units (P34-P39 mean: 102.6 units), a significant decrease from the early-autumn/back-to-school peak of ~210 units. The most recent demand (P39) was 102 units, aligning perfectly with this established baseline. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Based on the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is 80%, meaning we want to cover demand volatility without overstocking as the year progresses toward late November. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the stable demand mean and variance since the regime shift in Period 34.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a stable mid-late autumn demand regime. After the back-to-school surge calmed in early October, demand has settled into a consistent range. Specifically, the last 7 periods (P34-P40) have shown demand values of 102, 79, 99, 110, 124, 102, and 90. The mean of these 7 periods is 100.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14 units. There is no immediate evidence of a pre-holiday (Black Friday/December) surge yet in this specific 'Ladies Denim' SKU, as the last two weeks have slightly decelerated (102 to 90). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=7 to capture this stable autumn regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it balances the recent lower volumes against the slightly higher late-October variance.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Autumn demand regime firmly established (Oct-Nov): Demand has remained stable for 7 weeks (P34-P40) averaging 101 units, following the September back-to-school peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 42 (2019/11/25). Demand has been exceptionally stable since Period 34 (late September), with a 7-week average of 101 units through Period 40, and the most recent demand in Period 41 being 118 units. This confirms the 'Mid-Autumn' regime is still active as we enter late November. The product is 'Ankle-length jeans' (Ladies Denim), which typically maintains steady demand throughout autumn but may see volatility as winter sales or holiday shopping starts. However, there is no evidence yet of a Black Friday or holiday surge for this specific SKU in the data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on all history. I will use the established regime (N=8, covering P34-P41) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets the 100-110 unit baseline while accounting for the moderate volatility seen in this period (range 79-124).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand doubled to 221 units from the prior 7-week average of ~101 units. This aligns with typical early December/Cyber Monday retail surges. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Given this significant shift, I am moving to an 'explicit' demand forecast for Period 43 to capture the expected continuation of the holiday shopping peak. I'll use 220 as the base mu_hat (L=0, so mu_hat is for 1 period). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on the entire game history. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to account for higher volatility observed during seasonal transitions (like the spring jump from 225 to 548).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected: Demand doubled to 221 units in Period 42 (late Nov), breaking the 7-week stability of ~101 units. Transitioning to holiday peak regime.

LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season. Period 42 showed a significant surge (221 units) followed by a dip in Period 43 (89 units), which is characteristic of high holiday volatility. Given the 'Mid-Autumn' baseline was ~101 units and we've seen evidence of a holiday spike, I will set the forecast (mu_hat) to capture this higher mean. Using recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat (averaging the holiday surge and the subsequent dip: (221+89)/2 = 155) provides a responsive but tempered estimate for the current week's potential demand. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=2) to reflect the recent high volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility confirmed: Late Nov/Early Dec transitioned from a stable ~101 unit baseline to a high-variance state (range 89-221).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing the holiday season peak. Recent demand history shows a shift from a stable ~101 unit baseline to a high-variance state (P42: 221, P43: 89, P44: 79). This high volatility is characteristic of Western retail in December, where demand can spike on holiday shopping weeks and drop during others. L is set to calculated/default as the promised lead time of 0 has been consistently met. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current holiday regime (averaging ~122 units) which includes the P42 surge and subsequent weeks. sigma_hat is set with N=4 to reflect the significantly increased volatility (standard deviation > 60) seen during this holiday transition. This protects against a potential surge in the final weeks of the year.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand volatility confirmed: Demand range expanded to [79, 221] units in late Nov/early Dec (P42-P44) from a steady 100-unit baseline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the winter holiday season. History shows lead times have consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving immediately to fulfill demand in the same period. Demand over the last three weeks (P43-P45) has been 89, 79, and 80 units, while P42 saw a surge to 221 units. The carry-over insights correctly note high volatility in this transition period. Given the product is 'Ankle-length jeans', demand is likely to remain relatively stable or decrease slightly post-Christmas compared to the late November peak. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current holiday regime (starting from the P42 surge). This N captures the high variance (79 to 221) and the recent cooling trend simultaneously, preparing the OR backend for potential late-December volatility without over-ordering on a product that typically has lower winter demand than spring/autumn.

Daily Reward (R_t): $219.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are in the post-Christmas/Pre-New Year period. Historical data for the last 4 periods (P43-P46) shows demand has stabilized at a lower level following the late November surge (P42), averaging 81.75 units (89, 79, 80, 79). This indicates that the holiday peak for this SKU has passed, and we have entered a late-winter cooling phase. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime precisely, and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the significantly reduced volatility in this new period. With an on-hand inventory of 97 units and recent demand around 80, the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to maintain the service level while minimizing holding costs for the expected lower-demand January period.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a lower range (avg ~82 units) over the last 4 periods (P43-P46), down from the high-volatility holiday transition in late November.
