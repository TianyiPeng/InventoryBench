Based on the date (2019-02-11) and historical demand data (Jan 7 to Feb 4: 69, 89, 133, 126, 92), the product is currently in a high-demand winter/early spring phase. The mean demand over the five provided weeks is approximately 102 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand in this same period (Period 1). Current on-hand inventory is 0. To meet the expected demand of roughly 100 units for this period while maintaining a small safety buffer for potential variability (as seen in the spike to 133), I will order 125 units. This target covers the immediate demand and provides a buffer for potential lead time delays or demand surges, balancing against the $1.00 holding cost.",

I will forecast Period 3 demand at 50 to be safe. Promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 history confirms lead time = 0 (ordered 125, arrived 125 in the same period). Since arrivals happen after the decision phase in the same period, I need to order enough to cover Period 3 demand and maintain safety stock for Period 4.

Given the recent drop in demand, I expect Period 4 demand to be in the range of 25-45 units.

Looking at historical data: Jan saw demand ranging from 69 to 133. Feb (Periods 1-2) demand was ~45. Late Feb to early March (Periods 3-4) demand dropped further to ~25. This confirms a downward trend consistent with seasonal transition. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the critical ratio (p/(p+h)) is 0.5; this suggests we should target the median demand to minimize total cost. For Period 5, I forecast demand at approximately 20-25 units based on the recent downward trend. Current on-hand inventory is 51, which is more than double the expected demand for this period and covers at least two periods of supply.
