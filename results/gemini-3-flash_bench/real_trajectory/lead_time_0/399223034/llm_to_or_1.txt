Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The SKU is 'Jeggings H.W', a staple denim item. Looking at the five historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4: 28, 20, 21, 11, 11), there appears to be a downward trend as we move away from the post-holiday/early January peak. The mean of these 5 samples is 18.2. However, the last two observations are consistently lower (11, 11). Given this is the first period of active management, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent demand levels while maintaining some buffer for volatility. Promised lead time is 0. I will keep L at default (0) but carefully monitor for the 'arrival' signal in Period 2 to see if 'same-period arrival' actually holds.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a staple denim item. Looking at the historical demand (Jan-Feb), the demand was initially higher (28, 20, 21) in early January and has stabilized at a lower level (11, 11, 12) recently. Period 1's actual demand was 12. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time was 0 periods), confirming the speed. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' to reflect observed performance. For demand (mu_hat), the recent period confirms a shift from the January high; I will use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent stability (11, 11, 12). For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the lower variance in this current regime. The on-hand inventory is 13, and there is no in-transit, so the OR backend will calculate a restock based on the lower current demand pattern.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ladies Denim Jeggings', a staple items which usually exhibits steady demand. In Period 1, fixed lead time was observed as 0 (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). Last week (Period 2), no order was placed. Starting inventory is now 3 units. Using historical data (last 5 samples including game history: 28, 20, 21, 11, 11, 12, 10), average demand is ~16 units per period. Recent demand (last 4 weeks) has stabilized lower: 11, 11, 12, 10. I will use recent_N=4 to reflect this shift. L=0 is the promised and confirmed actual lead time. mu_hat should reflect demand for (L+1)=1 period. sigma_hat will also be based on recent N=4 to capture the current volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a staple denim item. Current date is March 4th. Historical demand samples (before the simulation) were: 28, 20, 21, 11, 11 (mean ~18). During the first three periods of the simulation, observed demand has been 12, 10, and 6 (mean ~9.3). This represents a significant drop from the initial samples. Promised lead time is 0, and observed lead times for Period 1 and Period 3 orders were indeed 0. On-hand inventory is currently 6. To avoid overstocking while demand appears to be softening, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to prioritize the recent simulation demand over the older historical samples. I will keep the lead time at default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Jeggings H.W' is a ladies denim item. Observations from Periods 1-4 show a declining demand trend (12, 10, 6, 5), which is lower than the initial historical data provided (averaging 18.2). The current on-hand inventory is 7 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals in Periods 1, 3, and 4 confirm that actual lead time has consistently been 0. Since demand is currently softening as we move into March and on-hand inventory exists, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to better reflect the current slower sales rate instead of the higher historical mean. Using N=4 captures the specific downward trend since the start of the game. This will prevent over-ordering while maintaining a base stock level sufficient for the 1-period risk (L+1 = 1).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Ladies Denim Jeggings', which typically sees consistent demand but can fluctuate with seasonal transitions. Current date is March 18th (Early Spring). Historical demand shows a downward trend: P1 (12), P2 (10), P3 (6), P4 (5), P5 (2). Comparing this to pre-game data (Jan/Feb samples: 28, 20, 21, 11, 11), there's a clear regime shift toward lower volume. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by successful same-period arrivals in P1, P3, P4, and P5. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the downward trend (average ~7) and sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. A base stock approach will automatically lower the order as current on-hand (10) is already above the recent average weekly demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting 2019-02-11: Avg demand dropped from ~18 (pre-Feb) to ~7 (Feb-March).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223034' (Jeggings) has experienced a significant demand drop. Initial samples (Jan) averaged 18.2 units/week, while the last 6 periods (Feb-March) have averaged only 6.33 units/week. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory currently stands at 8 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given the recent demand regime (Avg ~6.3, Std ~3.8 over the last 6 periods), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect this lower demand environment and prevent overstocking as we move further into the Spring season. This targets a base stock that covers the estimated demand for the next period plus a safety buffer consistent with recent volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a basic denim item. Historical demand analysis shows a significant drop from an average of ~20 (Jan) to ~7 (Feb-March). In the last 7 periods, demand has ranged from 2 to 12, with a mean of 6.4. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Since on-hand inventory is low (3 units) and the demand regime has stabilized, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining responsiveness to small fluctuations. Setting L to calculate to reflect the 0-period lead time observed.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is Ladies Denim Jeggings. Analysis of the demand history from Period 1 (Feb 11) to Period 8 (Apr 1) shows a significant and sustained low-demand regime. Specifically, demand samples are: 12, 10, 6, 5, 2, 3, 7, 2. The carry-over insight correctly identified a drop from the initial samples (28, 20, 21, 11, 11) to an average of roughly 5.8 units per period over the last 8 weeks. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 5 units with nothing in-transit. Given the low demand and 0-period lead time, I will use recent history (N=8) to capture this lower volume regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the confirmed 0-period lead time history.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is 'Ladies Denim Jeggings'. Looking at the demand history since the shift identified in Period 6 (starting mid-February), demand has been consistently low: 12, 10, 6, 5, 2, 3, 7, 2, 2. The average demand since Period 3 is approximately 3.8 units per week. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations confirm actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 7 units with 0 in transit. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the reliable 0-period delivery. This will maintain a lean inventory posture suitable for the current low-demand phase without incurring excessive holding costs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223034 (Ladies Jeggings) entered a lower demand regime in mid-February, which has been sustained for about 10 periods. The average demand since Period 1 (starting 2019-02-11) is approximately 5.3 units per week, significantly lower than the pre-February average (~18). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with arrivals concluding in the same period they were ordered. Given that on-hand inventory is currently low (3 units), a small order is likely required to meet upcoming demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the current lower-demand regime (Periods 1-10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant mean and volatility estimates for recent performance.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a staple item (Jeggings). Since Period 1 (late February), demand has entered a lower, stable regime compared to the pre-game samples. Specifically, the last several weeks (Periods 5\u201311) have seen demand between 2 and 7, with an average of approximately 3.57. There is no evidence of a seasonal spike for spring/early summer in the recent data. Promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently show actual lead time is 0. With on-hand inventory at 4 units and an average demand of ~4 per period, I need to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to prevent stockouts while reflecting the current demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=7) to focus on the stability observed since mid-March, which captures both the low points (2) and the slight rebounds (5-7).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223034' (Jeggings) is entering May. Historical demand analysis shows two regimes: an early Jan peak (avg ~18) and a stable Feb-April period (avg ~4.75). However, Period 12 showed a demand spike to 8, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all completed orders. Given the stockout and the slight increase in demand over the last two weeks (5 and 8 units), I need to adjust the forecast upward to capture this shift and rebuild safety stock. I will use recent_N with N=6 to focus on the spring demand pattern (Periods 7-12) while acknowledging the recent uptick. Setting L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late April (Period 12 demand: 8 vs previous 4-week avg: 3.25), suggesting a potential late-spring demand lift or higher variance regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Historical data for this SKU (Jeggings) shows a significant demand drop in February, but a more recent upswing is visible in late April (Period 12 demand: 8 units). The last few periods (11-13) have shown an average demand of 5.66, which is higher than the previous March/April average of roughly 3.25. The stock level is currently low (3 units on-hand, 0 in-transit). Given the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), a service level of 80% is targeted. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To account for the recent demand lift while remaining cautious of potential volatility, I am using a recent window (N=3) for both mean and sigma to capture the local trend (avg ~5.7, plus volatility from the spike in Period 12).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility/regime shift confirmed for May: average weekly demand increased to 5.7 (Periods 11-13) from previous 4-week average of 3.25 (+75%).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 399223034 (Jeggings) shows distinct regimes: a high pre-Feb period (avg ~18), a significantly lower Feb-March period (avg ~7), and a recent period of volatility in late April/May. Last period (P14) saw 0 demand, which follows a sequence of 5, 8, 4 in periods 11-13. The Carry-over insight noted a lift in early May, but the P14 zero makes the trend unclear. Given the product category (denim/trousers) and the spring season, demand is likely to be stable but moderate. I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the recent volatility (8, 4, 0) while filtering out the much older high-demand periods. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with no missing shipments, so 'default' (promised lead time 0) is appropriate.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a pair of jeggings, which generally has stable year-round demand but can experience fluctuations. Analysis of the recent demand (Periods 11-15: 5, 8, 4, 0, 7) shows a mean of 4.8 units per week. This aligns with the 'carry-over insight' from Period 14 regarding a demand lift in May compared to the March/April average of ~3 units. A significant drop to 0 demand occurred in Period 14, but demand quickly rebounded to 7 in Period 15, confirming the higher volatility regime. On-hand inventory is critically low at 1 unit with 0 in-transit. Since the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met (13 out of 15 periods show lead_time 0), I will maintain L=0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current active spring demand regime and its associated volatility, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to prevent stockouts observed recently in Period 12.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223034' (Ladies Jeggings) is entering June, a period where denim demand typically remains steady or slightly increases due to summer transitions. In Period 16 (May 27), we saw a significant demand spike to 13 units, causing a stockout (sold 8, on-hand 0). This follows a previous high of 7 in Period 15 and 8 in Period 12. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 12-16), demand has averaged 6.4 units per period, while the more recent 3-period average is 6.67. Given the recent stockouts and the spike to 13, I am adopting a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this increased demand regime (6.4 vs earlier average of ~3-4). For sigma_hat, N=5 captures the increased volatility (Std Dev \u2248 4.8). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late May/early June: average weekly demand increased to 6.4 (Periods 12-16) from the April average of ~3.25. High volatility noted with a peak demand of 13 in Period 16.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/03), the SKU experienced a massive demand spike (98 units), far exceeding the previous high of 13. This resulted in a complete stockout. While this might be an outlier or a specific seasonal flash-sale/event, it signals a significant regime shift. The 'Carry-over insights' already noted increasing demand, but this event requires a drastic update to the forecast. Current on-hand is 0. I will switch mu_hat to 'explicit' to proactively stock for a higher baseline while the OR backend stabilizes, setting it to 25 (roughly double the previous non-outlier peak) to capture potential sustained high demand without over-ordering if the 98 was a one-time peak. L remains 'calculate' because arrivals have consistently been lead_time=0. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent extreme volatility.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike detected Period 17 (98 units); current inventory exhausted. Regime has shifted from low-single digits to high volatility with potential for extreme peaks in June.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223034' (Ladies Jeggings) has entered a high-volume seasonal demand phase since early June. Demand exploded from single digits in April/May to 98 and 73 units in the last two periods (P17 and P18). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). The product description (washed denim jeggings) and the June timing suggest a summer trend spike. Although the promised lead time is 0, we must aggressively increase the base stock parameters to prevent further lost sales. I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the massive shift in the last three weeks (demand: 13, 98, 73), and setting sigma_hat explicitly high to account for the extreme volatility observed (ranging from 13 to 98). This will allow the OR engine to calculate a significantly higher base stock to meet this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed for June: Weekly demand surged from ~6 in May to an average of 61.3 over the last 3 periods (P16-P18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223034' (Jeggings) is in a high-demand June seasonal peak. Demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) has been 13, 98, 73, and 41, resulting in an average of 56.25 units per period. While demand dropped from the extreme peak of 98 to 41, it remains significantly elevated compared to the spring average of ~5-7. The latest figure (41) suggests we are either seeing a stabilization of the high-demand regime or the tail end of the peak. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is 80%, meaning we should lean towards protecting against stockouts. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this June surge for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: June high-demand regime characterized by high volume and extreme volatility (P16-P19 average: 56.25, Max: 98). Demand appears to be softening from the peak (P19: 41) but remains at ~8x pre-June levels.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jeggings H.W' reached a peak in mid-June (June 3, 10) with levels of 98 and 73, but has since shown a decelerating trend (41 in P19 and 34 in P20). We are now entering July, which is the start of a new month and potential post-peak summer period. The 'high-demand June regime' (P17-P20) averaged ~61.5 units, but the last two weeks average only 37.5. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the current on-hand inventory of 54, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent softening trend (35-40 units) while maintaining a high sigma_hat to protect against the high volatility observed in June. L remains at the promised 0 as actual lead times consistently match. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the entirety of the June surge and subsequent cooling, which calculates to an average of (98+73+41+34)/4 = 61.5. This will result in a base stock that covers the downside while account for the 54 units already on hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak for summer jeggings occurred in mid-June (P17-P18); July demand is starting at a lower level (~34-41 units) compared to the peak (~73-98), suggesting a seasonal softening.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22 (July 8). Analysis of the June/July high-season for this SKU (jeggings) shows a significant but now softening demand spike. Demand peaked in mid-June (P17: 98, P18: 73) and has been consistently declining since (P19: 41, P20: 34, P21: 27). The current 5-period average (P17-P21) is 54.6, but the most recent 3 periods (P19-P21) average 34.0. To avoid overstocking while demand trends downward into July, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the shift (averaging 34, 41, 73, 98 would be too high; averaging the last 4: 27, 34, 41, 73 = 43.75). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the still-high volatility relative to early spring. With 60 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order based on a target base stock reflecting this cooling but still elevated July demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression confirmed: July demand is currently averaging ~30-35 units, down from the June peak average of ~85 units, but still significantly above the pre-June average of ~6.

The last four periods (P19-P22) show a downward trend: 41, 34, 27, 23. The average for July (P21-P22) is currently 25.0, while the average for the last four weeks (P19-P22) is 31.25. Given this cooling trend, I will use a recent N window of 3 to capture this softening (average 28.0) while maintaining enough buffer against the remaining volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as observed throughout the history. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 allows the OR backend to quickly adjust to the post-peak demand levels, reducing excessive holding costs while still covering the current weekly requirements.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal decline confirmed mid-July: July demands (P21-P22) average 25.0, a significant drop from the June peak period (P16-P20) average of 51.8. The trend is consistently downward for 4 consecutive weeks.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, there was a significant unexpected demand spike of 72 units (vs. the previous 2-week average of 25), leading to a stockout. This spike contrasts with the 'seasonal decline' observed in the first two weeks of July. Given this extreme volatility at the end of July (Date: 2019/7/22), I must adjust mu_hat upward to prevent further stockouts while remaining mindful of the overall downward seasonal trend from the June peak. The most recent regime (July: Periods 21-23) has shown demand values of 27, 23, and 72, resulting in a 3-week average of 40.6 units. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this recent spike and increased variance, ensuring the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to handle the current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in late July (P23: 72 units), reversing the previous 2-week decline and indicating an unstable seasonal transition.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223034' (jeggings) is experiencing significant seasonal volatility. After a massive June spike (Period 17: 98 units), demand appeared to soften in July (reaching a low of 23 units in P22), but then spiked again (P23: 72, P24: 42). The current Period 25 starting date (July 29) suggests we are exiting the peak summer season and moving toward late summer/early fall transitions. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To manage the recent high volatility (ranging from 23 to 72 in the last 3 periods), I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the July average (approx 37.2 units) and using an explicit sigma_hat of 20 to provide a robust safety buffer against the observed high variance while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit vs $4/unit profit).

Carry-over insight: July demand shows high instability with a secondary spike in late July (P23: 72 units), contradicting the earlier decline trend. Average demand for July (P21-P24) is 41.0 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (jeggings) experienced a significant summer peak in June (P17-P18) and has since entered a high-volatility phase in July and early August. Demand in the last four periods (P22-P25) has been 23, 72, 42, and 55, resulting in an average of approximately 48 units per week. This indicates that while the absolute peak has passed, demand remains much higher and more unstable than the early spring regime. The current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), necessitating a resupply. Historical 'conclude' messages show a consistent actual lead time of 0 periods. To capture the recent high-volatility demand while acknowledging the end of the extreme June peak, I will use a recent_N window for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. Setting N=5 covers the most recent volatile four-week window plus one additional sample to stabilize the estimate against the stockout in P23.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high entering August: average demand for P22-P25 is 48.0 units with significant fluctuations (range 23-72), requiring higher safety stock than spring levels.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223034 (Jeggings) is experiencing a high-volatility summer demand regime. Period 26 demand spiked significantly to 97 units, following a volatile July that saw spikes of 72 and 55. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Moving into mid-August (Period 27), demand remains very strong and unstable. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is 57.8 units, which is significantly higher than the early July average of ~25 units. This suggests the product remains in a peak seasonal phase or is highly sensitive to clearance/replenishment events. To prevent further stockouts (which have occurred in 4 of the last 10 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this elevated, volatile volume. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-volatility demand regime continues into August: Period 26 saw a spike to 97 units. Average demand for the last 5 weeks (P22-P26) is 57.8 units, confirming that early-July softening was temporary or replaced by late-summer peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223034 has entered a high-velocity, extreme-volatility phase during the summer months (June-August). Period 27 saw the highest demand to date (123 units), significantly exceeding previous weeks. The carry_over_insights indicate that while there were temporary softening trends in early July, the overall regime remains remarkably strong and volatile. In Period 27, a large order of 82 units was placed and completely exhausted by a demand of 123, leaving zero on-hand inventory. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent extreme volume and volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the last 5 weeks (Periods 23-27: 72, 42, 55, 97, 123), which average ~77.8 units per week. Given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, the OR backend's service level target is high (80%), and using recent observations will ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to mitigate the frequent stockouts observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand surge confirmed: August demand (Periods 26-27) averaged 110 units, compared to the July average of 41 units (+168%), indicating a significant peak-season expansion.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (August 2019) confirms a significant peak season for Jeggings, likely driven by 'Back to School' shopping. Demand in the last three periods (P26-P28) has surged to 97, 123, and 103 units respectively. The average demand for these three periods is 107.7 units, which is a massive increase from the July average (~41). Although on-hand inventory is near zero (3 units), the promised lead time remains 0, meaning we can replenish in the current period. Given the high volatility and the consistent 100+ demand over the last two weeks, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this high-demand August regime. This will ensure the base stock is high enough to satisfy this level of demand and prevent stockouts seen in P26 and P27.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand peak confirmed: August (P26-P28) weekly demand averaged 107.7 units, compared to ~41 units in July (+163%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (jeggings) has entered a sustained high-demand regime throughout August, driven by back-to-school seasonality. Demand in the most recent periods follows a stabilized high-volume pattern: P27 (123), P28 (103), and P29 (110). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is approximately 108.25 units. As we move into September (P30, 2019/9/2), demand is expected to remain high but potentially start a gradual transition away from the absolute back-to-school peak. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this high-volume regime while acknowledging the slight stabilization, I am using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine maintains a high base stock sufficient to cover the current demand levels and protect against the high volatility observed in August (range 97-123).

Carry-over insight: September transition: August demand stabilized at a high-volume regime (average 108.3 units), a significant sustained increase from July (average 41 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim jegging, which has exhibited strong seasonality. Demand spiked significantly in August (averaging 108.3 units) due to the back-to-school season. As we enter September (Period 31), demand remains high but is expected to stabilize or slightly soften as the primary peak passes. Period 30 saw a high demand of 126 units, causing a stockout. Given that the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met (L=0), and the demand regime has been stable at this high level for the last 5 periods (P26-P30), I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this current August/September volume. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, justifying a high service level to avoid further stockouts during this high-volume period.

Carry-over insight: September demand remains in the high-volume regime established in August (Avg ~110 units), with Period 30 showing no signs of immediate decline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a sustained high-demand regime throughout August and early September, averaging approximately 118 units per week over the last three weeks (P29-P31: 110, 126, 127). The 'Back-to-school' peak has stabilized into a consistent high-volume period. Despite the promised lead time of 0, actual demand has frequently exhausted on-hand inventory (on-hand is currently 0), leading to lost sales (e.g., P30: demand 126 vs sold 118; P31: demand 127 vs sold 123). To maximize reward and minimize stockouts in this high-volume regime (Profit: $4 vs Holding: $1), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this stabilized high demand (~116 units/period). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to account for the high volatility observed in this peak season. Lead time L is set to calculated based on historic performance (which has consistently been 0).

Carry-over insight: September demand has stabilized in a high-volume regime, averaging ~117.5 units over P28-P31, significantly higher than the August start. Stockouts occurred in P30 and P31, indicating that current supply is slightly trailing demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volume demand regime that began in August and has carried through September. Demand over the last 5 periods (P28-P32) has been 103, 110, 126, 127, and 100, averaging 113.2 units per week. Although P32 showed a slight dip to 100 units, it remains within the established high-volume band (approx. 100-130 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and prevent the stockouts seen in P30 and P31, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this current September stabilization. This methodology balances the slight softening in P32 against the very high demand seen in P30-P31 while maintaining sufficient safety stock for late-September/early-October levels.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stabilized: average weekly demand (P28-P32) is 113.2 units, maintaining the high-volume levels established in August.

=== Period 33 Summary ===
399223034: ordered=97, arrived=97 units (ordered on Period 33, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=124, demand=102, sold=102, ending on-hand inventory=22

Daily Reward (R_t): $386.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Ladies Jeggings) is in a stable high-demand regime following the August back-to-school peak. Analysis of the last six periods (P28-P33) shows a consistent demand profile with a mean of 111.33 units and a standard deviation of approximately 11.5 units. The transition into October typically signals a shift from early autumn peaks to stable fall demand before any pre-holiday surges. Since the lead time remains consistently 0, the inventory strategy focuses on capturing the current period's demand without overstocking. I will use the last 6 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stabilization following the August surge. The OR engine's critical ratio (4.0 / (4.0 + 1.0) = 0.8) indicates the backend will maintain a slightly aggressive service level (~80%), which is appropriate for this high-volume period to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 30 and 31.

Carry-over insight: October transition: Demand has stabilized into a high-volume autumn regime (P28-P33 avg: 111.3 units) with reduced volatility (sigma ~11.5) compared to the August surge.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223034 (high-waisted denim jeggings) has entered a stable, high-volume autumn regime. Period 34 concluded with a demand of 102 units, continuing a very consistent pattern observed over the last five weeks (P30-P34: 126, 127, 100, 102, 102). The average demand for this most recent regime is 111.4 units with significantly reduced volatility compared to the August surge. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order. For Period 35, I am setting the lead time L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering Periods 30-34) to capture this stabilized autumn demand level accurately. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current lower volatility, ensuring the OR engine correctly balances the service level for this high-margin item (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) without excessive overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: P30-P34 weekly demand average is 111.4 units with high consistency (standard deviation ~12.3), reflecting a mature high-volume phase with lower volatility than the August transition.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (jeggings) has transitioned into a stable autumn regime. Demand in the most recent period (P35: 80 units) was lower than the previous 5-week average (P30-P34: ~111 units), suggesting a potential late-season softening or typical weekly variance. The standard deviation over the last 5 weeks is approximately 19.3. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the OR engine will target an 80% service level. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the established autumn regime while incorporating the recent dip to avoid excessive overstocking as we head deeper into October. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history, so I am setting L to default (promised).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime softening detected: Period 35 demand (80 units) is 28% below the September average (~111 units), signaling a potential transition from the high-volume back-to-school peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223034 (Jeggings) is showing a clear downward trend as we move further into October, transitioning away from the high-volume August/September peak. Period 35 demand was 80 units and Period 36 dropped further to 56 units. This is a significant decrease from the previous regime average of ~111 units. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (which are $1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am adjusting the forecast to reflect this more recent lower demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the sharp downturn (avg of periods 34, 35, 36 is ~79 units), but I will modulate this with a higher volatility estimate (recent_N for sigma) to account for the uncertainty during this regime transition.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline in October: Demand dropped for two consecutive weeks (P35: 80, P36: 56) from the September average of ~111, signaling the end of the high-volume autumn regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223034 (High-waisted Jeggings) is in a confirmed autumnal decline following the August/September peak. Period 37 demand (69 units) slightly rebounded from Period 36 (56 units), but remains significantly lower than the September average (~111 units). The overall trend since Period 35 is clearly downward. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory as the season winds down, I am adjusting the forecast to reflect the recent lower-demand regime. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current average (approx. 68 units/week) while providing sufficient safety stock for the lingering volatility observed in the transition periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline in October: Demand for Periods 35-37 (avg 68.3) is significantly lower than the September peak (avg 111.3), confirming a seasonal phase-out.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering November, and the demand signals from October (P35-P38) confirm a clear step-down from the high-volume late-summer/autumn regime (which averaged ~115 units). The last four weeks of demand are 80, 56, 69, and 50, resulting in a new mean of 63.75 units. This represents a ~45% reduction from the previous peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory during this seasonal decline, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect the most recent 4-week regime (P35-P38). This targets the current demand level of approximately 64 units per period while accounting for the recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized in late October: November entry demand (P35-P38) average is 63.8 units, down from the September average of 111.3 (-43%).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223034 (Jeggings) has entered a post-peak seasonal decline. Following the high-volume 'back-to-school' regime in August and September (average ~111-117 units), demand has dropped significantly through October and early November. The last five periods (P35-P39) show demands of 80, 56, 69, 50, and 44, respectively. This period's start date is 2019/11/11, moving further into late autumn. The average demand of the last 5 weeks is 59.8 units, down 46% from the September peak. I am selecting recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time. This approach reduces inventory levels to avoid holding costs on a declining-demand item while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime stabilized in November: Period 35-39 average weekly demand is 59.8 units, confirming a ~46% reduction from the September peak (111.4 units). Volatility has also decreased relative to the summer surge.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223034 (Jeggings) is in a clear post-peak seasonal decline as we move into mid-November. The high-volume regime of August/September (avg ~110+) has shifted to a lower regime. The last 5 periods (P36-P40) show an average demand of 50.6 units, but the most recent two weeks (P39-P40) show a tighter average of 39 units. Given the transition into late November, I am selecting N=5 to capture the stabilized lower demand regime while allowing the backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock for the current volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Setting parameters to reflect this 'late-autumn' stabilized regime prevents overstocking while maintaining service levels for the ~40-unit/week baseline.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed for November: average demand for P36-P40 is 50.6 units, with the latest two weeks (P39-P40) stabilizing around 34-44 units (~65% reduction from September peak).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a post-peak autumn/winter phase. Demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the September high. Over the last five periods (P37-P41), demand values were 69, 50, 44, 34, and 58, resulting in a 5-period average of 51.0 units. The most recent period (P41) saw a slight uptick to 58 units, possibly due to pre-holiday or early Black Friday interest (current date is Nov 25). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stabilized post-peak regime while reacting slightly to the recent 58-unit demand, ensuring the inventory is sufficient for the end-of-November transition without overstocking as we approach the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime stabilized: P37-P41 average weekly demand is 51.0 units, a ~54% reduction from the September peak (111.4 units). Volatility remains moderate (std dev ~13.1).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). The demand in Period 42 was 338 units, which is a massive spike compared to the previous 5-week average of ~51 units. This strongly indicates the start of the Black Friday/Holiday shopping season (late November/early December). Because the system resolved Period 42 with only 63 units of starting inventory (and 0 ending), we experienced a major stockout. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-volume peak, I am moving to an 'explicit' demand forecast. I will forecast mu_hat based on the Period 42 spike, but slightly moderated as Period 42 might be the absolute peak (Black Friday week). I will set mu_hat to 250 units (assuming a sustained holiday level) and a high explicit sigma_hat of 80 to account for extreme volatility observed during such peaks.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Season demand spike confirmed: Period 42 (Nov 25) demand reached 338 units, a >6x increase from the November average (~51 units). Entering high-volume December regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 demand (Dec 2) was 122 units, following the extreme Black Friday spike of 338 units. The date is now Dec 9, entering the peak holiday shopping weeks. While demand dropped from the 338 peak, 122 is still ~2.4x the November average (~51), confirming we are in a high-volume December regime. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the transition from the end of November into the December peaks (Avg of P41-P43: (58+338+122)/3 = 172.6). I will use explicit sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed during this holiday transition, as the standard deviation across this period is very high. Given the on-hand inventory of 196, the OR engine will determine if additional units are needed to maintain the base stock for this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: December Holiday regime confirmed: Demand shifted from Nov avg (~51) to a high-volatility peak (P42: 338, P43: 122). Demand is expected to remain elevated through mid-December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak. Following the massive spike in Period 42 (338 units), demand has remained elevated (P43: 122, P44: 130). We are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 45 of 47). Historical lead time calculation consistently shows L=0. In Period 44, we ended with 161 units on-hand. Based on the last two weeks, we expect demand to continue at a high level (120-140 units) for Period 45 and likely taper off slightly as we approach Christmas/Year-end. To set parameters, I will use a restricted window (recent_N=3) to focus on the holiday spike average across the lead+review period (1+0=1 period). This covers the surge and the current stabilization. Given the high holding cost ($1) and the nearing end of the game, we want to maintain high service but avoid excessive ending inventory after Period 47.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Season demand remains elevated but stable following the late November spike: P43 and P44 demand averaged 126 units, significantly higher than the November pre-spike average of 51 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 falls on Dec 23, 2019, immediately following the peak holiday demand weeks. Historical demand shows a significant spike in late November (338 units) followed by three weeks of stabilized but elevated demand (122, 130, 126 units). As we move into the final week of December, demand often tapers off after the Christmas shopping peak. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 174 units. Given the transition from peak holiday to post-holiday periods, a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) captures the current holiday average (~126 units) while sigma_hat (recent_N=4) accounts for the high variability seen in the transition from November to December. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The parameters aim to maintain availability for the remaining holiday demand while beginning to scale down for the January transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition detected: Demand across P43-P45 stabilized at an average of 126 units (+148% vs Nov average of 51) after the initial Black Friday spike.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the final week of December (Period 47). Looking at the post-Holiday trend (P43-P46), demand has stabilized at an average of 125 units (122, 130, 126, 122), following the Black Friday spike of 338. With January approaching, historical data from similar periods (P1-P5) showed demand starting in the 10-20 range after the initial launch phase. However, given the much higher baseline established in 2019 compared to the early launch phase, and the high-volume autumn/winter regimes, I expect demand to moderate from the 126 average but remain significantly higher than last spring. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 captures the current 125-unit stability. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the low standard deviation observed over these four weeks (approx 3.7 units), though I will use a slightly more conservative buffer of 15 to account for potential January clearing variability. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilized in late December: Weekly demand for P43-P46 was remarkably consistent, averaging 125 units with very low volatility (range 122-130).
