Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for this fitted T-shirt (SKU 678342002) is: [22, 11, 20, 13, 41]. There is a visible spike in the most recent period (Feb 4th, 41 units), though the previous four samples averaged 16.5. This product is a 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt, typically showing stable demand but potentially rising as we approach Spring. Promised lead time (L) is 0. With L=0, the system must cover (0+1) units of demand per period. My goal is to ensure inventory is available immediately upon ordering. Since L=0, orders arrive in the same period they are placed. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture all historical data points, which accounts for the recent spike while smoothing it against earlier samples.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). Examining the historical demand data: [22, 11, 20, 13, 41] and the Period 1 actual demand of 60, there is a clear upward trend in demand as we move into mid-February. The item 'Fitted T-shirt in soft cotton jersey' is a basic garment likely seeing increased volume as spring approaches. Period 1 demand was 60 units, significantly higher than the 5-week historical mean (~21.4). We stocked 22 units (the amount suggested by the initial demand sample), resulting in lost sales (22 sold vs 60 demand). The actual lead time for Period 1 was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand parameters (the last sample 41 and Period 1's 60) to capture this surge, while maintaining the L=0 expectation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th (Period 3). Demand for 678342002 (Fitted T-shirt) has shown a significant surge: P1 demand was 60 (up from the historical mean of ~21) and P2 demand was 77. This indicates a seasonal shift or trend for basic jersey tops. The promised lead time is 0, and historical logic from Period 1 and 2 confirms L=0 (orders arrived within the same period). Both periods resulted in lost sales because the 'cap' logic or current base stock parameters were insufficient for the demand spike (ending inventory 0 and sales equal to receipts). I will set L to 0 (default). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=2 to focus on the current high-demand regime (avg ~68). Since the volatility is also high in this new regime, I will use recent_N with N=2 for sigma_hat as well to ensure a higher service level to capture the profit of this high-volume period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 (Feb 11): Demand increased from pre-game mean of ~21 to a current average of 68.5 units/period.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678342002' (Fitted T-shirt) is currently experiencing a significant demand surge following its season transition in mid-February. Historical demand for the most recent 3 periods (60, 77, 98) shows a clear upward trend and a mean of 78.3 units, far exceeding the pre-game mean of 21.4. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. However, we have stocked out in every period (ending inventory = 0, sold < demand), indicating we are under-ordering. To capture the current growth and mitigate lost sales, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's higher mean and volatility. Setting L to default (0) as evidenced by previous arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand is trending upwards within the new regime: P1=60, P2=77, P3=98. Current regime mean (N=3) is 78.3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic fitted T-shirt, and we are entering mid-March, a period where seasonal demand for basic upper-body garments typically begins to rise. Historical data from early 2019 (pre-game) showed a mean of ~21, which jumped significantly starting Period 1. Observed demand in the last four periods has been 60, 77, 98, and 89, establishing a new high-volume regime. The mean of these four periods is 81.0 contextually. However, in all four periods, we have stocked out (ending inventory = 0) because we are hitting the OR backend's order cap and base stock calculations which are likely lagging due to the 0-period lead time and extreme demand volatility. The product description suggests a high-volume staple. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To prevent continuous stockouts, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high mean (~81) and variance, but I will explicitly set a higher mu_hat to account for the consistent stockouts (lost demand likely higher than observed sold units) and prepare for early spring seasonality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1 confirmed: mean increased from ~21 to ~81 (+285%). Consistent stockouts in Periods 1-4 suggest true demand likely exceeds observed sales.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678342002' (Fitted T-shirt) entered a high-demand regime in February, characterized by significant stockouts in Periods 1-4 where observed demand reflected only available inventory. Period 5 (March 11) saw a drop in demand to 50 units, which resulted in the first instance of ending inventory (60 units). This suggests that previous demand signals were heavily censored and the true mean is likely between the high of 98 and the low of 50. Since we are moving further into the spring season for a t-shirt product, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (the start of the high regime) to capture this new level. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z*=0); however, to account for the high volatility and previous stockouts, I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to ensure the base stock is sufficiently responsive to the observed variance in this new regime. Promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a fitted T-shirt, which typically sees increased demand as spring approaches. Historical data shows a clear regime shift starting in Period 1 (late Feb), with demand peaking at 98 in P3. However, Periods 5 and 6 show a softening in demand (50 and 42 respectively), suggesting the initial 'spring lift' surge might be stabilizing or reverting toward a moderate mean. We have experienced consistent stockouts in P1-P4, meaning earlier demand was likely higher than sales. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering following the high demand in P1-P4 while accounting for the recent cooling, I will use a recent_N approach. N=6 covers the entire new regime since Feb 11. mu_hat will use N=6 (average ~69.3), and L will remain at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand from Period 1 to 6 is 69.3 units, significantly higher than pre-Feb levels but cooling from the P3 peak of 98.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678342002' (Fitted T-shirt) is exhibiting a higher demand regime compared to the pre-February period. Since Feb 11 (Period 1), demand has averaged 69.4 units, though it has been volatile (range 42-98). The inventory is currently 0, following a sell-out in Period 7 (demand 70 vs starting inventory 70). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 (orders arrive same-period). Given the product type and spring dates, I aniticipate steady to rising demand. I will use the average demand from the last 7 periods (the 'new' regime since Feb 11) to set mu_hat. This balances the earlier spikes (98) and recent lower values (42). With profit ($1) equal to holding cost ($1), the OR engine target service level is 50%, so sigma_hat is crucial to prevent stockouts if demand exceeds the mean.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a fitted cotton t-shirt, which is trending into the spring/summer season (Divided Basics line). Looking at the history (Period 1 to 8), demand has shifted significantly from the pre-game samples (avg ~21) to a higher regime (avg ~70.1). Recent demand (Periods 3-8) averages 70.6, with a standard deviation of approximately 19.5. Stockouts occurred in Periods 1-4, 7, and 8, indicating that realized sales (sold units) are likely underestimating true underlying demand. Notably, in Period 7 and 8, the system sold exactly what was available (70 units), while recorded demand was 70 and 75 respectively. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). To ensure we capture the demand as the weather warms and avoid further stockouts, I will use a mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (Period 4-8) to reflect the recent stable-but-high demand level, and keep L at default (0).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 (Cotton T-shirt) is in a high-demand spring regime. Looking at historical periods 1-9, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand remains significantly higher than the January pre-game average of ~20. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has shown some volatility but averages approximately 57.8 units (50, 42, 70, 75, 52). However, earlier periods (P1-P4) showed even higher constrained demand (60, 77, 98, 89). Given the current date is April 15th, demand for basic jersey t-shirts is likely to remain strong as spring progresses. To avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 1-4 and 7-8, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation. I'll set N=9 to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime that started in February, which yields a mean of ~68 units. Since holding cost equals profit ($1 each), the OR backend will target a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), effectively ordering to the mean demand. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time as it is consistently observed at 0.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a fitted t-shirt, which enters peak seasonality as spring progresses into summer. Historical demand from Period 1 to Period 10 shows a mean of approximately 67.7 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 17.5. Recent demand patterns (Periods 7-10) are consistent with this, averaging 65.25. However, since the product is a staple t-shirt and we are approaching warmer months, demand is expected to remain firm or increase slightly. We have observed that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is low (5 units on-hand), necessitating a robust order for the current period. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stable but high-demand regime that began in February, while the OR backend's service level logic (critical ratio q=0.5 since profit=holding cost) will handle the buffer. Given the seasonal relevance of the SKU (Jersey T-shirt in April), maintaining a base stock that covers the mean demand is crucial to avoid stockouts seen in earlier periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a fitted cotton T-shirt, which typically sees sustained or increasing demand as spring progresses into summer. Historical demand from Period 5 onwards (the current stable regime) has averages around 57 units per period (P5-P11 mean: 58.5). Since lead time (L) has consistently been 0, I will set L=0. I will use the last 7 periods (N=7) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable demand period following the initial Feb/March volatility. This sample period accounts for the slight dip and current stabilization around the 55-65 range. Given Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the OR engine will target a 50th percentile service level (z=0), effectively aiming for the mean demand. Increasing the window to N=7 provides a more stable forecast than the volatile early periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 5 (March 11) with a mean of approximately 58 units/period (P5-P11 range: 42-75). Seasonal visibility suggests this 'spring' level is the new baseline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/06. The SKU is a fitted T-shirt, which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. In Period 12 (April 29), demand spiked to 91 units, which resulted in a stockout (sold 59, ending inventory 0). This suggests the previous 'stable' mean of 58 units (observed between periods 5-11) is shifting upwards as summer approaches. Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the service level target q is 0.5, meaning the base stock level will target the median demand. To react to the recent spike while maintaining some stability, I will use a recent_N of 8 periods (covering the start of the 'spring' regime through the recent spike) and set mu_hat explicitly to account for the anticipated seasonal increase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in Period 12 (91 units) signaling the start of a summer seasonal peak; mean demand is trending above the previous 58 units baseline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678342002' (Fitted T-shirt) is entering a summer demand regime as of late April/early May. We are currently observing a trend of increasing demand (P12=91, P13=81), continuing to result in stockouts despite order quantities in the 60s. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time in all concluded periods (P1-P13) has consistently been 0, L is set to 'default'. To capture the recent shift to summer demand, mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on the last 3 periods (P11-P13), which includes the jump from ~58 units to the current ~75+ range. This provides the OR backend with more aggressive targets to prevent the recurring stockouts observed in P12 and P13.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P12-P13): Mean demand has shifted from ~58 (Spring) to ~86 (Early Summer), resulting in consistent stockouts at previous inventory levels.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical data and Carry-over Insights confirm a summer peak for this SKU (Fitted T-shirt). Demand has consistently exceeded supply for the last three periods (P12-P14), with observed sales totaling exactly the stock available (59, 63, 77) against higher latent demand (91, 81, 89). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To capture the full volume of this peak and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 100 units to account for the true demand signal currently obscured by stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to a higher value (explicitly 15) to account for the increased volatility observed during seasonal transitions, ensuring the OR backend maintains a higher safety stock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019, which is late spring/early summer. The product is a fitted t-shirt, which is entering its peak seasonal demand. Since Period 12 (late April), there has been a significant and sustained increase in demand. The demand figures for the last four periods are: P12=91, P13=81, P14=89, P15=83. This averages to approximately 86 units per period. The earlier regime (P5-P11) averaged around 58 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). In Period 15, on-hand inventory finally met all demand (sold 83, ending 17), providing a cleaner sample of actual demand (83) compared to the previous stockout-constrained periods. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this summer regime (P12-P15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it specifically targets the current high-demand seasonal window while excluding the lower spring volumes.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the SKU (Short-sleeved Fitted T-shirt) is in its summer seasonal peak. Historical data from Period 12 to Period 16 shows a clear upward shift in demand, with values ranging from 81 to 98. Most importantly, 'sold' quantities have frequently been capped by ending inventory (Periods 12, 13, 14, 16), indicating that true demand is likely higher than the observed sales mean. The mean of observed demand from P12 onwards is roughly 88.4 units. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the OR backend will target the median. To prevent further stockouts during this peak season and account for censored demand, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 105 (slightly above the recent peak demand of 98) to ensure the system orders enough to cover the expected customer request. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the volatility of the summer regime. Lead time remains 'default' (0 periods) as it has been consistent throughout the game.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P12-P16) mean observed demand is 88.4, but persistent stockouts (P12, P13, P14, P16) confirm true demand is higher, exceeding 95 units during peak weeks.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 (Cotton T-shirt) is currently in a summer demand regime (starting Period 12, late April). While the most recent demand (P17) was 67, earlier weeks in this regime reached peaks of 91, 89, 83, and 98. Persistent stockouts in periods 12, 13, 14, and 16 indicate that observed sales consistently underrepresented actual demand during those weeks. The mean observed demand for the summer regime (P12-P17) is 84.8 units. However, given the nature of the product (basic t-shirt) and the current date (June 10), we are entering the peak summer season. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current summer baseline, but I will explicitly set sigma_hat higher to account for the volatility seen in recent weeks (range 67-98) and ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient buffer to prevent further stockouts. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by P1-P17 conclusions.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We are in the 'Summer demand regime' for this SKU (Fitted T-shirt). Historical data shows a clear shift starting Period 12 (late April), where demand frequently exceeds 80-90 units, often resulting in stockouts (P12, P13, P14, P16). Although the last two periods (P17, P18) moved closer to mean levels (~67-68 units), the carry-over insights confirm that true demand remains elevated, likely near 95+ during peak weeks. My objective is to maintain a high service level to capture this summer peak while accounting for the high volatility. Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use an explicit mu_hat of 95 to cover the upper end of the summer regime, as recent 'sold' units are truncated by stockouts, and use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7 to capture the summer volatility from P12-P18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, which is mid-summer for this 'Fitted T-shirt' SKU. Historical lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since Period 12 (April 29), we have seen a sustained 'summer' demand regime. Demand from Period 12 to 19 was: 91, 81, 89, 83, 98, 67, 68, 87. There was a slight dip in Periods 17 and 18, but Period 19 rebounded to 87 units. The carry-over insights suggest true demand often exceeds reported sales due to stockouts, particularly when demand is in the 90s. The mean of the summer regime (Periods 12-19) is approximately 84 units. Given that Period 19 demand was 87, I will use a recent_N (N=8) to capture this summer average while providing enough safety stock to cover potential spikes back toward 100 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st, 2019. The product is a 'Fitted T-shirt', which is in peak summer seasonality. Demand in Period 20 reached a new high of 119, resulting in a significant stockout (sold 83, 36 lost sales). The summer regime (starting Period 12) originally averaged ~86 units, but the last 4 periods (P17-P20) show a mean of 85.25 with a massive spike to 119 in Period 20. Given the date (July peak) and the severe stockout in the last period, the true demand is likely between 100-120 units. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 115 to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover this peak and recover from 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a larger sigma_hat (recent_N=5) to account for the increased volatility seen in the move from 68 to 119 demand units.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand peak confirmed: Period 20 demand (119) is the highest recorded, significantly exceeding the early summer average of 88. Stockouts continue to obscure true peak demand potential.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678342002' (Fitted T-shirt) is in a peak summer demand regime. Period 21 (July 1st) showed a stockout with sales of 115 against a demand of 122, following a Period 20 demand of 119. These are the highest recorded demand levels in the game history, significantly exceeding the early summer average of ~88. The trend is clearly upward as we enter July. To capture this sustained peak and avoid further lost sales, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use recent_N with N=2 (the last two high-demand weeks: P20 and P21). Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high volatility and current peak, I am also using recent_N=2 for sigma_hat to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover potential spikes above 120 units. With profit and holding cost equal ($1.0), the OR backend targets a 50% service level by default (z=0), but the 'cap' logic and my explicit N selection will help maintain higher coverage during this critical seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer peak (July) confirmed: Demand in P20-P21 averaged 120.5 units, a ~36% increase over the early summer (P12-P19) average of ~88. Stockouts occurring frequently when stock levels are below 120.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer period (July) for this jersey T-shirt. Historical data confirms two distinct seasonal shifts: from a spring average of ~58 units/period (P5-P11) to an early summer average of ~88 (P12-P19), and now a mid-summer peak (P20-P22) averaging 107.3 units (observed: 119, 122, 81). The low demand in P22 (81) follows several weeks of stockouts and high demand, which may be a minor fluctuation or indicative of some cooling; however, given the 'Mid-summer peak (July)' context, we should maintain a robust base stock. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% for the base stock calculation, but the OR engine's cap uses 95th percentile protection. To capture the current mid-summer volatility and average, I will use a recent window of N=3 for demand and sigma, covering the high-demand peak spanning late June and July.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Fitted T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand summer regime. Since Period 20 (late June), observed demand has spiked, averaging approx. 103.5 units (P20: 119, P21: 122, P22: 81, P23: 92), with periods 20 and 21 likely truncated by stockouts. The current date (July 22) suggests we are nearing the end of peak summer demand, but high levels are expected to persist through July. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while balancing the $1:$1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (which implies a target service level of 50%, although the OR backend cap provides a safety buffer), I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the mid-summer peak demand average (approx. 104 units per period). This N=4 allows the model to prioritize the most recent trend while acknowledging the slight cooling seen in the last two weeks.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in the peak summer demand regime for this T-shirt SKU. Recent demand observations show a significant spike, with Period 24 reaching a record high of 145 units, resulting in a complete stockout. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is 111.8 units, but given the stockouts in P20, P21, and P24, true demand is likely higher. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 140 to account for this peak and avoid further lost sales, as the summer season is at its height. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to reflect the high volatility observed during these peak weeks (range 81 to 145). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. This strategy aims to maximize profit by ensuring sufficient stock for the high summer demand despite the equal profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Period 24 demand (145) set a new record high. Mean demand for late July (P20-P24) has shifted to approximately 112+ units, with frequent stockouts masking true demand peaks above 140.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer demand regime for this T-shirt SKU. In Period 25 (July 29), demand was 129 units, following a peak of 145 in Period 24. For the most recent 5-period window (P21-P25), observed demand values are 122, 81, 92, 145, and 129. However, several of these periods (P21, P24) were stockouts, meaning true demand is likely higher than the average sold. The average demand over the last 5 periods (including stockout limited sales) is 113.8. Given the frequent spikes above 140, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 140 to ensure the base stock (mu + z*sigma) covers these peaks, especially since the holding cost and profit are equal ($1), implying a 50% service level target by default from the OR engine, but the capped policy and our desire to avoid lost sales in a high-demand window justify a more aggressive forecast. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the late summer period for a 'Fitted T-shirt', which has shown a significant demand increase since late May (Period 12). Recent demand (P24-P26) has been 145, 129, and 97, showing a slight cooling from the late July peak but still remaining well above the spring baseline of 58. The average demand over the last 7 periods (since the mid-summer peak began in Period 20) is 112.1 units. Given that we are moving into mid-August, I expect demand to remain high but potentially start a gradual seasonal decline. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent stockouts seen during the July peak while accounting for the recent slight drop in Period 26, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand late-summer regime (P20-P26) while providing enough safety stock to cover demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P20-P26) average confirmed at 112.1 units, significantly higher than early summer (88) and spring (58).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a fitted t-shirt, entering late August (Period 28: 2019/8/19). Historical demand analysis shows a significant drop in Period 27 (demand = 47) compared to the late-summer regime average of ~112 units (Periods 20-26). This sharp decline likely signals the end of the summer peak as the school season approaches or weather cools. Using a full-regime average (N=8) would result in overstocking (avg ~104), whereas the recent demand suggests a return to the spring/early-summer baseline of ~60-80 units. I will use recent_N=3 (average of P25-P27: 129, 97, 47 = 91) but choose mu_hat explicitly to account for the downward trend observed in the last two weeks. I estimate mean demand to be approximately 60 units for the upcoming period to avoid high holding costs while maintaining a service level for a potential late-season tail. The actual lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Seasonal transition observed; demand dropped significantly in P27 (47 units) after a late-summer peak, suggesting the high-demand summer regime (P20-P26) has ended.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Fitted T-shirt' (678342002) is currently in a post-summer transition phase (late August). Following the summer peak (P20-P26 avg ~112), demand dropped to 47 in P27 but then bounced back to 86 in P28, suggesting that while the absolute peak is over, demand remains significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~58. The current on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in P28. Given the volatility of this transition (47 vs 86), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent post-peak behavior (P26-P28 demand: 97, 47, 86; mean = 76.6). This allows the OR backend to adjust to the lower (but still substantial) late-summer/early-autumn demand level while maintaining safety stock for the observed volatility. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer transition confirmed: Demand in P27-P28 (avg 66.5) is lower than the summer peak (~112) but remains higher than the spring baseline (~58).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Demand history over the last three periods (P27: 47, P28: 86, P29: 76) confirms that the late-summer peak (avg ~112) has ended and stabilized into a post-summer regime. The average of these last three periods is 69.7 units. This level is slightly higher than the spring baseline (~58) but significantly lower than the July/August peaks. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new stabilization point (69.7 * (1+L)). Lead time remains consistently 0. Since demand is currently less volatile than the peak season but shows some variation (47 to 86), I will use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the current transition environment. The backend will target a ~50% service level because Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), but the inventory cap will protect against excessive overstocking during this downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer regime confirmed (P27-P29): Demand has stabilized at an average of 69.7 units/period, down from the late-summer peak of 112.1 (-38%).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern: a spring baseline (~58 units), a summer peak (up to 145 units), and a significant post-summer drop. The product is a fitted t-shirt, which explains higher summer demand. Since Period 27 (mid-August), demand has dropped from the 112+ summer average to a range of 47-86 units. Periods 27-30 show demands of 47, 86, 76, and 47. The last four periods (P27-P30) have an average of 64 units, which is consistent with the post-summer 'fall' regime identified in carry-over insights. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this stabilized post-summer demand level and use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while avoiding the extreme peaks and stockout-driven variance of the summer months. This ensures we don't over-order during the seasonal downturn.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical data and Carry-over Insights confirm a post-summer demand regime shift that began around Period 27 (mid-August). Demand has cooled significantly from the summer peak (avg ~112) to a more moderate level. Recent demand observations for Periods 27-31 are 47, 86, 76, 47, and 44. Since Period 30, demand has consistently stayed below 50 units (except for the late August spike in P28-P29). The mean of the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 60 units, but the most recent two periods (P30-P31) suggest a further cooling towards 45 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this downward seasonal trend, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the post-summer average, and N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility. This balances the recent lower observations (40s) with the late-August transition (70s-80s).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: Demand in P30-P31 has further dropped to an average of ~45 units, suggesting the post-summer regime (previously ~70) is continuing to trend downwards towards spring levels (~58) or lower.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Fitted T-shirt', which is highly seasonal. We are currently in late September (Period 33, 2019/09/23). Demand data from the last 3 periods (P30-P32: 47, 44, 28) shows a clear cooling trend as the weather gets colder, dropping below the post-summer average of 70. Period 32 demand (28) matches the lowest levels seen since pre-game history. The regime has shifted from the summer peak (~112) down through a transitional phase (~70) to what appears to be a 'Fall/Winter' baseline. I will use a short window (N=3) to capture this most recent downward shift to avoid overstocking. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a base stock that covers current low demand while accounting for a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Fall demand regime confirmed (P30-P32). Demand has dropped to an average of 39.7 units, significantly lower than the post-summer stabilization of ~70. The most recent demand (P32: 28) suggests a return to near-original baseline levels.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 is currently in a downward demand transition from its summer peak. The latest demand observations (P30-P33) are 47, 44, 28, and 43 unit, showing a stabilization near an average of 40 units/period. The Carry-over insights confirm this 'Fall' regime. Although P33 saw a slight bump to 43 units, the trend is significantly lower than the August levels (~70) and July peak (~112). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 0 after P33. To balance the service level without overstocking during this cooling period, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current mean of 40.5. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current volatility, ensuring the OR engine maintains a base stock level appropriate for the Fall baseline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the fall season (since Period 30) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the summer peak. The average demand from Period 30 to 34 is 42.8 units (47, 44, 28, 43, 52). While the last two periods (43, 52) show a slight uptick, the overall trend remains significantly lower than August levels. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to stockouts in P33 and P34, where orders were kept low based on previous lower demand samples. To prevent continued stockouts while acknowledging the lower seasonal regime, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the fall stabilization average of ~43. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to balance the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost, targeting a 50% service level which is appropriate given the symmetric cost structure.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (P30-P34) confirmed at an average of 42.8 units/period, roughly 62% lower than the summer peak (112.1).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. We are in a confirmed Fall demand regime for SKU 678342002 (Cotton Fitted T-shirt). Since Period 30, demand has significantly cooled from summer peaks (~112 units) to a much lower average. Analyzing the most recent regime (P30-P35), demand values are 47, 44, 28, 43, 52, 33, yielding an average of 41.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 8.7. Although P33 and P34 experienced stockouts due to under-ordering, the true demand appears stabilized around this 41-unit mark as temperatures drop. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use the recent_N method with N=6 to capture this Fall baseline (P30-P35) while excluding the higher late-summer data. This will set a base stock level that prevents excessive holding costs while covering the stabilized demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in a confirmed 'Fall' demand regime which started around Period 30 (early September). Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P32-P36: 28, 43, 52, 33, 27) averages 36.6 units, showing a return to lower levels compared to the summer peak. The product is a basic T-shirt, which likely maintains a stable baseline with less volatility now that the peak season has passed. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a safe service level during this transition, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most current regime behavior. This reflects the cooling demand trend from an average of ~43 (P30-P34) down to the most recent behavior.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (P30-P36) mean demand has further stabilized at 38.9 units/period, down from the post-summer high of 70 (-44%). Recent 3-period demand (P34-P36) average is 37.3.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 is a fitted t-shirt, which follows a strong seasonal pattern. We are currently in late October (Period 38, Oct 28). The carry-over insights and recent history confirm a 'fall' demand regime that began around Period 30. Mean demand from Period 30 to 37 is approximately 38.3 units/period (47, 44, 28, 43, 52, 33, 27, 32). This is significantly lower than the summer peak of ~112 units. Recent demand over the last 4 periods (P34-P37) is even lower, averaging 36 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this cooling period while maintaining service levels for the jersey basic, I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the stable fall regime. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same N=8 period to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level plus safety stock), which is appropriate for a stable basic item at the end of its peak season.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 (fitted Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a stable fall demand regime following its summer peak. The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Analyzed demand for the last 9 periods (P30-P38) shows a mean of 38.6 units. The most recent demand (P38: 42) and the short-term 3-period average (P36-P38: 33.7) suggest demand is holding steady around the 35-40 unit range. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'conclude' messages. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to a slight stockout in Period 38 (demand 42 vs. starting stock 39). To maintain service levels while accounting for the current stable but slightly variable fall demand, I will use a recent_N window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=9 captures the entirety of the post-September stabilization (P30 onwards) to provide a robust estimate of mean and variance for this season.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a stable 'Fall' demand regime. For the last 10 periods (P30-P39), demand has averaged 38.4 units per period across various fluctuations (range 27-52). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. As we are approaching late Q4, there is a possibility of a holiday uptick or further winter cooling, but the data does not yet show a significant new regime shift. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-summer stabilization (since Period 30) while excluding the much higher summer peaks that would inflate the forecast. This ensures the OR backend targets a safety stock appropriate for the current ~38 units/period baseline.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime confirmed (P30-P39): mean demand has stabilized at 38.4 units/period, consistent with spring baseline levels and roughly 66% lower than the summer peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is a basic T-shirt. Historically, demand has stabilized in a 'fall' regime since Period 30 (early September). The most recent demand in Period 40 was exceptionally low (10 units), which may be a random fluctuation or the start of a further pre-winter dip. However, the average demand for the stable fall regime (P30-P39) is 38.4 units. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which aligns the base stock closely with the mean demand over the look-ahead period (L+1). I will use a recent_N of 11 to capture the stabilized fall demand regime (P30-P40) while smoothing out the recent low outlier in P40. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game, so the default setting is appropriate.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a 'Fall/Early Winter' demand regime which has stabilized since Period 30. Recent demand (P40: 10, P41: 18) suggests a further cooling compared to the previous fall average of ~38. The mean demand of the last 12 periods (P30-P41) is approximately 32 units, but the most recent 3-period average (P39-P41) is 21.3 units, signaling a potential year-end decline or return to early baseline levels (~21). Given the current on-hand inventory of 18 units and the lower demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the most recent cooling (mean ~23) while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed throughout the history. The sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to reflect current low-demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand regime cooling further in late Nov; mean demand for P39-P41 dropped to 21.3 units/period, down from the early Fall average of ~38 (-44%).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are in a late fall/early winter period following a significant demand drop observed in November. Demand in P42 unexpectedly spiked to 33 after a low of 10-18 in the preceding periods, but the overall trend from P39-P42 (avg 24.25) remains much lower than the early Fall average (~38). The product is a fitted t-shirt, which typically sees lower demand in winter. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower late-year regime (P39-P42), while allowing for the slight volatility seen in P42. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 4 periods to reflect recent demand variance. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late Fall/Winter demand regime identified: Demand from P39 to P42 has averaged 24.3 units, a 37% decrease from the early Fall baseline of ~38.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the SKU (Fitted T-shirt) has shifted into a late-season/winter low regime. Demand from Period 39 to 43 was: 36, 10, 18, 33, 14. This averages to approximately 22.2 units per period, which aligns with the carry-over insight indicating a 37% decrease from the early Fall baseline of ~38. The most recent demand (P43) was 14. Given the date is Dec 9, we are in the heart of winter for this short-sleeve T-shirt, and demand is expected to remain at this lower baseline. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this late Fall/Winter regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which balances the recent variability (10 to 33 units) against the lower mean.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678342002 is in a late-year/winter demand regime. Since Period 40 (Nov 11), demand has significantly dropped, averaging 17.4 units per period (P40-P44: 10, 18, 33, 14, 12). This is a stark contrast to the earlier fall baseline of ~38 and the summer peak of ~112. The current date is Dec 16; historically, demand for t-shirts remains low during mid-winter. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this stabilized lower demand level. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the reduced volatility in this regime. On-hand inventory is 11, which aligns well with the current demand run-rate.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime stabilized (P40-P44): mean demand has reached a floor of approximately 17.4 units/period, down from the late Fall average of ~24. This reflects a total reduction of ~85% from the summer peak.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the week leading into Christmas. Historically, we are in a 'Winter' demand regime (P40-P45) with a mean demand of approximately 17.5 units. However, the last observed demand in P45 was 18, and looking back at the pre-game January data, demand ranged from 11-22 units. Given this is a fitted T-shirt (summer staple), demand is currently at its seasonal floor. The holding cost ($1) equals the profit ($1), requiring a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which mathematically translates to ordering the mean demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 6 (P40-P45) to capture the current stable winter baseline of ~17.5 units, which aligns with the earliest historical data and the cooling trend observed throughout Q4.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019 (Period 47). We are in a Winter demand regime (starting around Period 40), characterized by a significant drop from summer peaks to a baseline similar to the original pre-Feb demand. Demand in the last few periods (P43-P46) has been: 14, 12, 18, 6. This results in a recent mean (N=4) of 12.5 units/period. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. With on-hand inventory at 12 units and a very low recent demand of 6 units in Period 46, current stock is nearly sufficient for one period's demand, but setting parameters to cover the (L+1) window against the recent mean of ~12.5 is prudent. I will use recent_N (N=7 to cover the transition from late November) to stabilize the mu and sigma estimates for this final period.
