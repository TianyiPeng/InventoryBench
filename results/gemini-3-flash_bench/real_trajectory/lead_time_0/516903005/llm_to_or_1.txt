Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) with no on-hand or in-transit inventory. The product is a cotton-blend knit sweater ('Sally Structure TVP') from the 'Divided' collection. In February, demand for transition knitwear is typically stable but may experience a slight uptick as shoppers look for spring-ready layering pieces. Historically, the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) show a stable demand mean of approximately 17.8 units/week with low volatility (14 to 20 range). Given the promised lead time of 0, I will set parameters to cover the immediate demand of the current period. I'll use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting (mu_hat) to capture the most recent patterns (N=5) and 'default' for sigma to ensure adequate safety stock during startup. Lead time L is set to 'default' (0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a textured cotton-blend sweater. Historical demand from January to early February averaged 17.8 units/week. In Period 1, actual demand was 11 units. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmes a lead time of 0 (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). With on-hand inventory at 9 and no units in-transit, we need to order to meet expected demand. Given the item is a sweater and we are in mid-February, we should expect steady demand before a potential spring decline. I will use recent_N to capture the most recent demand behavior (N=6 includes the provided 5 samples plus Period 1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater (Divided Collection), typically catering to a younger demographic. Currently, we are in late February (Period 3). Historical samples (Jan-early Feb) showed stable demand around 14-20 units. However, Period 2 saw a significant demand spike to 31 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 20, ending inventory 0). This spike likely correlates with the transition into spring fashion or specific retail promotions. Since the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met (confirmed in Period 1 and 2 concludes), I will maintain L=0. To address the recent demand surge and prevent further lost sales (given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent upward trend including the stockout period, and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for increased volatility observed in the last two weeks.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a cotton-blend sweater, which remains relevant in early March. Historical demand samples (before the game) averaged 17.8 units. Game history shows higher volatility: P1 (11), P2 (31), and P3 (14), averaging 18.66. Period 2 saw a significant spike (31) causing a stockout. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (P1, P2, and P3 all arrived same-period). Given the stockout in P2 and the current on-hand of 15, I will use recent_N to capture the higher volatility seen in the game periods while maintaining the promised lead time. I'll set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 samples (P3, P2, P1, and the two most recent pre-game samples) to ensure we buffer against another spike like P2.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater (knitwear). Historically, demand for knitwear peaks in late winter and early spring. The observed historical demand samples (20, 14, 19, 18, 18) average 17.8. In-game demand (11, 31, 14, 16) shows one spike in Period 2 (31) and an average of 18.0. The date is early March (2019/3/11). Since lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period as ordered), I will maintain the default lead time. For mu_hat, considering the spike in Period 2 was likely an outlier or a temporary cold snap, I will use a recent window (N=4) of in-game data to calculate mean demand, which is (11+31+14+16)/4 = 18.0. Given L=0, (1+L)*18.0 = 18.0. For sigma_hat, the variance has increased due to the P2 spike, so recent_N = 4 will capture that higher volatility to maintain a safe service level and avoid the stockout experienced in Period 2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a textured cotton-blend sweater (SKU 516903005). Current date is March 18th, 2019. Observed demand has been: 11, 31, 14, 16, 19 across the first five periods. The demand spike in Period 2 (31 units) appears anomalous compared to the surrounding periods, but the mean demand over the last 5 periods is 18.2 units, which aligns closely with the long-term historical average of ~17.8 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met based on 'conclude' messages. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility while smoothing out the Period 2 outlier. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 0 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a textured cotton-blend sweater (Knitwear). Historically, demand was stable around 17-18 units in early 2019. However, in the last two periods (Period 6 and 7: Mar 18 and Mar 25), demand spiked significantly to 34 and 38 units, leading to 0 ending inventory and lost sales (stockouts). This is a clear demand regime shift, likely correlated with spring seasonality or a specific campaign for the 'Divided' collection. To address this, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this upward shift while still including some baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Mu_hat needs to reflect this higher volume to prevent further stockouts. I will use the mean of the last 3 samples (19, 34, 38) which is approx 30.33 per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 6 (Mar 18): average demand increased from ~17 to ~36 units (+100%), likely seasonal shift for the 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/04/08). The 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater is experiencing a significant demand increase starting around Period 6 (March 18), coinciding with early spring. Historical pre-shift demand (Periods 1-5 and pre-history) averaged ~17 units, while the recent 3-period regime (Periods 6-8) averaged 35.3 units (34, 38, 34). Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (5 units) and there is no in-transit stock. To maximize profit while managing holding costs (profit/holding ratio of 4:1 implies a target service level of 80%), I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this new demand regime for both \u03bc (mu_hat) and \u03c3 (sigma_hat). This enables the OR backend to set a higher base stock that covers the ~35 units per period expectation. I will keep L at 'default' since the 0-period lead time is performing as promised.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Sally Structure TVP' (a sweater) is experiencing a sustained higher demand regime starting from 2019-03-18 (Period 6). The last four periods (Periods 6-9) show demands of 34, 38, 34, and 36, which yields an average of 35.5 units per period. This confirms the previously noted 100% increase from the initial regime (avg ~17). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders in Period 1-9 arrived within the same period). Inventory levels are currently low (2 units on-hand), and since L=0, the system must order enough to cover the immediate period's demand. I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand spring regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand winter data.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a cotton-blend sweater. Historical data and recent activity confirm a demand regime shift that began around Period 6 (March 18). Before Period 6, demand averaged ~17.8 units. From Period 6 to Period 10, demand increased and stabilized at a higher level: 34, 38, 34, 36, 26 (mean ~33.6). The lower demand in Period 10 (26) is treated as a fluctuation rather than a reversal of the higher-demand trend, likely due to spring seasonality for this light knitwear item. Observation of concluding periods 1 through 10 confirms a consistent lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand periods. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been consistently 0.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (April 29). The product is a textured cotton-blend sweater. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Demand showed a significant regime shift starting in Period 6 (mid-March), increasing from an average of ~17 units to ~34 units. However, in the last two periods (Period 10 and 11), demand has dropped to 26 and 16 units respectively. This could signal a tapering off of the spring peak as we move into May. I will use a recent window (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the high-demand regime from Period 6 through 11 (averaging ~31 units) while starting to account for the recent cooling. Since lead time is consistently 0, the backend will treat L=0 as 'default'. This approach balances the stock-out risks seen in Periods 6 and 7 against the 22 units currently on hand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Historical data and recent demand confirm a seasonal regime shift that began in mid-March (Period 6). Pre-shift mean demand was ~17 units, while post-shift demand (Periods 6-12) has averaged 30.8 units (34, 38, 34, 36, 26, 16, 32). Although there was a slight dip in Periods 10 and 11, Period 12 saw a recovery to 32 units, suggesting the higher demand regime is relatively stable for this 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater during the spring season. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all 12 concluded observations. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this higher-demand regime while allowing for some variability. Lead time L will remain set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Sally Structure TVP' (a sweater) is currently in Period 14 (May 13). Demand history shows two distinct regimes: Period 1-5 averaged ~18 units, while Period 6-13 has fluctuated significantly with a mean around 29 units. However, recent weeks (P10-P13) have shown a decline in demand (26, 16, 32, 14), averaging ~22 units. This suggests the earlier spring peak may be tapering off as summer approaches. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), but the clear downward trend and high volatility (ranging from 14 to 38 in the second regime), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the duration of the second regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current variability while acknowledging the overall higher mean compared to the start of the game. This provides a safety buffer against stockouts while the OR backend optimizes for the high service level required by the unit economics.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/20. Examining the demand history, there was a significant regime shift starting in Period 6 (Mid-March), where demand increased from an average of ~17 to ~31 units. However, looking at the last 4 periods (Periods 11-14), demand has cooled significantly, averaging 19.75 units (16, 32, 14, 17) compared to the peak observed between Periods 6-10. This suggests the peak spring interest in this textured cotton-blend sweater might be tapering off as we move further into May. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently holding true across all 14 periods. To prevent overstocking during this cooling period while maintaining responsiveness, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the latest decelerating demand trend. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains 'default' since it is reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering detected following spring peak: Average demand decreased from ~34 (Periods 6-10) to ~20 (Periods 11-14).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater, which has shown clear seasonal behavior. Demand surged in March/April (averaging ~34 units) but has significantly tapered off in May as the weather warms. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 11-15), demand has averaged 19.8 units (16, 32, 14, 17, 20). Period 12 was an outlier (32), while most measurements are now consistently below 20. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this lower post-peak demand regime (approx 20 units/period). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the current volatility (std dev \u2248 7.3). This should prevent overstocking as we move further away from the spring peak.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 516903005 (Sally Structure TVP sweater) is currently in Period 17 (June 3). Historically, this item saw a spring peak in March/April (avg ~34) which has since declined. The carry-over insights correctly identified a tapering starting around Period 11. Demand for the most recent 6 periods (Periods 11-16) has been: 16, 32, 14, 17, 20, 13. This averages 18.6 units per period, which aligns with the pre-peak demand levels (~18). Given the June date, we expect stable or slightly lower demand as summer begins, compared to the spring peak. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this 'post-peak' regime's mean and volatility, ensuring an appropriate base stock to cover demand without exessive holding costs for this lower-demand period.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18 (June 10th), the demand for this 'textured cotton-blend knit' sweater continues to decline as we move into summer. Historical demand has fallen significantly from the spring peak (~34 units) to a recent average of approximately 14.8 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 13-17: 14, 17, 20, 13, 10). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs ($1.0/unit) on a low-margin item ($4.0/unit profit), I am adjusting the demand forecast to reflect this lower mid-summer regime. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the most recent downward trend while maintaining enough sensitivity to variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Spring peak subsided; demand from Period 13 (May 6) onwards has stabilized at a lower average of ~15 units/period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical data for the 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater shows a clear seasonality: an initial stable period (Feb-mid Mar), a significant spring peak (mid Mar-mid May) averaging ~30-36 units, and a recent stabilization at a lower baseline (mid May-present) averaging ~15 units. In Period 18, demand spiked unexpectedly to 23, causing a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time has remained consistently at 0. To prevent stockouts during this stabilized but slightly volatile summer phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (Period 13-18), which covers the low-demand regime after the spring peak. This provides a mu_forecast of ~16.2 units and captures the recent volatility (N=6).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a textured cotton-blend sweater. Historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high-demand period in March/April (avg ~34 units) followed by a significant decline as summer approaches. We are currently in a low-demand regime that began around Period 13 (May 6). Since Period 13, demand has averaged 14.4 units per period (14, 17, 20, 13, 10, 23, 4). The recent demand in Period 19 was particularly low (4 units). Given it is late June, demand for sweaters is expected to remain low or continue to taper. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (since the regime shift stabilized) to capture this lower average. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory currently stands at 17 units on-hand, which is sufficient for one period given the recent average; however, the OR backend needs updated parameters to manage the safety stock level appropriately for this low-demand phase without over-ordering.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is July 1st. Historically, this 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater saw a significant demand peak in late March through April (averaging ~34 units). Since mid-May (Period 13), demand has stabilized at a much lower level. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P13-P20) show demand of 14, 17, 20, 13, 10, 23, 4, and 5. The most recent two periods (4 and 5 units) suggest a further mid-summer decline as temperatures rise, which is typical for a knitwear/sweater category. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the stabilized post-peak regime (average ~13.25), and sigma_hat with recent_N=8 to capture current volatility. This will prevent overstocking during the summer trough while maintaining a sufficient base stock for typical variations. On-hand remains 15, which covers approximately 1 period of recent average demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough confirmed: Late June demands (P19-20) dropped to <10 units per period, consistent with summer seasonality for knitwear.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a cotton-blend sweater, currently in early July (Period 22), which is the peak of summer. Demand for knitwear typically reaches its annual minimum during this time. Consistent with this, recent demand (Periods 19-21) has dropped significantly to 4, 5, and 12 respectively (average ~7). This follows a spring peak where demand was closer to 30. The carry-over insights correctly identified this shift. Promised lead time is 0, and historical observations confirm actual lead time remains 0. With an on-hand inventory of 7 and expected demand low, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the summer trough. This conservative approach balances the risk of stockouts during minor demand fluctuations against the high holding cost of excess inventory for a seasonal item moving out of its primary sales window.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, peak summer. The product is a 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater, which has shown low demand (under 13 units) between Period 19 and 21, but saw a sudden spike to 21 units in Period 22. This spike resulted in 0 ending inventory, likely losing 10 units of potential sales (demand 21 vs. starting on-hand 11). While the general summer trend for knitwear is low, this recent spike suggests a localized fluctuation or early clearance interest. Demand from Period 19 to 22 has averaged (4+5+12+21)/4 = 10.5. Given Profit=$4 and HoldingCost=$1, the target service level q is 4/(4+1) = 0.80. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this minor volatility increase and the higher demand from Period 22 without over-reacting to it as a full-scale regime shift.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a cotton-blend sweater, which is in its seasonal demand trough during the summer months. Recent demand for Periods 19-23 has been 4, 5, 12, 21, and 13 respectively. While there was a slight uptick to 21 in Period 22, the overall average since the start of July (P21-P23) is approximately 15.3 units. Given that we are in deep summer, demand is expected to remain relatively low and volatile. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current stabilization around 11-15 units, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility (ranging from 4 to 21). This allows the OR engine to maintain a lean inventory appropriate for the low summer season while providing enough safety stock (z* for a 80% service level) to cover the observed variance.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a textured cotton-blend sweater. We are in the middle of summer, which is typically a low-demand period for knitwear, though we observed a small spike in Period 22 (21 units). Since Period 18, the demand has been volatile but generally low, averaging approximately 11.4 units per period (P19-P24 demand: 4, 5, 12, 21, 13, 5). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time has consistently been 0. Given the high stock-out cost relative to holding cost (4:1 ratio), I will aim for a base stock levels that slightly buffer against the recent volatility (the 21 and 13 unit spikes), while acknowledging the overall summer trough. Using N=7 for mu_hat captures the recent regime including the late-June/July fluctuations.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering Period 26 (August 5). Historically, demand for this knitwear product (SKU 516903005) has shown significant seasonality: a spring peak (~34 units), a late spring/early summer stabilization (~15-20 units), and a mid-summer trough (P19-P21 demand was < 10 avg). However, the most recent four periods (P22-P25) show demand of 21, 13, 5, and 19 (average 14.5). August typically marks the beginning of the 'Back to School' or 'Pre-Fall' transition in retail, where interest in knitwear starts to recover from the summer low. Given the recent average of ~15 units and the expected seasonal uptick, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the most recent activity while remaining lean. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Early August transition: Demand is recovering from summer lows, averaging ~15 units over the last 4 periods (P22-P25).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/12. We are observing the start of late-summer/early-autumn demand for this knitwear product ('Sally Structure TVP' sweater). Period 26 experienced a significant demand spike to 36 units, causing a stockout. This mimics the spring peak observed around Week 6. Historical context shows demand usually rises as the transition to cooler months begins (August). The last 5 periods (P22-P26) have demand values: 21, 13, 5, 19, 36. Mean of these 5 periods is 18.8. Given the strong upward trend and the stockout in P26, I will set N=5 to capture this recent recovery while acknowledging the volatile start of the new regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer/Early Autumn transition confirmed: Period 26 demand (36 units) mimics spring peak onset, indicating seasonal recovery for knitwear after summer lows.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Sally Structure TVP' (knitwear sweater) is experiencing a powerful late-summer/early-autumn seasonal rebound. Period 27 demand surged to 67 units, following a significant jump to 36 units in Period 26. This confirms the seasonal transition noted in the carry-over insights and aligns with typical retail patterns for knitwear as autumn approaches. Actual lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-growth phase, I am selecting an 'explicit' mu_hat of 65.0, reflecting the current demand momentum rather than historical averages which include summer lows. Sigma_hat is also set explicitly to 25.0 to provide a safety buffer against the high volatility observed during regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn seasonal ramp confirmed: Demand increased from summer lows (~15) to 36 (P26) and 67 (P27), indicating a rapid 4x increase in volume within 2 weeks.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater has surged significantly as we enter the autumn season. Demand over the last three periods has jumped from ~15 to 36, 67, and 68 units respectively, confirming a new high-demand regime. Current data from Period 27 and 28 suggests demand has stabilized at this higher level (avg ~67.5). Given the product is knitwear and the date is late August, this trend is expected to persist or increase further. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am shifting mu_hat to reflect this recent high-volume regime using recent_N=3 (encompassing P26-P28). This allows the OR engine to set a base stock that covers the ~68-unit demand expectation plus a safety buffer for the high volatility (sigma_hat) observed during this rapid transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime confirmed: Demand stabilized at ~67 units/period for P27-P28, a 4.5x increase over summer averages.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a cotton-blend knit sweater, which is entering its peak autumn season. Demand has fundamentally shifted from a summer low of ~15 units to a high-demand regime starting Period 27. The last three periods (P27, P28, P29) show demands of 67, 68, and 59 respectively, averaging approximately 64.6 units. This is a 4x increase over the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-growth seasonal phase, I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this recent average (64.6) adjusted for a (1+L) factor, and use a recent N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility of this peak period without being skewed by the much lower summer variance.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater has entered a high-intensity phase, with a massive spike to 145 units in Period 30 (Sep 2). This coincides with peak autumn back-to-school/seasonal shifts for knitwear. Recent demand (P27-P30) has averaged approximately 85 units, but the sudden jump from ~60 to 145 suggests that the previous 'high-demand regime' of 60-70 units is being superseded by an even stronger peak. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this transition. While the single observation of 145 is high, basing decisions on the last 4 periods balances the pre-spike stability (avg ~65) with the current surge. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified at Period 30: Demand jumped 2.4x from 59 to 145 units, indicating a move from the initial autumn ramp-up to a primary seasonal peak.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516903005' (knitwear jumper) is in a primary autumn peak. Demand significantly increased from ~60 units in August to ~150 units in early September (P30: 145, P31: 152). Recent demand has consistently exceeded available stock, leading to lost sales. We are now in mid-September (P32), which corresponds to high seasonal demand for knitwear. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the sharp acceleration and the fact that we sold out our entire arrival in Period 31, I will use recent_N with N=2 to capture the current high-demand regime (~148.5 units/period) while maintaining enough volatility coverage for this peak. Setting L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified further at Period 31: Demand remained high at 152 units (following 145 units in P30), confirming a stable peak regime of ~150 units per period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater has entered an even higher intensity peak. Period 32 (Sept 16) recorded a demand of 193 units, following 152 and 145 units in the preceding weeks. This indicates that as we move deeper into autumn, the demand is still accelerating. The average of the last three periods (P30-P32) is approximately 163 units. Since we sold out every unit available (ending on-hand is 0) and the inventory at the start of Period 33 is 0, we must aggressively increase the stock level to capture this seasonal peak and avoid stockouts. I will use the last 3 samples to capture this most recent intensification of the autumn peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensification: Demand increased to 193 in P32, raising the 3-period average to ~163 units, confirming a steeper seasonal incline than previously estimated.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516903005' is a knitwear sweater entering its peak autumn/winter season. Period 33 demand spiked dramatically to 594 units, far exceeding the recent 'intensified peak' average of ~150-160 units. This is likely a major seasonal event or promotions-driven surge characteristic of late September in fashion retail. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid massive stockouts while managing the risk of this being a one-week extreme outlier, I will use an explicit mu_hat. I am forecasting Period 34 demand at 400 units\u2014a balance between the previous ~160 level and the 594 peak\u2014to ensure high service levels during this surge. I will set sigma_hat explicitly high (100) to account for the extreme volatility observed in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Major seasonal demand surge confirmed at Period 33 (Sept 23): Demand reached 594 units, a 3x increase over the previous 'peak' level (~190) and a 30x increase over summer lows, indicating extreme volatility in early autumn knitwear demand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Sally Structure TVP' (a knitwear sweater) is experiencing extreme seasonal volatility as we enter October. Period 33 saw a massive demand surge to 594 units, but Period 34 dropped back significantly to 147 units. This suggests the extreme spike in P33 may have been a localized peak or a specific promotional event rather than a new sustained floor of 600+ units. However, demand remains significantly higher than late summer levels. The current on-hand inventory of 338 units is roughly double the demand of the last period (147). Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the average since the intensification began (averaging P31-P34: (152+193+594+147)/4 = 271.5). This protects against the extreme upside seen in P33 while acknowledging the drop in P34. I will use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat as well to account for this heightened volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in late September: P33 peaked at 594 followed by a sharp drop to 147 in P34, indicating a high-variance autumn peak regime rather than a stable trend.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater, which is currently in its peak autumn season (October). Demand in the last six periods has been extremely volatile: 145, 152, 193, 594, 147, and 164. The extreme outlier of 594 (Period 33) suggests a massive one-time spike, while the other five periods suggest a stabilized peak regime around ~160 units (mean of P30-P35 excluding the outlier is 160.4). Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, the target service level is 80%. I am holding 290 units on-hand, which is significantly higher than the most recent demand (164). Since the lead time is consistently 0, the backend will target a base stock level. I will use the recent N=6 periods (including the spike) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we account for the high variance observed in recent weeks without over-ordering based solely on the massive P33 outlier, as the current inventory already provides a substantial buffer.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'textured cotton-blend knit' sweater, currently in its peak autumn/winter season (mid-October). After the massive demand spike in Period 33 (594 units), demand has stabilized significantly over the last three periods (P34-P36) at 147, 164, and 116 units respectively. This suggests the 594 was likely a localized peak or outlier within the seasonal ramp, and we are now in a high-sustained regime. The current average demand over the last three periods is approximately 142 units. With lead time L=0 and 267 units on hand, the inventory position is relatively healthy. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect this stabilized post-surge regime while maintaining a responsive sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in this specific product category during the autumn transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike stabilization: Demand has stabilized over Periods 34-36 at an average of ~142 units after the isolated Period 33 surge (594).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 516903005 (Knitwear Sweater) is currently in its peak autumn/winter season. Following the extreme demand spike in Period 33 (594 units), the regime has stabilized into a high-volume, high-variance pattern. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has been 147, 164, 116, and 166, resulting in an average of approximately 148 units per period. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently sufficient (101 on-hand) due to previous large orders, but new stock is needed to maintain the base stock level for the current regime. I am setting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this post-spike stabilization level (~148), and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods to reflect the current regime's volatility, which is significantly higher than the summer or early spring levels. This ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio while accounting for recent stabilization.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the post-peak autumn period for 'Sally Structure TVP' sweaters. Historical demand shows a significant surge in September (Period 33 hit 594), but it has since stabilized into a high-volume autumn regime. Recent demand from Period 34 to 38 reads: 147, 164, 116, 166, 139. The average of these last 5 periods is approximately 146.4 units. Although the 'spike' period (P33) significantly inflates the long-term mean and variance, the recent 5-period window provides a more accurate representation of the current 'steady-state' autumn demand before potential pre-holiday shifts. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized volume (~146 units/period) while ignoring the 594 outlier. Lead time remains stably at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand stabilization confirmed: Period 34-38 demand averaged 146 units after the extreme Period 33 outlier (594).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is November 11, 2019. Demand for the 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater has entered a high-demand late autumn/pre-winter regime. While there was a singular massive spike in Period 33 (594 units), the regime has since stabilized around 140-150 units. However, Period 39 showed a significant drop to 73 units. I will prioritize recent history (Periods 34-39) to set parameters, excluding the anomalous Period 33 spike. The average demand across these last 6 periods is approximately 141 units. I'll use recent_N (N=6) to track the current stabilized level through the recent dip while maintaining sufficient stock for the expected November/December seasonal volume. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter stabilization: Following the massive Period 33 spike, demand from Period 34 to 39 has averaged 141 units, with high variance (range 73 to 166).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 516903005 (cotton-blend sweater) is currently in its peak autumn/winter demand season. Since the massive outlier in Period 33 (594 units), demand has stabilized into a high-volume but volatile regime. Over the most recent 7 periods (P34-P40), demand has averaged approximately 126 units (147, 164, 116, 166, 139, 73, 83), though the last two weeks show a softening (73, 83). Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures this post-spike stabilization period while reflecting the higher seasonal volume compared to summer. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to account for the high variance observed during this plateau. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the immediate demand plus a safety buffer, which is appropriate given the product's $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (target service level ~80%).

Carry-over insight: Demand post-spike (P34-P40) has averaged 126 units, showing a stabilization after the Period 33 extreme outlier, but with a recent downward trend in the last two weeks (sub-100 units).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/25. We are in the post-autumn peak period for this textured cotton-blend sweater. Historical demand review shows a clear stabilization and gradual decline after the massive Period 33 spike (594 units). Over the last five periods (P37-P41), demand has been 166, 139, 73, 83, and 74, averaging approximately 107 units per period. However, the last three weeks show a tighter cluster around 73-83 units (avg 77). Carrying 85 units on-hand into Period 42 with a 0-period lead time means the 'pipeline' is almost perfectly matched to this recent 3-week average. Since the item is knitwear and we are approaching the end of the year (P42 of 47), demand may stay relatively flat or begin a late-season taper. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend, which averages 107 units, providing a safe buffer above the most recent sub-80 unit weeks while accounting for the ongoing volatility (std deviation remains significant). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-autumn peak (P37-P41) has entered a lower, stable regime averaging ~107 units, with the most recent three weeks (P39-P41) showing a further softening to ~77 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516903005' (textured cotton-blend jumper) is showing a clear seasonal decline as winter progresses. Following the massive Period 33 peak and the subsequent 'high autumn' plateau of ~140 units, demand has consistently dropped over the last four weeks: Period 39 (73), Period 40 (83), Period 41 (74), and most significantly Period 42 (39). This suggests the secondary seasonal peak (likely autumn/back-to-school) has ended, and we are entering a lower winter regime. On-hand inventory is currently high (105 units), which already covers nearly three weeks of the most recent demand level. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining market, I am reducing mu_hat and sigma_hat using a short 4-period lookback (N=4) to capture the recent downward trend (P39-P42 average is ~67 units). The actual lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Autumn/Winter peak has subsided; recent 4-week demand (P39-P42) has dropped to an average of 67 units (-50% from the P34-P38 average of 146).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater is clearly declining as we head deeper into December (Period 44). The latest weekly demand figures are 83, 74, 39, and 23 units, confirming a significant downward trend post-autumn peak. The current on-hand inventory is 82 units, which already covers more than 3 weeks of the most recent demand level (23 units). Since lead time is consistently 0, I want to avoid overstocking and incurring holding costs ($1.0/unit) on a product with a relatively low profit margin ($4.0/unit). I will use a conservative demand estimate based on the last 3 periods (average ~45 units) to target a lower base stock while the product enters its late-season phase. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) allows the model to react quickly to this softening demand while maintaining a small buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline intensified at Period 43: Last 3 weeks (P41-P43) average demand is 45 units, down significantly from the P37-P41 average of 107.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 516903005 (textured cotton-blend sweater) is currently in a late-season demand decline as we approach the end of the year (Dec 16). Historical data shows demand has dropped significantly over the last few weeks: P42 (39 units), P43 (23 units), and P44 (11 units). The 3-period average is now ~24 units, and the most recent demand is only 11 units. With 71 units on-hand and a promised lead time of 0, our physical inventory is already sufficient to cover approximately six weeks of current demand levels. To maximize profit and minimize holding costs for this seasonal item at the end of its cycle, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect this rapid cooling, while keeping sigma_hat capped and lead time at default. This conservative approach prevents over-ordering as demand likely winds down further toward the year-end transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline intensified: P44 demand (11 units) marks a significant drop for the late-season period; the 3-week average (P42-P44) has fallen below 25 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516903005' (textured knit jumper) is entering Period 46 (Dec 23). Historical demand analysis shows a significant late-December seasonal spike: Period 45 demand suddenly jumped to 156 units after a steady decline from the autumn peak (which had fallen to ~11 units in P44). This spike is consistent with pre-Christmas shopping and clearing. For Period 46 (Dec 23), demand is expected to remain high or stabilize momentarily before the post-Christmas drop. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after the P45 surge. Although the autumn trend was downward, the recent P45 data (156 units) requires a responsive forecast to capture the remaining holiday/event demand. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this sudden reversal (average of P43-P45 is ~63) and explicit sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed (ranging from 11 to 156 in three weeks). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Severe holiday demand spike confirmed at Period 45 (Dec 16); demand increased from 11 to 156 units (14x increase), reversing the 5-week downward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $524.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits massive holiday volatility. Period 45 (Dec 16) saw a 14x demand spike to 156 units, followed by 145 units in Period 46 (Dec 23), confirming a holiday peak regime. Current on-hand is 0. Period 47 (Dec 30) is the post-Christmas/New Year transition week. Historically, after large spikes (like the Period 33 surge), demand often stabilizes or tapers but rarely drops back to zero immediately. Given the 'Knitwear' category, demand should remain significant through winter. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 2 peak periods (~150) to ensure we have enough stock to meet immediate demand while acknowledging that the absolute peak may have passed. Sigma remains high due to the recent extreme variance. Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed (P45-P46): Demand spiked to an average of ~150 units/period, up from the previous 3-week average of 25 units.
