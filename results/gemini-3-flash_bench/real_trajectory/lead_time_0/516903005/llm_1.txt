  "rationale": "Product 516903005 is a 'Sally Structure TVP' textured cotton-blend knit jumper from the Divided Collection. Given the current date is February 11th, we are in the late winter/early spring transition, a period where light knitwear typically sees stable demand. Historical data for the past five weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a consistent demand range between 14 and 20 units, with a mean of 17.8 and a median of 18. Since we start with 0 On-hand and 0 In-transit, I need to order enough to cover Period 1 demand. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available for this period's demand (Resolution Phase). Aiming for the upper end of the historical range (20) plus a small safety buffer for initial stock-out prevention (Total 22) to account for potential slight variability at the start of the season.",

Given the date (February 18), we are in the late winter/early spring transition, a season where demand for mid-weight knitwear typically remains stable or slightly declines before spring. Historical demand data from early 2019 (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a range of 14-20 units, with an average of approximately 17.8 units per week. In Period 1 (Feb 11), demand was 11 units, which is lower than the January average but aligns with a potential seasonal softening or natural variance. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on the Period 1 conclusion (ordered 22, arrived 22 in the same period). Current on-hand inventory is 11. To satisfy expected demand for Period 2 (forecasted at roughly 17-18 units based on historical averages) and maintain a small buffer for Period 3, I need to replenish. Target inventory for the start of Period 2 (after arrival) should be approximately 30-35 units to safely cover current demand (~18) and leave enough for next period's start (~12-17). Since lead time is 0, an order placed now will arrive immediately to satisfy Period 2 customer demand. I will order 24 units: (11 on-hand + 24 order = 35 total available).

However, the last observed period (P2: 2019-02-18) showed a significant spike to 31 units. This might be due to a promotion, weather change, or early Spring fashion trends. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (P1 and P2 orders both arrived within the same period). Current inventory is low at 4 units. For Period 3 (2019-02-25), I will forecast demand slightly higher than the historical mean but more conservative than the P2 spike to avoid overstocking expensive jumpers ($1 holding cost).

Lead time analysis: P1, P2, and P3 orders all arrived in 0 periods (same-period arrival), confirming lead_time=0. Starting Period 4, on-hand inventory is 16. With lead_time=0, the order placed now will arrive before the Period 4 demand resolution. Total on-hand after arrival needs to cover P4 demand. To minimize holding costs ($1.0) while capturing profit ($4.0), I aim for a target inventory of roughly 25 units (mean 18-20 + small safety stock for the spike seen in P2).

However, Period 6 (March 18th) saw a significant demand spike to 34 units, which resulted in a stockout (sold 25, ending inventory 0). This suggests either a seasonal spring cleaning/refresh peak or a promotional event. With a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, the order placed in Period 7 arrives and is available for Period 7's demand. I need to cover the current period's demand (N). Given the P6 spike to 34, I will forecast Period 7 demand to be closer to that high level (approx 30-35) to avoid another stockout, especially since the profit margin ($4) is much higher than the holding cost ($1).

Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the demand is trending upward (last two periods averaged 36, with stockouts potentially masking even higher latent demand), I will target a stock level of 45 to cover the current upward momentum and provide a small safety buffer against further spikes.

Historical demand shows a massive surge starting late August, intensifying in early September (Period 30: 145, Period 31: 152). We are currently in mid-September (Period 32), which corresponds to the peak 'back-to-school' and autumn transition for sweaters. Demand has exceeded current inventory for the last two periods (sold out at 70 and 140 units), indicating the true demand is at least 152. Given the trend (59 -> 145 -> 152), demand seems to be plateauing at a high level. Since lead time is 0, I will order enough to cover the expected high demand for this period plus a safety buffer.

Reviewing the September trajectory (P30: 145, P31: 152, P32: 193), the current baseline appears to be roughly 150-200 units per week. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. We currently have 478 units on hand, which is enough to cover over 2-3 weeks of 'normal' autumn demand (150-200 range).

History from January 2019 shows demand starting at ~20 units. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Inventory is currently 0. I will order approximately 50 units to cover potential post-holiday demand while avoiding high holding costs ($1/unit) if demand reverts back to seasonal lows (10-20 units) in January.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand spike confirmed in Period 45 (156 units) despite the established 'Winter Low' regime; demand in late December is highly volatile due to calendar events.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU '516903005' is a textured cotton-blend sweater. Historical data shows two major seasonal peaks: a spring peak (~35-38 units) and a massive autumn peak (reaching 500+ units, stabilizing at ~150). We are currently in the late December/early January window. Period 45 (Dec 16) and Period 46 (Dec 23) showed significant holiday spikes of 156 and 145 units respectively, likely due to pre-Christmas and Christmas week shopping for winter apparel. Period 47 (Dec 30) is the week between Christmas and New Year. Traditionally, this period sees a cooling off from the peak holiday rush but often remains elevated due to post-holiday sales and colder weather. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Given that we ran out of stock in the last two periods and demand was ~145-156, I expect demand for Period 47 to remain high but potentially lower than the absolute holiday peak as consumers recalibrate post-Christmas. I will target a stock level of 100 units to capture remaining seasonal demand while minimizing the risk of high holding costs as we enter the 'Winter Low' regime observed in previous years (where demand dropped to ~10-15 units).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand spike (Periods 45-46) confirmed: demand averaged 150.5 units (+500% over the late-November baseline), driven by late-December calendar events and winter seasonality.",
