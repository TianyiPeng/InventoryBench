This suggests a post-holiday/early-year clearance or seasonal transition. The current date is 2019-02-11 (Period 1). Promoted lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With the recent demand flattening at 81 units, I need to stock enough for Period 1. I will forecast demand for P1 at approximately 80 units. To ensure availability while acknowledging the downward trend, I will order 85 units to cover this period and leave a small buffer, as I can reorder instantly in Period 2 if lead time holds at 0.",

Looking at the historical trend (256, 241, 112, 112, 81), there is a clear downward trend moving from January into February, likely settling into a post-holiday/early spring baseline. Since the most recent demand points (Feb 4th and Feb 11th) are 81 and 82 respectively, I will forecast Period 2 demand at approximately 82 units. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 (order placed in Period 1 arrived immediately). Inventory standing is 3 on-hand.

The drop to 60 in P9 suggests that the 'rebound' might be volatile rather than a stable shift to a 90+ regime. Lead time analysis: Historical data from Periods 1-9 consistently shows a 0-period lead time (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Inventory status: Currently have 35 units on hand. Forecasting for P10: Given the volatility (83, 90, 60), I will forecast a demand of approximately 75 units (mid-range). Ordering strategy: Since holding cost ($1) is high relative to profit ($4), I prefer lean inventory. I need 75 units to cover P10 demand. With 35 on-hand, an order of 40 units should satisfy demand while minimizing risk of excess holding cost if demand remains at the lower end of the recent range.

After a significant demand surge from late August to early September (peaking at 189 units in P29), demand has started to moderate: P30 was 176 and P31 was 141. Historically, in January (the post-holiday peak), demand was in the 240-250 range but quickly dropped to around 112 then 81 by February. We are seeing a similar cooling pattern now that we are mid-September. The average demand over the last three periods is 168.7 units, but the most recent figure (141) indicates a significant week-over-week decline (-20%). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. We currently have 79 units on-hand. Considering the cooling trend and the high holding cost ($1/unit) relative to profit ($4/unit), a conservative target inventory of roughly 140-150 units is appropriate to cover current demand while minimizing stock-out risk without over-holding.
