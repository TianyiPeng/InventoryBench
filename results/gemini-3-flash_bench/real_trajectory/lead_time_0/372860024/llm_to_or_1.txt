Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is 'Basic 7p Shaftless Socks'. Historical demand samples from January through early February (28, 38, 34, 44, 41) show an upward trend, with the last two weeks averaging 42.5 units. Given this is basic hosiery but in February, we should prepare for a stable or slightly increasing demand. Promised lead time is 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent higher levels while smoothing the variance. L is set to 'default' (0 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a basic staple. In Period 1, we ordered 48 units and 48 arrived immediately (lead_time 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods is currently accurate. Demand in Period 1 was 43. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are [28, 38, 34, 44, 41]. The average demand is 38.0 and the standard deviation is 6.12. Period 1's demand (43) is consistent with this range. Since there is no strong evidence of a regime shift or upcoming seasonal peak yet, I will use recent_N for both mean and volatility based on the available history (N=6, including Period 1's demand).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, and we are managing fine-knit trainer socks. Historically, demand has increased from a mean of 37.6 (Jan) to 43 (P1) and 66 (P2), suggesting a rising trend or a shift in regime as we approach spring. Period 2 saw a stockout where we sold all 49 available units against a demand of 66. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is 0 (arrivals in P1 and P2 both occurred within the same period). To avoid stockouts while reacting to the recent demand surge, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat (N=3) to weigh the most recent high-demand periods (P2: 66, P1: 43, Jan 28: 44) more heavily. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to capture the increased volatility (std of 66, 43, 44 is approx 13). This allows the OR backend to set a higher base stock (targeting ~73 units) to cover demand until the next decision cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1067.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic women's trainer socks item. Historically, lead time has been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Current demand (measured over the last 5 samples including historically provided data) shows a rising trend: 28, 38, 34, 44, 41, 43, 66, and 57. The average over the last 3 periods (since P1) is 55.3, compared to the prehistoric average of ~37. This suggests a demand regime shift upwards as we move into March (spring seasonality for trainer socks). Currently, there is 16 on-hand and 0 in-transit. I will use a recent_N strategy for both lead time (N=3) to confirm the 0-day lead time continues, and mu_hat (N=3) to focus on the higher recent demand levels (avg ~55). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher volume and prevents stockouts like the one seen in Period 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 18 (Period 2): Average demand increased from ~37 to ~55 following the transition into late February/early March, likely due to spring seasonality for trainer socks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $805.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5 (2019/03/11), we are observing trainer socks during the spring transition. Historical demand samples (late Jan to early Feb) averaged 37.8 units, while the recent 4 periods of active gameplay (Feb 11 - Mar 4) have averaged 52.5 units, confirming a sustained higher demand regime. The most recent demand was 44, down from previous spikes of 66 and 57, but still significantly higher than the January baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use N=4 for mu_hat to capture this higher spring demand level (avg 52.5) while allowing the OR engine to adjust for the recent slight cooling. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the higher volatility (range 43-66) seen in the current regime compared to the steady growth in the pre-game samples.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th (Period 6). Inventory on-hand is 28 units. Historically, the 'Fine-knit trainer socks' showed a demand spike in late February (Period 2: 66, Period 3: 57), but the most recent two periods (Period 4: 44, Period 5: 43) have moderated back towards the earlier levels (28-44 range). The previous carry-over insight suggesting a sustained shift to a mean of 55 appears premature, as the last two weeks suggest a mean closer to 44. Since trainer socks are highly seasonal for spring, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the elevated post-February average while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~52.5 (mu_hat) while the Profit ($19) vs Holding Cost ($1) ratio drives a high service level (~95%).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. We are managing trainer socks, which are entering peak spring seasonality. Last period (Period 6) saw a significant demand spike to 73 units, exhausting all on-hand inventory and resulting in lost sales. Historical demand analysis shows two regimes: the initial pre-February mean (~37) and the recent February-March period where demand has fluctuated but averaged significantly higher (~55), culminating in the recent 73. Given we are currently at 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we must order aggressively to cover current demand and replenish safety stock. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher late-Feb/March levels (avg ~56.6), and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (std ~12.5), ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level for this high-profit/low-holding-cost item.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased as we enter peak spring season (Period 6 demand = 73 vs Period 5 demand = 43). Stockouts occurred in Period 6, suggesting that targeting recent higher mean and variance is necessary to maintain service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1501.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8 (April 1st). The SKU (trainer socks) is entering peak spring demand. Analysis of recent demand shows a significant upward trend: Period 6 demand was 73 and Period 7 demand spiked to 98, both resulting in stockouts (ending inventory = 0). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this high-demand phase, I am utilizing the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3. This focuses on the Period 5-7 window (avg demand \u2248 71.3) rather than the long-term average, which is now too low. By capturing the recent surge and increased volatility, the OR backend will set a higher base stock to accommodate the spring seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed for April peak: Period 7 demand (98) represents a ~100% increase over early February levels. Stockouts in 2 consecutive periods (P6, P7) indicate current inventory levels are insufficient for spring seasonality.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which shows strong spring seasonality. Historical demand has accelerated from ~40-50 units in February to peaks of 73-98 in late March. Period 8 demand was 72. With on-hand inventory at 45 and a promised lead time of 0 periods, we need to ensure the base stock covers current high-demand levels to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 6 and 7. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (ordered and arrived in the same period). To capture the recent seasonal peak and volatility, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for both demand mean and sigma. I'll set N=4 to include the peak demand periods (P5-P8: 43, 73, 98, 72), which reflects the current late-spring demand regime better than the long-term average.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. This is the peak season for 'fine-knit trainer socks' as the weather warms. Historical demand analysis shows a significant shift starting around Period 6 (Mid-March), with demand peaking at 98 units in Period 7 and stabilizing recently at 72 and 69 units (Periods 8 and 9). The average demand over the last four periods (P6-P9) is 78 units, compared to the early season average of ~45. Multiple stockouts (Periods 2, 6, 7) confirm that the system was previously under-ordering. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and reaction. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this sustained high-demand spring regime while filtering out the much lower early-February data. This ensures the OR backend targets the higher service level required for this high-profit ($19) vs. low-cost ($1) SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level for the April peak: Period 6-9 average demand is 78 units, a ~73% increase over the initial Period 1-5 average of 45 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860024' (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in its peak spring season (late April). Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift occurring around Period 6 (mid-March), coinciding with warming weather. The demand average for the first 5 periods was ~46.6 units, while the average for the most recent 5 periods (Periods 6-10) has risen to ~78 units. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods, as every order placed has arrived within the same period. For Period 11, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture this higher demand regime and the associated volatility (std dev ~11.5) to prevent the recurring stockouts observed in Periods 6 and 7. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the current high-demand trend while accounting for recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at peak levels (Avg ~78 units/period) for the month of April (Periods 6-10), significantly higher than February/early March levels (~47 units/period).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), we are in the peak spring/early summer season for trainer socks. Demand in Period 11 spiked to 116 units, causing a stockout because the starting inventory (on-hand + current arrival = 98) was insufficient. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Looking at the recent high-demand regime from Period 7 to 11 (the last 5 periods), the average demand is (98+72+69+78+116)/5 = 86.6. Given the upward trend and the recent spike, I will set mu_hat using a recent window of N=5 to capture this shift. Sigma_hat is also set to N=5 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this peak season. The OR backend will use these values to compute a base stock level that targets a high service level (Profit=$19, Holding=$1), which is crucial given the recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late April: Period 11 demand reached 116 units, exceeding the previous April average of ~78 units. The seasonal peak for trainer socks appears more volatile and higher than initially estimated.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), we are in the peak spring/early summer season for trainer socks. Based on recent history, demand entered a higher regime starting around Period 6 (late March), with Period 11 and 12 seeing significant levels of 116 and 102 units respectively. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is approximately 87.4 units, which is significantly higher than the overall average. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand seasonal window, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this sustained higher mean, and use the same N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in April/May.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level during the peak spring transition: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 87.4 units, confirming a shift from the earlier April average of ~78.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Fine-knit trainer socks' has shown strong seasonality through spring, peaking in late April (Period 11 demand of 116). We are now in mid-May (Period 14). Demand in Period 13 dropped to 61 units from 102 in Period 12, suggesting we might be moving past the primary spring peak. However, average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 85.2, which is significantly higher than the early-season average. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To manage the current transition while protecting against the still-high demand volatility, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and sigma. This captures the most recent peak-and-post-peak behavior (P9: 69, P10: 78, P11: 116, P12: 102, P13: 61). This N=5 window provides a more responsive forecast to the recent drop than the full history, while still acknowledging the elevated levels compared to February.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high post-April peak: Period 13 demand (61) showed a significant drop from Period 12 (102), indicating a potential cooling of spring seasonality.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is May 20, 2019 (Period 15). We are exiting the spring peak season for fine-knit trainer socks. Historical demand for the last few periods (P11-P14) has been 116, 102, 61, and 74, showing a downward but volatile trend as we transition into summer. The average demand for the last 4 periods is 88.25, while the last 2 periods (May) average 67.5. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently confirm an actual lead time of 0. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level (approx. 95th percentile). I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent post-peak demand levels, as using a longer window (N=10) would significantly overestimate demand (average ~79) based on the April heights. Setting L=0 explicitly as it has been extremely stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime transition: Post-spring peak cooling observed in May (avg 67.5 for P13-P14) compared to April peak (avg ~78-100+).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Historical demand for the last three weeks (P13-P15) has stabilized at a lower mean (61, 74, 76; Avg = 70.3) compared to the April peak which saw demand frequently exceeding 100. This suggests we are now in a stable 'post-peak spring' regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 15 observed intervals. To capture this lower but stable demand regime and prevent overstocking as the seasonal peak for trainer socks subsides, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the most recent customer behavior while the OR backend manages the service level for a high-profit (19:1) SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed post-peak: May demand (P13-P15) has stabilized at an average of 70.3 units/period, roughly 30% lower than the April peak volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/3 (Period 17). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which experienced a significant spring peak from late March through April. After a brief cooling in early May (averaging ~70), Period 16 saw a resurgence in demand to 102 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). This suggests that while the April peak passed, early summer (June) is maintaining high demand levels for trainer socks. Based on Period 16's demand of 102 and the stockout, I need to recalibrate to a higher demand regime. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current early summer trend (P13-P16 average demand is 78.25, but the 102 indicates an upward shift). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early June resurgence: Demand spiked to 102 in Period 16 (2019/5/27) following a mid-May cooling period (avg ~70), suggesting sustained interest in trainer socks as summer begins.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. This SKU (Fine-knit trainer socks) is in the middle of its peak summer season. Historically, demand for trainer socks remains high through June and July. Recent demand history shows high volatility: Period 16 peaked at 102 units, followed by 76 units in Period 17. The average demand over the last four periods (P14-P17) is approximately 82 units, which is higher than the May average but slightly lower than the late April peak (~87-100). The strategy is to set mu_hat based on this recent four-period regime to capture the sustained interest as summer begins. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. A recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is chosen to prioritize the most current summer demand profile while managing the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer resurgence confirmed: average demand for early June (P16-P17) is 89 units, significantly higher than the mid-May average of 70 units, indicating a second seasonal peak as summer begins.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which is highly seasonal towards summer. Historical analysis shows a primary demand peak in April (Avg ~80-100), followed by a cooling period in May (Avg ~70), and a confirmed summer resurgence in June. The last three periods (P16-P18) have shown demand of 102, 76, and 66 respectively. While demand has slightly tapered in the last two weeks, the onset of mid-June usually maintains high demand for trainer socks. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To account for the current summer regime while acknowledging the slight cooling over the last two weeks, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 (the June start) to capture the current volatility and mean (avg ~81 units). This targets a service level dictated by the high profit margin ($19.0) vs holding cost ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Mid-June demand stabilization: After the early June spike (102 units), demand for periods 17-18 has averaged 71 units, suggesting a plateau rather than a continuous surge.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which exhibit strong spring/summer seasonality. Analyzing the recent demand history: Period 19 demand was 86 units, and the average over the last 3 periods (P17-P19) is 76 units. Although mid-June showed a slight stabilization compared to the early June spike (Period 16: 102 units), the demand remains consistently higher than the mid-May 'cooling' level of ~70 units. With summer in full swing, demand is expected to remain robust. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for rapid response. I will use a recent_N calculation for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (covering the month of June: P16-P19) to capture the current summer demand regime (average ~82.5 units) while protecting against the observed volatility (range 66-102).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (June) is stable at a higher baseline than May: Avg demand for Periods 16-19 is 82.5 units, compared to the May average (Periods 13-15) of 70.3 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-01. The SKU is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand during late spring and summer. Examining recent history, demand in June (Periods 17-20) has balanced out at an average of 74.25 units. This follows a high-volatility early June spike (102 units in P16) and a consistent May baseline. July usually remains a strong month for summer apparel before the late-summer tail-off. I am observing a stable summer demand regime roughly 10-15% higher than the May average. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of the current June/July regime, I will use a recent_N of 5 periods (Periods 16-20) to capture this summer baseline (Avg 80 units, reflecting the spike and subsequent stabilization) while providing enough buffer for July demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (June) stabilized at approximately 75-80 units/period, following the early-June spike.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860024' (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in its summer demand phase (July). Historical data from June (Periods 17-21) shows demand ranging between 66 and 86 units, with an average of approximately 75 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 21) was 78 units, maintaining the stable regime identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N strategy for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 periods (Period 17 to 21) to capture the current summer stabilization and volatility (~75 mean, ~7.5 std). This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current market behavior rather than early spring peaks or mid-May lulls.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime for July remains stable at ~75 units per period (Period 17-21 average: 75.0), confirming the lower volatility compared to the April peak.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical demand for the month of July (Periods 21-22) has been consistent at 78 units per period. This follows a stable June regime (Periods 17-21) where demand averaged 75.4 units. Performance has been steady with lead times consistently at 0 periods. The product, fine-knit trainer socks, is in the middle of its summer season where demand is higher than early spring but lower than the April volatility peak. I will use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the localized stability of the current summer regime (Periods 17-22) while accounting for moderate volatility. With L=0 and no in-transit units, the OR backend will target a base stock level that covers the expected demand plus a safety factor for the upcoming period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860024' (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a stable summer demand regime. Historical demand data from mid-June through mid-July (Periods 19-23) shows values of 86, 69, 78, 78, and 73, yielding a mean of 76.8 units per period. This confirms the 'summer stability' insight noted in previous periods. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To maintain the target service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) and avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stabilized summer plateau. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption rates rather than the volatile spring peaks observed in April and May.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which typically see high demand throughout the spring and summer. Historical data shows that after the major April peak, demand has stabilized. In the most recent four periods (P21-P24), demand has been very stable, ranging between 69 and 78 units (mean = 74.5). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history (ordered and arrived in the same period). Given this stable late-summer demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covering Periods 20-24) to capture this stabilized level while maintaining enough sensitivity to minor fluctuations before we potentially enter a late-summer/autumn transition.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime stabilized in July (Periods 21-24) with an average of 74.5 units per period and low volatility compared to the spring peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5 (Period 26). This product (fine-knit trainer socks) has transitioned through a volatile spring peak (April) and a secondary summer peak (June). Analysis of July (Periods 21-25) shows that demand has stabilized at a lower, consistent level with an average of approximately 72.2 units per period (78, 78, 73, 69, 63). There is a slight downward trend as we move into August, which is expected for summer-specific items as the season progresses. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period history. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current stable summer regime and the slight declining trend, which is more representative of upcoming August demand than the older, high-volatility spring data. On-hand inventory is currently low (18 units), so the OR backend will trigger a replenishment order to meet this baseline demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime for July/August has stabilized at a lower average compared to June; Period 21-25 average is 72.2 units/period with a slight cooling trend entering August.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-12 (Period 27). The product is trainer socks, which historically peaked in April/May. Comparing recent demand, we see a clear downward trend as we progress through August: Period 26 demand was 51, a significant drop from the July average of ~74.5 and the late June average of ~75-80. This suggests a seasonal cooling as the transition from summer into late summer/early autumn begins. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) is 68.6, but the most recent sample (51) suggests the regime is shifting lower. To avoid overstocking during this cooling phase while maintaining sufficient service levels (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent cooling trend (P22-P26 average: 66.8). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed entering August: Demand has cooled from a July average of ~74.5 units to 51 units in Period 26, indicating a transition out of the summer peak for trainer socks.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-19. We are exiting the peak summer season for 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Historical demand shows a cooling trend: demand in Period 26 was 51 and Period 27 was 64, significantly lower than the June/July average of ~75-80. This indicates a regime shift towards a lower late-summer/early-autumn baseline. The promised lead time remains 0, and the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition to lower demand (avg ~58 over P25-P27) while maintaining enough stock to avoid stockouts if volatility persists. L remains at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift entering late August confirmed: Average demand for Periods 26-27 (57.5 units) is approximately 23% lower than the July average (~74.5), signaling the end of the peak trainer sock season.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Historical demand for fine-knit trainer socks shows a clear seasonal pattern: a significant peak in April (avg ~80-100), a secondary summer peak in June (avg ~80), and a steady cooling trend starting in August. Demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) has averaged 56 units (51, 64, 53), which is a notable drop from the July average of ~74.5. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 28 regarding the end of the peak trainer sock season. To prevent excess holding costs as demand continues to taper off towards autumn, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this lower late-August regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. We are exiting the summer season for trainer socks. Looking at the historical demand, we've transitioned from a high-summer average (June/July ~75-80 units) to a late-summer/early-Autumn cooling phase. Demand for the last 4 periods (P26-P29) has averaged 59.25 units (51, 64, 53, 69), with Period 29 showing a slight uptick to 69, which resulted in a stockout. This stockout indicates that while demand is lower than the April/June peaks, it remains volatile and easily exceeds current inventory levels if they are set too low. I will set N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent lower average (~59) while allowing for the volatility seen in the most recent period. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to protect against this lingering volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late August/early September (P26-P29) has stabilized at an average of 59.3 units, approximately 20% lower than the July average, but remains volatile enough to cause stockouts if inventory buffers are too thin.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for trainer socks is transitioning out of the summer peak and stabilizing at a lower, though still volatile, early-autumn baseline. Over the last five periods (P26-P30), average demand has been 58.6 units, which is a significant step down from the July/early-August averages (~75-80 units). However, a stockout in Period 29 followed by a demand of 56 in Period 30 suggests that while the mean has dropped, volatility remains present. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently been 0 periods, but the model needs to stay reactive to this consistency. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=5 to capture the stabilized late-August/early-September demand regime (avg ~59). For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current variability, ensuring the OR backend maintains a buffer sufficient to prevent the stockouts seen in P29 without overstocking as the season cools further.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for early September (P26-P30) has stabilized at an average of 58.6 units, confirming a ~20% reduction from summer levels.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical demand analysis for the late August/early September period (Periods 26-31) shows a stabilized regime with an average demand of 59.1 units (51, 64, 53, 69, 56, 62). This represents a decrease from the July summer peak (~74 units) but remains steady as we transition into mid-September. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory is low (10 units on-hand), following a period where demand (62) slightly exceeded the previous order (54). To maintain high service levels (critical given the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio) while accounting for the current stabilized demand level, I am using recent_N with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this post-summer steady state. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover the expected demand and a safety buffer against the observed volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Mid-September demand regime stabilized: Average demand for Periods 26-31 is 59.1 units/period, confirming a 20% reduction from summer peaks but maintaining consistent volume through early September.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks has entered a stable late-summer/early-autumn regime. Over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), demand has averaged 58.3 units, significantly lower than the June/July peak of ~75-80 units. The most recent demand (P32) was 53 units, reinforcing this stabilization. Although there was a stockout in P29, subsequent periods (P30-P32) have shown that a mean estimate around 60 units with moderate volatility is sufficient. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-peak behavior while filtering out the higher summer volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (2019/09/23), demand spiked significantly to 90 units, compared to the stable early September average of ~59 units. This resulted in a stockout (on-hand 0). While the Carry-Over Insights suggest a cooling trend after the summer, this recent spike may indicate a 'back-to-school' or late-September surge in demand for trainer socks. To address this and prevent further lost sales, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to an explicit forecast. I will use a value of 85 units for (1+L) periods, which is close to the recent spike level, acknowledging that N=1 is highly volatile but necessary given the stockout. Sigma_hat is set to 15 (explicit) to account for this renewed volatility. The lead time remains at the promised 0 periods, which has been consistently observed in every period of history.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in late September (Period 33): Demand jumped to 90 units, a ~52% increase over the previous 6-period average of 59.1, causing a stockout.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860024' (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in Period 35 (2019/10/07). Historical data shows a significant demand spike in Period 33 (90 units) followed by Period 34 (69 units). While there was a stockout in Period 33, Period 34 saw a partial normalization. Analyzing the calendar, we are moving into mid-October. Typically, trainer sock demand peaks in spring (April) and has a second resurgence in early summer (June), which we observed. The late September spike (P33) likely represents a 'back-to-school' or late transition activity. However, demand for trainer socks generally cools as temperatures drop in October/November. The average demand for the most recent period block (P26-P34) is 63 units, but if we look at the immediate post-spike demand (P34), it was 69. I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the late September shift without over-indexing on the single P33 spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 41, which is below the recent average demand, necessitating a restock to maintains service levels for the upcoming week.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed for late September/early October: Period 33-34 average demand is 79.5 units, significantly higher than the August/early Sept average of ~59 units (+35%), likely due to seasonal transition or promotional activity.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th. Demand for fine-knit trainer socks has shown a moderate surge in late September/early October (avg 64.0 for P33-P35) compared to the August/mid-September baseline (avg 59.1 for P26-P32). While Period 33 spiked to 90, the subsequent periods (69 and 53) suggest this was a temporary volatility peak rather than a high-level regime shift. We are now entering mid-October, where demand typically cools for trainer socks as the weather turns colder. I will use a 3-period window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent moderate lift while maintaining responsiveness to any immediate autumn slowdown. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for early October (P33-P35) showed localized volatility with an average of 70.7 units, though the most recent period (P35: 53 units) suggests a return toward the autumn baseline of ~60 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in a post-peak autumn regime for trainer socks. Demand in the most recent three periods (P34-P36) has been 69, 53, and 52 respectively, averaging 58 units/period. This aligns with the stabilized autumn baseline observed in August and early September (approx. 59 units/period), following a brief spike in late September (P33 reached 90 units). The stockouts from that spike have been resolved by higher inventory levels. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Given the cooling trend and the return to the ~58-60 units baseline, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this stabilization (P33-P36) while allowing for the recent lower observations (53, 52) to weight the forecast toward the current autumnal decline. This minimizes holding costs as demand softens heading into late October.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for mid-October (P34-P36) has stabilized at an average of 58 units/period, returning to the pre-spike autumn baseline after a brief surge in late September.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the mid-autumn period for fine-knit trainer socks. Demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P34-P37) with an average of 56 units/period (69, 53, 52, 50), which aligns with the carry-over insight from P37 identifying a return to a baseline of ~58-60 units. Volatility is currently low (std dev ~8.7 over these 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 46 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this stable autumn baseline and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current lower volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient but not excessive buffer as we move deeper into Q4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late October has stabilized at approximately 56 units/period (Periods 34-37), reflecting a consistent autumn baseline with lower volatility compared to the September surge.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the late autumn season for trainer socks. Demand has stabilized following the brief volatility in late September/early October. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 55.0 units (69, 53, 52, 50, 51), which is very consistent with the 'autumn baseline' identified in previous carry-over insights. Lead time has reliably remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the stability and low volatility of this current regime (std dev \u2248 7.8 in the last 5 periods), the backend OR engine can effectively manage the stock using a recent sample window. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 to capture this stable autumn baseline and avoid over-reacting to the older September spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for November has stabilized at a consistent autumn baseline of ~55 units/period (Periods 34-38 avg: 55.0), with significantly lower volatility than the spring/summer peaks.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks has entered a significantly lower regime as of Period 39 (2019/11/04), with demand dropping to 22 units, compared to the previous 5-period average (P34-P38) of 55 units. This suggests the end of the autumn baseline and a transition into a late-autumn/winter low-demand period. To avoid overstocking and excessive holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to focus on this new regime. I'll use recent_N with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this downturn while still accounting for the slightly higher demand preceding it. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed entering November: Period 39 demand (22 units) is 60% lower than the Oct baseline (~55 units), indicating a seasonal drop as winter approaches.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Period 39: 22 units, Period 40: 23 units) confirms a significant downward regime shift as we enter mid-November, compared to the October average of ~55 units. This aligns with seasonal expectations for trainer socks as weather cools. For Period 41, I am using a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this new lower-demand baseline (approx. 22-23 units/period) and its reduced volatility. This will allow the OR backend to set a lower base stock, preventing excess inventory and reducing holding costs now that the peak seasons have passed. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all previous 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for mid-November (Periods 39-40): Average demand has dropped to ~22.5 units/period, a ~60% decrease from the autumn baseline of ~55, marking the start of the winter low-season.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late November (Period 42), the defined low-season for trainer socks. The demand regime shift documented in the Carry-over Insights (Periods 40 and 41) is sustained, with the last three periods (P39-P41) showing demand of 22, 23, and 25 units respectively. This averages 23.33 units/period, which is a significant drop from the October baseline of ~55 units. Given this stable low-demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new winter baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals in the history, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-season confirmed: Demand for the second half of November (Periods 39-41) has stabilized at an average of 23.3 units/period, a ~58% decrease from the autumn baseline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand unexpectedly spiked to 45 units from a late-November average of ~23 units, causing a stockout as no order was placed in Period 42. This spike (2019/11/25) likely reflects early Cyber Monday or holiday shopping for trainer socks. Entering December (Period 43), demand for this category is expected to remain volatile or stay at this slightly elevated winter level compared to the mid-November trough. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture this recent uptick and the preceding low-season baseline (Avg: (22+23+25+45)/4 = 28.75). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on all previous concluded messages. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N=4 will also account for the increased volatility seen in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased entering December (Period 42 demand: 45 units), nearly double the mid-November average of 23.3 units, likely due to holiday seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the December holiday season (Dec 9). In Period 42, demand spiked to 45 units (nearly double the November average of ~23), likely due to holiday shopping for trainer socks. Period 43 demand was 28. While Period 43 was lower than Period 42, the overall volatility in December suggests we need to guard against holiday peaks. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use an explicit lead time of 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent winter seasonality and the December volatility, as the long-term history contains high-volume spring/summer data that is no longer relevant.

Carry-over insight: December holiday volatility confirmed: Period 42 demand spike (45 units) followed by Period 43 (28 units) indicates a deviation from the stable November winter low-season average of 23.3 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). We are in the mid-December holiday season. Historical analysis shows a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 39 (November), where demand dropped from an autumn baseline of ~55 units to a winter low-season average of ~23.3 units (Periods 39-41). However, since Period 42, we have entered a more volatile December holiday phase. Demand across the last three periods (P42-P44) has been 45, 28, and 33 units, averaging 35.3 units/period. This represents a ~50% increase over the mid-November low, though it remains significantly lower than the spring/summer peak levels. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture this specific December holiday regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we cover the slightly higher holiday volume without overstocking based on higher autumn averages. Starting on-hand is 12 units, so the OR engine should order to reach the calculated base stock for this regime.

Carry-over insight: December holiday regime: Demand for Periods 42-44 has increased to an average of 35.3 units/period, up ~50% from the mid-November low of 23.3 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the immediate lead-up to Christmas. We have just observed a significant demand spike in Period 45 (81 units), which is more than double the December average of 35.3 units noted in the carry-over insights. This spike likely reflects the final peak of holiday shopping for trainer socks. Although demand often drops sharply after Christmas, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to the Period 45 stockout. To recover and avoid missing residual holiday or post-holiday sales, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 (Periods 42-45) to capture the increased holiday mean (approx 46.75 units) and volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Christmas peak confirmed: Period 45 demand spiked to 81 units, significantly exceeding the early December average of ~35 units. This indicates high localized volatility at the end of the year.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1253.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30 (Period 47). We are emerging from the Christmas peak for trainer socks. Period 45 saw a demand spike to 81, followed by a slight moderation to 67 in Period 46. Throughout the year, demand for this SKU has shown significant seasonality (Spring/Summer peaks and a Winter low). Having concluded 46 periods, the actual lead time is consistently 0 (units arrive same period). I will use the recent 3 periods (P44-P46) to set the forecast, as they capture the December holiday regime (average ~60.3 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%). Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat accounts for the current volatility while acknowledging the post-Christmas cooling compared to the P45 peak.

Carry-over insight: Christmas holiday volatility peaked in Period 45 (81 units) and began to moderate in Period 46 (67 units). December average (P42-P46) has stabilized at ~50.8 units/period, roughly double the mid-November winter low.
