Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is an H&M+ Cora tee (viscose jersey top). Historical demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) are 43, 55, 46, 53, 59, showing a slight upward trend but generally stable around a mean of 51.2. The promised lead time is 0. Since this is the first period, on-hand and in-transit are zero. Given that holding cost equals profit ($1/unit), the target service level q = 0.5, meaning we aim for a base stock close to the median demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the base demand level while allowing for the recent growth (59 units). Method 'default' would essentially do the same, but 'recent_N' explicitly targets the most recent regime.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18) for the 'HM+ Cora tee'. Period 1 results show a high initial demand of 66 units, which exceeded our order and starting inventory (52 units), resulting in a stockout. Historical demand samples (before P1) averaged 51.2 units (43, 55, 46, 53, 59). Adding P1's demand (66) to the history suggests a slight upward trend or higher volatility than the initial samples indicated. The confirmed lead time is 0 periods (order placed in P1 arrived in P1). Given the stockout in P1 and the seasonality of a short-sleeved top as we move toward spring, I will use recent history to capture the higher demand level. mu_hat will use the last 4 samples (53, 59, 66 plus the current estimate) approximated via N=4 to reflect the recent uptick. L=0 is confirmed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is an H&M+ jersey top (Cora tee), and demand is showing a clear upward trend in February (66 in P1, 88 in P2 compared to the Jan average of ~51). Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times in P1 and P2 were indeed 0, I will stay with lead time 0. However, the current stockouts (sold = on-hand, ending inventory = 0) indicate we are underestimating demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly toward the higher February demand levels, ensuring we order enough to meet the rising trend without being overly penalized by low January stats.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in February (avg 77 vs Jan avg 51). Stockouts in P1 and P2 indicate forecast is lagging actual demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/4. The product is an H&M+ Cora tee, a fashion staple. Analyzing demand history: Jan avg was ~51. Feb demand (Periods 1-3) jumped to [66, 88, 70], averaging 74.6. Stockouts occurred in P1 and P2 because the initial forecast (based on Jan) was too low. Period 3 demand of 70 shows staying power in this higher regime. Lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in P1, P2, P3 arrived in the same period). Setting L to 0. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher Feb/Mar demand regime (avg ~75) while ignoring the lower Jan baseline. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current velocity and volatility to prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1/unit holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in February: avg increased from 51 to ~75 (+47%). Lead time consistently 0.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is an H&M+ Cora tee (viscose jersey top), which is a spring-seasonal item. Historically (January), demand averaged ~51 units/week. Since February, demand has shifted significantly upward: P1(66), P2(88), P3(70), P4(77), averaging ~75 units. In P1, P2, and P4, we experienced stockouts (ending inventory 0), meaning the actual market demand likely exceeds the units sold. The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm actual lead time is consistently 0. To prevent further stockouts and capture the full demand potential of this spring item, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (the February-March regime) which averages 75.25. Given the high volatility and frequent stockouts, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 85 to provide a safety buffer for latent demand not captured in sales, and an explicit sigma_hat of 15 to account for the variance observed in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: March demand remains high (avg 75+), maintaining the February regime shift. Frequent stockouts suggest true demand is higher than units sold.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. Historical demand data and recent performance show a clear regime shift starting in February. Jan avg was ~49, while Feb/March avg demand (Periods 1-5) is ~73. Frequent stockouts in Periods 1, 2, and 4 indicate that the actual customer demand likely exceeds units sold. The last five periods show demands of 66, 88, 70, 77, and 64. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high stockout frequency and the product being a 'Jersey Fancy' garment which likely has seasonal momentum heading into spring, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (the current regime) to ensure the base stock calculation captures the higher volume. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making an accurate mean forecast critical to avoid lost sales.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, transitioning into Spring. Demand for the 'HM+ Cora tee' (Jersey Fancy) remains high following the shift in February. We have faced stockouts in Periods 1, 2, 4, and 6, indicating that the 'units sold' metric underestimates true latent demand. In Period 6, demand was 75 units but we only sold 73 due to stockouts. The average demand since the February shift (Periods 1-6) is approximately 73.3 units, with a peak of 88. Since lead time is consistently 0, we must cover the current period's demand. To prevent further stockouts and account for latent demand, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 80 (slightly above the recent average to capture lost sales) and an explicit sigma_hat of 12 based on the observed volatility in the high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Latent demand continues to exceed units sold: stockouts occurred in 4 out of 6 periods of the current regime. Setting forecast slightly above observed sales mean of 73 to recover service level.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (soft viscose jersey tee) is entering the spring season. Historical demand in the current regime (Periods 1-7) averages 76 units, but frequent stockouts (5 out of 7 periods) confirm that actual demand is higher than units sold. Demand has been particularly strong recently, with P7 demand reaching 93. Given that both profit and holding cost are $1.0, the target service level is 50%, but our inventory has consistently been too low to meet even that. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime since February, but I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat slightly above the observed sales average to account for the consistent stockouts and the upcoming spring seasonality for this garment. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand and stockout pattern: 5 out of 7 periods since February have ended with 0 inventory, indicating latent demand exceeds the observed sales mean of 71.4. Spring seasonality for jersey tops is likely sustaining this levels.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a jersey top, which traditionally sees strong demand in spring. Observations from the last 8 periods (since February) show a clear demand regime shift where the mean observed sales is approx 71.4, but this is capped by frequent stockouts (6 out of 8 periods ended with 0 inventory). Specifically, in Period 7 and 8, we saw demands of 93 and 82, both resulting in stockouts or zero ending inventory. The true latent demand is likely in the 80-90 range. Because the OR backend uses a capped policy (base_stock - pipeline), and my current on-hand/in-transit is 0, I need to set mu_hat high enough to trigger a sufficient order. Given the promised lead time L=0, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a target that accounts for the persistent stockouts and spring seasonality, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Latent demand significantly higher than sales throughout Spring: 6 out of 8 periods since Feb 11 ended in stockouts. Demand for Jersey Fancy tops peaking in April/May.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15th, 2019. This product (Jersey Fancy flared top) is in peak spring seasonality. While Period 9 saw a drop in demand (56 units) and finally left ending inventory (34 units), the historical context from Periods 1-8 shows a persistent pattern of stockouts (7 out of 9 periods), indicating that latent demand consistently exceeds orders. The average demand since the February regime shift (Period 1 to Period 9) is approximately 74.5 units, but frequent stockouts mean the actual mean is likely higher. Given that lead time has been consistently 0, I will use a mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (averaging 74 units) but intentionally use 'explicit' to set a slightly higher buffer of 80 to account for the suppressed demand history and avoid further lost sales during this peak April window.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Demand remains volatile but high. Period 9 was the first period in 4 weeks not to stock out, but ending inventory (34) suggests the previous order was finally sufficient. Average demand since Feb remains ~75.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The product is a 'Jersey Fancy' flared top, which typically sees high demand during spring months (late April into May). Since the demand regime shift in Period 1 (late Feb), the average demand has been approximately 70.4 units, though this is heavily suppressed by frequent stockouts (6 out of 10 periods). Period 10 saw lower demand (37), but this appears to be a weekly fluctuation rather than a trend reversal, given the seasonal context. On-hand inventory is 43. Since L=0, we must ensure base stock covers current period demand. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime since February, which results in a mu_hat of ~70.4 (backend will compute). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=10 to account for the high volatility observed during this regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. We are in the peak period for jersey fancy tops. In Period 11, we experienced a massive demand spike of 108 units, which led to a complete stockout (ending inventory 0) despite having 71 units on-hand. This confirms that latent demand is significantly higher than recent sales averages. The average sales since the February regime shift (Period 1 to Period 11) is approximately 65, but demand has exceeded 80 units in 5 out of 11 periods. Because the product is a 'Gently flared top', it is highly seasonal for the current Spring/May window. To recover service level and capture this unmet demand, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I'll set mu_hat based on an expected demand of 90-100 units (mu_hat = (1+L)*forecast = (1+0)*95 = 95). I will also use an explicit sigma_hat of 20 to account for high volatility seen in the transition from 37 to 108 units in the last two weeks. Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent history.

Carry-over insight: Late April demand spike (108 units) confirms extreme Spring seasonality for Jersey Fancy tops. Observed sales remain capped by inventory in 7 out of 11 periods since Feb, indicating the true mean is likely >85 during the April/May peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-06. The SKU 'HM+ Cora tee' (Jersey Fancy) is in its peak Spring/Pre-Summer season. Looking at the history since February (Period 1), the product has stocked out in 9 out of 12 periods, meaning observed sales (mean ~71) significantly underrepresent latent demand. In Period 11, demand reached 108, and in Period 12, it was 100+, both resulting in stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable based on the 'conclude' messages. Because 75% of periods end in stockouts and we are in a peak seasonal window, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 105 (reflecting the uncapped demand seen in late April) to recover service levels. I am also increasing sigma_hat to 25 to account for high volatility during this seasonal transition and to ensure the backend base-stock calculation (where q = 0.5 given Profit=Holding=$1) doesn't under-order.

Carry-over insight: May peak seasonality confirmed: Demand consistently exceeding 100 units in late April/early May, with stockouts occurring in 9 of the last 12 periods since February.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (May 13), currently in the peak seasonality for 'Jersey Fancy' tops. Historical demand in the recent peak (starting Period 11, late April) shows values of 108, 100, and 91, resulting in stockouts in 2 of the 3 most recent periods. Average demand over these 3 periods is 99.6. Although the previous order (P13) resulted in an ending inventory of 14, the recent regime (P11-P13) clearly demonstrates a move toward a mean around 100 units. To maintain service levels during this May peak and avoid the frequent stockouts seen in April, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the current seasonal peak pattern. Sigma_hat is also set to the recent volatility of this peak period to ensure adequate safety stock. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-20. The product is a 'Gently flared top in soft viscose jersey', which historically experiences a demand peak in late spring (April/May). Period 14 saw a significant stockout with demand reaching 121 units while only 100 were available. This continues a pattern of strong May seasonality\u2014stockouts have occurred in 10 out of the last 14 periods since the February regime shift. The last 4 periods (P11-P14) show demand levels of 108, 100, 91, and 121 (mean=105), suggesting the seasonal peak is currently active. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met (L=0). Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the OR backend targets a 50% service level by default. However, to capture the observed latent demand and account for the high frequency of stockouts during this peak, I am using an explicit mu_hat reflecting the recent average of 105. I'm choosing recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of this peak season appropriately.

Carry-over insight: May peak seasonality intensive: Average demand for the last 4 periods (late April to mid-May) is 105 units. Continued high stockout frequency (10/14 periods since Feb) confirms that sales figures are underestimating true latent demand during the spring peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'HM+ Cora tee' (Jersey Fancy) is in its peak spring/early summer season (late May). Period 15 showed a demand of 126, which exceeded the starting inventory and order total (105), resulting in a stockout. This is the 11th stockout in 15 periods, confirming that observed sales are heavily constrained by inventory. Average sales in the last 5 periods (since late April) are approximately 92.4, but the average demand during those same periods is 109.2. To account for this seasonality peak and the high frequency of stockouts, I am using the 'explicit' method to set mu_hat at 110 units (L=0, so mu_hat reflects 1+0 periods). This value is more representative of the latent demand than historical sales averages. Sigma is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current high volatility during this peak period. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Late May peak confirmed: Demand has exceeded 120 units for two consecutive weeks (Periods 14 & 15). Observed sales are consistently lower than latent demand due to repeated stockouts (11 out of 15 periods). Latent demand average for the last month is ~109 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (June 3) occurs as the spring/summer peak for 'Jersey Fancy' tops continues and intensifies. In Period 16, demand reached a new high of 140 units, significantly exceeding the supply of 110 units and resulting in another stockout (the 12th since February). Since February, realized sales have consistently underestimated latent demand due to these frequent stockouts. The average demand over the last 5 weeks (late April through May) is approximately 117 units. To restore service levels and capture this peaking demand, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 120 (reflecting recent demand trends) and an explicit sigma_hat of 20 to account for high volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Early June demand continues to peak: Period 16 demand hit 140, the highest yet. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 117 units. Stockout frequency remains extremely high (12 out of 16 periods since Feb).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 10th (Period 18), we are in the heart of the summer season for 'Jersey Fancy' flared tops. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend starting in late April, with peaks frequently exceeding 120 units (P14: 121, P15: 126, P16: 140). Period 17 saw a slightly lower demand of 113, but since 7 of the last 11 periods resulted in stockouts, the observed demand likely underestimates the true latent demand. The current average demand for the 'peak' regime (P12-P17) is approximately 115 units, with a high standard deviation (approx 17.5). Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.50, meaning the base stock level should target the median demand. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set the forecast to 125 (slightly above the recent average to account for seasonality and persistent stockout history) and 'explicit' for sigma_hat at 20 to provide a sufficient buffer against the high volatility observed in May. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: June peak seasonality sustained: Demand average for the last 6 periods (late April to June) is 115 units, with recent peaks hitting 140. Stockout frequency remains very high (12 out of 17 periods), indicating sales data consistently lags latent demand for this SKU during the Spring/Summer peak.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17, mid-June, which is the peak season for 'Jersey Fancy' tops. Historical demand from the last 5 periods (P14-P18) shows realized sales of 100, 105, 110, 113, and 118. However, multiple stockouts (12 out of the last 18 periods) and actual demand spikes reaching 140 indicate that sales are consistently capped by inventory. The realized demand in P18 was 118, exactly matching the starting on-hand plus arrival. Lead time remains stable at 0. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, but given the repeated stockout evidence and peak summer seasonality, a more aggressive 'explicit' mu_hat of 125 is necessary to capture latent demand and prevent further lost sales during this high-demand window. Sigma_hat is set to 15 to reflect the high volatility observed in recent peaks.

Carry-over insight: Latent demand continues to outperform sales as we enter peak Summer (mid-June): Demand has stabilized at a high level (110-120 range) but remains prone to spikes (140 in P16). Stockout frequency is 66% over the last 18 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), SKU 294008002 (Jersey Fancy top) continues to experience peak summer demand. The observation from Period 19 shows a significant demand spike of 173 units, the highest in the history, leading to yet another complete stockout (on-hand is 0). Over the last 8 periods (since late April), the average demand has been approximately 117 units, but the last several periods have shown values of 126, 140, 113, 118, and 173. The frequent stockouts (approximately 70% of periods since February) indicate that actual latent demand consistently exceeds sold units. With profit and holding costs equal ($1.0), the backend OR logic targeting a 50% service level is insufficient given the high cost of missed sales opportunities and the clear upward trend. I am setting mu_hat to 135 to better account for the recent surge and persistent stockouts, and setting sigma_hat to 35 to capture the increased volatility (Standard Deviation of recent periods is ~28, but 35 provides a safer buffer for the 173-unit spike scenario). Actual lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Extreme Summer peak confirmed. Period 19 demand reached 173 units. Average demand over the last 8 periods is ~117, but latent demand is likely >130 given frequent stockouts.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of July 1st (Period 21), we are in the peak summer season for the 'HM+ Cora tee'. Reviewing recent history, demand significantly spiked in late June (P19 reached 173 units), though it pulled back to 78 units in P20. However, the consistent pattern since May has been high latent demand often exceeding 110-120 units, resulting in frequent stockouts (12 out of 20 periods). With 57 units currently on-hand and a promised lead time of 0 (consistently held), we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture the next volatility spike. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is ~124 units. Given the high variance and the high stockout history, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture the recent summer trend and use an explicit sigma_hat of 40 to account for high volatility (P19's 173 vs P20's 78). This balanced approach protects against stockouts while recognizing the recent high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: July 2019: Summer peak demand established with a recent high of 173 units (P19). Recent 5-period average demand (P16-P20) is 124 units, reflecting high-season levels despite a single-period drop to 78 in P20.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'HM+ Cora tee' (Jersey Fancy/Gently flared top) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since mid-April, reflecting Spring/Summer peak seasonality. However, demand in the last two periods (P20: 78, P21: 79) shows a distinct drop from the previous 110-170 range, suggesting the peak may be tapering off as we enter July. There have been no stockouts for two consecutive periods, with ending inventory now at 46. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the recent drop in demand, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current level (avg ~104) while still weighting the potential for continued high volume. This protects against a sudden drop in seasonality while maintaining enough stock if the peak continues at a moderate level (~80-100 units).

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand softening: Demand dropped to ~79 units/period in P20-P21 after a sustained 110-170 peak, indicating the Summer peak may be tapering.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the HM+ Cora tee is clearly tapering off from its extreme Summer peak. Observation for the last three periods (P20-P22) shows a shift in demand from an average of ~117 down to 78, 79, and 52 respectively. The most recent demand (52) is back to levels seen in January/February, signaling the end of the High Summer season. Lead time remains consistently 0. I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward trend and avoid over-ordering as seasonality shifts. With on-hand inventory at 61, the OR backend will calculate a modest order to maintain the new, lower base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (End of Summer Peak): Demand has decreased significantly in July, falling from a June peak of 173 to a 3-period average of 69 units (Period 20-22). Seasonality for this jersey top appears to have peaked in June and is now returning to baseline levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '294008002' (Jersey Fancy flared top) has definitively exited its summer peak (which hit a high of 173 units in June). Demand for the last four periods (P20-P23) has averaged 69.25 units (78, 79, 52, 68), a significant drop from the May/June average of ~120+. This confirms the regime shift noted in the carry-over insights. Total on-hand inventory is currently 2 units. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the move to a lower, more stable regime, I will use a recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock that covers the current post-peak demand level (~70 units) while accounting for the lower volatility compared to the peak season. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5 (the median), meaning the OR backend will target the mean demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'HM+ Cora tee' (Jersey Fancy) is clearly transitioning out of its summer peak. The demand in Period 24 was 39 units, following a downward trend (78, 79, 52, 68, 39) from the June peak of 173. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 63 units, but the most recent figure suggests a return towards the early-year baseline (pre-February average was 51). With an ending inventory of 31 units and a current demand observation of 39, the target base stock should reflect this lower regime to avoid accumulating excess inventory during the seasonal decline. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-peak regime while smoothing out the volatility seen in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline confirmed: Demand dropped from a June peak of 173 to a 5-period average (P20-P24) of ~63 units, with the most recent demand hitting 39. Seasonality for Jersey Fancy tops is reverting to base levels.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '294008002' (Jersey Fancy top) is currently in a post-summer decline. Since the peak in June (Period 19, demand 173), demand has generally trended downward. However, Period 25 saw a bounce back to 74 units, which resulted in a stockout. Over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), the average demand is approximately 65 units (78, 79, 52, 68, 39, 74). The stockout in P25 indicates that the system is still underestimating the lower-bound 'baseline' demand for this product after the summer peak. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this current post-peak regime (average ~65) while allowing for the volatility seen in the last few weeks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all history.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the HM+ Cora tee is clearly in a post-summer decline. Since the peak in June (max demand 173), demand has significantly dropped. The most recent 5 periods (P22-P26) show an average demand of 55.4 units (52, 68, 39, 74, 44), falling from the previous high-season averages (>100). Period 25 saw a stockout, but Period 26 concluded with 21 units on hand, suggesting the current order levels are stabilizing around the new lower mean. We are now in mid-August, moving further away from the spring/summer peak for this jersey top. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this lower demand regime (avg ~55) while allowing for some volatility (standard deviation remains relevant). Lead time is consistently 0.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '294008002' (Jersey Fancy top) is in a post-summer demand decline. Recent demand samples show a significant drop from the June peak (avg ~140) to a more stable late-summer level. Periods 24-27 show demand values of 39, 74, 44, and 65, averaging approximately 55.5 units. The most recent period (P27) resulted in a stockout with demand at 65, suggesting the current regime is stabilizing around 55-60 units per period. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this post-peak stabilization while allowing for minor late-season volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0, allowing for responsive ordering.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization: Demand has settled into a 40-70 unit range following the June peak, with an average of ~55 units over the last 4 periods (P24-P27).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Demand for 'Jersey Fancy' tops has significantly stabilized following the extreme Summer peak (which hit 173 units in Period 19). Over the last 5 periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged 57.2 units (39, 74, 44, 65, 64), conforming to the post-summer stabilization regime noted in the carry-over insights. Stockouts occurred in P27 and P28 because the previous orders were based on slightly lower expectations or residual inventory, but the demand remains consistently in the 55-65 range. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'late summer/early autumn' baseline while ensuring sufficient base stock to prevent further stockouts.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. This SKU (Jersey Fancy top) has completed its Summer peak (which peaked in June at 173 units) and has stabilized into a post-summer demand regime. For the last 6 periods (Period 24 to Period 29), demand has averaged 55 units (39, 74, 44, 65, 64, 44) with some volatility. The most recent demand was 44. Since the Summer peak is clearly over and data has shown a stable mean for several weeks, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current baseline. This N-value covers the period since late July when the post-peak stabilization began. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for the HM+ Cora tee (Jersey Fancy) has transitioned from its high summer peak to a significantly lower post-summer baseline. Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), demand has averaged 52.6 units, but the last two periods (44 and 25 units) suggest a further cooling as we enter autumn. Period 30 saw the lowest demand (25 units) since February. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 30 units and a clearly declining demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the most recent cooling phase (average ~44 units) while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this transition. This approach prevents over-ordering as the product moves further out of season.

Carry-over insight: September demand decline: Demand has dropped below the previous post-summer stabilization range (40-70), hitting a new low of 25 in Period 30. Current demand regime average (P29-P30) is ~35 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the HM+ Cora tee is currently in a post-summer stabilization/decline phase as we enter mid-September. Recent demand figures for the last three periods (P29-P31) are 44, 25, and 41, averaging approximately 36.7 units per period. This confirms the shift noted in the 'Carry-over Insights' for Period 31, where demand has dropped below the previous 40-70 unit range. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this lower-demand period while maintaining a sufficient service level (especially since holding costs are relatively high at $1.0/unit), I am setting mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this most recent September regime. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same window to capture recent volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'HM+ Cora tee' (Jersey Fancy flared top) is experiencing late-September demand volatility after a post-summer low. Recent demand (P31: 41, P32: 60) shows a slight uptick from the early September lows (P30: 25). The most recent demand of 60 exceeded starting inventory, resulting in a stockout. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P29-P32) is 42.5. To account for this slight recovery/fluctuation while acknowledging the general downward trend compared to the summer peak, I will use a 4-period window (recent_N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to the recent stockout with the overall seasonal decline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand remains volatile but higher than the P30 low; demand increased from 25 (P30) to 60 (P32), suggesting a higher stabilization point than initially estimated in P31.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September/early October. Demand has shown a recent increase from the September low (25 in P30) to 60 (P32) and 66 (P33), though both recent periods resulted in stockouts, suggesting latent demand is likely in the 65-75 range. The 'recent_N' method with N=4 captures this stabilization period (P30-P33) while smoothing the volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the OR backend targets a 50% service level (base stock = mean demand) unless parameters are adjusted. Given the stockout pattern in P32 and P33, mu_hat is set using N=4 (spanning the September stabilization) to ensure the base stock covers the recent mean of ~48 plus variance.

Carry-over insight: September demand stabilization: Demand has rebounded from a low of 25 (P30) to an average of ~63 over the last two periods (P32-P33), indicating a new autumn baseline higher than the early September trough.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 294008002 (Jersey Fancy top) is currently in an autumn demand phase. Following a volatile September where demand fluctuated between 25 and 66, the most recent period (P34) saw a significant drop to 16 units. However, looking at the regime since the post-summer decline (around P30), demand has averaged approximately 40 units (P30-P34: 25, 41, 60, 66, 16). The low demand in P34 might be an outlier or early sign of late-autumn tapering. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this autumn stabilization (mean ~42) while allowing for the recent volatility, and use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the high variance observed in September.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: September/October demand is averaging ~42 units (P30-P34), showing high volatility compared to the summer peak but remains higher than the early Sept trough.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '294008002' (Jersey Fancy flared top) is currently in a post-summer/autumn stabilization phase. Demand has cooled significantly from the June/July peaks (which hit 170+ units) and is now fluctuating between 16 and 66 units. Recent behavior shows a distinct drop in the last two periods (P34: 16 units, P35: 18 units) compared to the mid-September rebound (P32-P33 average: 63 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the high volatility in autumn demand and the recent downward trend over the last two weeks, I am focusing on a 5-period window (P31-P35) to capture the current regime which averages ~40 units. This approach balances the mid-September spikes with the early October lows, ensuring we don't over-order on a dying seasonal trend while maintaining enough stock to cover the volatility observed in this category.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand volatility confirmed: October demand (P34-P35) dropped to an average of ~17 units, significantly lower than the September average of ~48 units, signaling a potential further decline as the product moves out of season.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Jersey Fancy top) is showing a clear late-autumn decline as it moves out of its primary Spring/Summer season. Current demand in October (Periods 34-36) has dropped significantly to an average of 15.6 units (16, 18, 13), compared to the September average of ~48. With on-hand inventory at 28 units and a promised lead time of 0, the current stock covers nearly two periods of the current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs at the end of the season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that reflects the current ~15 unit/period reality.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn demand decline: October demand (P34-P36) has dropped to an average of ~16 units, down from the September average of ~48 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a late autumn decline as confirmed by the demand in the last four periods (P34-P37: 16, 18, 13, 10), averaging 14.25 units. This is a significant drop from the September average of ~48 units. Given the 'Gently flared top... short sleeves' description, this item is highly seasonal and demand is expected to remain low or continue decreasing as we enter November. Current on-hand inventory is 18, which already covers more than one period of the current demand level. The Lead Time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this low-demand regime and avoid overstocking a seasonal item at the end of its cycle. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early November (late Autumn). Demand has significantly declined from the Summer peak (June ~173 units) and the September rebound (~63 units) to a very low and stable level. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has been 16, 18, 13, 10, and 9 units respectively, averaging ~13 units. This confirms the product is moving out of season as a short-sleeved jersey top. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Based on this sustained low-demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current late-season baseline and avoid overstocking as we approach winter. The current on-hand inventory of 9 units covers roughly one period of current demand, so a small order to reach the base stock level is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Early Winter regime shift: Demand has stabilized at low-season levels, averaging ~13 units over the last 5 periods (P34-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (gently flared jersey top) has fully transitioned into its low-season demand regime as of mid-October (Late Autumn). Current demand reflects a stable, low baseline. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has been: 16, 18, 13, 10, 9, 11, centering around an average of ~13 units. The 'In-transit' is 0 and on-hand inventory is 3. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain the service level while minimizing holding costs for this low-demand phase, I am selecting mu_hat based on the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture this stabilized Autumn/Winter baseline. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the significantly reduced volatility compared to the high-season Summer peaks.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (Period 41). Since the late Autumn/Early Winter regime shift (Period 34/35), demand has stabilized at a low-season baseline. Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), demand has averaged 12.7 units (observed values: 16, 18, 13, 10, 9, 11, 12). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 1 unit. Given the stability of this low-demand regime, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current baseline while maintaining a lean inventory profile suitable for low season. This captures the 12-13 unit mean and appropriate volatility since the October drop.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a late autumn/early winter low-demand regime. Over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), demand has consistently remained low, ranging between 8 and 18 units, with an average of approximately 12.1 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P38-P41) show very stable demand at 9, 11, 12, and 8 units (average 10). Stockouts are no longer an issue, and the on-hand inventory is being managed effectively with short lead times (confirmed L=0). I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this stable low-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to maintain lean inventory and minimize holding costs during this off-peak season.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (HM+ Cora tee) is in a clear late-autumn/winter low-demand regime, with lead times consistently at 0. Demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) has averaged 11.2 units, with a slight peak of 16 units in the most recent period. Given the current date (Dec 2), we are well past the summer/spring peak and in a stable low-volume period. On-hand inventory is 0. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the stable winter baseline while accounting for the recent slight increase in volatility. This will ensure the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the expected 10-15 units per period without overstocking during this low-season phase.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Cora tee) is in a low-demand winter regime. Since Period 39 (early November), demand has consistently averaged ~12.5 units per period (P39-P43: 11, 12, 8, 16, 17). The last two periods show a slight uptick (16 and 17), resulting in stockouts because the system attempted to maintain very lean inventory levels. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.50, meaning the OR engine targets the median demand. However, to prevent repeated stockouts during this minor volatility, I will use a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current stable winter average. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to capture the volatility from the last two months of lower demand while ignoring the much higher autumn/summer variance.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime established: Average demand since November (Period 39) is ~13 units, significantly lower than autumn levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a stable low-demand winter regime. Since November (Period 39), demand has consistently averaged around 13 units per week. Although there were minor stockouts in Periods 42 and 43 where demand slightly exceeded supply (16 and 17 units respectively), the latest observation (Period 44) shows a return to the mean with 10 units of demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain the service level across this low-demand phase while minimizing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture the stable demand regime from Period 39 to Period 44.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Jersey Fancy tee) is currently in a stable winter demand regime. Over the last 7 periods (P39-P45), demand has averaged 14.3 units, significantly lower than previous seasons but showing a slight uptick in the most recent period (P45 demand = 26), likely due to holiday-week gifting or clearance. Stockouts occurred in P42, P43, and P45, indicating that holding levels have been slightly too low to capture peak volatility even at this low baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will continue using a recent_N of 7 to capture the core winter regime mean, but I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the slight holiday uptick and to ensure sufficient stock to prevent another stockout as we approach the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime stable since Period 39: average demand ~14 units. Slight holiday demand spike observed in Period 45 (26 units).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a stable low-demand winter regime. Since Period 39 (early November), demand has averaged approximately 14 units per period (13, 12, 8, 16, 17, 10, 26, 17). Period 45 showed a slight holiday spike (26), but Period 46 returned to the baseline (17). The current date is December 30th, which marks the end of the holiday season and a return to typical winter demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high stockout history during the spring peak, I want to ensure enough safety stock for the current regime to avoid missed sales even at low volumes. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the average since the November regime shift (Period 39), which includes the minor holiday volatility.
