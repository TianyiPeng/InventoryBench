  "rationale": "For Period 1 (2019-02-11), I am managing SKU 294008002 (HM+ Cora tee), a soft viscose jersey top. Historical demand data shows a stable range between 43 and 59 units over the last five weeks (avg: ~51.2). The current date is February 11th; we are moving into the spring season when demand for jersey tees and light tops generally begins to rise. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive in time to satisfy Period 1 demand. Starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to order enough to cover Period 1 demand plus a small buffer for upward variance or lead-time risk. Given the historical average and the 'gently flared' style which suggests a steady fashion staple, I'll target the upper end of historical demand (~60 units) to ensure high service level under a same-period arrival assumption.",

This likely reflects seasonal interest in lighter jersey cotton tops for spring. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on P1 and P2 arrivals. In both P1 and P2, it was under-stocked (sold all on-hand but couldn't meet total demand). To capture the current momentum and meet forecasted demand (~85-95 units) while accounting for the fact that stock-outs occurred twice, I will target a stock level of 100 units to ensure service level.

Recent performance (66, 88, 70) shows a higher mean (~75). However, significant sales were lost in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was lower than demand (indicated by ending inventory of 0 and demand > ordered).

There are no units in transit. e) Final Order Logic: Forecasted demand for Period 4 is ~80 units, considering the seasonal shift toward Spring.
