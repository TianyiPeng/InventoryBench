Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Push Up Jegging L.W'. Historically, demand has shown an upward trend over the last five weeks (39, 38, 59, 55, 73). The average demand over these 5 samples is 52.8. Given the increasing trend as we move into February, I will use a conservative recent_N approach to capture this shift. The promised lead time is 0. Since there's no history of actual lead times yet, I'll stick with the default (0). I'll use recent_N=3 for the demand components (mu and sigma) to weigh the most recent uptick (avg ~62) more heavily while maintaining some statistical stability. Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit), so the backend target service level will be 50%, balancing the risk of stockouts against high holding costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Push Up Jegging L.W', a skinny denim item. In Period 1, we ordered 63 units with a lead time of 0 (same-period arrival). Demand was 64, resulting in 63 units sold and 0 units ending inventory (1 unit lost demand). Looking at historical data: (Jan 7: 39, Jan 14: 38, Jan 21: 59, Jan 28: 55, Feb 4: 73) and Period 1's actual demand (64), there is a clear upward trend starting in late January. The mean of the last 3 samples (55, 73, 64) is 64. Given the lead time is 0, we need to cover demand for current period (1+L=1). I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand regime (~64 units/week) compared to the early January average (~38 units/week).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, transitioning from late winter into early spring. Historical demand for these jeggings has shown a clear upward trend: 39, 38, 59, 55, 73 (pre-simulation) and 64, 62 in the last two periods. The mean of the last 4 periods is approximately 63.5, significantly higher than the initial samples in early January. Lead time observations from P1 and P2 confirm that the actual lead time is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (2 units on-hand), and there are no units in-transit. To ensure high service levels for a product with a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while accounting for the recent demand stabilization at a higher level than the early January baseline, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=4 for mu_hat captures the recent regime shift (Avg ~63.5), while setting N=5 for sigma_hat captures recent volatility. Since L=0, the OR backend will calculate base_stock for (1+0) periods (current demand).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: average demand increased from ~40 (early Jan) to ~63.5 (Feb) as the season progresses.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th. This product is a 'Push Up Jegging', a fashion item. We've seen a shift in demand since early February: from averages of ~40 to recent demand values in the 60s (P1: 64, P2: 62), though P3 dipped to 38. The carry-over insight noted a regime shift, but the P3 result suggests high volatility or a potential stabilization. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. As profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median (z=0) for base stock. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent February/March behavior more heavily while accounting for the lower P3 demand. This provides a safety buffer against the observed volatility while tracking the higher demand level compared to January.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 (Push Up Jeggings) is entering March. Historically, demand for this item started around 40 in early January, peaked near 73 in early February, and has recently stabilized. In the last four concluded periods (Feb 11 - March 4), demand values were 64, 62, 38, and 51, averaging 53.75. The previous carry-over insight suggested a shift to 63.5, but recent data shows a slight cooling or stabilization around 50-55. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. With only 4 units on hand and 0 in transit, we need an order to cover the current period's demand (L=0 means review+lead = 1 period). I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this stabilization while maintaining responsiveness to the high-demand season.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 18, 2019. The product is a 'Push Up Jegging', a staple fashion item. Observation of recent performance (Periods 1-5) shows a mean demand of approximately 56.6 units. While Period 5 demand spiked to 68, the overall trend since February has stabilized around 55-65 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (100% arrival rate in the same period). My strategy is to set parameters that maintain a base stock sufficient for the current demand regime, using N=5 to capture the most recent February/March pattern. Note: in Period 5, inventory stocked out (sold 54 with demand 68), so the mu_hat needs to remain high enough to cover this potential. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50% (z=0), meaning the OR engine will target the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' for all parameters with N=5 to reflect the current active selling season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable around 55-60 units/period for late Feb/early March; Lead time consistently 0 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. We are managing 'Push Up Jegging L.W', a ladies' denim item. Historical demand showed a shift in February to ~63.5, but recent periods (P4-P6) show a more stable yet volatile range around 58 units (51, 68, 55). Specifically, Period 5 saw a demand spike to 68, resulting in lost sales. Since L is consistently 0, the OR backend requires parameters for a single period (1+L=1). I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P2-P6) to capture the current spring demand level while smoothing the P5 spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the recent volatility (stdev of 51, 68, 55, etc.). Lead time (L) remains 0 as every order from P1 to P6 arrived in the same period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/1. Historical demand for this 'Push Up Jegging' (Ladies Denim) shows a significant recent spike. Period 7 saw a demand of 94 units, up from the previously stable range of 55-68. This likely indicates a late-March/early-April seasonal peak for spring apparel. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 7 (stockout), meaning actual demand (94) exceeded available supply (55). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts during this potential seasonal surge, I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N=3 (encompassing demand of 68, 55, and 94) to capture the higher mean. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend OR logic targets a 50% service level (q=0.5), which results in the base stock being the mean demand (z=0). To prevent conservative ordering during a spike, I will set mu_hat explicitly slightly higher than the recent 3-period average (~72) to 80 units to buffer against the momentum seen in Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected starting Period 7: Demand rose to 94 units (+60% vs previous average), likely indicating seasonal spring peak for denim.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 (Push Up Jegging) is currently in a high-demand spring window. While Period 8 saw demand pull back to 52 units from a peak of 94 in Period 7, the average across the last three weeks (P6-P8) is 67 units, which is higher than the early February average of 40-50. This volatility suggests we are in a high-demand regime but with significant weekly variance. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set L=0 and use a recent_N window for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=3. This N captures the recent spike and subsequent moderate period, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 67 units for the 1+L period window. Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend will aim for a 50% service level base stock; however, the capped policy ensures we order enough to reflect the recent high volume while managing the risk of overstocking if demand reverts.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/04/15). Historical analysis shows a significant demand spike in Period 7 (94 units), followed by a cooling off in Periods 8 and 9 (52 and 37 units respectively). Previously, we identified a spring peak, but the last two weeks suggest that specifically for this low-waist jegging, the peak may be transitory or volatile. Since April is mid-spring, I expect demand to stabilize rather than continue dropping to winter levels. The 'lead_time' has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current post-spike stabilization (average of 94, 52, 37 is approx 61), and a similar window for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility. Using N=3 for mu_hat provides a projection of (1+0)*61 = 61, reconciling the recent high and low points. This balances the risk of another spike against the cost of carrying inventory if demand remains at the Period 9 level.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in early April: Peak of 94 (P7) followed by decline to 37 (P9), suggesting a short-lived seasonal burst or inconsistent spring demand for this SKU.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the demand history for the 'Push Up Jegging', there was a significant seasonal spike in late March (94 units), followed by a notable cooling period in April (52, 37, 24 units). This suggests the peak demand phase for this specific spring denim item has passed, or consumer interest is fluctuating significantly post-Easter/Early April. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (base_stock = median demand), making it critical to avoid overstocking in a declining or volatile regime. I will use a recent window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this recent downward trend (avg ~51) while acknowledging the high variance from transition periods using the last 5 samples for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-April 1st: Demand has steadily declined from a peak of 94 to 24 units, indicating the end of the early spring seasonal peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical data and recent demand trends indicate a significant decline in demand for this item (Push Up Jegging L.W) following a peak in late March. Specifically, demand has dropped from 94 (P7) to 18 (P11) in a steady downward trend. The most recent three periods (P9-P11) show demand levels of 37, 24, and 18, averaging approximately 26 units/period. The current on-hand inventory of 34 units is already sufficient to cover this new, lower demand regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect this contraction, which will likely result in a very small or zero order from the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-seasonal peak (late March) has stabilized at a lower regime: average of 26 units over the last 3 weeks (P9-P11) compared to 60+ in early spring.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th. Looking at the demand history, we had a seasonal peak in March (up to 94 units) which has since declined significantly. In the most recent four periods (P9-P12), demand values were 37, 24, 18, and 47. While Period 12 showed a slight uptick to 47, the overall trend since mid-April is much lower than the early spring peak. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 after selling out last period (34 sold vs 47 demand). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering during a declining seasonal phase while accounting for the recent small bounce, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the lower post-peak regime (average ~31.5) while acknowledging the volatility observed in the last period. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed in lower post-peak state (late April/early May): Average demand dropped from ~60 to ~31.5 units across P9-P12.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Historical analysis shows a significant seasonal peak in late March (Period 7: 94 units), followed by a sharp decline in April. However, demand has recently shown a slight recovery trend (Period 12: 47, Period 13: 41), compared to the low of 18-24 in mid-April. This suggest a new stable late-spring regime higher than the mid-April trough but lower than the March peak. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P11-P13) is 35.3 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilization while acknowledging the recent uptick, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the low outlier (18) with the recent higher values (47, 41) to ensure sufficient stock for this 'low waist skinny jegging' which likely sees a secondary boost in May.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May: Average demand is approximately 35 units (P11-P13), showing recovery from the mid-April trough (avg ~20) but remaining well below the late March peak (94).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of May 20th (Period 15), demand for the Push Up Jegging has stabilized after the late-April trough. The last three periods (P12-P14) show consistent demand of 47, 41, and 43 units respectively (average ~44), which is higher than the early-May estimate of 35 units. The system has experienced stockouts for three consecutive periods because orders were based on the lower April regime. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the target service level is 50% (z=0), meaning the base stock should equal the expected demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this stabilization and recovery trend, which provides a mean across the transition from the trough to the current stable state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in May (P12-P14) at an average of 43.6 units, reflecting a recovery from the April trough (avg ~26).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. This SKU (Ladies Denim Jegging) has transitioned from a volatile spring peak into a relatively stable late-May demand regime. Historical demand for the most recent three periods (P13-P15) has been consistent: 41, 43, and 40 units respectively (average ~41.3). This represents a successful recovery from the April decline. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal (q=0.5, z*=0), the OR backend will target the mean demand. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this stabilized May baseline of ~41 units. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=3) to capture the current low volatility, ensuring we cover the immediate demand without overstocking during this stable phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May (P13-P15) at a mean of ~41 units/period with very low volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. We are in a stable demand regime for this Push Up Jegging SKU. In the last four periods (P13-P16), demand has been extremely consistent: 41, 43, 40, and 43, averaging 41.75 units. The historical lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we lost 1 unit of demand last period (P16). Since the current demand is steady and low-volatility, I am using recent_N=4 to capture this specific late-May/early-June stability for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a service level dictated by the equal weights of profit and holding cost (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Demand regime confirmed stable for late May/early June (P13-P16) at an average of 41.75 units with very low standard deviation.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. In Period 17, demand dropped significantly to 18 units from a previously stable average of ~41.75 units (P13-P16). This could signal the start of a summer demand slump or simply a high-variance week, as denim (jeggings) often sees shifting demand as temperatures rise. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend service level target is 50%, making the base stock equivalent to the expected demand (mu_hat). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent drop while acknowledging the previous month of stability, I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (averaging P13-P17) to smooth the forecast. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility introduced by the Period 17 data point.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in early June (Period 17): after 4 weeks of stability at ~42 units, demand dropped to 18 units, potentially signaling a seasonal shift or increased noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Push Up Jegging' (Ladies Denim), and we are currently in mid-June. Demand history shows a recent and significant shift: after a stable period of ~42 units (P13-P16), demand dropped sharply in Period 17 (18 units) and remained low in Period 18 (23 units). These two points, combined with the carry-over insight from Period 18, suggest that the early summer demand for this specific denim SKU is significantly lower than the late spring average. The average demand across these last two periods is 20.5 units. Given that the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level (the median). To adapt to this new, lower demand regime while accounting for potential noise, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3: P16-P18, average 28 units) to transition the forecast downwards without overreacting to a single week, while using N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of the shift. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed mid-June (P17-P18): Average demand dropped from ~42 to ~20.5 units, signaling a seasonal transition to summer lows for this denim SKU.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The 'Push Up Jegging' SKU is in a confirmed summer low demand regime, which started around Period 17 (early June). Demand over the last three periods (P17-P19) has been 18, 23, and 18, respectively, averaging approximately 19.7 units. This is a significant drop from the May average of ~42 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this low-demand phase, I will set L to 0 and use the last 3 samples (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This method accurately reflects the most recent stable regime while allowing for the inherent volatility observed in this transition.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (mid-late June): Average demand settled at 19.7 units (P17-P19), a ~50% decrease from the May average of 42.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. We are in a confirmed summer demand trough for this denim SKU. Historical demand over the last four periods (P17-P20) has been 18, 23, 18, and 9 units respectively, showing a clear downward trend and lower overall volume compared to the spring peak. The average for the last 3 periods (P18-P20) is 16.7 units. Given the transition into July, which is typically a slower period for full-length heavy denim, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower regime (avg ~17). Lead time is consistently 0. Since profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the median forecast. This approach minimizes holding costs while covering the expected summer low.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough deepening in late June/early July: Demand fell to single digits (9 units) in P20, bringing the 3-period average down to ~16.7 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the July 'summer trough' period. Demand has significantly decreased from the May average of ~42 down to recent values of 18, 23, 18, 9, and 12 (P17-P21). The mean of the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is approximately 16 units, and the mean of the last 3 periods (P19-P21) is 13 units. Given the low-waist, skinny jegging description, it is likely experiencing a seasonal low as consumers shift toward summer-specific wear. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (which equal profit at $1/unit), I am targeting a base stock aligned with the most recent 3-period demand average of ~13 units. Setting N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this lower summer regime while maintaining responsiveness to the recent slight uptick from 9 to 12.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed for July: 3-period average (P19-P21) has dropped to 13 units, down from the June average (~20.5) and May average (~42).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (low-waist jeggings) is currently in a summer demand trough (mid-July). Period 22 demand was 18 units, which is a slight uptick from the previous average of ~13 units observed in P19-P21, but remains consistent with the lower summer regime (averaging ~16.7 units since P20). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target cycle service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. To capture the current summer stabilization while allowing for the slight observed recovery in P22, I will use a 4-period window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers Periods 19-22 (demands: 18, 9, 12, 18), yielding an average of 14.25 units and capturing the recent variability. This protects against stockouts if demand continues to normalize around 18-20 while avoiding excessive holding costs if it dips back to single digits.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough appears to be stabilizing in July; 4-period demand average (P19-P22) is 14.25 units, significantly lower than the May/June levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Historical demand analysis confirms the SKU is in a summer trough with low and relatively stable demand. Over the last five periods (P19-P23), demand has been 18, 9, 12, 18, and 12, averaging 13.8 units per period. The recent trend shows stabilization after the mid-June drop. Leading through July, there is no evidence of a pre-autumn spike yet. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level (q) is 0.50, which corresponds to the median (z=0). Setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) captures this stable summer regime, while sigma_hat using the same window will provide enough safety stock to cover the slight fluctuations seen between 9 and 18 units without overstocking and incurring excessive holding costs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, which is the heart of the summer season for this 'Push Up Jegging'. Historical data from the last 6 periods (P19-P24) shows that demand has settled into a low summer trough, with values of 18, 9, 12, 18, 12, and 10. This results in a mean of approximately 13.17 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period). Given that the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level targeted by the OR backend is 50%, which essentially aims to stock the median demand. I will use the recent_N method with N=6 to capture this stabilized summer regime and avoid overstocking as we approach the end of July, while allowing for the slight volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 4) observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough stabilized in late July (P19-P24): Average demand is 13.2 units per period, consistently lower than the spring peak (~60) and May recovery (~42).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Historical demand over the last 7 periods (P19-P25) has been consistently low, averaging 11.8 units, which confirms the 'summer trough' insight. The most recent demand (P25) was extremely low at 4 units, suggesting the trough is still active or deepening. Given the product is a 'Push Up Jegging' (denim), we are likely a few weeks away from a potential 'Back to School' or Autumn recovery, but there is no numerical evidence of a shift yet. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand (10) currently covers more than 2x the most recent demand (4). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the stable summer regime (average ~12), while using a slightly larger N for sigma_hat (N=7) to account for the volatility seen in July. This conservative approach prevents overstocking while maintenance for the low-demand period remains cost-effective due to equal profit and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough persists into August: 7-period average (P19-P25) is 11.8 units, compared to May's 42 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/08/12). Historically, this SKU (Push Up Jegging) has been in a sustained 'summer trough' since mid-June, with demand frequently dropping into the single digits or low teens. However, Period 26 saw a sudden demand spike to 22 units, which is nearly double the average of the preceding seven weeks (avg ~11.8). This likely signals the start of the 'Back-to-School' or early autumn transition for denim, as customers begin shifting from summer wear back to trousers. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this potential upward shift without over-committing to high holding costs (since profit and holding cost are equal), I will use a shorter window (N=4) to weight the recent uptick while acknowledging the low summer base. mu_hat will use recent_N=4 to average P23-P26 (12, 10, 4, 22), resulting in a forecast mean of 12.0 per period, but the inclusion of the 22 units in Period 26 will naturally increase the sigma_hat to provide a buffer against continued rising demand.

Carry-over insight: Early signs of autumn/back-to-school demand recovery detected in Period 26 (demand rose to 22 units from a 7-week average of ~11.8).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/08/19), which corresponds to the start of the Autumn/Back-to-School season for clothing. Demand has spiked significantly over the last two periods: jumping from 4 units (P25) to 22 units (P26) and now 48 units (P27). This strongly confirms a structural demand regime shift away from the summer trough (~12 units) towards an autumn recovery. The 48-unit demand in P27 is the highest since April. Lead time remains stable at 0. Because demand is currently accelerating, using a long historical average would undershoot significantly. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current upward trend while filtering out the extremely low July numbers. This setting balances the need for more stock to capture the spike while acknowledging the risk of holding costs if the spike is volatile.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School demand recovery confirmed mid-August: Demand increased from 4 (P25) to 22 (P26) and 48 (P27), signaling a shift from the summer low regime (~12) to a higher autumn regime (avg ~35+).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 (Push Up Jegging) is currently experiencing a rapid demand surge associated with the late-August back-to-school/autumn transition. Demand has climbed from 4 (P25) to 22 (P26), 48 (P27), and now 70 (P28). This confirms a significant upward regime shift from the summer low (~13 units) into an autumn peak that currently mirrors the spring peak (94 units in P7). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this acceleration and avoid stockouts (as starting inventory has been insufficient for the last 3 periods), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current growth trend (avg ~46.7 units) while providing a high volatility buffer to account for the steep week-over-week increase. This setting will allow the OR backend to target a higher base stock to meet this rising demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand surge intensifying: Demand tripled in 3 weeks (22 to 70), indicating a peak similar in magnitude to the March spring peak.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-late August and early September period (P30, Date 2019/9/2), which coincides with the Autumn/Back-to-School seasonal surge for denim products. Historical data shows demand jumped from ~12 in the summer trough to 22 (P26), 48 (P27), 70 (P28), and 55 (P29). The carry-over insight confirms this is a major regime shift similar in magnitude to the March spring peak (where demand hit 94). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory due to stockouts in the last four periods (P26-P29), where demand significantly exceeded the orders placed by the OR backend. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current high-demand state and prevent further lost sales, I will use a short-window recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to focus on the surge (P26-P29 mean = 48.75). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to reflect the significantly increased volatility during this seasonal transition (std of P26-P29 is ~20.9). Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the OR backend aims for a 50% service level; my parameters will ensure the base stock is elevated to meet this autumn demand peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand peak confirmed: 4-period mean (P26-P29) is 48.75 units, up from the summer trough mean of ~12 units. Expect high volatility to continue through September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019, which is squarely in the middle of the 'Back-to-School' and autumn demand peak for denim products. Since Period 26 (early August), demand has transitioned from a summer trough (~12 units) to a high-demand regime, with the last four periods recording 48, 70, 55, and 84 units respectively (average 64.25). We are currently experiencing stockouts due to underestimating this surge. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this momentum and prevent further lost sales during this profitable peak, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the most recent 4-period regime. Using recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat targets this specific seasonal window while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation ~15.8 in this period).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand regime confirmed: 4-period average (P27-P30) is 64.25 units, significantly higher than the initial August recovery estimate of ~48. Stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods indicate the peak is stronger than expected.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand Autumn/Back-to-School peak. Demand in Period 31 spiked significantly to 126 units, which is a massive increase (+50%) over the previous peak of 84 and far exceeds the 4-period average of ~64. We have experienced stockouts for the last 6 consecutive periods (P26-P31), indicating that our base stock is consistently under-calculating the true demand during this surge. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To stop the cycle of stockouts and maximize profit during this high-volume window, I am adjusting mu_hat to an explicit value of 110. This value is a conservative move toward the most recent observation of 126 while acknowledging that P31 might be the absolute peak. I am also using an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to account for the extreme volatility observed during this transition (demand has ranged from 55 to 126 in the last 3 weeks).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified in Period 31: Demand reached 126 units, significantly exceeding previous years and spring peaks (~94). Consistent stockouts since P26 confirm the current regime is much higher than the historical mean.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 658030006 is in a major autumn/back-to-school peak, as evidenced by consistent stockouts and recent demand values of 84, 126, and 115 (Periods 30-32). The current regime is significantly higher than the spring peak (94) and historical averages. Over the last 4 periods (P29-P32), the average demand is 95 units, but the last two periods averaged 120.5 units. Given that we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need a high base stock to capture this peak demand. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture this massive jump, and sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the increased volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified in late September (P31-P32): Demand remains high and stable above 110 units (avg 120.5 over the last two periods), confirming a significantly higher secondary peak compared to the earlier March spring peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030006 (Push Up Jegging) is currently experiencing an unprecedented demand surge in late September, far exceeding the initial autumn/back-to-school peak. Period 33 demand reached 227 units, which is nearly double the previous period's demand of 115 and significantly higher than any historical observation. We have stocked out for 8 consecutive periods (P26-P33), indicating that our inventory levels have been consistently lagging behind this explosive growth. The date (Sept 30) suggests we are at the peak of the autumn season. Given the recent demand values (84, 126, 115, 227), I will use an explicit forecast to capture this extreme upward momentum and set a base stock level that aggressively targets this new regime to prevent further lost sales, despite the high holding cost risk. Setting mu_hat to 240 units to cover the expected demand for the next period (L=0, so L+1=1 period of demand coverage).

Carry-over insight: Super-peak detected in late September (P33): Demand reached 227 units, a 100% increase over the previous high of 126. This indicates a secondary, much more aggressive autumn demand wave.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn/back-to-school super-peak. Demand in Period 33 reached 227 units, followed by 135 units in Period 34. While the 135 units in P34 is a decrease from the absolute peak of 227, it remains significantly elevated compared to historical averages. The transition through late September and early October typically sees sustained interest in denim (trousers) before potentially cooling. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the extreme volatility and recent super-peak, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (averaging ~150 units/period) while allowing for the slight cooling observed in P34. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to account for the massive variance seen during this surge (range 115-227), ensuring the OR backend sets a sufficiently high base stock to avoid the frequent stockouts observed in previous periods.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak volatility confirmed: P33 (227) and P34 (135) show extreme demand swings in the autumn regime. Demand appears to be softening from the absolute peak but remains in a high-volume state (>100 units/period).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn 'super-peak' regime. Over the last four periods (P32-P35), demand has been 115, 227, 135, and 131, resulting in a 4-period average of 152 units. While the extreme peak of 227 (P33) has subsided, demand appears to have settled into a high-volume state significantly above 100 units. Carrying over the 'recent_N' approach with N=4 focuses on this high-volume period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The on-hand inventory of 20 units is low relative to recent demand, and with no units in transit, the OR parameters must be set to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to capture the ongoing autumn demand and avoid further stockouts. mu_hat is set to the recent average multiplied by (1+L).

Carry-over insight: Autumn super-peak remains in a high-volume state (P34-P35 avg: 133) following the P33 peak of 227. Demand has stabilized significantly above 100 units/period for four consecutive weeks.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand autumn 'super-peak' regime. Over the last four periods (P33-P36), demand has been 227, 135, 131, and 127 respectively. While decreasing from the absolute peak of 227, it has stabilized significantly above 100 units/period (average ~130 over the last 3 weeks). The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this specific high-volume regime while acknowledging the slight downward trend from the peak to prevent excessive overstocking as we move further into October. Since Profit=1.0 and Holding=1.0, the OR target is a 50% service level (the median demand), but given the high volatility (sigma) and 0 lead time, the capped policy will help manage the upside risk.

Carry-over insight: Autumn super-peak stabilization: Demand has maintained a high-volume state averaging ~131 units over the last three periods (P34-P36), following the P33 peak of 227.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'Ladies Denim Push Up Jeggings' has stabilized at a high-volume state after the late-September peak (P33: 227). In the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has been 135, 131, 127, and 114, respectively. This shows a very gradual softening from the super-peak but remains in a high-demand autumn/winter regime. The mean demand for these last four periods is 126.75 units, which is significantly higher than any previous spring or summer regime. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain service levels while accounting for the slight downward trend from the peak, I am using a recent_N of 4 to capture this stabilized high-volume state.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-volume regime stabilized (P34-P37): Demand average is 126.75 units following the late-September super-peak, showing a gradual taper from 135 to 114.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4th, entering the lead-up to the holiday season. The 'Autumn super-peak' that started in September remains very strong. In Period 38, demand spiked again to 167 units, catching the system with a stockout despite high inventory. This follows a period of stabilization around 126 units (P34-P37). Lead time is consistently 0. Given the recent spike to 167 and the high-volume state since late September (P33), the best approach is to set the demand forecast using the last 6 periods (P33-P38) which captures the shift from the absolute peak of 227 down to the current stabilized but volatile high-level state. The average of P33-P38 is approx 150 units. We'll use recent_N=6 to reflect this current regime and capture the higher volatility (sigma) to prevent further stockouts as we enter November.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in the late-autumn regime (P33-P38): Demand spiked to 167 in P38 after a period of stabilization, following the P33 peak of 227. The mean demand for the last 6 periods is ~150 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the late autumn/pre-holiday regime. Demand has been highly volatile but has stayed in a high-volume state (avg ~145 over P33-P39). The most recent demand was 99 units, a drop from the previous spike of 167, suggesting the super-peak may be tapering or transitioning into a pre-winter phase. However, given the product (jegging/denim), demand usually remains robust through November. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To balance the risk of high holding costs ($1/unit) against lost sales, I will use a recent demand window (N=6, covering the post-peak stabilization from P34-P39) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the high volume while accounting for the recent taper.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn regime (early Nov) shows demand tapering from super-peak but remaining high; average demand for P34-P39 is 128.8 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the late autumn/pre-holiday regime. Demand has exhibited extreme volatility recently, with a massive 'super-peak' in late September (227 units) followed by a high-volume stabilization phase. The last three periods (P38-P40) show demand values of 167, 99, and 134, resulting in a 3-period average of approximately 133 units. While the 'super-peak' of 227 skewed the longer-term average, the current stabilization is consistently above 100 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this high but slightly receding autumn volume, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (covering P36-P40 demand: 127, 114, 167, 99, 134) to calculate a mean of 128.2. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to account for the high observed volatility within this regime, ensuring enough safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 38 and 40.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn regime (Nov) remains high-volume but volatile: 3-period average (P38-P40) is 133.3 units, significantly higher than the initial autumn recovery but lower than the P33 super-peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030006' (Ladies Denim Jegging) is currently in a high-volume late autumn regime. We are approaching December, where demand for this category typically remains elevated but volatile. The average demand over the last four periods (P38-P41) is 123.5 units (167, 99, 134, 94). While the most recent period (P41) saw a dip to 94, the regime remains significantly higher than the spring peak (94), with frequent swings above 130. Since the lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed and arrive within the same period), I will set L to 'calculate'. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current late-autumn stabilization around 123.5 units. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to account for the high volatility observed in this regime (standard deviation of ~33 units). This approach ensures we maintain enough stock to satisfy potential spikes during the holiday season while minimizing excess holding costs given the zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn regime (Nov) stabilized at lower volatility but high volume compared to the Oct super-peak: 4-period mean (P38-P41) is 123.5 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). We are in the late autumn/winter regime. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 183 units, significantly higher than the previous 4-period average of ~123.5. This spike, combined with the stockout in Period 42 (on-hand dropped to 0), suggests that either the late-season volatility remains extremely high or there is a specific early-December surge (possibly related to Black Friday/Cyber Monday trailing effects or early holiday shopping). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this recent surge while respecting the trend of the last several weeks, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher mean (approx 139) driven by the P42 spike, and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility from 183. This balances the risk of further stockouts against the holding cost of $1/unit.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike in late November (P42) to 183 units identifies a return to super-peak levels (similar to P33), significantly deviating from the November stabilization average of ~123.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 43 dropped significantly to 35 units after a series of high-volume periods (P42: 183, P41: 94, P40: 134, P38: 167). This drop follows the 'late November super-peak' identified in the carry-over insights and likely indicates the expected post-holiday/early December taper. However, the high volatility of the 'late autumn/early winter' regime (mean ~130 over the last month) makes a single-period drop difficult to classify as a permanent regime shift yet. Given the high on-hand inventory (101 units) relative to the most recent demand (35 units), the base stock calculation needs to account for both the high mean of the recent peak and the possibility of a seasonal drop. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the broader late-autumn average (approx 124 units) to ensure sufficient stock if demand spikes again before the final periods, while the OR engine's cap will naturally limit over-ordering given the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Significant demand drop to 35 units in early December (P43) following a volatile late-November peak; monitoring for a sustained shift to a lower year-end regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late December period (P45, Dec 16). Historically, after the late November super-peak (P42 demand: 183), demand dropped sharply in early December (P43: 35) but partially rebounded in P44 to 69 units. This suggests a transition from the volatile autumn/winter peak into a lower, yet still active, year-end regime. The 2-period average for December (P43-P44) is 52 units. Given the profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, the OR engine seeks a 50% service level (the median). I will set mu_hat to 52 (the recent December mean) and sigma_hat to 17 (reflecting the step up from 35 to 69) to manage the current inventory of 50 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime (P43-P44) shows a significant decrease from the autumn/November high-volume state, averaging 52 units/period compared to the previous ~130 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late December period (P46, Dec 23). Historical demand for December (P43-P45) has been 35, 69, and 75 units, respectively. This confirms a significant step-down from the autumn super-peak (which averaged ~130-150 units). The mean of the last 3 periods is 59.6 units, reflecting a post-peak stabilization. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as indicated by the 'arrived=X units (ordered on Period N, lead_time was 0 periods)' confirmation in Period 45. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this new December regime by using recent_N=3 (P43-P45) to capture the lower volume but acknowledge the slight upward trend within December (35 -> 69 -> 75). Sigma_hat will also be set based on the last 3 periods to account for the variance in this new regime. On-hand at the start of P46 is 0 units, so the algorithm needs current demand estimates to fulfill the upcoming week's orders.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime (P43-P45) confirmed lower than autumn peak, stabilizing at a mean of ~60 units/period (vs previous ~130).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Analyis of the recent demand history (P43-P46) reveals a clear transition from the high-volume autumn regime (~130 units) to a significantly lower and more volatile December/Year-end regime. Demand for the last four periods was 35, 69, 75, and 31. The 4-period mean is 52.5 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 46. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the transition into the post-holiday/January period, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this lower volume accurately while maintaining enough variance for potential year-end noise. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N of 4 to reflect the recent fluctuation (30 to 75 range). On-hand inventory is 29, so the OR backend will calculate the order based on a base stock target near ~52 units.
