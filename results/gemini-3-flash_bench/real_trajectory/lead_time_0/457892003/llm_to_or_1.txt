Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 457892003 is 'Leggings in sturdy jersey', categorized as 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Historical demand (last 5 weeks) shows: 66, 73, 111, 83, 85. There is a noticeable bump on 2019-01-21 (111), but demand has stabilized around ~84 in the last two weeks. Since this is an 'Everyday Basic' item, demand is expected to be relatively stable, though we should monitor for seasonal shifts as spring approaches. The promised lead time is 0. With an on-hand inventory of 0 and no in-transit units, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent mean (~83.6) and variance, while acknowledging the 111 spike. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' (0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Women's Everyday Basics Leggings'. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks: 66, 73, 111, 83, 85) plus the Period 1 demand (61) suggest a mean demand of approximately 79 units per week. There is some volatility (std dev ~17). The promised lead time is 0, and the Period 1 observation confirms an actual lead time of 0 (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). Currently, on-hand inventory is 38 units. Since L=0, the OR backend needs parameters to cover the current period's demand (Review + Lead = 1 period). I will use the last 6 samples (including Period 1) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the demand appears relatively stable with a slight downward trend in the most recent two observations (85, 61). Setting N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the recent average and variance effectively.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Women's Jersey Leggings - Everyday Basics) shows stable demand in the early periods of the game (61 and 64 units). Historical data from January shows a range of 66\u2013111, with the most recent sample at 85. Average demand over all 7 available samples (5 historical + 2 game periods) is approximately 78.8. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 31 units with no units in transit. Since this is an 'Everyday Basic' item, demand is expected to remain relatively stable without significant seasonal spikes in late February. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand to anchor the forecast on the most recent 5 weeks (approximate mean of 73).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Women's Jersey Leggings) is a basic item. Current historical demand samples (66, 73, 111, 83, 85) and game history (P1: 61, P2: 64, P3: 78) show a relatively stable demand pattern with a slight upward trend in recent weeks. The average demand across these 8 data points is approximately 77 units per week. The promised lead time is 0, and the last 3 periods have confirmed that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (actual L=0). Given the stable lead time and the consistent demand, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (capturing the most recent data points including the game history) to account for the slight upward trend while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility. L remains default as 0 is confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Women's Jersey Leggings) has shown consistent lead times of 0 periods over the first four periods. The demand for the last 5 samples (including pre-game) has been: 66, 73, 111, 83, 85, 61, 64, 78, 48. There is a slight drop in the most recent period (48 units on March 4th), but the overall mean remains around 72 units per week. Given the date is March 11th, we are in a stable 'Everyday Basics' demand profile. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and variance to capture the most recent behavior (the last 4 game periods plus the final pre-game sample) and maintain the lead time at 0. The profit margin is $4 vs $1 holding cost, justifying a service level around 80%.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's jersey leggings, a wardrobe basic. Current date is 2019-03-18. Looking at the demand history, there was an initial phase with higher demand (P1-P3 avg: 67.7) followed by a notable drop in P4 and P5 (avg: 41.0). This could indicate a post-winter slowdown or a temporary fluctuation. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive same-period). Total inventory (on-hand 46 + 0 in-transit) is currently higher than the most recent weekly demand (34). To prevent overstocking during this apparent demand dip while maintaining a service level for this high-margin-to-holding-cost ratio SKU (Profit $4, Holding $1 results in a critical ratio of 0.8), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent downward trend while still accounting for the earlier higher volume. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $138.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. We are managing 'Leggings in sturdy jersey', a year-round basic item. Reviewing historical demand (including the provided pre-game samples), there was a notable peak in January (avg ~83) and early February (avg ~68 in Periods 1-3), which has now settled into a lower demand regime in the last three periods (Avg: 41.33). The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since demand has shifted downwards over the last 3 weeks, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid overstocking while demand is in this lower phase. A lead time of 0 (L+1 = 1) means we only need to cover the current period's demand. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock level that targets an optimal service level given the $4 profit and $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 4: Mean demand decreased from ~75 (P1-P3) to ~41 (P4-P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product (Women's Everyday Leggings) has seen a distinct demand regime shift starting around Period 4 (March 4th). Prior to Period 4, the mean demand was approximately 74 units (average of P1-P3 and historical seeds). From Period 4 to Period 7, the average demand has dropped to 39 units (48, 34, 42, 32). This consistent four-period sequence justifies using recent_N where N=4 to capture the localized mean and variance of this lower-demand regime. The promised lead time of 0 appears stable, as all previous orders (P1-P7) arrived in the same period (actual lead time = 0). Therefore, I will set L to 'default' (0), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to ensure the OR backend aligns with the current seasonal demand level for jersey basics in early spring.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), demand spiked to 72, which is significantly higher than the average of ~40 observed since Period 4. This resulted in a stockout (sold only 46, ending on-hand 0). The item is 'Leggings/Tights' from the 'Everyday Basics' category. The date transition from late March to early April often triggers demand for lighter basic layers in spring. I am treating the Period 8 spike (72) as a sign that the lower demand regime (avg 40) is ending and returning to a higher baseline (similar to the initial Period 1-3 avg of 67.6). I will use a shorter window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this upward shift quickly (averaging Period 6-8 gives ~48.6, which when multiplied by (1+L) provides a safer base stock). I will use N=8 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the recent stockout event. Lead time (L) remains 0 as verified by recent 'conclude' messages.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's jersey leggings, a basic everyday item. The historical demand shows a significant shift around Period 4. Previously (P1-P3), the mean was ~67. From P4 to P7, it dropped to ~39. However, Period 8 saw a spike to 72, followed by 40 in Period 9. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P4-P9) is 44.6, which represents the current 'low' regime with occasional volatility. The lead time consistently confirms a 0-period delivery (arriving same period as ordered). Given the recent stockout in Period 8 and the subsequent recovery in Period 9, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture the current demand level while acknowledging the lower average since early March. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using the last 6 periods (P4-P9) to balance the stable low demand with the recent spike.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Leggings) shows high volatility. While a regime shift was noted at Period 7 (mean decreased to ~41), Period 8 saw a significant spike to 72. However, the last two periods (P9 and P10) have seen demand drop to 40 and 24 respectively. The current date (April 22) doesn't suggest an immediate holiday spike, and demand appears to be settling back toward the lower average identified in the carry-over insights. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 (arrived in the same period), I will stay with lead time L=0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-regime-shift environment which includes the P8 outlier, providing a slightly conservative buffer (mean ~41.7 over last 7 periods) while reacting to the lower recent demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Women's Jersey Leggings) has transitioned through several demand regimes. After a low-demand period (P4-P7, avg ~39), demand has become more volatile but generally higher (P8-P11, avg ~46.5). Historically, demand for this 'everyday basic' item shows periodic spikes (P8: 72, P11: 50). The promised lead time is 0, and shipments have consistently arrived in the same period (L=0). On-hand inventory is very low (5 units) following a demand of 50 in Period 11. I will set the lead time to follow the observed data (L=0). To capture the recent increase in both demand level and volatility compared to the P4-P7 period, I will use a recent window of N=5 periods (P7-P11), which includes the most recent 'low' and the subsequent 'high' data points, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 43.6 units per period and accounting for the recent standard deviation increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased starting Period 8: Demand mean shifted from ~39 (P4-P7) to ~46.5 (P8-P11) with significantly higher variance (Range 24-72).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Women's Jersey Leggings) has moved through two distinct demand regimes. Initially, demand was higher (~75 units/period), dropped significantly between periods 4-7 (~39 units/period), and has recently stabilized at a slightly higher mean with significantly increased volatility in periods 8-12 (mean of 43.6, but with a range of 24 to 72). Period 12's demand was 32. Current on-hand is 28. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods (same-period arrival). Given the high volatility observed since Period 8, using a recent window (N=5) for the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters will allow the OR backend to capture this increased variance while reacting to the current demand level. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a target service level of 80% (z \u2248 0.84), making capturing recent volatility critical to avoid stockouts like the one seen in Period 8.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is a women's everyday basic (leggings), which usually exhibits relatively stable demand but can be influenced by stockouts or shifts in seasonality. Reviewing the history: Lead time is consistently 0 (all 13 periods arrived same-day). Demand has shown two distinct regimes: initially high (P1-P3 avg: ~68), followed by a drop (P4-P7 avg: ~39), and most recently a volatile phase (P8-P13). In the last 6 periods (P8-P13), demand has been: 72, 40, 24, 50, 32, 30. The average of these 6 periods is 41.33, with a high standard deviation (approx 16.5). Since lead time is 0, the forecast horizon is (L+1) = 1 period. I will use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility while maintaining a baseline mean that respects the current lower-demand trend compared to the very beginning of the history. On-hand is 30, and since L=0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock based on the target service level (Profit 4.0 / (4.0 + 1.0) = 0.8 crit ratio) and order the difference.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Womens Everyday Leggings) is currently in Period 15 (May 20). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Historical demand shown in the conclude messages from Period 8 to 14 suggests a volatile regime with a mean around 38.8 units (samples: 72, 40, 24, 50, 32, 30, 24). The demand appears to be stabilizing at a lower level in the last three periods (32, 30, 24, mean ~28.7) compared to the spike in Period 8. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target cycle service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80. My goal is to set parameters that maintain enough stock for this volatility without over-ordering. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture the regime since Period 8, and recent_N of 7 for sigma_hat to reflect the higher observed variance in this window compared to the very early periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Women's Everyday Leggings) is currently in Period 16 (late May). Analysis of the last several periods (P11-P15) shows a consistent downward trend in demand: 50, 32, 30, 24, 17. The mean demand for these 5 periods is 30.6. This suggests a seasonal decline as warmer weather approaches, reducing demand for basic jersey leggings. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent deceleration and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility (which has stabilized compared to the mid-regime spike). This strategy aims to reduce ending inventory (currently at 37) and minimize holding costs while the item faces decreasing seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline detected starting Period 11: mean dropped from ~46.5 (P8-P11) to ~30.6 (P11-P15), correlating with seasonal transition into late spring/summer.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is Women's Jersey Leggings, which typically experience a seasonal decline as weather warms in late spring and summer (as noted in the Period 16 carry-over insight). Analysis of the last 5 periods (P12-P16) shows demand has stabilized at a lower level with a mean of 25.4 (32, 30, 24, 17, 24). This is a significant drop from the mean of 46.5 seen in early spring. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with the most recent order arriving as expected. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current low-demand summer regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a lower base stock level. This reduces the risk of overstocking and incurring high holding costs ($1.0/unit) during a period of lower sales potential.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Leggings' item. Demand has significantly cooled off as we move into summer (June). Specifically, demand in Period 17 dropped to 6 units, following a trend of low demand (averaging ~19 units over P14-P17). The current on-hand inventory is 25 units, which already covers more than 4 weeks of the most recent demand level. To prevent overstocking and unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (P14-P17) to reflect this summer slowdown. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed: Demand mean dropped to ~19 units (P14-P17) from ~31 units (P11-P14), a 38% decrease as temperatures rise.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Leggings in sturdy jersey', a basic item that has shown a strong downward seasonal trend as we move into summer (June). Demand in the last two periods has been extremely low (6 and 5 units). The 'Summer demand trough' identified in Period 18 is clearly persisting. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Inventory on hand is currently 20 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 3-4 weeks of current demand levels. To avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a service level for this low-demand period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 samples (Periods 15-18) to reflect this new low-demand regime (mean ~13 units).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, which is mid-summer. The product (women's leggings) is currently in a confirmed summer demand trough. In the last four periods (P16-P19), demand has been 24, 6, 5, and 15 units, respectively. This averages to 12.5 units per period. The 'Carry-over Insights' previously noted a drop to ~19 units, but current data suggests an even deeper trough as temperatures peak for the summer season. Inventory is currently at 6 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels during this low-demand period, I will adjust mu_hat using the most recent 4 samples (N=4) to capture this deepened trough. Sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the current low but variable demand level.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough deepened: Demand mean for P16-P19 dropped to 12.5 units from previous insight of 19 units.

This represents a significant sustained drop from the spring mean of ~30-46 units. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. With 9 units currently on-hand and 0 in-transit, I am setting the base stock to cover this current low-demand regime using the most recent 5 periods (recent_N=5) to avoid overstocking and incurring unnecessary holding costs during the off-season.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (sturdy leggings) is in a deep summer demand trough as of early July. Demand in the most recent 4 periods (P18-P21) has averaged 9.75 units (5, 15, 11, 8), which aligns with the carry-over insight from P20 indicating a shift to ~12.5 units or fewer during peak summer. On-hand inventory is currently 11 units. Given lead time is consistently 0 periods, we should maintain lean inventory to minimize holding costs while covering these low demand levels. I will use a window of N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this stabilized low-demand regime (P17-P21 demand: 6, 5, 15, 11, 8; Mean = 9). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current summer trough rather than the higher spring averages.

The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the middle of summer, which is the historical demand trough for this SKU (leggings in sturdy jersey). Demand over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) has averaged ~8.3 units (6, 5, 15, 11, 8, 5), which is significantly lower than the previous regime of ~12.5 recorded in Period 20. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect this current summer baseline. These parameters will allow the OR backend to maintain a lean inventory (on-hand is currently 8 units) while aiming for the target 80% service level necessary for a $4 profit vs $1 holding cost structure.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline further stabilized at ~8.3 units per period (P17-P22), down from the ~12.5 units observed in the early summer transition (P16-P19).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Leggings) is currently in a summer demand trough, but Period 23 saw a significant demand spike to 29 units, causing a stockout (ending inventory 0). This spike likely represents a mid-summer clearance or a minor early-season pre-stocking event, as it significantly deviates from the previous 6-period average of ~8.3 units. Lead time remains stable at 0. Because of the stockout and the recent volatility, I need to raise the base stock slightly to recover and protect against similar spikes while maintaining sensitivity to the overall low summer baseline. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime shift and the latest spike (averaging ~13 units per period), and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility (std dev approx 8.3). This balances the need for more inventory to handle spikes like the one in P23 without over-ordering for a generally low-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Observed first significant demand spike (29 units) within the summer trough, indicating potential increased volatility or early mid-summer demand patterns.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (leggings) is experiencing a mid-summer demand spike. Demand for Period 23 was 29 units and Period 24 was 30 units, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average of ~8.3 units. This suggests the 'summer trough' has ended or a mid-season event is driving traffic. On-hand inventory is currently 0, following two consecutive periods of stockouts where only 12 and 19 units were sold against demands of 29 and 30, respectively. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To recover service levels and capture this new demand level, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to focus on the last 3 periods (P22-P24) to capture this upward shift, while maintaining L=0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand recovery: Demand increased from baseline ~8.3 to ~29.5 units over P23-P24, ending the summer trough. Volatility is also elevated.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Women's Leggings) is showing a clear mid-summer recovery trend as we enter August. After a prolonged summer trough where demand averaged ~8 units (P17-P22), the last three periods (P23-P25) have recorded demand of 29, 30, and 27 units respectively. This indicates a new, stable demand regime for late summer, likely driven by 'back-to-school' preparation or late summer shopping. The mean demand for these last 3 periods is 28.67. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this significant upward shift and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this new regime. On-hand inventory is low (7 units), so the OR backend should trigger a replenishment order to meet this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer recovery confirmed (P23-P25): Demand shifted from a trough of ~8 units to a new stable mean of ~28.7 units, likely associated with pre-autumn shopping trends.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Leggings) has clearly moved out of its summer trough (approx. 8 units/period) into a mid-summer/pre-autumn recovery phase. Demand for the last four periods (P23-P26) has been 29, 30, 27, and 37, representing a new stable mean of approximately 30.75 units. Period 26 demand (37) reached a new local peak, and we ended the period with 0 on-hand inventory, indicating we are under-stocking for this new regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this specific post-trough recovery. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility seen during this transition. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer recovery regime (P23-P26) solidified: Mean demand increased from ~8.3 to ~30.8 units per period (+270%), marking the end of the summer trough and the start of pre-autumn demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a significant demand recovery phase corresponding to the pre-autumn (Back-to-School) season. Recent demand (P27) spiked to 62 units, significantly higher than the previous mid-summer recovery average of ~30 units (P23-P26). This suggests a rapid upward trend. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we experienced stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods (P23, P24, P26, P27), indicating the previous forecasts were too conservative for this seasonal shift. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' (historically 0 periods), and use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 (P23-P27) to capture the accelerating demand. Given the sharp increase in volatility (range 27-62 in the last 3 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to ensure a higher service level and minimize further stockouts during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Pre-autumn demand surge acceleration: Demand increased from a mean of ~30.8 (P23-P26) to 62 units in Period 27, signaling the start of a high-demand seasonal peak.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its pre-autumn/back-to-school peak (late August). Demand has accelerated significantly from its summer trough (~8 units) to a recent high-demand regime. Specifically, the last two periods (P27-P28) saw demands of 62 and 46 units (mean ~54). This aligns with the 'everyday basics leggings' category as school and cooler weather approach. We are currently facing stockouts/low inventory (on-hand is 4), and the previous orders were insufficient to cover the surge. I will set mu_hat to address this new regime using the last 2-3 periods of data. Given the volatility of this shift (range 27-62 in the last 4 weeks), I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the recent high average of ~54 to ensure the base stock calculation captures the peak. L remains at 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Pre-autumn peak confirmed (P27-P28): Demand mean shifted to ~54 units (previously ~30), likely driven by back-to-school jersey basics demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '457892003' (Leggings in sturdy jersey) is entering the high-demand autumn season. Historically (P1-P3 in Feb), demand was ~66-78. After a significant summer trough, demand has rebounded strongly: P27 (62 units), P28 (46 units), and P29 (39 units). The mean demand for the last 3 periods (P27-P29) is ~49 units. Given the transition into September, we expect demand to remain high or increase slightly as cooler weather sets in, aligning with the early-year baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent window of N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level (1+L)*mu + z*sigma covers the upcoming period's volatility while accounting for the current on-hand inventory of 28.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: P27-P29 demand mean is 49.0 units, recovering from summer lows and returning towards the early-year baseline (~66-78 units).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (sturdy jersey leggings) is currently in an autumn demand recovery phase. As of September 9th, demand has stabilized at a higher level than the summer trough, with recent observations for P27-P30 being 62, 46, 39, and 53. The mean demand for this most recent 4-period high-demand regime is 50.0 units. Observed lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Inventory is low (6 units on hand), so I will use a recent window (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher autumn baseline and ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the 50+ unit demand per period. This balances the risk of stockouts during the back-to-school/autumn peak against the holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Leggings in sturdy jersey' has entered an autumn recovery phase as of Period 27 (mid-August). The mean demand from Period 27 to Period 31 is approximately 48.8 units, which is significantly higher than the mid-summer recovery level of ~30.8 and the deep summer trough of ~8. This shift aligns with the back-to-school season and cooler weather transitions in September. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific autumn regime (P27-P31). The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as evidenced by all recent deliveries arriving in the same period they were ordered. Current on-hand inventory is 15, and there is no pipeline inventory, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order size based on this updated baseline to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 26 and 27 while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Leggings in sturdy jersey' has transitioned from its summer trough (approx. 8-12 units) into a higher autumn regime. Analysis of Period 27-32 shows a stabilized demand mean of 47.5 units (62, 46, 39, 53, 44, 41) as we enter late September. This aligns with typical 'back-to-school' and early autumn seasonal trends for jersey basics. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (profit $4 vs holding $1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (P27-P32), which accurately captures this confirmed post-summer regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current demand level without over-ordering as the initial 'surge' (P27) levels off.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: P27-P32 demand mean is 47.5 units, confirming a return to high-season baseline after the summer trough.

This aligns with late September/early October seasonal demand for basic jersey leggings as weather cools. Because the starting on-hand inventory is 0 for Period 34 and we just experienced a stock-out (sold 55 vs. 87 demand), I need to aggressively adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this upward shift and prevent further lost sales. I will use recent_N=7 to focus on the autumn regime (P27-P33), but I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a higher baseline of 65 units (reflecting the recent average and the high P33 demand) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this potential new peak. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge acceleration: Demand spiked to 87 units in Period 33, increasing the autumn regime mean (P27-P33) to 53.1 units. This suggests a higher seasonal peak than previously estimated.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Leggings) is currently in an autumn demand surge. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 87 units and remained high at 63 units in Period 34. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P27-P34), since the end of the summer trough, is 54.125 units, which aligns with the early-year baseline (P1-P4 mean ~66). Given the product description ('sturdy jersey'), demand is expected to remain strong as weather cools in October. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture this stabilized autumn regime while reflecting the recent upward volatility (sigma). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the current higher demand level while considering the profit ($4) vs. holding cost ($1) ratio.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P33-P35) shows a significant escalation in the autumn peak, with demand values of 87, 63, and 70 (mean \u2248 73.3). This represents a shift from the previous autumn baseline of ~47.5 units observed between P27-P32. As of Period 36 (mid-October), we are in the heart of the high-demand season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' leggings. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this most recent sustained surge (P33-P35), ensuring the base stock level (target inventory) accounts for this higher mean. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on the historical pattern of same-period arrivals (L=0).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak intensified starting Period 33: Mean demand increased from ~47.5 (P27-P32) to ~73.3 (P33-P35), a 54% increase identifying a core high-season regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Women's Jersey Leggings) is currently in its peak autumn/high-season regime, which began specifically around Period 33. Demand over the last four periods (P33-P36) has been consistently elevated: 87, 63, 70, and 61 units, resulting in a mean of 70.25 units. This is a significant jump from the previous autumn baseline of ~47.5 units and validates the 'Autumn demand peak intensified' insight. The current date is 2019-10-21, entering the late-October period where apparel demand for basics like leggings generally remains strong before potentially shifting for winter. Given lead time remains stable at 0 periods (as confirmed by recent history), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this intensified peak regime and ensure the OR backend targets a high service level for this profitable basic item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost). Lead time (L) remains at default (promised 0).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 is currently in an intense Autumn/Winter high-demand regime. Period 37 demand reached 91 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Analyzing the core high-season regime from Period 33 to 37, the demand mean has shifted upward significantly. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is approximately 74.4 units (87, 63, 70, 61, 91), compared to the earlier autumn mean of ~49. Given the product is 'Leggings/Tights in sturdy jersey', we are moving into the peak cold-weather season in late October, where demand for basic warm layers typically remains high or increases. To ensure a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level via the OR backend), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the latest shift to over 70 units/period and the associated higher volatility (std dev ~13) while discounting the lower summer and early autumn data. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: High-season peak intensification: Demand mean (P33-P37) is 74.4 units with high volatility, representing the core late-autumn demand for jersey leggings.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/04 (Period 39), which places the SKU in the peak autumn/winter high-season for jersey leggings. Analysis of the demand regime starting from Period 33 shows a stable, high mean of 73.5 units (P33-P38: 87, 63, 70, 61, 91, 69). The most recent observation (Period 38) shows demand of 69 units following a spike of 91, confirming sustained high-season volume with significant volatility (standard deviation of ~11.5 during this specific regime). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this 'high-season peak' regime, I will use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the current high demand level and sufficient volatility to maintain high service levels while avoiding over-reliance on the much lower summer data.

Carry-over insight: High-season peak regime (P33-P38) stabilized: Mean demand of 73.5 units confirmed, returning to or slightly exceeding early-year baseline levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-season peak regime (autumn/winter for jersey leggings). The core high-season regime identified in Period 33 has stabilized with a mean around 73.5 units. Specifically, for the last 7 periods (P33-P39), demand values were 87, 63, 70, 61, 91, 69, 72. Calculating the mean for these 7 periods gives 73.3 units. Given the date (Nov 11) and the product type (sturdy jersey leggings), we are in the peak period before potential late-winter tapering. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (ordered and arrived in the same period). To ensure we meet this high demand and minimize lost sales (which happened in P33, P35, and P37), I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this specific intensified peak regime. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to reflect the current high volatility (std dev over these 7 periods is approx 10.6), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock (z-score approximately 0.84 for Q=0.8).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/18, entering the late autumn/winter season. The product is 'Jersey Basic Leggings', which typically sees high demand during cooler months. Historically, we've identified a 'High-season peak regime' starting around Period 33 (late September), which has remained stable through Period 40. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P33-P40) is 71.5 units (87, 63, 70, 61, 91, 69, 72, 59). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by 'arrived=ordered' in the same periods throughout history. Current on-hand inventory is 24 units with no units in transit. Since the current demand regime is stable and reflects the high-season baseline, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this specific regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the risk of stockouts during the seasonal peak while managing holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 457892003 (Jersey Leggings) is currently in a stable high-season peak. Analysis of the regime starting at Period 33 shows a mean demand of approximately 71.0 units (Period 33-41: 87, 63, 70, 61, 91, 69, 72, 59, 70). This aligns with the 'High-season peak' identified in carry-over insights and historical early-year demand. Current date is November 25, 2019, which is still within the core demand period for this category (Womens Everyday Basics). Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9) to capture this specific high-demand regime. Since the current lead time is 0, the backend will calculate base_stock as (1+0)*mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. The ending on-hand inventory is low (12 units), so the system should place a significant order to cover the next period's expected high demand (~71 units) and maintain a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: High-season demand regime (starting Period 33) is stable with a mean of ~71.0 units (P33-P41), confirming return to early-year baseline levels.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 457892003 (sturdy jersey leggings) has shown a significant surge as of Period 42 (2019/11/25), with demand reaching 118 units. This aligns with the start of the winter holiday shopping season (late November/early December). Prior to this, the high-season regime (P33-P41) was stable around a mean of 71.0 units. The spike to 118 units suggests a new seasonal peak regime, likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday and winter demand. I will shift the forecasting window to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent increase in both volume and volatility (std dev) while moving away from the lower autumn average. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected starting Period 42: Demand spiked to 118 units (+66% over autumn mean of 71.0).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand of 118 (P42) followed by 47 (P43) shows high volatility typical of the December holiday season. While P43 saw a drop, we are in the peak period leading up to Christmas (Dec 9th), which usually sustains or increases demand for 'Everyday Basics' like leggings. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 11 periods (P33-P43) which captures the core high-season regime, resulting in a mean of approximately 75 units. This provides a robust baseline that respects the recent 118 spike and the 47 dip. I'll use a recent window (N=11) for sigma_hat as well to capture the current high volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P43) mean currently 82.5 units, though volatility is extremely high (range 47-118). Higher safety stock is required for the final weeks of the year.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday shopping period (Period 45). Demand for jersey leggings has shown a significant surge starting in Period 42 (118 units), followed by high volatility (47 and 68 units in Recent Periods 43 and 44). The mean demand for this 'Holiday Surge' (P42-P44) is approximately 77.7 units, which is higher than the previous high-season mean of 71 units. Given that we are exactly in the peak pre-Christmas weeks, I expect demand to remain elevated and volatile. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the behavior of the current holiday regime (P42-P44) while maintaining enough safety stock to handle potential spikes before the year-end slowdown. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 periods captures the current average of ~78 units and the associated high variance.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P44) mean confirmed at 77.7 units with high volatility (range 47-118), representing the peak seasonal demand for jersey basics.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the peak holiday shopping week. Historically, this product (jersey leggings) saw a massive spike of 118 units in Period 42 (late November/Black Friday) and has maintained a high-season mean of approximately 77.7 units over the last four weeks (P42-P45: 118, 47, 68, 67). As we are at the very end of the year and the holiday peak, demand is expected to remain high before potentially dropping in January. Inventory on-hand is 42 units. With a promised lead time of 0, I will set mu_hat using the recent holiday regime (N=4) to ensure we capture the current high demand levels (~75 units/period). Sigma_hat will also be set based on this recent high-volatility period (range 47-118) to provide adequate safety stock and prevent stockouts during the final peak days.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the final period of the year. The historical data shows a holiday demand regime (P42-P46) with a mean of ~72.8 units (118, 47, 68, 67, 64) and high volatility. Given this is the final order period, the goal is to satisfy remaining holiday demand while minimizing year-end holding costs for inventory that will enter the typically slower January period. Since the holiday spike (118 units in P42) has subsided into a stable range of 64-68 units over the last three periods, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this end-of-year plateau. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the variance observed during this holiday peak period. This approach ensures we are stocked for a potential final surge while acknowledging the recent stabilization of demand.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P46) stabilized at a mean of ~72.8 units after an initial spike of 118, with the last 3 periods showing high consistency (64-68 units).
