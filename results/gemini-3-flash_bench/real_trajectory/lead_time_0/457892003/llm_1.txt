The spike on 2019-01-21 (111) might be a post-holiday outlier or promotion. Excluding it, the average is ~77. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0. With L=0, an order placed in Period 1 arrives in Period 1 and is available for Period 1 demand. d) Inventory Assessment: Current on-hand is 0. I need to cover Period 1 demand immediately. e) Final Order Logic: Since L=0, I order enough for the current period plus a small safety buffer for variance.

The peak of 111 occurred around late January, possibly due to post-holiday sales or early spring shopping. \nLead Time: Period 1's order was placed and arrived in the same period, confirming a lead time (L) of 0. \nInventory Position: Current on-hand is 29.

The drop to 48 last period appears to be a local variation rather than a permanent downward trend, as basic items typically maintain steady volume. The date is early March, which is a stable period for everyday basics before late spring/summer shifts. In terms of logistics, the supplier has consistently delivered with a lead time of 0 (same-period arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 102 units. Given the lead time is 0, the total pipeline requirement (L+1 periods) is just for the current period's demand plus safety stock. Forecasting demand at approximately 75 units, the current 102 units on-hand are sufficient to cover Period 5 demand with a comfortable buffer. To maintain an 'order-up-to' level that targets roughly 1.5 to 2 weeks of safety stock (protecting against potential delays or spikes), I will order 50 units.

With an expected demand of ~42 units for Period 7, the 76 units on hand are sufficient to cover demand for nearly two weeks (Period 7 and Period 8). To minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while maintaining a safe buffer for a 0-lead-time item, I will place an order of 0 units this period.

Recent demand shows a clear downward trend, with the most recent observation being only 17 units. As we enter late May (Period 16, 2019/5/27), we expect demand to remain low or continue softening as weather warms, making heavy jersey leggings less seasonally relevant. Current On-hand is 49 units, which covers nearly 3 weeks of the most recent demand level (17 units). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To minimize holding costs (which are $1.0 vs $4.0 profit) given the inventory cushion and declining trend, I will not place an order this period. I will let the current stock deplete to see if a new lower baseline or seasonal exit is established.",

As of Period 18 (June 10), we are well into the summer season in the Northern Hemisphere, which traditionally sees a significant drop in demand for heavyweight jersey items in favor of lighter alternatives or shorts. (b) Demand Regime Analysis: Demand has collapsed significantly. Recent demand since the start of May (P13-P17) follows a clear downward trajectory: 30, 24, 17, 24, 6. The most recent observation (6 units) is the lowest recorded to date. (c) Lead Time: Consistently confirmed at 0 periods throughout the history. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 19 units with no units in transit. (e) Final Order Logic: The current on-hand inventory (19 units) is more than 3x the most recent demand (6 units) and exceeds the average demand of the last three periods (~15.6 units). Given the $1.00 per unit holding cost and the high probability that demand will remain low or continue to dwindle throughout June, no new order is required.
