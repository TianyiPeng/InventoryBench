Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical data shows a significant upward trend in demand: 2, 1, 22, 71, 102 units over the last five weeks. This product is a 'Period tote' (spacious leather imitation handbag). The demand surge in late January and early February (reaching 102 units) strongly aligns with the lead-up to Valentine's Day. Since the next week includes February 14th, I expect demand to remain high or slightly peak before tapering off. Given the rapid change from single digits to over 100 units, the default mean (approx. 40) is too low. I will use the last 3 samples (22, 71, 102) to capture the current high-demand regime. This results in a mu_hat calculation of (1+0)*mean(22, 71, 102) = 65. However, since the most recent observation is 102 and we are in the peak gift-giving week, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 110 to ensure sufficient stock for this Valentine's week and prevent stockouts. For volatility, I will use recent_N=3 to reflect the high-variance nature of this seasonal spike.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The SKU is a 'Period tote', a spacious handbag. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 2, 1, 22, 71, 102, and most recently 86 in Period 1. This suggests a post-holiday build-up or a specific seasonal trend for this accessory category. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on Period 1's conclusion (ordered 144, arrived 144). Current on-hand is 58 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent high-demand regime (71, 102, 86) while smoothing the volatility. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the increased variance in this higher demand bracket. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover the current momentum without over-investing in inventory given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Spacious handbag', and current dates (Feb 11 - Feb 25) align with the lead-up to and immediate aftermath of Valentine's Day. Historical demand grew from near zero in early January to 102 by Feb 4. Period 1 (Feb 11) saw demand of 86, and Period 2 (Feb 18) spiked to 118, causing a stockout as demand exceeded available inventory (starting 100, demand 118). The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on Period 1 and 2 arrivals. Demand is currently in a high-regime state (~100 units/week). I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture this high Feb demand (avg of 102, 86, 118 is ~102). Given the stockout in P2 and rising trend, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 120 for the next period (L=0, so 1+L=1) to ensure we cover the current peak and recover from the stockout. Sigma is set based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Feb: Mean demand increased from ~25 in Jan to ~100+ in Feb (+300% change).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are forecasting for Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demand shows a clear regime shift: Jan demand was low (avg ~24), while Feb demand (the last 4 weeks including Period 1-3 from the history) surged significantly (102, 86, 118, 55). Moving into March, the 'Period tote' (a spacious handbag) likely maintains this higher baseline, though Period 3 saw a dip to 55. The average for the last 4 periods is ~90. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times have consistently been 0 periods, I will set L=0. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current high-demand regime, as the earlier Jan data is no longer relevant for the current stock policy. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR backend to react to the increased mean and volatility of this new level.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Period tote) shows a distinct shift in demand behavior. In January, demand samples averaged around 25. Since February (Period 1-4), demand has stabilized at a higher level, averaging ~78.5 units per week (86, 118, 55, 55). The 'Carry-over Insight' previously noted a shift to 100+, but recent samples from Periods 3 and 4 suggest the actual mean of this new regime is lower, around 80. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all four concluded periods (P1-P4), matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 58 units with 0 in transit. To account for the current regime while acknowledging the recent dip to 55 units, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the entirety of this February/March demand shift. Setting L to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent 0-period observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in Feb/Mar: mean demand settled at approximately 79 units (N=4), lower than the initial spike but significantly higher than Jan.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th (Period 6). Historically, the SKU (Spacious Handbag) saw a massive demand spike in early February (up to 118 units) which has since stabilized. The demand over the last three periods (Periods 3, 4, and 5) has been remarkably consistent at 55, 55, and 49 units respectively, averaging 53 units per period. The earlier spike in Periods 1 and 2 (86 and 118 units) appears to be a separate, higher-demand regime. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). With current on-hand inventory at 55 units and a stable demand around 53, the OR engine needs parameters reflective of this current 'post-spike' stability. I will use N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent plateau (approx. 53 units/period) while excluding the Feb volatility. L remains at the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further in March: Periods 3-5 show mean demand of 53 units/period with significantly lower volatility compared to Feb.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a spacious handbag, a relatively stable accessory item. Reviewing historical data from Jan to Mar 2019, demand surged in February (avg ~102) but has transitioned to a lower, stable regime in March. In the last three periods (Period 4, 5, 6), demand was 55, 49, and 25 respectively. The most recent demand (25) suggests the post-February peak is ending as we move further into spring. I am setting N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this cooling trend. Lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by 'arrived=X (ordered on Period Z, lead_time was 0 periods)' in all historical periods. For mu_hat, using recent_N (N=3) results in (1+0) * mean(55, 49, 25) = 43. For sigma_hat, using recent_N (N=3) captures the current tightening variance. This approach ensures we avoid overstocking a cooling trend while maintaining a safe service level for the $4 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: March demand has decelerated significantly from Feb, dropping from average ~100 to latest demand of 25 (-75%).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st. Looking at the demand history for the 'Spacious handbag' (SKU 639448001), demand has been highly volatile throughout February and March, fluctuating between 25 and 118 units. Recent performance (Periods 5-7) shows demands of 49, 25, and 55. While the carry-over insight mentioned a drop to 25 in Period 6, Period 7 rebounded to 55, suggesting the regime hasn't fully collapsed but is averaging around 45-50 units recently. Since 'Lead Time 0' is consistently confirmed every period (actual matches promised), I will maintain the 'calculate' method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, the recent 3-period window (P5-P7) provides a more relevant mean (~43) and variance for early Spring demand compared to the high-spike data from February. This setting allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers immediate demand without overstocking on a product that may be moving past its peak season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 is currently in an April demand phase. Analyzing recent performance: Period 8 demand was 61 (stockout), Period 7 was 55, and Period 6 was 25. The mean demand for the last 3 periods is 47. Although demand in late Feb/early March was around 50-55, the most recent week showed a peak of 61. With April moving toward mid-month, demand appears to be stabilizing or slightly increasing from the late March dip. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there is nothing in transit, I need to restock effectively. I will set mu_hat to the mean of the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the recent range (25, 55, 61), which averages to 47. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by continuous arrival timestamps.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand regime in late March/early April has stabilized following the previous drop; recent 3-period mean is 47 (range 25-61). Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a spacious handbag, a relatively stable accessory item. Current date is mid-April. Looking at recent demand history: P9=37, P8=61, P7=55, P6=25. The 4-period average is 44.5. The 'Carry-over Insight' from P9 noted a recent 3-period mean of 47. Demand seems to have stabilized after the initial February/March fluctuations. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived in same period). I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture this stable post-peak demand regime, as it reflects the current spring season. mu_hat target is for (1+L) periods, and with L=0, this is just the expected demand for the next period. Calculation for mu_hat (N=4): (1+0) * mean(37, 61, 55, 25) = 44.5. sigma_hat will also be calculated using N=4 to reflect recent variance. The backend OR logic will use these to calculate the base stock and place an order to cover the gap between current on-hand (27) and the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in April: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P6-P9) is 44.5 units, significantly lower than the February peak (~100) but higher than January levels.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a spacious handbag, which typically sees demand spikes in early spring (Feb/Mar) and a stabilization thereafter. Historical data and recent 'conclude' messages show a high-demand period in February (averaging ~100) followed by a stabilization in March and April. The most recent demand samples from Period 6 to Period 10 (25, 55, 61, 37, 35) yield a mean of 42.6. This represents a confirmed lower-demand regime compared to early February. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods as confirmed by every historical conclude message (P1-P10). I will use the recent N=5 samples to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stabilized demand level and volatility (std approx 14.5), ensuring the OR backend targets a service level based on the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late March/April: Recent 5-period mean is 42.6 units (range 25-61), confirming a shift away from the high-volatility February peak (~100).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a spacious handbag. Demand has stabilized significantly since the mid-February peak (avg ~100). For the last 6 periods (P6-P11), demand has averaged 38.8 units (25, 55, 61, 37, 35, 20), showing a consistent downward trend from the high-volatility period. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the recent lower demand levels in late April, I will use recent_N=6 to capture this localized stability and avoid over-ordering based on the high-demand February historical data. This approach sets a base stock that covers the expected 40-unit demand while accounting for the recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late April: 6-period mean (P6-P11) is 38.8 units (range 20-61), confirming a significant reduction in volatility and volume compared to the early spring peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a 'Period tote' (spacious handbag). Historical demand for the last seven periods (P6-P12) has been relative stable with values of 25, 55, 61, 37, 35, 20, and 50. This results in a 7-period mean of 40.4. While May could see a slight uptick due to Mother's Day, there is no evidence yet of a significant seasonal shift in the data compared to the late-April demand (50). On-hand inventory is very low (3 units). Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the current post-February demand regime, which is more stable than the early spring peak.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. This product is a spacious handbag, a fashion accessory. Reviewing demand history since the post-February stabilization (Period 6 onwards), demand has remained relatively consistent within a moderate range. Specifically, over the last 8 periods (P6-P13), demand has averaged 40.875 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.5. The most recent demand (P13) was 44, aligning with this trend. There is no significant evidence of new seasonal spikes or drops for mid-May in the historical data for this category. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. I will use a window of 8 periods (N=8) to capture this stable post-peak regime for calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the L parameter at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further over late spring: 8-period mean (P6-P13) is 40.9 units (range 20-61), indicating low-to-moderate sustained demand after the February peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Women's spacious handbag) is currently in a stable late-spring demand regime. Since Period 6 (mid-March), demand has fluctuated between 20 and 61 units, with a mean of approximately 42 units over the last 9 periods. The most recent demand (Period 14) was 45 units, very close to this average. Period 15 (late May) does not typically coincide with major retail spikes for this category before the summer season. On-hand inventory is low (8 units), but the lead time is consistently 0, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use the last 9 periods (N=9, corresponding to the regime post-February spike) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we capture the current volatility while ignoring the outdated high-volume February data, allowing the OR backend to target a service level based on the current $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a women's tote bag. Demand has been relatively stable in the late spring period (approx. 40-50 units/period), with a slight uptick to 60 units in the most recent period (P15). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Historical data from earlier in the year (Jan/Feb) showed a significant peak, but the regime from Period 6 onwards represents a stable post-peak phase. The recent 5-period mean (P11-P15) is 43.8 units, while the recent 3-period mean is 49.6 units, reflecting the minor recent increase. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slightly higher late-spring demand level while maintaining the efficiency of the 0-period lead time. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May: Recent 5-period mean (P11-P15) is 43.8 units (range 20-60), showing slight growth compared to the late April/early May average of 40.9.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 3 (Period 17), the product (a spacious handbag) remains in a stable demand regime appropriate for late spring/early summer. The historical demand context shows a significant peak in February/March (mu ~100), followed by a stabilization in April/May. The most recent demand (P16) was 28 units, and the 5-period mean through P16 is 45.4 units (44, 45, 60, 28, plus the implied 50 from P12). Looking at the Carry-Over Insights, the demand has fluctuated between roughly 20 and 60 units since mid-April. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods consistently. Given the volatility (\u03c3) observed in the recent 5-7 weeks, using recent_N (N=6) for demand parameters provides a balanced forecast that accounts for the current stabilization while ignoring the obsolete February spikes. This supports a service level aligned with the profit($4)/holding cost($1) ratio.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 18 (June 10, 2019). The product is a 'Spacious handbag', which typically sees standard year-round demand with periodic fluctuations. Reviewing physical performance since Period 11 (mid-to-late spring), demand has stabilized significantly. The last 7 periods (P11-P17) show demands of 20, 50, 44, 45, 60, 28, and 29. This averages to approximately 39.4 units per period. The recent two weeks (28, 29) suggest a slight cooling from the late May peak of 60. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable post-peak demand regime while smoothing out the volatility observed in May. Setting L=0 as it is the promised and consistently observed lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Period tote) is in Period 19 (mid-June). Demand in the most recent period (P18) was exceptionally low at 7 units, following a stable range of 20-60 units throughout May and early June. The current date is 2019/6/17, and there are no immediate major retail holidays in the upcoming week; however, the recent drop significantly pulls down the short-term average. Lead time is consistently 0. I will refine the demand forecast using a recent_N window of 5 periods (P14-P18) to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the historical volatility seen in this category (sturdy grained imitation leather tote). Mean demand for P14-P18 is 29.8 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently high at 45 units relative to the last demand point, so the OR backend will likely minimize additional ordering to avoid holding costs unless the base stock calculation exceeds the current stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: Demand dropped to 7 units, significantly below the late-spring average of ~44 (84% decrease), suggesting a potential transition into a lower-velocity summer phase.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '639448001' (Womens Spacious Handbag) has entered a significantly lower demand phase as of mid-June. Demand dropped from a late-spring average of ~44 units to 7 units in Period 18 and 4 units in Period 19. This suggests a transition into a low-velocity summer regime where demand for this specific large handbag style has cooled. Current on-hand inventory is 47 units, which is roughly 8-10 times the current weekly demand. Given the promised lead time of 0 (confirmed by continuous history of same-period arrivals) and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio that suggests a service level target of 0.80, the primary risk is now overstocking and unnecessary holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current low-demand volatility, effectively signaling the OR backend to minimize orders while the current stock is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 18: Late June demand dropped to an average of 5.5 units (P18-P19), compared to the previous spring average of ~44 (-87% change).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The SKU is a 'Spacious handbag in sturdy grained imitation leather,' which typically sees higher demand in late winter and spring and lower demand in summer. Historical demand data shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 18 (June 10th). Demand dropped from a spring average of ~44 units per period to an average of 5.66 units over the last three periods (P18: 7, P19: 4, P20: 6). This low-demand summer phase is now confirmed as a sustained pattern (3 consecutive periods). Lead time remains confirmed at 0, as orders consistently arrive within the same period. With 41 units currently on-hand and an expected demand of ~6 units/period, the current inventory level covers nearly 7 periods of demand. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-velocity regime and prevent over-stocking during the summer lull, while maintaining the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand regime confirmed (P18-P20): Mean demand has decreased to 5.7 units/period, representing an 87% drop from the spring peak (~44).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Spacious handbag) has entered a clear summer low-demand regime starting from Period 18 (June). Recent demand samples (P18-P21) are 7, 4, 6, 5, resulting in a 4-period mean of 5.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 36 units, which represents over 6 periods of supply at the current demand rate. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the 0-period lead time, we should avoid ordering until inventory levels drop significantly. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this sustained low-velocity regime and minimize further inventory accumulation.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Women's spacious handbag) is currently in a distinct 'summer low' demand regime. Since Period 18 (June 10), demand has consistently ranged between 4 and 7 units per week, following a significant drop from the spring average of ~44. The last 5 periods (P18-P22) have demand values of 7, 4, 6, 5, and 7, resulting in a mean of 5.8 units/period. The current date is July 15, which is mid-summer, supporting the continuation of this low-velocity phase. With 29 units on hand and a promised lead time of 0 (consistently observed as 0 in history), the current inventory is sufficient for approximately 5 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the steady, low demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this specific regime precisely and avoid overstocking while demand remains low.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (handbag) is currently in a sustained low-demand summer regime. Since Period 18 (June 10th), demand has consistently remained between 4 and 7 units per period. The 6-period mean (P18-P23) is approximately 5.67 units. Current inventory on-hand is 24 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at this rate. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00), the OR backend should aim to reduce excess stock. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this low-velocity regime and minimize further ordering until inventory levels align with current demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 based on history.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Women's Spacious Handbag) is currently in a stable summer low-demand regime. Analysis of the demand history from Period 18 (June 10) to Period 24 (July 22) shows a consistent mean of approximately 5.57 units per period (7, 4, 6, 5, 7, 5, 5). The previous spring regime (P1-P17) had significantly higher volume (~45 units) which is no longer relevant for the current seasonal inventory needs. The current on-hand inventory is 19 units, which covers approximately 3.4 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead time is consistently 0. I will continue using a recent_N approach (N=7, covering the entire summer regime P18-P24) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend captures this low-velocity phase and avoids over-ordering, while maintaining sufficient stock for the 80% service level target implied by the profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 is currently in a stable low-demand summer phase. Date is early August. Demand has been consistently low since mid-June (Period 18). Over the last 8 periods (P18-P25), the mean demand is 6.1 units (range 4-10), which is a significant drop compared to the spring average of ~44. Recent demand (P25) was 10, slightly above the summer average but still within a low-velocity regime. With 9 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we are well-positioned for the current period's expected demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this summer regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The OR backend with these parameters will maintain a lean inventory appropriate for the current $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand regime persistent through early August (P18-P25): Mean demand 6.1 units/period, roughly 85% lower than spring peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Period Tote Bag) is entering mid-August. Historically, demand was in a summer low-regime (mean ~6 units) from Period 18 to 25. However, Period 26 showed a significant spike to 24 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This spike likely signals the beginning of 'Back to School' or 'Late Summer' seasonality for accessories/bags. I will adjust the demand forecast to account for this upward trend by focusing on the most recent 3 periods (P24-P26) where demand has begun to climb. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the summer floor toward harvest/back-to-school levels while maintaining responsiveness to the recent stockout.

Carry-over insight: Potential transition out of summer low-regime detected at Period 26: Demand increased to 24 units, surpassing the previous 8-week average of ~6 units by 300%. Suggests start of late-summer/back-to-school seasonality.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The seasonal transition from the summer low (avg ~6) to late-summer/back-to-school demand is confirmed. Period 26 saw demand rise to 24, and Period 27 spiked significantly to 52. We are currently out of stock. The current date is August 19, which aligns with the peak of back-to-school shopping for accessories like handbags. To capture this shift while being mindful of potential volatility, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=2 (the start of the spike: P26, P27) to capture the upward momentum. This brings the expected demand per period to approximately 38 units. Sigma_hat will also be set based on the last 2 periods to account for the increased variance seen during this transition. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school transition confirmed (late August): Demand increased from summer average of ~6 to 24 (P26) and 52 (P27), indicating a return to high-velocity spring levels (~40-50 units).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Women's spacious handbag) is currently exiting a summer low-demand regime and entering a higher-velocity late-August/back-to-school phase. Demand in Period 26 was 24, Period 27 was 52, and Period 28 was 69. This confirms a rapid climb from the summer average of ~6 units back to and surpassing the spring levels of ~44 units. At Period 29 (late August), we expect this higher volatility to continue. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 70 units to cover the current upward trend and avoid stockouts which occurred in the last three periods (sold < demand). I will use a high N for sigma_hat to capture the recent increase in variance during this regime transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed late August: Demand accelerated from ~6 (summer avg) to 24 (P26), 52 (P27), and 69 (P28), exceeding spring averages of ~44 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Spacious handbag) is experiencing a strong seasonal surge associated with the late August/early September back-to-school and autumn transition. Demand has escalated rapidly over the last four periods: 24, 52, 69, and most recently 106. This confirms a new high-velocity regime that exceeds the spring peak (~44 units). The current period (Sep 2) typically remains a high-demand window for work and school accessories. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this acceleration (mean ~63, but the engine will scale it). Given the stockouts in the last four periods, the OR backend needs to set a higher base stock to meet this momentum, especially with a 0-period lead time allowing for immediate replenishment. I will maintain lead time at 'default' as it remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 29: Autumn/Back-to-school demand has peaked at 106 units, significantly higher than the spring peak (~44) and the late-August transition average (~48).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Women's handbag) is currently in a high-demand regime associated with the 'Back-to-School' and early autumn season. Demand spiked from a summer low of ~6 units to a peak of 106 units in Period 29. The most recent demand (Period 30) was 84 units. Given this transition, I will focus on the last 5 periods (P26-P30) to capture the current high-velocity regime while dampening the impact of the summer lull. The mean demand for these 5 periods is 67 units. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 will allow the OR engine to react to this higher mean. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the seasonal surge. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand regime stable: Recent 5-period mean is 67 units (P26-P30), confirming sustained high velocity following the summer low.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the high-demand Autumn/Back-to-school phase (September). Recent demand (P29-P31) has been consistently high at 106, 84, and 87 units. The 5-period mean (P27-P31) is approximately 79.6 units, but the most recent 3-period surge (P29-P31) averages 92.3 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this sustained high-velocity regime while including the initial transition to ensure the OR backend builds a sufficient buffer for the current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the conclusion of Period 31.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school high-demand regime confirmed: demand has stabilized at a high level (mean ~92 units for P29-P31), significantly exceeding both the summer low (~6) and spring average (~44).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are firmly in the Autumn/Back-to-school demand regime. Recent demand for periods 29-32 has been 106, 84, 87, and 68 units respectively. While demand decreased to 68 in the latest period, the overall average for this high-velocity regime (P29-P32) is approximately 86 units per period. The lead time remains consistently 0. To capture the current high-demand environment while acknowledging the slight deceleration in the last period, I will use a recent_N method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire autumn regime shift. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, suggesting the backend should maintain a high service level (approx. 80%) to avoid stockouts during this high-volume period. On-hand inventory is currently 29 units, so we need to order sufficient quantity to cover the upcoming period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school regime (P29-P32) shows stabilized high demand with a mean of 86.25 units, significantly higher than the spring peak of ~44.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Spacious handbag) is currently in its autumn/back-to-school high-demand phase. Demand spiked to 149 units in Period 33, which is the highest observed value in the dataset and reflects significant end-of-September momentum. While the 5-period mean (P29-P33) is approximately 98.8 units, the recent jump to 149 suggests either a new peak or high volatility in the current regime. To capture this acceleration and ensure high service levels (critical given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the autumn regime while acknowledging the recent 149-unit demand. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a new seasonal peak of 149 units in Period 33, increasing the autumn regime mean (P29-P33) to approximately 99 units/period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P29-P34) confirms a high-velocity autumn/back-to-school regime for item 639448001 (a spacious handbag), with demand samples of 106, 84, 87, 68, 149, and 78. Current on-hand inventory is 48. The mean demand for this specific 6-period regime is approximately 95 units per period. Although Period 33 saw a massive peak of 149, the following period (P34) returned to 78, suggesting we should not over-react to the single highest spike but must maintain a high base stock to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 27-29 and 33. I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to define both mu_hat and sigma_hat, accurately capturing the current seasonal mean (~95) and the high volatility (std ~28) observed in this regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school regime (P29-P34) mean demand stabilizes at ~95 units/period with significant volatility (std ~28), representing the highest sustained demand velocity of the year to date.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Women's Tote Bag) continues in its high-velocity autumn/back-to-school regime. The current date (Oct 14) is post-September peak but still shows significant demand (P34: 78, P35: 70). The autumn regime (P29-P35) has been consistent, with a mean demand of approximately 92. And while the extreme spike of 149 (P33) has subsided, the last two periods confirm that demand remains significantly higher than spring/summer levels. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use the last 7 periods (P29-P35) to capture this specific seasonal regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school regime (P29-P35) mean demand remains stable at ~92 units/period, despite the P33 outlier, maintaining significantly higher velocity than previous spring/summer cycles.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Spacious handbag) is currently in its high-velocity autumn/back-to-school regime. In Period 36, demand was 64 units, continuing a gradual tapering from the late September peak of 149 units. The mean demand for the most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 85.8 units, which accurately reflects the current post-peak stabilization. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilization while accounting for the high volatility (std ~36) observed during this phase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 52 units, and the backend will calculate the necessary order to meet the targeted base stock based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand stabilization: Recent 5-period mean (P32-P36) is 85.8 units/period, showing a controlled decline from the late September peak while maintaining significantly higher velocity than summer (avg ~6) or spring (avg ~44).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The 'Period tote' (spacious handbag) is in its peak autumn/back-to-school season. Recent demand has stabilized after the late September peak of 149 units. For the last 5 periods (P33-P37), actual demand has been [149, 78, 70, 64, 68]. Excluding the P33 outlier, the mean demand is approximately 70 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 48 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level for this high-velocity product while accounting for the recent stabilization, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the current post-peak mean (~70) and volatility, as demand is no longer accelerating but remains significantly higher than the spring/summer levels.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand regime has peaked and stabilized as of late October: Recent 4-period mean (P34-P37) is 70.0 units/period, showing a steady velocity after the late September surge.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is early November (2019/11/4). The SKU '639448001' is a 'spacious handbag', which historically saw a significant autumn/back-to-school peak. Recent demand (P34-P38) has stabilized around an average of 74 units/period (78, 70, 64, 68, 90). Period 38 saw a stockout with demand reaching 90 units, suggesting that demand is not yet tapering off for the holiday season and may actually be increasing as we approach mid-November and December gift-shopping periods. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this recent stabilization and slight upward trend (mean ~74), and use the same window for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility. Lead time is consistently 0.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 is currently in an Autumn/Early Winter high-demand regime. Looking at the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has been: 78, 70, 64, 68, 90, 77. This results in a mean of approximately 74.5 units per period. The recent demand spike in P38 (90 units) and P39 (77 units) suggests that as we approach mid-November (Date: 2019/11/11), demand is remaining strong, potentially bolstered by pre-holiday shopping. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized but high-velocity behavior, I am using recent_N (N=6) for both mean and volatility, which covers the period since the late-September peak settled into the current sustained range. This will ensure the OR backend generates a base stock level that accounts for the current ~75 unit/period velocity and its associated variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late autumn (Nov): Recent 6-period mean (P34-P39) is 74.5 units, maintaining high velocity compared to spring/summer, with consistent 0-period lead time.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is a spacious handbag, and we are entering the mid-to-late November period, which precedes major holiday shopping events like Black Friday. Historically, the Autumn/Back-to-school high-demand regime slowed down slightly in late October but has maintained a robust velocity in November. The recent 6-period mean (P35-P40) is 71.3 units. However, given the approaching holiday season (late November/December) and the products seasonal nature (accessories/handbags often see holiday spikes), I will set mu_hat using a recent_N window of 7 periods (P34-P40) which averages 73.1 units. This captures the sustained high velocity of the current regime while remaining sensitive to recent fluctuations. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 24 units, and the OR backend's service level target (z*) will be approximately 0.84 based on the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1) ratio. This configuration aims to provide sufficient safety stock for potential holiday-driven demand increases while managing holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. This is the start of the 'Cyber Week' / 'Black Friday' period. Historically, demand for this SKU (a spacious handbag) has shown significant velocity in the autumn/winter season. Looking at recent history, the 4-period mean (P38-P41) is approximately 76 units (90, 77, 59, 78), which aligns with the carry-over insight of a stabilized high-velocity regime (~74.5). However, given the specific calendar date (the week of Black Friday), a significant spike is anticipated. Black Friday often sees demand 1.5x to 2x higher than typical November weeks. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current stable base demand (~76 units) but use the 'explicit' mu_hat to forecast a seasonal surge to 120 units to account for holiday shopping. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Black Friday surge anticipated: Dec-proximal demand (P41) remains high (78 units), and calendar knowledge (Nov 25) suggests a major seasonal peak is imminent.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 639448001 (Women's Spacious Handbag) just experienced a massive demand spike in Period 42 (221 units), coinciding with Black Friday week (Nov 25). This confirms the 'Holiday/Black Friday surge' anticipated in previous periods. Since current inventory is 0 and lead time is verified as 0, we must capture both the immediate post-Black Friday demand and the lead-up to the Christmas peak. Historical data shows that high-velocity regimes (Autumn) averaged ~90 units, but this holiday peak is significantly higher. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 180 to provide a buffer for sustained December demand, while using recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed during this seasonal transition (P39-P42 demand: 77, 59, 78, 221).

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Black Friday peak confirmed: Period 42 demand surged to 221 units (+180% vs previous week average). December demand is expected to remain highly volatile and well above the Autumn average of ~90.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 44 (Dec 9). Period 42 captured the 'Black Friday' peak (demand 221), while Period 43 showed a massive drop to 18 units, likely reflecting a post-Cyber Monday lull. However, we are entering the peak holiday shopping season leading up to Christmas. Historical data for this specific SKU shows a similar pattern in January/February where demand spiked significantly. The previous period (P43) had a very high order based on the BF surge, resulting in 226 units on-hand. Given the product is a 'Spacious handbag', it is a likely gift item. Demand is expected to rise again in the weeks before Dec 25. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to blend the massive peak (221), the lull (18), and the pre-peak levels to stay responsive to holiday volatility without over-ordering further, as current on-hand is already high.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday lull observed in Period 43 (demand 18), but high inventory (226) maintained in anticipation of December holiday gift-giving demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak holiday shopping season (mid-December). Following the massive Black Friday demand spike (221 units in Period 42), the last two periods (P43-P44) have seen a significant lull (18 and 14 units respectively). This 'post-Black Friday / pre-Christmas' lull is common as customers wait for final holiday sales or shipping deadlines. However, with the current date of December 16, a final pre-Christmas surge is highly probable in the coming period. We currently have 212 units on-hand. Given the lead time is 0, we can afford to be reactive if demand spikes, but we should maintain a robust base stock to avoid stockouts during the final holiday push. mu_hat will be set using the recent 4 periods (P41-P44) to capture the high volatility of the holiday month (mean ~83), which includes both the massive peak and the current lull, providing a balanced forecast for the next week.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility confirmed: December exhibits extreme swings, with a Black Friday peak (221 units) followed by a mid-month lull (~16 units avg), preceding an expected final Christmas surge.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, representing the final Christmas shopping week and the beginning of the post-holiday transition. Historically (Periods 43-45), December demand for this SKU has seen a significant lull (averaging ~19 units) following the Black Friday peak (221 units). With 188 units currently on-hand and an expected post-Christmas demand drop, we are significantly overstocked relative to recent velocity. I will use a 4-period window (recent_N, N=4) for demand forecasting; this includes the Black Friday surge, which provides a conservative safety buffer for any last-minute Christmas spike while recognizing that current inventory levels are more than sufficient. No new order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend given the high on-hand balance and the 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition detected: Demand following the late-November peak has entered a mid-December lull (avg 18.6 units, P43-P45), consistent with pre-Christmas shopping fatigue or early fulfillment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-163.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are in the final week of the year following the Christmas holiday peak. Evaluation of demand since the Black Friday surge (P42, demand 221) shows a significant and sustained drop: P43-P46 demands were 18, 14, 24, and 5. This confirms the 'post-holiday lull' previously identified. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 183 units due to aggressive replenishment during the holiday peak that was not fully utilized by customers in December. Given the current date and the product type (a spacious handbag), demand is expected to remain low as the market transitions out of the gifting season into January. The priority is now to minimize holding costs and bleed off excess inventory rather than placing new orders. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent post-holiday demand velocity (~15 units/period) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the decreased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand collapse confirmed: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P43-P46) has dropped to 15.25 units, an 80% decrease from the Autumn average (~75) and a 93% decrease from the Black Friday peak.
