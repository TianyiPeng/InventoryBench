Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Long leggings 2-pack'. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a mean of 127.2 and a standard deviation of 21.0. Given the product is a staple 'Womens Everyday Basics' item and it is mid-February, we expect steady demand. The promised lead time is 0. Currently, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero, so we need to establish stock immediately. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available historical samples) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will allow the backend to calculate the base stock for a (1+L) period horizon (which is 1 period since L=0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey leggings', which typically shows stable demand but can have slight variability. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 121. The historical data for the previous 5 weeks shows demand values of 155, 98, 122, 119, and 142 (Average \u2248 127). The promised lead time is 0, and the actual lead time for the Period 1 order was confirmed to be 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 7. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 5 historical samples plus the Period 1 observation (N=6) to capture the base demand level of this 'Everyday Basic' item accurately. Setting L to 'default' as the actual lead time matches the promised 0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 2-pack of long leggings, a staple 'Womens Everyday Basics' item. Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) averaged 127.2 units per week. In Period 1 (Feb 11), demand was 121. In Period 2 (Feb 18), demand spiked to 150, resulting in a stockout (sold 127, ending 0) despite a lead time of 0. Feb 18-25 corresponds to the lead-up to spring in many regions, often triggering a refresh of basic jersey wear. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Since current on-hand is 0 and we are entering Period 3 (Feb 25), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent upward trend (avg of 121 and 150, and the last historical point 142) more sensitively than the full history, ensuring the base stock level can accommodate the recent demand increase and recover from the stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Long leggings 2-pack' (Womens Everyday Basics). Analysis of the 5-week history (samples) and the 3 concluded periods shows a demand mean of approximately 126 units (Samples: 155, 98, 122, 119, 142; History: 121, 150, 92). Current period is March 4, 2019. There is no strong evidence of a seasonal shift yet, but demand is volatile (standard deviation \u2248 20-25). The promised lead time is 0, and all three concluded periods confirm an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently at 46 units. Since holding cost equals profit ($1/unit), the target service level q = 0.5. However, since stockouts occurred in Period 2 (sold 127 vs 150 demand), and holding cost is significant, I will use recent history (last 5 samples + 3 game periods = 8 data points) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the most recent mean of ~125 ((142+121+150+92+119)/5 \u2248 125), and default/all-sample L and sigma to provide a stable buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 (Long leggings 2-pack) is a basic staple item. Historical demand samples (before P1) were [155, 98, 122, 119, 142], mean \u2248 127. Demand in Periods 1-4 was [121, 150, 92, 103], mean \u2248 116. Combining all 9 data points gives a global mean of 122.5 and standard deviation of 22.1. The promised lead time is 0, and observations for P1-P4 confirm actual lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period). In P2, we stocked out (ending on-hand 0, sold 127/demand 150), so the actual demand of 150 must be factored in. Current on-hand is 22. There are no known upcoming seasonal events in mid-March that would significantly spike demand for basic leggings, so I will use a global average for stability. I set L=0, mu_hat based on all available samples (N=9), and sigma_hat based on all available samples (N=9) to maintain a consistent service level given equal profit and holding costs (q=0.5).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is 'Women's Everyday Basics' leggings. Based on the 5 concluded periods, the actual lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period), which matches the promised lead time. Demand history shows relatively stable consumption: [121, 150, 92, 103, 114], with an average of 116 units. The product description suggests steady 'Everyday Basic' demand, and there are no immediate major calendar spikes expected for mid-March jersey basics that aren't already reflected in the variance. Current on-hand inventory is 9 units. Because lead time is 0, the backend base stock covers only the current period (L+1=1). I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and variance to capture the most recent demand regime since the pre-game samples (all ~120 range) are consistent with current observations.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic (leggings), which shows relatively stable demand. The current date is March 25th. Historical demand samples (including pre-game) are: 155, 98, 122, 119, 142, 121, 150, 92, 103, 114, 86. The mean of all 11 samples is approximately 118. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently 30 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50, meaning the OR backend will aim for the median demand. I will use 'default' for lead time (0) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent performance (mean ~99 over the last 5 weeks), which is slightly lower than the long-term average.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is 'Long leggings 2-pack', a staple women's basic. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 110 units (Periods 1-7: 121, 150, 92, 103, 114, 86, 99). The demand doesn't show a strong seasonal spike yet, but April often transitions into spring patterns. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). My on-hand inventory is low (10 units). Given profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the most recent demand stability, which averages around 99 units. This ensures we replenish enough to meet the current window's demand while acknowledging the 0 lead time environment.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/8 (Spring). The SKU is a basic jersey legging 2-pack, which typically has stable demand but can see spikes during seasonal transitions. In Period 8 (2019/4/1), demand spiked to 159 units, causing a stockout (sold 99, 0 remaining). All previous periods (1-8) confirmed a lead time of 0 periods. Historical demand samples (including the seed data) show a mean around 120-130 units, but recent weeks fluctuated between high demand (159) and lower troughs (86-99). Since lead time L=0, the OR engine needs to cover the current period's demand. I will use a recent window (N=5) for mu_hat to account for the recent spike, and 'calculate' for lead time since stability is observed. Because profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the service level target is 50% (z=0), meaning we primarily target the mean. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (avg ~112) slightly lags the recent 159 spike, but balancing with the seed data ensures we don't over-order into a potential post-spike lull.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' 2-pack of leggings. Current date is 2019/4/15. Historical demand shows relative stability with some spikes: Periods 2 (150) and 8 (159). The average demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 112 units. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). In Period 8, a demand spike to 159 resulted in lost sales as we only had 99 units on hand. Period 9 demand returned to a more normal level of 82. Given the high stockout cost relative to holding (profit/holding = 1.0, critical ratio = 0.5), the OR engine will naturally target a inventory level near the median. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent demand behavior, which includes the recent Period 8 spike, while calculating lead time based on the consistent historical performance of 0 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 (Women's Jersey Leggings 2-pack) is an everyday basic. In the last 10 periods, the promised lead time of 0 has been consistently honored, so L is set to default. Demand has fluctuated between 76 and 159. The long-term mean (including pre-game samples) is approximately 115 units per period. Recent performance (P8-P10) shows a slight cooling after a spike (avg ~105). Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the policy primarily targets the mean demand. Current on-hand is 32. I will use a recent_N of 10 periods to capture the baseline demand of this stable basic item while remaining responsive to the recent variance observed in April.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's basic jersey legging, which typically exhibits stable demand but can be influenced by spring fashion cycles. Looking at the demand history, the last three periods (P9, P10, P11) show a decrease in demand (82, 76, 76) compared to earlier periods (e.g., P8 demand of 159). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is approximately 98.4 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N (lead_time = 0). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the recent stabilization/slight decline in demand while filtering out the outlier spike in Period 8.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 is a 'long leggings 2-pack', a staple basic with relatively stable demand. Analyzing the history, current demand in Period 12 spiked to 118, causing a stockout. Over the last 12 periods, the mean demand is 108.33, but lookback at the last 5 periods (Periods 8-12) shows a mean of 102.2. The seasonal context (May) does not suggest a massive surge, but the recent stockout suggests the OR backend was under-ordering based on previous low-demand periods (P9-P11). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full range of variability seen so far (from 76 to 159) while smoothing out the recent fluctuation, ensuring the base stock level better covers potential demand spikes like the ones seen in Period 2, 8, and 12. Using all available data (N=12) provides a more robust estimate of the mean and volatility for this basic item.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's basic jersey legging, which typically shows steady year-round demand with periodic spikes. Analysis of the 13 concluded periods plus initial history shows an average demand of approximately 109 units (Initial 5: 127 avg, Game P1-P13: 102 avg). There have been three instances of stockouts (Periods 2, 8, 12) where demand exceeded supply, suggesting high volatility or slight under-ordering. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level is 50%. However, due to recent stockouts and the 'cap' mechanism in the OR engine, I will set mu_hat slightly higher than the simple mean to ensure better availability. I will use the last 10 periods for demand estimation to capture the most recent market behavior (mean ~101), while maintaining the default lead time (0).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Long leggings 2-pack', a staple jersey basic. Demand has remained relatively stable without a strong seasonal trend visible in the data so far (2019-02-11 to 2019-05-13). There have been three stockout events (Periods 2, 8, 12) where demand exceeded significantly the available inventory, specifically when demand spiked to ~118-159 range. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for the high volatility and occasional spikes, I am using a recent window (N=10) to calculate mean and standard deviation. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5 (z*=0), meaning the base stock will target the mean demand. However, the capping mechanism used by the OR engine handles the right-tail protection. Using N=10 captures the recent demand distribution (mean approx 100) while smoothing out the earliest values.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 (Women's Jersey Leggings) shows a relatively stable core demand pattern with occasional spikes (likely driven by events not immediately obvious in the calendar). Historical data provided (155, 98, 122, 119, 142) and game history (averaging ~101 over the last 15 periods) suggest that while mean demand is around 100-110, there is significant volatility. Recent demand (Periods 11-15: 76, 118, 101, 89, 93) averages 95.4. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and prevent stockouts seen in Periods 2, 8, and 12, I will use recent trends (N=10) to capture current demand levels while maintaining a buffer for volatility. Setting L to 0 based on consistent performance. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 10 periods (since Period 6) to reflect the current steady state while smoothing recent fluctuations.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 2-pack of long leggings, a staple basic. Current date is 2019/06/03. Reviewing history from Period 1 to 16, demand averages approximately 101 units per week. There is no clear seasonal trend visible in the spring/early summer data for this 'Everyday Basic' item, although there was a slight dip in the most recent period (65 units). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use a recent window of 10 periods (N=10) to capture the stable demand mean while being slightly more responsive to recent fluctuations than the full history would allow. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been reliably 0.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' legging, which tends to have relatively stable demand but has shown a recent downward trend. Specifically, the last two weeks (Periods 16 and 17) saw demand drop to 65 and 54 units respectively, compared to the overall historical mean of approximately 105. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promise. Because the profit per unit ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we want the base stock to cover the median demand (\u03bc\u0302) for the (L+1) period cycle. I am using a recent_N window of 5 weeks for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current downward trend without overreacting to the single lowest point, ensuring we don't overstock during this lower-demand phase while maintaining the 0-period lead time parameter.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 16: average weekly demand decreased from ~100 to ~60 in the most recent two-week window.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics leggings'. Starting from Period 16 (May 27th), demand dropped from a historical average of ~100 to a lower regime (65, 54, and 57 in the last three periods). This suggests a seasonal shift as weather warms, reducing demand for long leggings. To respond to this change while maintaining a high service level (profit and holding costs are equal at $1.0, making the critical ratio 0.5), I will use the recent_N method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand level and its specific volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, which is accurately captured by the 'default' method.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: Weekly demand average decreased from ~100 to 58.7 units (3-week average) as of Period 19, likely due to summer seasonality for long leggings.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-06-24. We are managing 'Long leggings', which is a seasonal product generally experiencing lower demand during the summer months. Historical demand confirms a regime shift starting around Period 16 (late May). The demand for the last four periods (Periods 16-19) has been 65, 54, 57, and 85, averaging 65.25 units per week. Although Period 19 saw a spike to 85, the ending inventory of 0 indicates we were stock-out constrained. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To adapt to the lower summer demand while accounting for the recent spike, I will use a recent window of N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current seasonal regime (late May to late June) while being responsive to the higher demand observed in the most recent week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 is a 'Long leggings 2-pack', which typically sees lower demand during the peak summer months (July/August). Current date is 2019/7/1. Analysis of history confirms a significant drop in demand starting around Period 16 (late May). Demands for Periods 16 to 20 were 65, 54, 57, 85, and 71. While Periods 19 and 20 showed a slight rebound due to a potential stock-out situation leading to suppressed visibility of true demand, the overall trend is consistent with the 'summer seasonality' insight recorded previously. The average for the last 5 periods (N=5) is 66.4 units per period, which is significantly lower than the ~100 unit average seen in early Spring. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this lower summer regime while slightly accounting for the recent minor uptick, and using default sigma_hat to allow the OR engine to maintain a standard safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonality (Periods 16-20): Demand average established at approximately 66 units/period, down from ~100 units/period in Spring.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-07-08. Demand for long leggings has stabilized into a 'summer regime' since Period 16. In the last three periods (P19, P20, P21), demand has been 85, 71, and 84 (average ~80), which is slightly higher than the initial summer drop (54-57 range in P17-P18) but still lower than the spring peak. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently show actual lead time is 0. With On-hand = 0 and In-transit = 0, we must order for the current period's demand immediately. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer demand behavior (Periods 16-21) while excluding the higher spring volume. This covers the most recent regime length.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization: After an initial drop in Period 16, demand for long leggings has stabilized to an average of ~70 units (Periods 16-21) compared to the ~100 units seen in Spring.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Long leggings 2-pack', which follows a seasonal pattern. Starting around Period 16 (late May), demand dropped from a Spring average of ~100 to a Summer average of ~70 units. Over the last four periods (19-22), demand has been 85, 71, 84, and 74, showing a stable but slightly higher-than-initially-expected summer regime (average 78.5). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid the stockouts observed in the last four periods (where sales were capped by limited stock), I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=7 (covering the summer period from P16-P22) to capture this stabilized lower demand while allowing the OR backend to recalculate the mean including the recent stockout-impacted demand samples. Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures we account for current summer volatility rather than the higher spring variance.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 2-pack of long leggings, which has seen a seasonal demand shift starting around Period 16 (late May) as temperatures rose. The demand in the 'Spring' regime (Periods 1-15) averaged ~105 units, while the 'Summer' regime (Periods 16-23) has stabilized at a lower average of approximately 72 units. The most recent demand (Period 23) was 88 units, indicating that while demand is lower than in Spring, it remains robust enough to frequently deplete stock. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods. To capture this stabilized summer demand, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (the duration of the summer regime). Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost), the OR engine will target a 50% service level. Setting mu_hat using the recent summer average ensures we don't overstock based on the irrelevant high-demand spring data, while sigma_hat is calculated from the same window to provide a safety buffer against the observed volatility (demand range 54-88 in summer).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Periods 16-23) confirmed: Average weekly demand is ~72 units, approximately 30% lower than the Spring average of ~105 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/29. Historically, demand for this SKU (long leggings) shifted significantly around Period 16 (late May), coinciding with summer seasonality. Over the last 9 periods (P16-P24), demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 70.8 units, compared to the spring average of ~105. Current on-hand inventory is 14 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical 'conclude' messages consistently show that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time 0). To capture the current summer demand regime while ignoring the higher spring volume, I will use a recent_N window of 9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering the period from the detected changepoint at Period 16 to the most recent concluded period).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. The product is 'Long leggings 2-pack', which experienced a significant demand drop starting around Period 16 (late May), dropping from an average of ~105 units to ~72 units during the summer months. However, as we enter August, historical retail trends suggest that 'Back to School' preparations begin, which typically leads to a recovery in demand for basic apparel like leggings. Looking at the last 5 periods (Periods 21-25), demand was 84, 74, 88, 59, and 62, averaging 73.4. While the last two weeks were relatively low, the periods prior showed higher activity. Since on-hand inventory is very low (9 units) and actual lead time is consistently 0, I will use a conservative average of the summer regime for the base stock, but use recent_N=10 to capture both the low summer trough and the emerging stabilization. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods (16-25) provides a robust estimate for this transitional period before the full autumn recovery.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Long leggings 2-pack', which follows a seasonal pattern. Starting Period 16 (late May), demand dropped from a Spring average of ~105 units to a Summer regime average of ~70 units. Over the last 11 periods (P16-P26), demand has averaged 69.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.2. Currently, we are in mid-August (P27), nearing the end of the summer season. There is no evidence yet of a late-summer/early-fall uptick, so I will maintain the current regime parameters. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 11 to capture the entirety of the stabilized summer regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the consistent 0-period performance.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 688432001 (Women's long leggings) shifted from a high-demand Spring regime (~105 units/period) to a lower-demand Summer regime around Period 16. Since then, demand has stabilized. In the most recent four periods (P24-P27), demand values were 59, 62, 68, and 68, averaging 64.25 units. Although we are approaching the end of August, there is no statistically significant evidence yet that demand is rebounding for Fall, so I will maintain the current regime's parameters to avoid overstocking. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Periods 16 to 27) to capture the stable Summer regime while weighing toward the current lower volume. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the expected 65-70 unit demand while minimizing holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019, which marks the transition from late summer into early fall. Recent demand for women's leggings has been stabilizing around 70-75 units throughout the summer (Periods 16-27), but Period 28 saw a jump to 95 units, potentially signaling the start of 'back-to-school' or fall seasonality. Historically, the spring average was roughly 105 units. Lead time remain consistently 0. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 24-28) to capture this recent uptick while maintaining the summer baseline, resulting in a slightly more responsive forecast to the potential shift. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same window to capture recent volatility (notably the jump in P28).

Carry-over insight: Potential transition out of summer demand regime: Period 28 demand (95 units) is significantly higher than the summer average (~72 units), suggesting an upward shift as autumn approaches.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, marking the transition from summer to autumn. Historically, this SKU (long leggings) saw a demand drop in late May (Period 16, avg ~71), likely due to summer seasonality. We are now looking for an upward shift as autumn begins. Period 28 showed a spike to 95, but Period 29 returned to 65. Despite the Period 29 dip, the upcoming autumn season is a high-demand period for 'long leggings' and 'everyday basics'. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 14 periods (Periods 16-29) to capture the summer baseline, but I'll monitor closely for the expected seasonal climb. All historical arrivals confirm the actual lead time is 0 (same-period arrival).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019). The product is 'Long leggings', which typically follows a seasonal pattern: lower demand in summer and higher demand in autumn/winter. Since Period 16 (late May), the demand dropped to a 'summer regime' of roughly 70 units per week. However, the last three weeks of demand (Periods 28, 29, 30) were 95, 65, and 120 respectively. The spike to 120 in Period 30 (early September) strongly suggests the transition into the higher-demand autumn regime has begun as temperatures start to drop. To capture this upward shift without over-reacting to the single spike of 120, I will use a recent window (N=3) which averages ~93 units, closer to the spring baseline of ~100. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting mu_hat using N=3 allows the OR backend to quickly adjust the base stock to meet this rising seasonal demand and prevent further stockouts (we ended with 0 inventory in Period 30).

Carry-over insight: Transition to Autumn demand regime confirmed: Demand in Periods 28-30 averaged 93 units, significantly higher than the Summer average (~70 units), signaling the end of summer seasonality for leggings.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019), the leggings SKU is transitioning into the Autumn demand regime. Demand over the last four periods (Periods 28-31) has been 95, 65, 120, and 115, averaging ~99 units per week. This is a significant increase from the Summer average of ~70 units and aligns with the expected seasonal trend for jersey leggings as temperatures drop. Because lead time remains consistently 0, the goal is to set the base stock to cover current period demand. I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this window precisely captures the post-Summer recovery while excluding the lower Summer baseline. Given on-hand inventory is 0, the OR backend will calculate an order based on these higher parameters to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 30 and 31.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Demand Surge: As of Period 32, demand has averaged ~99 units over the last 4 weeks (Periods 28-31), representing a ~40% increase over the Summer average (~70), confirming a seasonal shift back to Spring-level demand or higher.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for long leggings has clearly transitioned out of the summer slump (~70 units/period) into an Autumn regime. Over the last 5 periods (28-32), demand has averaged 98.2 units (95, 65, 120, 115, 96), which aligns with the Spring baseline. Period 32 demand was 96. We are currently at Period 33 (Sept 23), heading further into the peak season for this product category. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. To capture this stabilized Autumn demand while allowing for the recent volatility (std dev is approximately 22 in this new regime), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the target average of ~98 units per period. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to provide a localized volatility estimate for the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Demand Regime Stable: Periods 28-32 average demand is 98.2 units, confirming a return to high-season baseline (Spring was ~100).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for long leggings has confirmed a return to the high-demand regime (Autumn/Spring baseline). In Period 33, demand spiked to 133 units, following a sequence of 95, 65, 120, 115, and 96. The average demand over the last 6 periods (Period 28-33) is 104 units, which aligns with the historical Spring average (~100-105). Given that on-hand inventory is currently 0, I need to ensure the base stock is sufficient to meet this sustained higher demand level. I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this Autumn shift while excluding the lower Summer data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 28-33 average demand is 104 units/period, matching or slightly exceeding the Spring baseline of ~100 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 (Long leggings) has transitioned into a stable Autumn/Winter high-demand regime as of Period 28 (late August). Over the most recent 7 periods (P28-P34), the average demand is 100.7 units, which aligns with the carry-over insights and the Spring baseline (~100 units). The most recent demand in Period 34 was 83, creating an ending inventory of 21. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain sufficient stock for this high-demand season while balancing a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level prior to the safety stock cap), I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility. This ensures the base stock reflects the ~100 units/period demand pattern confirmed over the last ~2 months.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (2019/10/14), we are in the middle of the Autumn/Winter high-demand regime for long leggings. Although Period 35 showed a lower demand of 53 units, historical trends for this specific product (long leggings) and the categorical averages identify this as a high-demand period compared to Summer. The Autumn regime (starting Period 28) has averaged approximately 95 units per week. To prevent under-stocking while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (which targets a 50% service level or essentially the mean demand), I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the higher baseline since late August while acknowledging the recent volatility. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 37 (Oct 21, 2019). The demand for long leggings has unexpectedly dropped in the last two periods (Period 35: 53 units, Period 36: 58 units) compared to the Autumn average of ~104 units observed between Periods 28-34. This drop follows a high peak of 133 in Period 33. Given the product is 'Long leggings 2-pack' and we are approaching late October, a minor mid-autumn lull or a correction from the previous peak may be occurring. On-hand inventory is 37 units. The actual lead time remains 0. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=9 (covering the transition to and the recent volatility in Autumn) to capture the current mean of approximately 93 units per period (Periods 28-36), which acknowledges the recent lower demand while maintaining a buffer for the expected high-season baseline.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand volatility (Periods 35-36): Demand dropped to an average of ~55 units after a high-demand phase (Avg ~104). Monitoring for a sustained shift or temporary lull.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 35-37) shows a sharp decline, with weekly figures of 53, 58, and 29 units respectively. This represents a significant shift from the Autumn high-demand regime (which averaged ~104 units). The three-week average is now ~46.7 units. This downtrend in late October (Period 38, Oct 28) for 'Long leggings' is unexpected for a winter staple but represents a sustained 3-period drop. With on-hand inventory currently at 62 units and a promised lead time of 0, the current stock exceeds the recent demand average. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the inventory policy toward this lower demand regime and avoid overstocking costs, while maintaining a baseline service level for this SKU. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 35: Weekly demand average decreased from ~104 to 46.7 units (3-week average), marking a significant departure from the Autumn high-demand phase.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for long leggings has shifted significantly downward starting around Period 35 (early October). The average demand over the last four periods (P35-P38) is 45 units (53, 58, 29, 40), compared to the preceding Autumn peak average of over 100 units. This drop likely reflects a late-autumn/early-winter demand lull or a specific regime change for this SKU. Given the 'Long leggings' description, we might expect another surge closer to deep winter, but currently, we must adjust to the lower observed mean to avoid excessive holding costs. Inventory is currently at 22 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 (as confirmed by 'conclude' messages P1-P37), I will set L to 0. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current low-demand regime, ensuring the base stock aligns with the ~45 unit weekly average.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime shift confirmed (Periods 35-38): Average weekly demand has dropped to 45 units, a ~55% decrease from the Autumn peak of ~100+ units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11 (Period 40). We have confirmed a demand regime shift starting around Period 35, where the previous Autumn peak (avg ~100) has dropped to a leaner late-autumn/winter baseline. The average demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 35-39) is 45.2 units (53, 58, 29, 40, 46). On-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. To capture this new, lower demand level while remaining responsive to potential minor fluctuations, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures our base stock level is aligned with the current ~45 unit/period demand regime, minimizing holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the upcoming week.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Winter demand stabilization: Since Period 35, demand has settled into a new regime averaging ~45 units/period, down ~55% from the Autumn peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 688432001 (Women's Jersey Leggings) has settled into a lower regime since Period 35 (approx. mid-October), consistent with a seasonal downturn in late autumn/early winter. The average demand across these last 6 periods (P35-P40) is 43.6 units, compared to the Autumn peak of over 100 units. Period 40 demand was 36 units. Given the stability of this lower regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this mean (approx. 44 units). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=6) to capture the volatility of this specific regime, which has been relatively consistent. On-hand inventory is 10 units, and there are no units in-transit. The actual lead time remains 0 consistently in recent history, so method 'default' is appropriate. These parameters will aim to maintain a stock level that satisfies this current lower demand while minimizing holding costs on this low-margin ($1 profit vs $1 holding cost) item.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 (Women's Everyday Basics Leggings) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime that began around Period 35 (early October). Over the last 7 periods (P35-P41), demand has averaged 40.5 units, which is a significant drop from the Autumn peak of ~100 units. The most recent demand (Period 41) was 22 units, and the on-hand inventory is 22. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 0. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this specific Late Autumn/Winter regime characterized by lower, stable demand. This N covers the period from the initial drop in P35 to the present (P41), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current ~40 units/period baseline rather than the historical annual average.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand spiked unexpectedly to 140 units, significantly deviating from the 'Late Autumn/Winter' stabilization average of ~45 units established since Period 35. This date (2019/11/25) corresponds with Black Friday week, a major retail event likely causing a temporary surge for this basic garment SKU. While the carry_over_insights suggested a lower baseline, we must respond to this volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. I will adjust mu_hat to a higher explicit forecast for Period 43 to ensure the system replenishes enough stock to handle any lingering post-promotion demand, while acknowledging the promised lead time remains 0. Given the high demand in P42 (140) and the previous regime (~45), I'll set mu_hat to 85 (a blend of the spike and the recent average) to avoid over-ordering if the spike was strictly a one-week event, while still protecting against further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike to 140 units in Period 42 (2019/11/25) likely due to Black Friday promotion; previous regime was ~45 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/09), we are evaluating demand following a major spike move. Period 42 (Nov 25) saw demand hit 140, likely due to Black Friday. Period 43 (Dec 2) showed demand at 86, which is still significantly elevated compared to the preceding late-autumn regime of ~45 units. This suggests a post-Black Friday 'Holiday Season' lift or clearance activity. Historically, the product (Long Leggings) had a baseline of ~100 units during Spring/Autumn but dropped in Summer/Late Autumn. With on-hand inventory at 0 and actual lead time consistently at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent lift. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat to capture the average of the Black Friday spike (140) and the subsequent high demand (86), resulting in a forecast of ~113. This ensures we don't under-order if the holiday momentum continues, while the OR backend's inventory cap prevents excessive overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand lift observed: Periods 42-43 average 113 units, significantly higher than the previous late-autumn regime of ~45 units, indicating a start to the winter holiday shopping season.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/16, approaching the peak holiday season. Demand in Period 42 was a spike due to Black Friday (140 units), followed by a high of 86 in Period 43. Period 44 saw a sharp drop to 18 units, which is common right after a major shopping event or due to a temporary lull before the final Christmas rush. However, looking at the product (Long leggings 2-pack) and the time of year, we expect another demand surge for Christmas/New Year gifting and cold weather needs. The inventory is currently at 95 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3-week average (approx 81 units) which balances the Black Friday spike, the subsequent high, and the recent low. This provides a buffer for a likely holiday week increase while recognizing the recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this high recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Holiday season volatility observed; Period 44 demand drop (18 units) follows high late-November/early-December activity. Expecting a final pre-Christmas surge.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/23 (Period 46). We are in the final stage of the holiday season. Historical demand for these 'Long leggings' has been highly volatile over the last month: Period 42 (Black Friday) hit 140, followed by 86, 18, and 37. The 'Carry-over' correctly noted a drop to 18 units in Period 44 but anticipated a final pre-Christmas surge. Period 45 demand of 37 units shows a slight recovery but remains well below the late-autumn average (~100). Given that Period 46 is the week leading into Christmas and Period 47 is the post-Christmas week (Boxing Day/Sales), I expect demand to be moderate to high. On-hand inventory is 58 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a service level for potential holiday clearance or final surges, I will use a recent demand window (Periods 42-45) to set mu_hat, which averages approximately 70 units. This balances the high Black Friday demand with the recent lull.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand (Periods 42-45) is averaging ~70 units, marked by extreme volatility ranging from 18 to 140 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/30, marking the transition from the end-of-year holiday season into the new year. Historical data shows that demand for this SKU (long leggings) is highly volatile during December, with spikes around Black Friday (140 units) followed by sharp drops (18 units) and stabilization (13 units in Period 46). The 'Holiday season' regime (Periods 42-46) has averaged ~59 units. However, looking back at January sample data (155, 98, 122, 119), demand typically surges significantly in January. The OR backend's service level logic (profit=1, holding=1 leads to a 50% target service level) might under-order if we only look at the volatile December data. To capture the expected January surge while acknowledging the recent stabilization, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5: Periods 42-46) which average 58.8 units, but I will use the 'explicit' method for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (Standard Deviation of recent demand is ~48 units) to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the potential new-year spike seen in the historical pre-game samples. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Transition to New Year demand regime. Historical Jan samples (~123 avg) suggest a significant increase over the December holiday average (~59 units). High volatility (Std Dev ~48) maintained in parameters to guard against stockouts during the anticipated January surge.
