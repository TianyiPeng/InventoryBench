Since the current date is Feb 11, 2019, we are entering the Spring/Summer season for the Northern Hemisphere, where demand for basic layered garments like tank tops naturally increases as consumers prepare for warmer weather. Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows an upward trend (90, 75, 152, 112, 142) with an average of approximately 114 units per week. The last three weeks averaged 135 units. Given that we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, and the promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival for demand satisfaction), I need to order enough to cover the expected demand for the current period plus a safety buffer for the increasing seasonal trend. I will estimate Period 1 demand at ~140-150 units. To ensure high service level and account for growth, I will order 150 units.",

Period 30 demand was only 8 units, down from 17 in Period 29, and a 40-50 average in the preceding weeks. We are currently in a very low demand regime (single to low double digits). With 35 units on hand and 0 in-transit, our current inventory covers approximately 3-4 periods of demand at the current average (weighted towards the most recent low). Given the holding cost of $1.00 relative to the tapering demand, it is optimal to let current inventory deplete rather than risk additional holding costs on dead stock as we move further into autumn. Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, allowing for reactive ordering if a sudden spike occurs, but for now, no order is necessary.",
