Given that demand spiked to 85 in the last two weeks and we are entering the week of Valentine's day (Feb 14), which often sees higher demand for lingerie/underwear categories, the OR recommendation of 108 is a safe buffer to prevent stockouts while starting from zero inventory.

Demand in Period 8 was 149, which exceeded the total available stock (137), resulting in lost sales and a stockout. The demand has been showing an upward trend (P6: 109, P7: 122, P8: 149).\n3. Product Context: As an 'Angela hipster' (Basic cotton underwear), demand is relatively stable but can fluctuate based on basic restocking needs. The recent jump to 149 might indicate a slight seasonal ramp-up as spring progresses.\n4. OR Recommendation: The OR baseline recommends 148 units based on historical values. However, given that demand hit 149 last period and we are currently out of stock, the base-stock calculation should account for the fact that we are starting from zero. The OR cap is likely smoothing the order too aggressively.

Demand analysis: The SKU ('Angela hipster' cotton underwear) has transitioned from a high-demand mid-game peak (averaging ~150 units) to a much lower, more volatile regime. Recent demand over the last four periods (P23-P26) has been 43, 82, 75, and 28, averaging 57 units. This validates the Carry-over Insight from Period 24 that demand has returned to pre-game levels (avg 54). Inventory status: Starting on-hand inventory is 67 units. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 89 units is based on a long-term average that includes the high-demand periods. Given the most recent demand of 28 units and the average of the last 4 periods being 57, an order of 89 would likely result in excessive holding costs. I will target a total availability (on-hand + order) of approximately 80-90 units to cover a potential return to the 70s while protecting against the lower-bound volatility seen in P26. With 67 units on-hand, an order of 23 units brings total stock to 90.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR recommendation from 89 to 23 units. Recent demand has averaged ~57 units over the last 4 periods, and with 67 units already on-hand, a smaller order is sufficient to avoid excessive holding costs while meeting expected demand.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 603145001 (cotton jersey hipster briefs) has entered a high-demand seasonal phase corresponding with the late December holiday period. In Period 45 (Dec 16), demand spiked to 76 units, and in Period 46 (Dec 23), it increased further to 97 units. Period 47 (Dec 30) follows this upward trend. History from earlier in the game shows that demand peaks can be sustained for several weeks (e.g., Periods 14-18) before moderating. The OR recommendation of 97 units is based on the most recent demand observation. Given that the lead time is 0 periods, current on-hand inventory is 46, and we are at the final period of the game (Period 47), the goal is to fully satisfy the remaining demand without excessive overstocking. Since demand peaked at 97 and follows a holiday pattern, Period 47 demand is likely to stay in the 90-110 range. Ordering 64 units will bring total available inventory to 110 (46 on-hand + 64 ordered), covering the high end of the current regime while limiting holding cost risk at the game's conclusion.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordered 64 units to bring total availability to 110, targeting the current high holiday demand regime (97 units last period) for the final period of the game.",
