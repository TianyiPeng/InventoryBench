Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a pair of ladies' super-skinny low-rise jeans. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 50 units (82, 35, 31, 48, 55). The high first data point (82) might be a post-holiday outlier or residue of sales. Recent demand (last 4 weeks) is more stable around 42. Since we are entering mid-February, we are moving away from the post-holiday sales period. With a promised lead time (L) of 0, the total demand to cover is for 1 period (L+1). I will use the recent N=4 average to forecast demand, excluding the older high spike. mu_hat = (0+1) * 42.25 = 42.25. sigma_hat = sqrt(0+1) * std(35, 31, 48, 55) \u2248 10.9.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start. Product is super-skinny low-rise denim jeans. Observed history: five samples (82, 35, 31, 48, 55) plus Period 1 actual demand of 61. Total mean \u2248 52. Promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmes actual lead time was 0 (ordered 43, arrived 43 in P1). In Period 1, we stocked 43 units but demand was 61, leading to a stockout (sold 43, ending on-hand 0). Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 0. Since L=0, we need to cover demand for the current period. mu_hat: Using the mean of all 6 samples [(82+35+31+48+55+61)/6 = 52]. sigma_hat: The standard deviation of these 6 samples is approximately 18. Setting L to default (0) as verified by Period 1 history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'S.Skinny L.W Epic' (Ladies Denim), and we are in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand has spiked significantly from early samples (average ~42) to the most recent concluded periods (P1: 61, P2: 130). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand exceeded stock in both P1 and P2. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. To maximize profit and capture the surging demand, I need to adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) upwards. I will use an 'explicit' L of 0 to match observations, and set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current high-demand momentum (averaging ~95 over the last two periods, but with a sharp upward trend) while being cautious of the high holding cost. Given 130 demand in P2, a base stock targeting a similar range is necessary.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from a pre-game average of ~42 to 61 (P1) and 130 (P2), indicating a 100%+ increase in recent weeks potentially due to seasonal trends in Ladies Denim.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th, 2019. This product is 'Ladies Denim' (Super Skinny Jeans). Historical demand (Jan-Feb) was low (avg ~50), but demand in Period 1-3 spiked significantly (61, 130, 104) as we move into the spring retail season. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival) across all three observed periods. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 3 periods show a mean of 98.3, which is a significant shift from the pre-game baseline. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this higher demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the higher volatility (std dev ~35.2) seen in this recent period compared to the pre-game data. This aggressive base-stock setting is necessary to avoid stockouts during this high-demand seasonal window, especially since Profit/Holding ratio is 1:1, requiring a balanced service level.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand confirmed: Average demand increased from pre-Feb mean of ~50 to recent 3-week mean of ~98 (+96%). Lead time consistently 0 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is Ladies Denim (super-skinny jeans), which is entering a peak spring season. Historical pre-game demand averaged ~50, but since Period 1 (Feb 11), demand has spiked to 61, 130, 104, and 86 (recent 4-week mean = 95.25). The last two periods (104 and 86) suggest the initial extreme volatility of Period 2 (130) is stabilizing into a higher plateau. Actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all four historical cycles. With on-hand inventory at 13 and zero in-transit, we need to ensure the order covers the upcoming period's demand. I am setting L to explicit 0 to match observed reality. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current spring demand level (~95 per period) while sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent high volatility observed in February/March compared to the pre-game data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. Demand for Ladies Denim (Super Skinny) spiked in February (Avg P1-P3: 98.3) and has stabilized in March (Avg P4-P5: 85.5). The pre-game data (Jan/Feb) had much lower demand (~50), so those samples are less relevant. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the cold-start pre-game data. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which is in line with the promised lead time. Inventory levels are currently low (11 units on-hand), and the OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent excessive overstocking while demand remains elevated. I choose N=5 to include the full range of the high-demand period (61, 130, 104, 86, 85).

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7 (2019/3/25), the demand for Ladies Denim continues to stabilize after the initial early spring spike. The last four periods (P3-P6) show demand values of 104, 86, 85, and 79, averaging approximately 88.5 per week. This is significantly higher than the pre-February average (~50) but lower than the P2 peak (130). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is 15. To align with the current demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spike stabilization. With L=0, the target base stock will be the expected demand of one period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-February spike: P3-P6 average is 88.5 units/period, down from the P2 peak of 130 but consistently higher than the pre-game baseline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 occurs on 2019/04/01, representing a transition from early spring into the core spring season. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 7 (179 units), following a period of relative stability around ~85 units (P3-P6). Looking back at P2 (Feb 18), we saw a similar spike (130 units). The low-rise, superstretch skinny jeans appear to have high volatility correlated with late-month or transition-into-new-month periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 7 demand (179) depleted all available stock (89). With a lead time consistently at 0, I need to set mu_hat to capture this recent volatility. Using an explicit value for mu_hat based on the average of the last two periods (approx 129 units per period) to account for the potential sustained higher demand as we enter April, while keeping L at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike detected at start of April: Period 7 demand (179) significantly exceeded the previous 4-period average (88.5). Observed second major demand spike in 7 weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $129.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of 2019/4/8, the item (Ladies Denim) is in a high-demand phase likely driven by spring seasonality. Demand in Period 7 (179) and Period 8 (148) are the highest observed, significantly exceeding the previous baseline (P3-P6 avg: 88.5). On-hand inventory is currently 0, following two consecutive periods of stockouts where all arrived units were sold. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). To capture this recent volatility spike and ensure higher service levels during this seasonal peak, mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated using N=3. This focuses on periods 6, 7, and 8 (demands: 79, 179, 148), resulting in an average demand of 135.33 per period. Since L=0, mu_hat = (1+L) * 135.33 = 135.33. This strategy aims to replenish stock aggressively to meet the elevated demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed for April: Average demand for P7-P8 is 163.5, which is 85% higher than the P3-P6 average of 88.5. This aligns with spring seasonal peaks for Ladies Denim.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15th, 2019. We are in the middle of a high-demand spring season for 'Ladies Denim'. Demand has been highly volatile recently: P7 reached 179, P8 reached 148, but P9 dropped to 88. Despite the drop in P9, the seasonal trend suggests high demand is likely to persist through April. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals (P1-P9). Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50% from the critical ratio, though the OR backend's inventory cap policy seeks to minimize stockout risk. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent April average (roughly 138 units per period) while acknowledging the high volatility by using a recent_N sigma_hat with N=3 to ensure the safety stock accounts for recent swings between 88 and 179.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the demand history for product 399087014 (Ladies Denim), we observed a significant demand peak in early April (P7: 179, P8: 148), which has since cooled down to P9: 88 and P10: 74. This pattern suggests that while April overall is a high-demand month for spring denim, we have passed the initial spring peak. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P7-P10) is 122.25, but the last two periods averaged 81. Given that the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the OR engine will target a 50% service level (z=0). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking as the spring peak subsides, I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the broader April average (122.25 units/period) while allowing the OR engine to account for the current on-hand inventory (65 units). For volatility, I will use recent_N=4 to reflect the higher standard deviation seen during the April fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand peaked in late March/early April (Avg P7-P8: 163.5) and has stabilized at a lower level in late April (Avg P9-P10: 81), though still remains above the pre-February baseline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. We are exiting the spring peak season for Ladies Denim. Period 11 saw a unexpected massive demand spike of 160 units, causing a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). This follows a period of stabilization (P9-P10 avg = 81) and an earlier peak in late March/early April (P7-P8 avg = 163.5). The demand is highly volatile (Coefficient of Variation > 0.4). Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical service level q = 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. Lead time is consistently 0. To capture the recent extreme volatility and the shift between stabilization and spikes, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat (avg = 110) to balance the high P7, P8, and P11 against the lower P9 and P10. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the high recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Recurring demand spikes detected every 3-4 periods during Spring season (P7: 179, P11: 160). Recent 5-period average (P7-P11) is 109.8 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13 (2019/5/6). Historical demand for this 'Ladies Denim' product shows significant volatility and seasonal peaks during the spring (specifically late March/early April and late April). Recent demand has fluctuated: P11 (160) and P12 (128). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Given the high volatility observed (spikes occurring every 3-4 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 6 periods (P7-P12), which covers the recent high-demand regime and includes both spikes and lulls. This average is 129.5. To protect against the high volatility (standard deviation of ~45 over that same period), I will set sigma_hat using the last 6 periods as well. This should allow the OR backend to maintain sufficient stock for upcoming potential spikes in early May.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is May 13th. The product is Ladies Denim trousers, which has shown significant seasonality with demand spikes occurring roughly every 3-4 weeks (P7: 179, P11: 160). Over the last 4 periods (P10-P13), demand has been high but volatile (74, 160, 128, 117), with a 4-period average of ~120. This indicates a sustained higher demand level compared to the pre-game baseline. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent window (N=4) to capture this most recent sustained high-demand regime, while the OR engine balances the unit profit vs liquidity cost (both $1.0) to maintain an optimal service level. The use of recent_N=4 for mu_hat ensures we are stocked for the current average of 120 units/period, while recent_N=4 for sigma_hat captures the high volatility seen in P11.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime confirmed: Average demand P10-P13 is 119.75 units, maintaining a higher baseline compared to early spring.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087014' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing high demand volatility with frequent stockouts. Today is May 20th. Historically, we see demand spikes every 4 periods (P3: 104, P7: 179, P11: 160, and now P14: 150). The current period (P15) follows a high demand peak of 150, where we stocked out (sold 120/150). Given the lead time is consistently 0, we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture these recurring spikes. The demand average from P11-P14 is 138.75 units. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to reflect this high May baseline while capturing the volatility with a recent_N sigma_hat of 4. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a service level that minimizes stockouts during high-demand spring weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $139.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product (Ladies' Denim trousers) has shown a strong and volatile demand pattern throughout the Spring. Period 15 saw a demand of 148, which follows Period 14's demand of 150. Based on the history, we have seen recurring demand spikes throughout April and May, often exceeding 140 units. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15: 160, 128, 117, 150, 148) is 140.6 units. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the fact that we have run out of stock in the last two periods (Sold < Demand), I will focus on this recent high-demand regime. The target service level z* is 0.5 (since Profit = Holding Cost = 1.0, q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, and \u03a6\u22121(0.5) = 0). Therefore, the OR engine will set the base stock equal to mu_hat. By setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods, the OR engine will target the recent average of ~141 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late May demand regime shift: Average demand P11-P15 increased to 140.6 units, reflecting sustained late-Spring peak throughput for ladies denim.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. This SKU (Super Skinny Ladies Denim) has shown significant demand spikes throughout the spring, with a recent regime shift in late May. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 131.2 units (128, 117, 150, 148, 113). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrived in the same period it was placed). In Period 16, demand was 113, leaving 28 units on hand. Given the recurring nature of demand spikes every 4 periods (P7, P11, P15), and the transition into June, I expect demand to remain in the 120-140 range. I will set L to 0 (promised), and use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current late-spring/early-summer demand level and volatility (reflecting the 113-150 range).

Carry-over insight: Early June demand regime: Average demand for P12-P16 stabilized at 131.2 units, maintaining the elevated late-Spring volume for ladies denim.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399087014' (Ladies Denim) is in mid-June with a consistently observed Lead Time of 0. Demand history shows significant volatility and periodic spikes (e.g., P7: 179, P11: 160, P14: 150, P15: 148). While the most recent demand in P17 (90) was lower than the previous two periods, the broad late-Spring/early-Summer regime (P11-P17) shows an average demand of approximately 129.5 units per period. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures this sustained higher volume while accounting for the recent deceleration. Sigma_hat is set to the recent_N=7 to account for the frequent demand spikes characteristic of this product category during this season. Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0, confirming same-period delivery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087014 (Ladies Denim) is currently in a steady June demand phase. Demand over the last two periods (P17-P18) has moderated to 90 and 95 units, following a peak in late May. The current average demand for the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is approximately 119.2 units, which is a reliable estimate for the current regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 18 conclude' message where the order placed in P18 arrived in P18. On-hand inventory is 35 units. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time, and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (capturing the P14-P18 window) to provide a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~120 units. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the recent volatility in this regime. This strategy ensures we maintain sufficient inventory to meet current demand trends while managing holding costs as demand stabilizes from the late May peak.

Carry-over insight: Mid-June demand stabilization: Average demand for P17-P18 has leveled to 92.5 units, down from the P14-P16 average of 137, but consistent with early summer patterns for ladies denim.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Demand for Ladies Denim has entered a lower-volume summer regime. The last three periods (P17-P19) show demand of 90, 95, and 67 respectively. This is a significant decrease from the late-Spring peak (P11-P16 average ~136). The average of these last three periods is approximately 84, which signals the start of the summer baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will adjust mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this lower stabilization point and avoid overstocking during the seasonal dip. Sigma_hat will also be adjusted using the last 3 periods to capture the reduced volatility observed as demand cools from the volatile spring spikes.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization confirmed: Period 17-19 average demand is 84 units/period, marking a ~40% decrease from the late-Spring peak (P11-P16 avg: 136).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (2019/7/1), the SKU 399087014 (Ladies Denim) continues its transition into the summer season. Historical demand data shows a clear downward shift starting mid-June: Period 19 demand was 67 and Period 20 demand was 34. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P17-P20) is 71.5, significantly lower than the late-Spring peak (P11-P15 avg: 140.6). Given the lowest demand of the season occurring last period (34), I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this stabilization into the lower summer regime while being responsive to the recent drop. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N of 4 to reflect the lowered volatility associated with the lower demand baseline. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical data and Carry-over Insights indicate that the product (Ladies Super Skinny Denim) has transitioned from its Spring peak into a stable Summer demand regime. Demand since Period 19 has been lower and more consistent: 67, 34, and 61 (average ~54). This follows a significantly higher Spring average (P11-P16 avg: 136). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods throughout the entire game. Given equal profit and holding costs ($1.0), the service level target (critical ratio) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand (mu_hat) to avoid overstocking. I will use the last 5 periods (P17-P21) to capture the recent stabilization while acknowledging the slight uptick in P21. N=5 covers the shift from ~90s to the current ~50s range.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Ladies Denim' SKU shows a clear downward shift from the late-Spring peak (avg ~136) to a stabilized Summer regime. The average demand for the most recent six periods (P17-P22) is approximately 68.5 units/period, compared to the P20-P22 average of 53 units/period. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock equivalent to the expected demand for the review and lead time period (1+L = 1 period). I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this stabilized summer demand level while accounting for the slight rebound in the last two weeks (61 and 64 units).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a pair of Super Skinny Ladies Denim jeans. Historically, demand for this SKU peaked in spring (April/May) and has since cooled during the summer months. Recent demand for Periods 19-23 has been 67, 34, 61, 64, and 41, averaging approximately 53.4. This is a significant drop from the spring average of ~136. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (which equal the profit margin), I will adjust mu_hat using the last 5 periods (Period 19-23) to capture this lower summer demand regime. Since demand is currently less volatile than it was during the spring spikes, I will use a recent window (N=5) for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current stability.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087014 (Ladies Denim) is currently in a lower-demand summer phase. History shows the demand peaked in spring (March-May) and has since stabilized at a lower level. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is 45.6 units, which is significantly lower than the P11-P15 average of 140.6. Specifically, the most recent four periods (P21-P24) have seen an average of 48.5 units. Given the date (July 29), we expect this lower baseline to continue through the rest of summer. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for highly responsive inventory management. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture this stabilized summer regime (P20-P24), providing a more accurate forecast than the long-term history which is skewed by high spring volumes. This approach balances the need to satisfy demand while minimizing holding costs in a low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline confirmed: Period 20-24 average is 45.6 units/period, down ~67% from the late-Spring peak (P11-P15 avg: 140.6).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. We are in a stable summer demand regime for Ladies Denim. Period 25 confirmed a baseline average of 45.6 units/period (based on P20-P24). The most recent demand (P25) was 32 units, following a sequence of 34, 61, 64, 41, 28. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making base_stock roughly equal to the mean demand over the lead period (1+L). I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat (P20-P25) to capture this lower summer baseline while maintaining enough inventory for the slight volatility observed in July. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect current low-season variance.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in a stable late-summer demand regime for Ladies Denim. The demand over the last 7 periods (P20-P26) has averaged 43.1 units, significantly lower than the Spring peak but showing slight recovery in the most recent two weeks (P25: 32, P26: 42). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent history. Given the inventory is nearly exhausted (On-hand: 2, In-transit: 0), a restock is required. I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods to capture this stable summer baseline for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it filters out the high-volatility Spring data that is no longer relevant for the current seasonal state.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical data (P20-P26) showed a stable summer baseline for Ladies Denim averaging ~43 units per period. However, Period 27 (Aug 12) saw a significant demand spike to 88 units, more than double the summer average. This aligns with 'Back-to-School' shopping trends typically occurring in mid-to-late August for denim products. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the P27 spike. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this shift into a potential late-Summer/Pre-Autumn regime, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent spike significantly while still acknowledging the prior low baseline. This will increase the order quantity to meet the anticipated higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand spike detected: Period 27 demand (88) is 100% higher than the P20-P26 summer average (44), signaling the start of a late-August seasonal shift.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087014 (Ladies Denim) is exiting the low-demand summer regime and entering a 'Back-to-School' and early-Autumn uplift. Demand in Period 27 (88) and Period 28 (69) represents a significant increase over the summer average (P20-26 avg: 44). Note that inventory stocked out in the last two periods, meaning actual demand may have been higher than the 'sold' units. Based on the spring cycle (Feb-Apr), we expect this autumn uplift to continue or stabilize at a higher level. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (N=3 includes Periods 26-28) to capture the start of this shift while weighing the recent spikes. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 (Periods 24-28) to better capture the volatility introduced by the transition from summer lows to late-August spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School demand uplift confirmed: Average demand for P27-P28 is 78.5, an 80% increase over the P20-P26 summer baseline (44). Stockouts occurred in P27 and P28.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087014 (Ladies Denim) is exiting the low-demand summer phase (Avg P20-P26: 44) and entering a higher demand 'Back-to-School/Autumn' phase as evidenced by Period 27-28 demand (Avg: 78.5). Period 29 demand (48) was slightly lower but still aligns with the seasonal transition. Stockouts in Period 27 and 28 highlight the need for a higher base stock to accommodate this new regime. lead_time has remained consistently 0 periods throughout the game. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period average (P27-P29) which captures this autumn uplift (~68 units per period, so mu_hat for L=0 is 68). sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this transition. This approach ensures the OR backend raises the inventory level to meet the new baseline while protecting against current demand spikes.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087014 (Ladies Denim) is currently in the 'Back-to-School' and Autumn seasonal transition. Demand spiked in Mid-August (P27: 88, P28: 69) and continues to be elevated compared to the summer baseline (P20-P26 avg: 44.4). Recent demand (P27-P30) reflects an average of 69.75 units. Period 30 saw a stockout with demand at 74 units, ending the period with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To accommodate the sustained Autumn uplift and prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost vs $1 profit (suggesting a 50% service level target by the OR backend), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the current demand regime (avg ~70 per period). This will provide a base stock level that covers the 70-unit average plus volatility, which is appropriate for a product category like denim entering the cooler months.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand regime stable: Average demand for P27-P30 is 69.75, confirming a sustained shift from the summer baseline of ~44 (+57%).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in the 'Back-to-School' and early Autumn demand regime for Ladies Denim. History shows a clear shift starting around Period 27 (mid-August), where demand increased from a summer average of ~44 to a recent average of approximately 72.4 (P27-P31). Specifically, demand has been 88, 69, 48, 74, and 83 over the last 5 periods. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand frequently hits the stock ceiling (sold = on-hand in P30 and P31), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this sustained uplift and volatility while maintaining a 0-period lead time. This will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock that covers the current demand level without overreacting to the very high spring peaks.

The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in the Autumn/Back-to-School demand regime for Ladies Denim. The demand from Period 27 to Period 32 has averaged 68.6 units (88, 69, 48, 74, 83, 50), confirming a sustained increase from the summer baseline of ~44 units. Although Period 32 demand (50) was lower than the previous two periods, the overall trend since mid-August necessitates a higher base stock to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 27, 28, 30, and 31. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this Autumn regime (P27-P32), which balances the high spikes (88, 83) against the recent moderations (48, 50). This should maintain an appropriate service level for the current season.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September/early October. Historical demand for P27-P33 shows a stable autumn baseline with an average of 71.4 units, significantly higher than the summer baseline of ~44 units. Period 33 demand was high (88 units) resulting in a stockout. Given the 'Back-to-school/Autumn' regime detected since Period 27, I will focus on this recent segment (N=7) for forecasting. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50%, though the backend OR logic will apply its own z-score calculations. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures the current elevated autumn baseline while smoothing recent volatility (range 48-88).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand regime persistent through September: Average demand P27-P33 is 71.4 units/period, compared to the summer baseline of 44 units (+62%). Frequent stockouts in this period (P27, P28, P30, P31, P33) suggest the current ordering levels are slightly below peak demand spikes.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in the Autumn/Back-to-school demand regime. Analyzing the most recent period (P27 to P34), the average demand is 68.375 units per period. Despite some volatility (ranging from 44 to 88), there have been multiple stockouts (P27, P28, P30, P31, P33) when demand spikes exceeded available inventory. The carry-over insights suggest this regime has been stable since mid-August. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To better handle the observed spikes (max demand 88 in recent weeks) and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this specific seasonal baseline (~68.4 per period) and maintaining recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility. This configuration helps the OR backend set a base stock level that covers the 0-period lead time plus the review period and provides enough safety stock to mitigate the risk of stockouts during frequent peak demand weeks.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. We are in the Autumn/Back-to-school demand regime which has persisted since late August. Demand for S.Skinny L.W Epic Ladies Denim has averaged 65.6 units over the last 9 periods (P27-P35), which is significantly higher than the summer baseline of 44. Recent individual demand samples (88, 69, 48, 74, 83, 50, 88, 44, 60) show high volatility. Previous periods (P27, P28, P30, P31, P33) experienced stockouts, indicating the need to maintain higher safety stock by setting a more responsive mean. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's characteristics while accounting for the high volatility observed in September and early October.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product is Ladies Denim (super-skinny jeans). We are in the Autumn season, following the back-to-school peak. Recent demand (P34-P36: 44, 60, 39) shows a slight cooling from the earlier September peaks (P31: 83, P33: 88), with an average of 47.7 over the last 3 periods. However, the broader Autumn regime (P27-P36) maintains an average of 64.2 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Given the product's seasonal nature, demand is likely to remain relatively stable until the winter holiday season approaches. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the full Autumn regime (since P27) while smoothing out the high-volatility spikes seen earlier in the season. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to reflect the volatility of the current regime. Setting L to calculate to maintain the 0-period lead time logic.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Average demand for P27-P36 is 64.2 units/period, significantly higher than the summer baseline of 44, but lower than the spring peak (~130). Transition to late Autumn shows slight cooling in last 3 periods (avg: 47.7).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the late Autumn season for 'Ladies Denim'. Demand has stabilized over the last 11 periods (P27-P37) following the back-to-school spike, with an average of approximately 64 units per period. However, the most recent four periods (P34-P37) show a slightly lower and more stable demand pattern (44, 60, 39, 47) averaging 47.5 units, which is consistent with the 'cooling' observed in the Carry-over Insights. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the OR backend will target a 50% service level (z=0), effectively ordering to the mean demand. Setting mu_hat to the recent 4-period average (N=4) captures the current stabilized late-Autumn demand regime while preventing overstocking as we move further away from the September peak.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn demand stabilization confirmed: Period 34-37 average demand is 47.5 units/period, down from the early Autumn/BTS peak (P27-P33 avg: 71.4). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Historical demand analysis shows a stabilization in the late Autumn regime (Period 34-37 average: 47.5 units). However, Period 38 saw a slightly higher demand of 57 units, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods throughout the game. Given the transition into early November, demand for 'Ladies Denim' (trousers) may experience pre-holiday shifts or remain stable at late-autumn levels. I will set the demand forecast based on the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) to capture the current stable-to-slightly-rising trend (average ~49.4 units). Setting L to 'default' (0) as lead time is stable. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to prioritize current seasonal demand over earlier Autumn peaks.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 399087014 (Ladies Denim) shows a distinct seasonal pattern: a high peak in Spring, a lull in Summer, and a secondary peak during Autumn/Back-to-school (Aug/Sep). We are now in Late Autumn (November). Analysis of the last 6 periods (P34-P39) shows average demand has stabilized at 49.5 units/period (44, 60, 39, 47, 57, 50). This indicates the Autumn 'Back-to-school' surge has subsided, returning to a baseline slightly above the summer lows but significantly below the spring highs. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory currently sits at 0 units following two consecutive periods of 100% sales-to-on-hand ratio (P38-P39). To maintain service levels while accounting for the current stabilized demand regime, I will set L to 'calculate' (confirming 0) and use a 'recent_N' of 6 (P34-P39) to capture the current late-Autumn mean of ~50. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect the current moderate volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is Ladies Denim trousers. Demand has been extremely stable over the last seven periods (P34-P40), with an average demand of 49.3 units per period and relatively low variance compared to earlier seasonal spikes. Period 40 concluded with a demand of 51, essentially matching the recent average. The holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), which theoretically suggests a 50% service level for the base stock calculation (z*=0), but given the history of stockouts and the low lead time, maintaining a slightly higher safety buffer is prudent. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use the last 7 periods (P34-P40) to define the current demand regime, as it reflects the post-Autumn stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn regime stabilized (P34-P40): Average demand is 49.3 units/period, showing significant stability and lack of spikes compared to the Spring/Early Autumn periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The demand for product 399087014 (Ladies Denim) has entered a stable late-Autumn regime. From Period 34 to Period 41, the average demand has been approximately 49.3 units, with very low volatility compared to the earlier Spring and early-Autumn spikes. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 12 units and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1 (suggesting a 50% target service level), I will set parameters to follow the recent demand regime (P34-P41, N=8) to ensure we satisfy demand without overstocking during this lower-demand period. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this stabilized period accurately while ignoring the higher volatility seen in September.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), we observed a major demand spike (133 units), which likely corresponds to Black Friday / Cyber Monday sales for this 'Ladies Denim' product. This is significantly higher than the late autumn baseline of ~49. Given that Period 43 is early December (Dec 2nd), we must anticipate continued high volume or a transition into holiday shopping. The previous spike in P42 caused a stockout (sold only 49 of 133 demanded). To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility shown in recent periods, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent baseline plus the holiday spike, while setting sigma_hat explicitly high to handle potential further December volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Black Friday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 133 units, a 170% increase over the previous 7-period average (~49). Early December demand is expected to remain volatile.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399087014 (Ladies Denim) experienced a significant sales spike in Period 42 (Nov 25) due to Black Friday (133 units), followed by a return to baseline in Period 43 (43 units). We are now in Period 44 (Dec 9), heading into the peak holiday season. Historically, this product shows high volatility and recurring spikes. Since lead time is consistently 0, we can respond quickly, but given the stockout in Period 42 and the high likelihood of pre-Christmas demand surges, I will set mu_hat using recent demand (N=10) to capture the higher late-year average while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the recent high variance caused by the Black Friday peak. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the baseline and potential holiday spikes.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand volatility confirmed: Period 42 spike (133) followed by Period 43 stabilization (43). Expected high demand variance through December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday season (Period 45). The product (Ladies Denim) experienced a significant Black Friday spike in Period 42 (demand=133) followed by a return to lower levels in Period 43 (43) and Period 44 (31). However, historical patterns and the current calendar date suggest potential for a pre-Christmas surge or continued volatility. On-hand inventory is 26. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the backend will calculate an order based on the current period's base stock. To account for the holiday volatility while not over-ordering for a single week, I am using recent_N with N=9 to capture the behavior from early November through the Black Friday event (encompassing both spikes and dips). This provides a balanced mean but keeps the sigma (volatility) representative of the recent high-variance period to ensure adequate safety stock for possible late holiday shoppers.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand period (Dec) showing high variance: P42 spike (133) vs P44 dip (31). Demand regime is influenced by holiday seasonality rather than a stable average.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 falls on Dec 23rd, just before the Christmas peak. Period 45 saw a massive demand spike (204 units), which far exceeded the holiday spikes seen in Period 42 (133). This indicates a significant Christmas peak for the ladies denim SKU. Inventory is currently 0 due to the stockout in P45. Given the high variance (P44: 31 vs P45: 204), and the potential for clearance or post-holiday demand, but especially the certainty of the Christmas peak having passed or peaking right now, I will use an explicit forecast. The mean of the last 4 periods (holiday regime P42-P45) is 102.75. However, since P46 is the week of Christmas, I will set mu_hat conservatively to handle potential remaining holiday demand while managing the high holding cost, using the holiday season average as a base for one more period.

Carry-over insight: Christmas demand peak confirmed: Period 45 demand reached 204 units (Dec 16-22), significantly higher than the Black Friday spike (133). Regime remains highly volatile.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30). This is the final period of the game and represents the transition from the Christmas peak to the post-holiday/New Year's Eve period. Historically, demand for this Ladies Denim SKU spiked significantly in December: Period 42 (133), Period 45 (204), and Period 46 (140). While the peak of Christmas shopping has passed, the final week of December often maintains elevated demand due to New Year's sales and gift card redemptions. Recent demand (P45-P46) averaged 172 units. Stockouts occurred in both P45 and P46 because the ordering levels didn't account for these massive seasonal spikes. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire game. For this final decision, I am setting L to default (0) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 140. This matches the most recent observed demand (P46) and acknowledges that while the absolute Christmas peak (204) is likely over, demand will remain significantly higher than the pre-holiday baseline (~50) as seen in previous transitions. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility inherent in the December shopping season.

Carry-over insight: Post-Christmas demand stabilization: Following the Dec 16-22 peak (204), demand remains elevated but declining (P46: 140).
