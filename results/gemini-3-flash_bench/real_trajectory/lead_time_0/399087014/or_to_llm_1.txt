{
  "rationale": "We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a pair of super-skinny low-rise denim trousers for women. Historical demand (5 samples) shows an average of 50.2 units per week (82, 35, 31, 48, 55). The '82' in the first week may be an outlier or part of a post-holiday sale, but recent demand has stabilized near 50. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive within this same period and be available for the demand resolution phase. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The OR recommendation is 51 units, based on the empirical mean and safety factor. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, implying the OR agent targets the median demand to minimize total cost. Given that failure to meet demand results in lost profit equal to the holding cost of one unit, the OR recommendation is a sound baseline. I will follow the OR recommendation of 51 units to establish initial stock.",

With a mean demand of ~95, a standard deviation of ~29 (based on recent samples), and L=0, the base-stock level for a 50% service level (Profit $1 = Holding $1) would be the mean itself (95). OR likely includes older, lower-demand samples from Jan/Feb, causing it to underestimate the current regime. 5.

Recent demand (P7: 179, P8: 148) is significantly higher than the initial game average of ~98. This surge coincides with early April, likely driven by spring fashion demand for denim. Comparison with OR: The OR recommendation of 87 is too low because it weighs older, lower-demand samples (pre-P1 and P1-P6) equally and uses a cap logic that stifles response to recent spikes. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, suggesting we should target the median demand.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand before P7 averaged ~91 units. Following a high-demand spike in P7 (179) and P8 (148), demand for P9 dropped back to 88 units. This suggests the peak was seasonal or promotional rather than a permanent regime shift. 3. Inventory & OR: On-hand inventory is 62 units. The OR recommendation is 25 units (targeting a base stock around 87). However, the OR's critical fractile logic is constrained by a 50/50 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, making it very conservative. Given that demand can still fluctuate towards the 100+ range, and current on-hand is low, I will increase the order slightly. 4. Strategy: I will order 45 units. This will bring the total available inventory for Period 10 to 107 units (62 on-hand + 45 arrival).

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has settled into a regime averaging 99.3 units over the last 3 periods (90, 95, 113) and 120.3 units over the last 8 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 399087014 (Ladies Denim) has just passed the peak holiday season. Historical data shows extreme volatility in December: Period 42 (Black Friday) demand was 133, Period 45 (Christmas week) demand peaked at 204, and Period 46 remained high at 140. However, both previous insights and the calendar (Date: 2019/12/30) indicate a significant post-holiday decline. Following the Christmas peak in Period 45, demand typically crashes as consumer spending cools in early January. The actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustment. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The OR baseline recommends 81 units based on a long-term average that includes these recent spikes. However, the post-peak periods in mid-December (P43-P44) averaged only 37 units. Given the likely 'January slump' for apparel, I will reduce the order quantity to 45 units to cover the expected lower demand while avoiding high holding costs for unsold stock.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR recommendation from 81 to 45 units. Following the Christmas peak (204 units), demand is expected to drop significantly in the post-holiday January period.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-holiday demand decline confirmed (P46 demand 140, trending down from peak 204). Expecting return to baseline (~40-50 units) for January.",
  "action": {
    "399087014": 45
  }
}
Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand decline confirmed (P46 demand 140, trending down from peak 204). Expecting return to baseline (~40-50 units) for January.
