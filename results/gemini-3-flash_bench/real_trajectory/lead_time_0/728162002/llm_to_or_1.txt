Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11), starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory for SKU 728162002 (Womens Jersey Basic T-shirt). The demand history shows a declining trend from early January (36 units) to late January (12 units), with a slight recovery in the most recent sample (16 units on 2019-02-04). Given the promised lead time (L) is 0, the order arrives in the same period it is placed. Total mean demand across all 5 historical samples is 19.0. Standard deviation is 10.37. As we have no active 'conclude' messages yet to verify actual lead time, I will use the promised lead time of 0. I will adopt a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=4) for demand forecasting to capture the lower demand regime seen in the last month compared to the early January peak, while accounting for the 'Jersey Basic' category which typically has steady but seasonal demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. In Period 1, we ordered 19 units with a lead time of 0, which arrived immediately, but demand was 46, resulting in a stockout (19 sold, 27 lost sales). Looking at the historical samples (36, 21, 10, 12, 16) and the actual demand in Period 1 (46), there is a significant upward trend or shift. The 2019-02-11 demand of 46 is much higher than the average of the samples (~19). I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this recent increase in demand while still considering recent historical variability. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0, so I will stay with the default lead time setting.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. Current demand is significantly higher than the initial historical samples from January (which averaged around 19). In Period 1, demand was 46, and in Period 2, it jumped to 73. This upward trend suggests a seasonal shift as we move further into February/March. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). Both Period 1 and 2 ended with 0 inventory despite orders, indicating we are under-ordering. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture the recent high demand (avg ~60) and use explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in the jump from 46 to 73, ensuring the base stock level is high enough to meet this growing demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 11 (Period 1): demand increased from Jan avg of 19 to Feb avg of 60 (+215%).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's v-neck T-shirt, a basic garment. Since the start of February (Period 1), we have seen a significant and sustained increase in demand compared to January. Demand for the last three periods has been 46, 73, and 73, averaging 64. This supports the carry-over insight of a regime shift. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals in Periods 1, 2, and 3 confirm an actual lead time of 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 4 units following the Period 3 conclusion. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high demand (N=3) which averages 64. Given L=0, mu_hat should be ~64 to cover the current period. I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture this higher-demand state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162002' (Women's Jersey T-shirt) is experiencing a significant demand surge as we enter March, likely driven by seasonal transitions toward spring/summer collections. Historical demand in January averaged 19.8 units, but since February (Period 1), it has accelerated rapidly: 46, 73, 73, and 142 units. The 142-unit demand in Period 4 is a clear peak. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in-transit. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). To prevent further stockouts (which occurred in Period 1, 2, and 4), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I will use the last 4 periods (the February/March regime) to calculate the mean (approx 83.5) but adjust upward toward the most recent high observation of 142 to capture the momentum of the spring season. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the high volatility seen in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated in Period 4 (March 4): demand spiked to 142 units, a 94% increase over the previous 2-week average of 73 units, confirming strong seasonal momentum for 'Everyday Basics' t-shirts.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162002' (Women's Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt) is experiencing a massive seasonal surge as we enter spring (Period 6, March 18). Demand has grown from 46 (P1) to 234 (P5), showing a consistent upward trend well beyond the initial historical average of ~19. We have repeatedly stocked out, selling everything on hand in periods 1, 2, 4, and 5. The actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all 5 recorded transactions. To address the stockouts and capture the accelerating momentum, I am switching to an EWMA approach for the mean demand to weight the most recent surge (234 units) heavily. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use the recent_N method based on the last 3 periods (P3-P5) to better estimate the current variance while avoiding the much lower variance from the Jan/early Feb period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated significantly in Period 5 (March 11): demand reached 234 units, a 65% increase over Period 4 (142), confirming an aggressive spring ramp-up for basic jersey tops.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162002' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck) is experiencing an aggressive spring demand ramp-up. Demand has seen a consistent, steep ascent over the last four weeks: 73 -> 142 -> 234 -> 311. We have stocked out in 5 of the 6 observed periods because the OR engine's internal 'cap' and base stock levels, based on historical averages including low January demand, are significantly undershooting the current growth trajectory. The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed reliable (actual lead time is consistently 0). To break the stock-out cycle and capture the current momentum, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a forecast for the upcoming week at 400 units (accounting for 1+L=1 period of demand), reflecting the ~30% week-over-week growth seen recently. I am also setting an explicit sigma_hat of 80 to provide a sufficient buffer against high volatility given the trend's steepness and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8 critical ratio).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated significantly in Period 6 (March 18): demand reached 311 units, a 33% increase over Period 5 (234), continuing the massive spring surge for basics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $782.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162002 is a women's v-neck t-shirt, which is currently experiencing a high-growth spring demand phase. Observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Historically, demand has grown rapidly from ~20 to a peak of 311 in Period 6, before dropping slightly to 250 in Period 7. This suggests the initial vertical growth phase might be stabilizing, but demand remains high. Current on-hand inventory is 218. Given the volatility (sigma) and the high service level requirements (profit $4 vs holding $1), I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the average of the last focus weeks (Period 4-7: 142, 234, 311, 250), which is approximately 234. Adding a slight conservative buffer for potential stabilization, I set mu_hat at 280 (1+L basis) to ensure we capture any remaining growth or variance. Sigma_hat is set using recent history (N=4) to account for the significantly higher volatility of the current regime compared to the January baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey tops has stabilized or slowed after the peak in Period 6 (311 units); Period 7 demand was 250 units (-20%). Recommend monitoring for a plateau or slight seasonal cooling.

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Reviewing the history, demand for this 'Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt peaked in Period 6 (311 units) and has since significantly declined: 250 units in Period 7 and 94 units in Period 8. This indicates the primary spring surge has concluded, and we are entering a lower demand regime or potentially overshooting inventory. The current on-hand inventory is 245 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand (94). All previous orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, confirming the promised lead time is stable. I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this downward trend (average demand over P6-P8 is ~218), while allowing the OR backend to normalize. Given the high on-hand stock and decreasing demand, a moderate sigma_hat using the same recent window will help manage the risk of overstocking while providing a buffer for remaining seasonal variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: The spring peak (P6: 311) has passed, with demand dropping significantly to 250 (P7) and 94 (P8), a -70% decrease from the peak. Current demand levels are returning toward early-regime averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $622.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of extreme volatility after a major spring peak in Period 6 (311 units). Demand dropped to 250 (P7), then slumped significantly to 94 (P8), but rebounded to 187 in the most recent Period 9. This suggests the demand is not staying at the low seen in Period 8 but is settling into a post-peak seasonal level. The current date is April 15. The 'Everyday Basics' t-shirt category should remain relevant through spring and early summer, though the initial buying surge has passed. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to average the post-peak values (250, 94, 187), resulting in an average of approximately 177 per period. Given the high volatility in these three periods (standard deviation approx 78), I will use recent_N of 3 for sigma_hat as well to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this 'choppy' stabilization. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: Following the P6 peak (311), demand has averaged 177 over P7-P9, but with high volatility (range 94-250), suggesting a choppy transition to late-spring baseline levels.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt has moved past its major spring peak (Period 6: 311) and appears to be settling into a late-spring baseline. Recent demand observations for Periods 9 and 10 were 187 and 203 respectively, showing much higher stability and volume than the dip seen in Period 8 (94). This suggests a current demand regime centered around 190-200 units per week. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high stockout costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), a slightly conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=3) will be used to capture the post-peak stabilization (Avg P8-P10 = 161.3; however, N=2 would be 195). To avoid over-reacting to the P8 outlier while respecting the recent strength in P9-P10, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a buffer against the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization confirmed: Following the early April dip, demand has recovered and stabilized over the last two periods (P9: 187, P10: 203), establishing a late-spring baseline near 195 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The seasonal demand for this product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt) has entered a more volatile post-peak phase. After a massive surge ending in Period 6 (311 units), demand transitioned to a mid-range baseline. While Period 9 and 10 were stable near 200 units, Period 11 saw a significant drop back down to 104 units. Looking at the last 5 periods (P7-P11), demand has been: 250, 94, 187, 203, 104. The current average over these 5 periods is 167.6 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 107 and recent demand is highly variable, I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=5) to capture this post-peak volatility and adjust mu_hat towards the current medium-demand regime. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the risk of another dip while maintaining a buffer for potential 200-unit spikes.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand volatility confirmed (P7-P11): Demand is fluctuating between ~100 and ~200 units, averaging 168, significantly lower than the P6 peak of 311.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th. Historically, this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) experienced a massive spring surge peaking in mid-March (P6: 311 units) followed by a decline and subsequent stabilization. In the most recent four periods (P9-P12), demand has shown a lower, more stable trend: 187, 203, 104, 108. The last two periods specifically show a tight clustering around ~106 units, suggesting the intense spring buying phase has concluded, settling into a late-spring/early-summer baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory currently stands at 116 units on-hand with zero in-transit. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs as demand cools, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower post-peak demand regime (averaging 150 over 4 periods, but trending toward ~100). This allows the OR engine to right-size the base stock for the current localized demand level.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime shift confirmed: Demand has dropped and stabilized at a lower baseline (avg ~106 over P11-P12) compared to the mid-spring volatility (avg ~170 over P7-P10).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 728162002 (Womens V-neck T-shirt) is currently in a post-peak seasonal decline. After a peak of 311 units in Period 6 (March 18), demand has trended downward. The most recent three periods show demand tapering from 104 (P11) and 108 (P12) down to 61 (P13). This confirms the 'post-peak' regime identified in carry-over insights, but shows a further step down. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is 80%. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to quickly capture this latest downward shift to avoid excessive holding costs as summer approaches, while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 13: demand has dropped further to 61 units, marking a significant decline from the P11-P12 average of 106 (-42%).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt has clearly entered a post-peak cooling phase. Following the spring surge (peaking at 311 in P6), demand has settled into a lower regime. The last four periods (P11-P14) show demand values of 104, 108, 61, and 74, averaging approximately 87 units per period. The most recent two periods (P13-P14) average 67.5 units, indicating a continued descent or stabilization at a lower baseline as we approach late May. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. With 60 units currently on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand level (~87 units) while adjusting for the recent drop. This helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering and incurring excessive holding costs (which are $1.0 vs $4.0 profit) for a product past its seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a lower baseline: P11-P14 demand avg is 87 units (-50% from the P7-P10 average of 183).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for this SKU ('Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt') has significantly declined from its mid-spring peak (P6: 311) and appears to be stabilizing at a lower late-spring baseline. Over the last three periods (P13-P15), demand was 61, 74, and 69, averaging 68 units. This is a clear step down from the P11-P12 average of 106. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the P15 conclude message. With 38 units on hand and 0 in transit, we need to order to meet the current regime's requirements. I will use the last 3 samples (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the most recent stable regime (approx. 68 units/period) while ignoring the higher volatility and magnitude of the earlier spring rush.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a low late-spring baseline: P13-P15 demand avg is 68 units (down from P11-P12 avg of 106).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirts is in a sustained downward trend as the peak spring season ends. Demand over the last 4 periods (P13-P16) has been 61, 74, 69, and 49, averaging approximately 63 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs ($1/unit/period) during this cooling phase, I will use a short lookback period (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent downward momentum. This will lower the base stock level to align with current weekly sales of ~50-70 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Late spring/early summer cooling confirmed. P13-P16 average demand is 63 units, a 40% decrease from the P11-P12 average of 106 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirts showed a sudden spike in Period 17 (120 units) compared to the low baseline established in Periods 13-16 (avg ~63 units). This mirrors a similar pattern seen in the 'spring surge' and may indicate a mid-summer demand lift as we enter June. The ending on-hand inventory is 0, having sold out. To avoid stockouts while being mindful of the significant drop seen after previous peaks, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this recent increase using recent_N=5 (covering the transition from the late-spring low to the current spike, avg ~75). Given the volatility, I will use an explicit sigma_hat to provide a buffer for similar spikes, setting it higher than the recent standard deviation to ensure a higher service level during this potential uptick.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand lift detected: Period 17 demand (120) doubled the previous 4-week average (63), suggesting a new demand regime or seasonal spike.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt has entered a second seasonal surge in mid-June (Period 17: 120 units, Period 18: 173 units), following a low late-spring baseline (P13-P16 avg: 63). This spike coincides with the transition into summer. The product is currently out of stock (ending inventory 0 in both P17 and P18) due to demand exceeding the recent averages used for base stock calculations. To prevent lost sales during this summer lift, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to focus on the last 2 periods (N=2) to quickly capture this upward regime shift. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (ordered and arrived within the same period). Setting N=2 for demand mean and volatility will aggressively adjust the base stock to match the current 173+ units/week pace.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime shift confirmed: Period 17 (120) and Period 18 (173) show a sharp reversal of the late-spring cooling, with demand now 2.7x higher than the P13-P16 average.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162002' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a strong mid-summer upward demand regime. Demand has increased sequentially over the last three periods (P17: 120, P18: 173, P19: 217), indicating significant seasonal momentum as we enter late June. The average demand over these 3 periods is 170 units, with the most recent observation at 217. Both P18 and P19 resulted in stockouts (ending on-hand inventory = 0), suggesting the actual demand likely exceeded the recorded sales. To capture this growth and avoid further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to focus on this new summer regime (avg ~170). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use N=3 for sigma_hat as well to account for the increased volatility during this ramp-up phase.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime shift confirmed and accelerating: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P17: 120, P18: 173, P19: 217), averaging 170 units, which is 2.7x higher than the previous late-spring baseline of 63.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirts is currently in a mid-summer high regime. After three periods of aggressive increases (P17: 120, P18: 173, P19: 217), Period 20 showed a slight cooling or stabilization at 159 units. The average demand for this mid-summer window (P17-P20) is approximately 167 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 20 conclude' message. Since we are entering July, demand is expected to remain high but potentially stabilize compared to the rapid ramp-up seen in June. I am setting mu_hat to reflect the average of this current 4-period summer window (N=4) to capture the elevated baseline without over-reacting to the single highest peak (P19). Sigma_hat is also set to the recent 4-period window to account for the increased volatility inherent in these seasonal shifts. This approach ensures a high service level while managing holding costs as we hold 52 units on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P17-P20) established an average of 167 units, a significant increase from the late-spring baseline of 63. Period 20 (159 units) suggests a potential stabilization after the P19 peak (217).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt is currently in a mid-summer demand regime (P17-P21). Demand for the last five periods (P17-P21) has been 120, 173, 217, 159, and 178, averaging 169 units. This is significantly higher than the late-spring baseline of 63. Although demand dipped slightly after the P19 peak, it has remained resilient over the last two weeks (P20: 159, P21: 178), suggesting a stable high-summer level near 170 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the start of this summer regime in P17) to capture this new average. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to reflect the current volatility within this high-demand period. On-hand inventory is low (23), and there is no in-transit stock, so the OR backend will calculate a base stock against this higher average to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. We are currently in mid-July (Period 23). Historical data shows a clear mid-summer demand lift starting around Period 17 (early June). Demand over the last five periods (P18-P22) has been 173, 217, 159, 178, and 174, respectively. This demonstrates a stable mid-summer regime with a mean of approximately 180 units. The previous volatility noted in P19 (217 units) has smoothed out into a consistent plateau. The lead time remains reliably at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. With on-hand inventory at 25 units and a high profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend needs to maintain a robust base stock to avoid lost sales during this peak season. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this current stable summer demand level for both mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand plateau confirmed (P18-P22): demand has stabilized at an average of 180 units per period following the initial June lift.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162002' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a mid-summer high-demand plateau. Period 23 demand reached 203 units, confirming the carry-over insight of a steady average around 180 units. The inventory ended at 0 in Period 23, meaning we potentially lost sales (demand 203 vs. available 199). The actual lead time remains 0 across the entire history. Using N=6 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 covers the period from P18 to P23, capturing this sustained high-demand regime (avg ~184) and its associated volatility. This will ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current demand peak while maintaining the required service level.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand mid-summer regime. Period 24 saw a significant jump in demand to 273 units, well above the previous 5-period average of ~178. This suggests a potential late-July peak or inventory-constrained demand buildup being released. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this recent surge while maintaining a buffer against the high volatility observed in previous periods (e.g., P23 and P24 both resulted in stockouts), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu) and volatility (sigma) with N=5. This focuses on the most recent month of summer demand (P20-P24: 159, 178, 174, 203, 273), yielding an average demand of 197.4 per period. Setting L to 'default' (0) is appropriate as arrivals have match ordering periods consistently. This strategy aims to prevent further stockouts during what appears to be a sustained summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge detected: Demand increased to 273 units in Period 24, a 53% increase over the P18-P22 average of 178 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $399.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirts has entered a highly volatile mid-summer phase. Following a sudden surge to 273 units in Period 24, Period 25 saw a sharp contraction to 127 units. This volatility is consistent with previous patterns in this SKU (e.g., Period 6-8). The current date is Aug 5, 2019. Historically, demand from Period 18 to 25 has averaged 188 units, but the most recent two periods (273, 127) show high variance. To avoid overreacting to the single low data point of Period 25 while still acknowledging the high volatility, I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the broader mid-summer average (~188) rather than the long-term historical mean. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by multiple 'conclude' messages. I will use a larger sigma_hat (recent_N=5) to account for the recent spike and drop, ensuring a buffer against stockouts if demand rebounds.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand volatility identified: Following a peak of 273 (P24), demand dropped 53% to 127 (P25). Current average for the summer regime (P18-P25) is 188 units with high standard deviation.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in a volatile summer demand regime. Following a spike to 273 (P24), demand has dropped significantly to 127 (P25) and 107 (P26), which is consistent with the late-summer cooling observed in the historical demand data (Jan/Feb levels were much lower). The average demand over the last three periods (P24-P26) is 169 units, but the last two periods average 117. Given the 'Everyday Basics' category and the cooling trend seen in August, I will set N=3 for demand parameters to capture the recent deceleration while maintaining a buffer against volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed for August: demand dropped from a P24 peak of 273 to an average of 117 over P25-P26, a 57% decrease from the peak.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt is experiencing a significant late-summer cooling trend. Period 27 demand dropped to 46 units, which is a substantial decrease following the previous two periods (127, 107). This confirms the cooling trend noted in the Period 27 carry-over insight. Given the current date is August 19, we are entering the end of the peak summer retail season for basic jersey tops. On-hand inventory is currently high at 200 units, which is more than enough to cover the most recent demand levels. I am setting mu_hat to a recent average (N=3) to reflect this downward shift (Period 25-27 average is ~93 units) and will use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility at these lower levels. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline in August confirmed: P25-P27 demand averages 93 units, a 50% decrease from the P18-P24 summer plateau average of 185 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt is in a clear end-of-summer decline. Recent demand samples show a significant drop: P24 (273), P25 (127), P26 (107), P27 (46), and P28 (69). The average over the last four periods (P25-P28) is 87.25 units, which is a stark contrast to the mid-summer plateau of ~180 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 131 units. Given that the promised and actual lead times have consistently been 0 periods, we only need to cover the current period's demand. With 131 units on hand and a projected demand of ~87 units, we are already overstocked for the current period. To avoid further holding costs during this cooling phase, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent 4-week average to allow the on-hand inventory to bleed down naturally. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility to provide a safety buffer against any minor late-August spikes.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand decline confirmed (Avg P25-P28: 87 units), marking a ~50% reduction from the mid-summer plateau.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirts is currently in an end-of-summer transition. After a significant decline throughout August (P25-P28 average: 87.25), Period 29 saw a sudden uptick to 116 units. However, the overall trend since the late July peak (P24: 273) remains downward. The current on-hand inventory is 15 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the transition into September, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (P25-P29: 93 units) to account for the recent volatility and the slight uptick in P29, while acknowledging the broader seasonal cooling. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture recent variance. L remains at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand regime (P25-P29) is averaging 93 units, a 50% decrease from the mid-summer plateau (avg 188).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirts is currently in an end-of-summer regime. While the previous five periods (P25-P29) averaged 93 units, the most recent demand in Period 30 spiked to 136 units, causing a stockout. This suggest that while the summer peak has passed, there is a residual baseline or late-season bump. The carry-over insights indicate an 'end-of-summer' regime averaging around 93 units, but recent volatility (P29: 116, P30: 136) suggests that N=5 is the most appropriate window to capture the current level while smoothing the recent upward fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 to cover the (1+L) = 1 period of demand effectively, ensuring we don't under-order if this late-season demand persists.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand regime (P25-P30) is averaging 100 units, showing more resilience than the mid-August dip, with the last two periods averaging 126 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirts is currently in an end-of-summer regime. Over the last seven periods (P25-P31), demand has been volatile but has averaged approximately 109 units (127, 107, 46, 69, 116, 136, 134), trending upward slightly in the last three weeks towards a 125-135 range. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this post-peak stabilization. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and there is no in-transit inventory, making a fresh order essential to meet the steady demand seen in the beginning of September. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7 will provide a volatility estimate representative of this late-season behavior, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock for the current localized demand floor.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand regime (P25-P31) has stabilized at an average of 109 units, showing a late-season recovery from the August lows (P27-P28 avg: 57) to a steadier September baseline (P30-P31 avg: 135).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirts is in an end-of-summer/early-autumn stabilization phase. Over the last three periods (P30-P32), demand has averaged 126 units (136, 134, 109), showing more strength than the August lows. Lead time consistently remains 0. I will set mu_hat using a recent window that captures this September stabilization (N=3) to avoid overreacting to the peak summer volatility or the deep August dip. This ensures we maintain enough stock to cover the current ~126 unit demand baseline without excessive holding costs as we exit the peak season.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirts is showing a late-season recovery and resilience. Over the last four periods (P30-P33), demand has averaged 134.75 units (136, 134, 109, 160), which is a significant increase from the August lows. Period 33 demand of 160 units depleted on-hand inventory entirely. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this recent stabilizing trend while remaining responsive to the slight uptick in volatility seen in Period 33, I am using a recent_N method with N=4. This focuses on the September baseline (approx 135 units) rather than the long-term history which includes the massive spring/summer peaks (311) and August troughs (46).

Carry-over insight: September demand recovery confirmed: P30-P33 average demand is 135 units, a 45% increase over the August end-of-summer baseline (avg 93), establishing a steady early-autumn regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a post-summer, early-autumn regime for the Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt. Historically, this product saw massive volatility in demand between February and September. Reviewing the last 5 periods (P30-P34), demand has been 136, 134, 109, 160, and 70 (Average: 121.8). The Period 34 demand of 70 is significantly lower than the preceding weeks, but could be a single-period fluctuation or the start of an autumn cooling trend. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To balance the risk of a continued cooling trend against the need to maintain service levels for a product with a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent September recovery and the most recent dip, and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the heightened volatility. Lead time L is held at the promised value of 0.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt has entered a significant cooling phase as we move into mid-October (Period 36). Demand has dropped from a September average of 135 to 70 and 43 in the last two periods, representing a ~60% decline from the early-autumn baseline. This is consistent with seasonal transitions for basic short-sleeved jersey tops. With 108 units on hand and a current demand level around 40-50, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P33-P35) to capture this downward trend (averaging 91 units across 1+L periods). Sigma_hat is also updated using the last 3 periods to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: October cooling confirmed. Demand dropped from a September average of 135 to an October average of 57 (P34-P35), a 58% decrease.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in an October cooling regime for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirts. Demand has significantly decreased from the September average of 135 to an October average of 57 (P34: 70, P35: 43, P36: 58). This represents a 58% drop, confirming a seasonal transition into late autumn. The observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 85 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 1.5 periods of the current average demand (57 units/period). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this stabilized lower demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the reduced volatility in this new regime. This approach prevents over-ordering during a seasonal downturn while maintaining a safety buffer against the remaining demand variance.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162002' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a late-autumn cooling phase. Since Period 34 (late Sept), demand has significantly dropped from a September average of 135 to an October average of approximately 59 units (last 4 periods: 70, 43, 58, 64). The carry-over insight from Period 36 confirms this October cooling. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 21 units. To avoid overstocking during this low-demand regime, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods of demand (N=4) to capture the current stable baseline of ~59 units per period. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility in this regime. This conservative approach balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost by matching the immediate demand trend.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed: P34-P37 average demand is 59 units, representing a 56% decrease from the September average of 135.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, entering the November/early holiday period. Historical demand for SKU 728162002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has stabilized following an October cooling trend. Demand over the last five periods (P34-P38) was 70, 43, 58, 64, and 42, averaging 55.4 units per period. This represents a confirmed regime shift from the September average of 135. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this stable late-autumn baseline while ensuring on-hand inventory is sufficient to meet current demand levels without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: November baseline established: Demand for P34-P38 has stabilized at an average of 55 units, following a significant drop from September's peak levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirts has entered a stable late-autumn/early-winter baseline. Over the last six periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 51 units (70, 43, 58, 64, 42, 27). There is a slight downward trend in the most recent samples (P38-P39), but a six-period window (N=6) captures the overall October-November regime effectively while smoothing out fluctuations. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 39 units, which covers more than the most recent demand (27). Setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) targets an average demand of ~51 units. With a lead time of 0, the backend will target a base stock roughly equal to 51 units plus a safety margin, ensuring adequate availability for this basic item while accounting for the recent low volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is a basic V-neck t-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal decline from a high of 311 in Period 6 and 273 in Period 24 to a stable late-autumn baseline. Over the last seven periods (P34-P40), demand has averaged 48.4 units per period (70, 43, 58, 64, 42, 27, 35). The most recent three periods (P38-P40) average 34.7 units, indicating a continued slight downward drift or stabilization at a lower level. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 30 units with 0 in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established autumn baseline while accounting for recent volatility (range 27-70). This approach balances the risk of stockouts during minor late-season fluctuations against the holding cost of $1.0/unit in a low-demand regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirts has entered a stabilized late-autumn baseline. Over the last three periods (P39-P41), demand has been 27, 35, and 26, averaging 29.3 units. This is a clear decrease from the October average of ~55. We are now in a late-November regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 41 conclude' message. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent window of N=4 (covering P38-P41) to capture this new lower late-autumn baseline (average 32.5) while ensuring enough safety stock to cover small fluctuations. Sigma_hat is also set to a recent window to reflect the lower current volatility compared to the high-demand summer months.

Carry-over insight: Late-November demand regime shift confirmed: P39-P41 demand has stabilized at an average of 29 units, a 47% decrease from the previous P34-P38 average of 55 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Period 42 showed a sharp demand increase to 60 units (more than double the recent 3-period average of 29 units), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (late November). Historical lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Given the late-November spike, I expect a short-term elevation in demand for early December. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to capture both the low baseline and the recent spike (average ~37.5), and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the increased volatility caused by the sales event.

Carry-over insight: Early December demand lift detected: Period 42 demand (60) doubled the previous 3-week baseline (29), likely due to holiday promotional activity (Black Friday).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019 (Period 44). We are in the post-Black Friday period. Period 42 saw a demand spike to 60 (likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday), which significantly dropped to 15 in Period 43. This pattern suggests a return to the pre-spike late-November baseline (avg ~29 units from P39-P41). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 36 units on-hand with zero in-transit. To avoid overstocking during the mid-December lull before any potential late-December Christmas surge, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (P40-P43), which is 34 units. This incorporates both the baseline (26, 35) and the spike (60) and subsequent dip (15), providing a balanced forecast that covers the current volatility while acknowledging the baseline shift.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand dip: Period 43 demand (15) confirmed a sharp drop following the Period 42 spike (60), suggesting demand is returning to the late-November baseline of ~29 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. We are in the final weeks of the year for 'Womens Everyday Basics' v-neck t-shirts. Reviewing the demand history: Period 42 saw a holiday spike (60 units), followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (15 units) and a moderate recovery in Period 44 (23 units). The carry-over insights correctly identified a late-November/early-December stabilization around 29 units before the holiday noise. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given we are approaching the end of the year, I will base the demand forecast on the most recent 6 periods (P39-P44) which covers the late-autumn baseline through the holiday fluctuations. This gives an average demand of approximately 31 units per period [(27+35+26+60+15+23)/6 = 31]. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this current regime while smoothing out the single-period spike from Black Friday. On-hand inventory is 28 units, which is nearly one full period of expected demand.

Carry-over insight: December baseline confirmed: Demand has averaged 31 units over P39-P44, successfully smoothing the P42 holiday spike and establishing a late-season baseline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019 (Period 46). We are in the final two periods of the simulation. Historically, demand for these Women's Everyday Basics V-necks has stabilized at a low baseline during December, with the last three periods showing demand of 15, 23, and 17 (averaging 18.3 units). The mid-November promotional spike (P42 demand=60) is well in the past. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since we have 28 units on Hand and one period left after this one, and the current consumption rate is ~18 units per period, a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 will capture the post-spike baseline (P42, P43, P44, P45) to set a safe target without over-ordering and incurring unnecessary holding costs in the final stage.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, representing the final period of the year. Demand has stabilized at a low winter baseline; over the last four periods (P43-P46), demand has averaged 17.75 units (15, 23, 17, 16), significantly lower than the late-November average. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given it is the final period of the year and on-hand inventory is 31 units (covering roughly 1.7 periods of current demand), I am setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime to prevent excess stock while maintaining service. I've chosen N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-December stabilization.
