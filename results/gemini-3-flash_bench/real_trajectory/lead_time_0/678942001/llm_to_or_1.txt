Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11), managing SKU 678942001 (Women's Knitwear top). Historical demand shows a clear downward trend: 346, 235, 196, 176, 172. This suggests a post-holiday or post-early-January clearance phase stabilization. The most recent 3 samples (196, 176, 172) indicate demand is settling around a mean of ~181 units per week. Promised lead time is 0. Since we have no observed history yet (Period 1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using the default (which averages all 5 samples, including the high 346) would result in over-ordering and high holding costs, especially since the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1 ($1 profit vs $1 holding cost), meaning the optimal service level is 50%. We must avoid excess inventory.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a women's short-sleeve knit top. Historical demand shows a declining trend from Jan (peak 346) into Feb (stabilizing around 172-203). Current on-hand is 0 because Period 1 demand (203) exceeded our order/arrival (182). Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on Period 1's conclusion (order arrived same period). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat because the recent demand (176, 172, 203) reflects the current stable regime better than the Jan peaks. Since L=0, mu_hat represents 1 period of demand. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to capture current volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's short-sleeved fine-knit jumper. Current date is Feb 25, 2019. Historically, demand was around 172-235 (Jan-early Feb). However, Period 1 demand was 203 and Period 2 demand spiked to 311. This indicates a seasonal ramp-up as we move towards spring. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods for both completed orders (ordered and arrived in the same period). Stockouts occurred in both P1 and P2 (ending inventory 0), meaning true demand is likely higher than sold units. I will use recent_N=4 for demand to capture the recent upward trend while acknowledging the pre-game samples, and explicit sigma to handle the increased volatility seen in the jump from 203 to 311. I set L to 0 to reflect the observed behavior.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's short-sleeve knitwear top, entering the spring season (March). Historical demand shows: 346, 235, 196, 176, 172 (Jan/Feb). Game history reveals severe stockouts: Period 1 (sold 182/203 demand), Period 2 (sold 184/311 demand), Period 3 (sold 216/235 demand). The total demand in the last 3 periods (203+311+235 = 749) averages 250 units/period, significantly higher than the units delivered by the OR backend due to the default base_stock logic failing to account for lost sales. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To fix the chronic stockouts, I am switching to 'explicit' mu_hat to boost the base stock level. I estimate demand for Period 4 (early March) at ~280 units, reflecting the upward trend seen in Period 2 and the seasonal transition to spring tops. Since lead time is 0, mu_hat = (1+0) * 280 = 280. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=3 to capture the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant stockouts observed in P1-P3; actual demand (avg ~250) exceeds ordered units due to stockouts. Actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 5 (2019-03-11). Reviewing historical demand (including pre-game samples): Jan saw 346, 235, 196, 176; Feb saw 172, 203, 311, 235; and the most recent Period 4 demand was 150. Significant stockouts occurred in Periods 1-3 because demand (203, 311, 235) was consistently higher than the stock available (182, 184, 216). Period 4 was the first period where on-hand inventory (280) successfully met demand (150), leaving 130 units. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. The average demand across all 9 data points is approximately 224, but the recent periods show high volatility (311 vs 150). To capture the recent trend including the stockout-corrected estimates, I will use a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat, which covers the post-sample game history. This balances the high demand spikes in Feb with the lower demand in early March. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for this observed volatility. Holding cost equals profit ($1.0), so the OR backend will target a 50% service level (~median demand); my slightly elevated mu_hat ensures we don't return to the stockout conditions of Periods 1-3.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/18. The product is a short-sleeved fine-knit jumper, which typically sees higher demand in early spring (Feb/March) as customers transition seasons. History shows high demand/stockouts in Periods 1-3 (avg demand ~250) followed by a decrease in Periods 4-5 (avg demand ~136). The initial high demand might have been a pre-season push or specific campaign. Since holding costs equal profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning it will aim to stock the mean demand. Lead time is confirmed as 0. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the more current, lower demand data while still acknowledging the volatility seen in the product's history. This prevents overstocking on a potentially decelerating trend while remaining responsive to the confirmed zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Post-seasonal peak decline confirmed. Avg demand Periods 1-3 (~250) dropped to avg Period 4-5 (~136).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678942001' (Harrison short sleeve top) is currently in a steady demand regime following a post-seasonal peak decline that occurred around Period 4. In Periods 4-6, demand has averaged 139.7 units (150, 122, 147), which is significantly lower than the P1-P3 period where stockouts masked even higher demand levels. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistently validated by the 'conclude' messages (every order arrives in the same period it is placed). Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock policy will target the median demand. I will use recent_N=3 to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~140, std ~16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain L=0. This should ensure we satisfy current demand while gradually clearing the small remaining on-hand inventory without excessive overstocking.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved knit top, which typically sees sustained demand in the spring. Analyzing historical demand: Periods 4-7 show demand values of 150, 122, 147, and 158 respectively. This averages approximately 144 units per week, representing a stabilization after the initial high-demand period (P1-P3) and the subsequent dip. Period 7 resulted in a stockout (158 demand vs 140 available), suggesting that current inventory levels are slightly too tight for the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will use a recent_N strategy with N=4 to capture this stable spring demand regime for both mean and variance calculation, ensuring the base stock covers the mean demand plus a safety margin to prevent further stockouts while respecting the holding cost constraint.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at ~144 units/period from Period 4-7 (post-peak regime).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved fine-knit top, which typically sees demand growth moving into spring. Inventory has stocked out for the last two periods (P7-P8) as demand rose from a stabilized low of ~144 to 158 and 181 respectively. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I need to account for this upward trend, as the previous 'stabilized' regime has likely ended. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0. I will use a shorter window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent demand surge (average 162 over P6-P8, increasing trend) and ensure the OR backend generates a high enough base stock to cover the expected demand and replenish safety stock, given profitability equals holding cost (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Recent 3-period demand (avg 162) reflects an upward trend from the previous stabilized avg of 144, likely due to spring seasonality for the short-sleeved top.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The SKU is a women's short-sleeved top, which typically sees rising demand during spring. Looking at the history: Period 9 demand dropped unexpectedly to 80 units after a spike to 181 in Period 8. However, looking at the average demand since the stabilization in Period 4 (P4-P9), the mean is approx 140. Given the high volatility (181 followed by 80) and the seasonal nature of the product, I will use a larger N=6 for mu_hat to smooth out the outlier in Period 9 while reflecting the broader stabilization period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture this recent increase in volatility. Lead time is consistently 0, so L=0 is maintained using calculate.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (Harrison short sleeve top) is entering late April. We have seen significant volatility recently: Period 8 demand spiked to 181, whereas Period 9 and 10 saw a sharp drop to 80 and 75 respectively. The initial hypothesis of a sustained spring upward trend (average 162 in Period 9) has been contradicted by the most recent two weeks of low demand (avg 77.5). On-hand inventory is 65, which is almost enough to cover one period if demand stays at this new lower level. Since the actual lead time is confirmed as 0, the backend will order to meet the base stock target in each period. I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the recent sharp decline (Avg P8-P10: 112) while still acknowledging the high P8 figure to avoid under-stocking. This balances the risk of over-ordering if the drop reflects a true demand change versus a temporary lull. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a wider safety buffer given the recent 75-181 demand swings.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 11: Significant drop in demand observed in Period 9-10 (avg 77.5) compared to Period 7-8 (avg 169.5), invalidating the previous upward trend hypothesis.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short-sleeved jumper) is experiencing a sustained downward trend in demand as we move into late April. Demand has dropped from a stable average of ~150 (Periods 4-8) to an average of ~70 in the most recent three periods (80, 75, 54). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend's target service level is 50% ($z=0$). In this scenario, the base stock objective is essentially the mean demand for the review+lead time period. Given the clear regime shift starting at Period 9, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this lower volume and prevent excess inventory buildup as the season likely transitions towards summer-weight clothing. Lead time is consistently 0, so I will use the 'calculate' method.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: Sustained decline confirmed over Periods 9-11 (avg 69.7) compared to previous stabilization at Periods 4-8 (avg 151.6).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/06. The SKU is a 'Harrison short sleeve top', which should ideally see spring/summer demand, but the history shows a significant decline. Demand for the last 4 periods (P9-P12) has been 80, 75, 54, 68 (average ~69.25), compared to the earlier stabilization around 150. This confirms a sustained regime shift to lower volume. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is low (on-hand 2), so an order is needed. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering and holding costs, while maintaining a service level close to 50% as specified by the OR formula where profit=holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (Harrison short sleeve top) is in a low-demand regime. Average demand from Period 9 to 13 is approximately 63.8 units. The most recent demand (P13) was 42 units, confirming the continued lower trend. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as confirmed in all previous conclude messages. I will use a recent N (N=5) to capture the current demand level (avg 63.8) and volatility. Setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat aligns the base stock calculation with the observed stabilization in demand over the last 5 periods (since Period 9). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 28 units and 0 in-transit. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for the current period and order the difference to maintain the target service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level: Average demand from Period 9-13 is 63.8 units, significantly lower than the P4-P8 average of 151.6 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Harrison short sleeve top', a soft fine-knit viscose blend jumper. As of Period 15 (May 20), we are in the late spring/early summer season. Demand significantly jumped in Period 14 to 111 units, up from a previously stable average of 63.8 units observed between Periods 9-13. This spike likely reflects increased consumer interest in lighter knitwear for late spring. Although we stocked out in Period 14 (Sold: 64, Demand: 111, On-hand: 0), the actual demand confirms a upward shift. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this recent upward move while remaining cautious of previous volatility, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (averaging 54, 42, 111) to adjust for seasonal momentum, while keeping a narrow window (N=3) for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance of the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Demand increased to 111 units, breaking the low-level stability (avg 63.8) seen since Period 9, indicating a seasonal move into late spring/early summer Knitwear demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short sleeve knitwear) is experiencing a dramatic seasonal surge as we approach late May (2019/5/27). Demand jumped from 111 in Period 14 to 272 in Period 15, resulting in a stockout. This confirms the seasonal shift noted in the previous carry-over insight. Given the 0-period lead time (consistently observed from P1 to P15) and the high recent volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture this immediate surge while acknowledging the upward trend. Sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the high variance during these seasonal transitions (standard deviation of P14-P15 is ~113), ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to avoid further lost sales during this peak demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Period 15 demand spiked to 272 units, completing a 2-period trend (avg 191.5) away from the previous low-level stability (avg 63.8).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (Harrison short sleeve top) is experiencing a significant seasonal demand surge as we enter June. Demand in Period 15 (272 units) and Period 16 (246 units) has shifted the regime far above the previous low-level baseline (~64 units). We have stocked out in both Period 15 and 16, indicating our previous estimates were too conservative. The average demand over the last three periods (P14-P16) is 209.7 units, and the last two periods average 259 units. Given the short-sleeved nature of the product and the June 3rd date, this peak is likely sustained for the early summer season. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while weighting the recent surge heavily. I will also use recent_N with N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with this surge. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime sustained: Average demand for Period 15-16 is 259 units, compared to the Period 9-13 average of 63.8 units (+306%). Stockouts in P14, P15, and P16 verify that current demand exceeds prior stock targets.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Harrison short-sleeved knitwear top, currently in the peak summer demand season (June 10th). Historically, we have seen a significant demand surge starting around Period 14-15 (mid-May). Recent demand for Periods 15, 16, and 17 was 272, 246, and 244 units respectively, all resulting in stockouts because supply was constrained by the OR backend's defensive capping (based on previous low-demand history). The average demand over the last three high-growth periods is 254 units. To break out of the stockout cycle and capture the current high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 300. This slightly exceeds the recent average to account for hidden demand lost during stockouts and the likely continued summer peak. I will use a high sigma_hat (50) to reflect the volatility and uncertainty of this growth phase. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime sustained: Period 15-17 average demand is ~254 units. Frequent stockouts (P14-P17) confirm that the actual demand is consistently bottlenecked by current inventory caps.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short-sleeve knitwear) is currently in a sustained high-demand summer regime. Period 18 demand was 202 units, following a three-period surge (P15-P17) where demand averaged ~254 units. While P18 showed a slight decrease to 202, it remains significantly elevated compared to the spring low and resulted in the first non-zero ending inventory (98 units) since P13, thanks to a large order of 300. Demand for Period 15-18 now averages 241 units. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level during this peak and avoid the stockouts seen in P14-P17, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P15-P18) to capture this summer regime accurately. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (4) to reflect the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P15-P18) average demand is 241 units, with actual lead time confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (Harrison short sleeve top) is currently in a summer demand phase. After a significant surge (Periods 15-17, avg ~254), demand has decelerated over the last two periods (Period 18: 202, Period 19: 130). This suggests the peak may be passing or stabilizing at a lower level for late June. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is 218.8 units, but the most recent 2 periods (P18-P19) suggest a downward trend. To avoid overstocking while holding 111 units on-hand and facing a 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (suggesting a 50% service level target in the base stock formula), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the summer regime while reflecting the recent cooling in demand. Actual lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed: After a peak averaging ~254 (P15-P17), demand dropped to 202 (P18) and 130 (P19), indicating a shift from the peak summer surge to a more moderate summer level.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a soft, fine-knit viscose blend short-sleeved jumper. Current date is 2019/07/01. Demand history shows a clear seasonal peak in late May and early June (Periods 15-18), where demand averaged ~240 units. Since Period 19, demand has significantly decelerated, dropping to 130 and 120 in the last two periods (avg 125). This aligns with a post-peak summer pattern. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid excess holding cost as we exit the peak season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand (last 3 periods: P18-P20, avg 150.6) search and setting L to 0. This reflects the downward trend while maintaining a buffer for the current more moderate demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed post-summer peak: Average demand dropped from ~240 (P15-P18) to 125 (P19-P20), a ~48% decrease.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short-sleeved knitwear) is currently in a post-summer-peak deceleration phase. Period 21 saw a demand of 163, which is a slight increase from Period 20 (120), but significantly lower than the June peak (avg ~240). The Carry-over Insights for Period 21 noted a 48% decrease in demand compared to the peak. We are now in July (2019/7/8), and while summers can be hot, retail demand for short-sleeved jumpers often starts to moderate as the mid-summer sale season concludes. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended Period 21 at 0 due to an unexpected demand spike relative to the previous periods (163 vs 120), resulting in lost sales. To avoid further stockouts while respecting the general downward trend from the peak, I will use a 3-period window (recent_N=3) for demand mean and variance. This captures the moderate stabilization observed across Periods 19-21 (avg demand ~138). Setting L=0 explicitly as per history.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed post-summer peak: Average demand for Periods 19-21 is 137.7 units, settling significantly lower than the Period 15-18 peak (avg 240).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (Women's short-sleeved jumper) is experiencing a mid-summer demand spike. After a brief deceleration (avg ~125 in Periods 19-20), demand surged back to 163 and 221 in Periods 21 and 22, respectively, leading to stockouts. This indicates the summer season is still highly active, possibly driven by July heatwaves or sales. History shows lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this resurgence and prevent further stockouts, I will use a recent_N of 4 periods for mu_hat (avg ~158.5) to capture the upturn since Period 19, and a similar recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility. The service level target is 50% (Profit $1, Holding $1), but the OR backend's cap and base-stock logic will help bridge the current inventory deficit.

Carry-over insight: Demand resurgence in July: Average demand for Periods 21-22 is 192 units, recovering from the 125 units average in Periods 19-20. Frequent stockouts continue to occur during peaks.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short-sleeved knit top) is currently in a high-demand summer phase (late July). Looking at the recent history, we see a resurgence in demand starting around Period 21. Demand for Periods 21, 22, and 23 was 163, 221, and 171 respectively, resulting in frequent stockouts (all units sold out in P21, P22, and P23). The average demand over these last 3 periods is 185 units. Because the system has been stocking out, the true latent demand is likely even higher than the reported demand. To capture this recent regime and ensure sufficient stock for the remaining summer weeks, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to target an average of ~185. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Safety stock (sigma) will also use the recent 3 periods to account for the volatility seen in this high-demand surge.

Carry-over insight: High-demand summer regime confirmed (Periods 21-23): Average demand increased to 185 units, with persistent stockouts indicating actual demand likely exceeds currently captured sales.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 is a short-sleeved jumper. Demand historical data shows a high-volatility summer pattern. In Period 24, demand dropped significantly to 83 units from the previous range of 170-220 units. This drop follows a sequence of stockouts (P21-P23) which might have obscured true demand, but the sharp decline suggests we have passed a peak or encountered a cooling period in late July. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. Given the recent drop to 83 units, I am moving to a more conservative recent mean (N=4) to capture the shift from the high 100s/early 200s down to the current level, while maintaining enough safety stock (sigma_hat) to handle the volatility observed during this summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: Demand dropped to 83 units after a high-demand summer peak (avg ~185 in P21-P23), suggesting a potential end-of-season deceleration.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short-sleeved knit top) is entering August (2019-08-05), which typically marks the transition away from peak summer demand for womenswear. Historical demand shows a significant drop in Period 24 (83 units) followed by Period 25 (109 units), compared to the July average of ~185. This suggests the high-demand summer regime is ending. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize the most recent data (Periods 24-25) to set the forecast, while maintaining a slightly higher mu_hat to ensure we don't stock out if demand fluctuates during the late summer clearance or final warm-weather weeks. N=3 is selected to capture the shift while providing a minimal sample size for variance.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand deceleration confirmed: Average demand for Periods 24-25 dropped to 96 units, a ~48% decrease from the July peak average of ~185.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short-sleeved knit top) is entering mid-August (2019/8/12). Recent demand history confirms a significant drop from the July peak (avg ~185) to a lower end-of-summer regime. Specifically, the average demand over Periods 24-26 is 110.33 units ((83+109+139)/3). Although Period 26 demand (139) was higher than the previous two weeks, the overall trend since late July suggests a deceleration as the retail season transitions away from summer items. Lead time is reliably confirmed as 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a seasonal item potentially nearing the end of its lifecycle, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period average (N=3) to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining responsiveness to the slight uptick in Period 26. sigma_hat will also use the same window to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short-sleeved knit top) is exhibiting high demand volatility as it transitions through different seasonal phases. After a period of deceleration (P24-P25), demand spiked again in P27 to 234 units. However, looking at the full history and the current date (mid-August), these spikes are likely clearing events or late-summer peaks rather than a sustained new high-growth regime. The product is a lightweight knit (viscose blend), which typically sees a final surge before the autumn transition. Since P26-P27 saw a stockout and a significant jump in demand (avg ~186), but P24-P25 were lower (avg 96), I will use a balanced lookback (recent_N=4) to capture the recent volatility without overreacting solely to the P27 spike. This N=4 covers the transition from low (83, 109) to high (139, 234) demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The balancing of profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) results in a target service level of 0.50, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the model to adjust to the higher recent variance while acknowledging the cooling trend from previous weeks.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand volatility: Significant resurgence in demand observed in mid-August (P26-P27 avg 186.5) following a late-July lull (P24-P25 avg 96).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short-sleeved knit top) is currently in a late-summer volatile period (late August). Recent demand (Periods 26-28) shows a significant resurgence with values of 139, 234, and 175 (avg ~183) following an late-July dip. Stockouts occurred in the last three periods (P26-P28), indicating that the actual demand is consistently higher than the available stock. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To capture this high-demand signal and mitigate persistent stockouts, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to prioritize the most recent resurgence. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the high service level target (profit=holding cost implies a 50% base stock target, but the OR backend's cap uses a 95th percentile buffer), focusing on the last 3 periods reflects the current demand regime most accurately.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand resurgence confirmed: Periods 26-28 average demand is 182.7 units, significantly higher than the P24-P25 average of 96 units (+90%). Persistent stockouts in P26-P28 confirm that demand is bottlenecked by inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short-sleeved knit top) is in a late-summer phase (Period 30, Sept 2). History shows a resurgence in demand from P26-P28 (avg ~183), but Period 29 shows a slight cooling to 140 units. This mirrors the previous 'wave' patterns seen throughout the season. Given the transition into September, a moderate deceleration is expected as the product type (short-sleeved viscose blend) loses seasonal relevance. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the most recent 4 periods (P26-P29) represent the current 'late-summer resurgence' regime (avg 172), I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using recent_N helps the OR backend capture the high volatility (139, 234, 175, 140) and ensure the service level is maintained against potential stockouts seen in the recent past, while preventing excessive overstocking as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand resurgence (P26-P28 avg 183) showed signs of cooling in P29 (140 units). Demand continues to be highly volatile.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short-sleeved knitwear) is experiencing late-summer/early-autumn volatility. Following a mid-August resurgence, demand dropped to 140 in Period 29 before spiking back to 191 in Period 30, resulting in a stockout. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Given the product type and date (Sept 9), we are likely entering an end-of-season transition where demand may become more erratic. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (avg ~149.8) to capture the recent volatility while avoiding over-reacting to the single Period 30 spike, and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the high standard deviation (approx 39) in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in early September: Period 30 demand (191) caused a stockout despite the Period 29 cooldown (140), showing continued late-season strength in Knitwear.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits significant late-season demand strength for knitwear in September (P30: 191, P31: 195). Over the last three periods (P29-P31), demand averaged 175.3 units, but persistent stockouts in 6 of the last 8 periods indicate that actual market demand is significantly higher than captured sales. Specifically, Period 31 ended with 0 inventory despite an arrival of 176 units, failing to satisfy the demand of 195. With lead time consistently at 0 periods, I will set L to 0. To capture the current high-demand volatility and prevent further stockouts, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 200 (rounding up from the most recent 195 demand) and an explicit sigma_hat of 40 to provide a robust safety buffer against the observed volatility in this late-summer/early-autumn transition. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, suggesting a target service level of 50%, but the presence of frequent stockouts justifies a more aggressive base stock to capture missed profit.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: Average demand for P30-P31 is 193 units, with actual market demand likely exceeding captured sales due to 0 ending inventory in both periods. Demand has risen significantly from the late-August cooling (P29: 140).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23 (Period 33). The product is a fine-knit viscose blend jumper (Knitwear), which typically sees strong demand in late summer and autumn. Historical demand shows a persistent high-demand regime throughout September: P30 (191), P31 (195), and P32 (147), with an average of 177.7 units. Stockouts occurred in P30 and P31, indicating that actual demand was higher than recorded sales. Period 32 demand (147) was lower but still significant, and we ended with 53 units on-hand. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To capture the remaining early-autumn demand while protecting against the eventual seasonal downturn in Knitwear as weather gets colder, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this high-demand September baseline (avg 177.7). This provides enough stock for current high levels while the capped policy will naturally moderate ordering if demand begins to soften next week.

Carry-over insight: September high-demand regime (P30-P32) average demand is 177.7 units, sustained from previous late-August resurgence. Stockouts in P30-P31 confirm market demand exceeded stock until P32.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 is a knitwear top experiencing high demand volatility during the transition from late summer to early autumn. Period 33 observed a significant demand spike to 224 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This confirms that the September high-demand regime (previously estimated at ~178 units) remains robust and is likely intensifying as the season progresses. The average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P30-P33) is 189.25 units, with the most recent observation significantly higher. Given the consistent stockouts (P30, P31, P33), actual demand is likely higher than the sales figures. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 210 (roughly (1+L)*210 where L=0) to account for this unmet demand and seasonal strength. L is set to explicit 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals verified throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge in late September confirmed: Period 33 demand of 224 units resulted in a stockout, showing that market demand continues to exceed previous 'high-demand' estimates of ~178. September/October transition remains a peak regime for this Knitwear item.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 is a Knitwear item currently in a highly volatile late-September/early-October regime. Historical demand shows a significant surge peaking at 224 in Period 33, followed by a sharp drop to 100 in Period 34. However, frequent stockouts (P30, P31, P33) suggest that market demand often exceeds captured sales. Given the transition into October, we should remain prepared for volatility. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=5 (Periods 30-34) which covers the recent surge (avg demand ~171). This N=5 captures the high-demand volatility and the recent cooling simultaneously. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. The holding cost of $1.0 vs profit of $1.0 results in a 50% target service level, which the OR backend will use to balance stockouts and inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in late-September: Demand fluctuated between 100 and 224 (avg ~171) over Periods 30-34, with frequent stockouts indicating market demand is higher than captured sales.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved fine-knit jumper, which typically experiences peak demand during transition seasons (spring and autumn). Current data (mid-October) shows a downward shift in demand following a late-September surge. Demand in P34 and P35 was 100 and 99 units respectively, marking a significant drop from the P33 peak of 224 and the prior high-demand average of ~178 (P30-P32). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given that demand has nearly halved and stabilized for two consecutive periods, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to a recent_N window (N=2) to capture this cooling trend and prevent excessive holding costs. Sigma_hat is set using a slightly longer window (N=5) to account for recent volatility while still reflecting the current lower mean level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Demand for the transition-season knitwear has decelerated from a late-September high (avg ~178) to a stable lower level (avg 99.5 in P34-P35), likely signaling the end of the autumn peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'short-sleeved jumper' (Knitwear), which typically sees demand peaks during seasonal transitions (Spring and Autumn). Period 36 (mid-October) data confirms a sustained deceleration in demand as we move deeper into autumn/winter, with demand dropping from a late-September high (avg ~178) to 70 units in Period 36. This aligns with the 'carry_over_insight' from Period 36. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs during this cooling phase, I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent window (N=3) to focus on the current lower demand level (avg ~90). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the current reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed in mid-October: Average demand for Periods 34-36 dropped to 89.7 units, compared to the late-September peak (P30-P33 avg 189). Actual lead time remains 0.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this short-sleeved knitwear item is in a confirmed deceleration phase as it transitions out of the autumn peak. For Period 38 (late October), recent demand has stabilized at a lower level: Period 34 (100), Period 35 (99), Period 36 (70), and Period 37 (79). The average for the last four periods is 87 units. To avoid excess holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I am setting mu_hat to reflect this recent regime using recent_N=4. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to capture the current volatility without being influenced by the significantly higher volatility of the September surge. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved fine-knit top, which is typically a transitional or summer item. Historical demand analysis shows a significant cooling phase following the autumn peak. Specifically, demand in Period 38 dropped to 41 units, continuing the deceleration trend observed since mid-October (P34-P37 avg ~87). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 77.8 units, while the last 3 periods (P36-P38) average ~63 units. Given the approach of winter, demand for short-sleeved knitwear is expected to remain low or continue to decline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this deceleration while maintaining enough sample stability to avoid over-reacting to a single low point (P38). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower-demand regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Demand dropped to 41 units, confirming a continued deceleration from the autumn peak (P34-P37 avg ~87) as the season transitions into winter.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (Knitwear short-sleeved jumper) is experiencing a continued seasonal decline as we move further into November. Demand has dropped from an average of ~87 (P34-P37) to ~37 (P38-P39), signaling the end of the transition season. The latest demand was 33 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P37-P39) to prioritize the current downward trend. Sigma_hat is also set to a recent 3-period window to capture the reduced volatility at these lower volume levels. This approach balances the risk of overstocking as the product exits its primary season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: Continued deceleration confirmed into early November (P38-P39 avg ~37) from previous autumn levels (~87), marking the end-of-season transition for this short-sleeved knitwear item.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is late autumn/early winter. Demand for this short-sleeved knitwear item has significantly decelerated, with the last three periods (P38-P40) showing demand of 41, 33, and 17 respectively. This confirms the transition out of the autumn peak. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a declining product, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent end-of-season behavior (avg ~30.3 units). This conservative approach aligns with the high holding cost relative to the low current unit demand during the off-season. Lead time will remain at 'calculate' since it is stable at 0.

Recent demand over the last 4 periods (P38-P41) has been 41, 33, 17, and 21, averaging approximately 28 units. This confirms the end-of-season regime shift noted in Period 40. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a declining seasonal item, I am moving to a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 to capture this low-demand baseline. This will set the base stock based on the most recent month of end-of-season data.

The SKU 678942001 is a short-sleeved jumper, which experienced significant demand peaks in summer (June/July) and early autumn (September). We are now in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). We observed a demand resurgence in Period 42 (68 units), which broke the previous end-of-season deceleration trend seen in Periods 38-41 (avg ~28). This spike is likely driven by Holiday/gift-giving season shopping in early December. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the backend calculates a 50% service level. However, previous history shows that under-ordering during volatility leads to frequent stockouts (ending Period 42 with 0 units). I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3, including the recent spike) to capture this renewed interest, and using explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (68 vs 17) to ensure adequate safety stock during the holiday window.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Late-season demand resurgence observed in Period 42 (68 units), likely due to holiday gifting seasonality, breaking the winter deceleration trend (P38-P41 avg ~28).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand shows high late-season volatility: after a holiday-driven surge to 68 units in P42 (resulting in a stockout), P43 demand dropped back to 20 units. This suggests the pre-holiday peak was short-lived or bottlenecked. Actual lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3, avg ~37) to capture this recent volatility while respecting the lower baseline of the winter season for this short-sleeved item. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the high variance between the surge and the sudden drop (68 vs 20).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: High late-season volatility confirmed; a 1-period surge in P42 (68 units) was followed by a sharp drop in P43 (20 units), indicating inconsistent holiday demand signals.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (2019/12/16), we are in the middle of December. The product is a short-sleeved knitwear item. After a sharp autumn deceleration (avg ~28 in P38-P41), we saw a volatile holiday signal (68 units in P42 followed by 20 and 15 in P43-P44). Given it is mid-December, demand is likely to remain at these moderate holiday levels before dropping further in January. The average demand for the last three periods (P42-P44) is 34.3 units. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this recent holiday volatility while acknowledging the overall winter low. Inventory is 22 units on-hand, and lead time is confirmed as 0. Setting mu_hat to capture this recent average ensures we cover potential late-December demand without overstocking for the January lull.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: December periods (P42-P44) show an average demand of 34.3 units, significantly higher than the late-November lull (~28) but characterized by high variance (68 vs 15).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23, leading into the final week of December (Christmas week). The product is a short-sleeved knitwear top. Historical demand shows a significant winter deceleration, with a small holiday spike in Period 42 (68 units) followed by stabilization (avg ~18 units for P43-P45). Given the holiday season, there is potential for a final minor peak before the post-Christmas clearance/transition phase. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods throughout the history. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized low-demand regime (avg ~18 units) which reflects the current winter demand level, while maintaining enough safety stock to handle minor holiday-related variance.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved knitwear item, which has seen a significant demand decline moving into the winter season. Recent demand in December (Periods 42-46) has been volatile but low, with an average of 30.4 units (68, 20, 15, 20, 29). The stockout in Period 46 (demand 29, sold 19) indicates that even at these low levels, my inventory targets were slightly too lean due to high variance. Given the post-holiday, mid-winter timing (late December/early January), demand is expected to remain low but stable until the spring transition. I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the December volatility) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring enough safety stock to handle the observed variance while avoiding overstocking as the season ends. Lead time is consistently 0.
