  "rationale": "Product 610776022 is a 'Tilly' women's basic T-shirt. Historically, demand has grown significantly from early January (53 units) into early February (233 units), likely due to the transition into spring/summer seasons. For Period 1 (2019/2/11), the most recent demand was 233. Given the upward trend and 'everyday basic' nature, demand is expected to remain high or continue increasing as spring approaches. Promised lead time is 0, but as this is the first period, the order must arrive following the decision to meet the demand occurring within this period. Current on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0. To satisfy a projected demand of ~240-250 units and maintain some buffer for potential lead time delays or further demand surges, an order of 250 units is placed.",

Period 1 actual demand was 267, continuing this growth. The average of the last three periods (including P1 demand) is approximately 250 units. c) Lead Time: Confirmed lead time is 0 periods (P1 order arrived in P1).

I missed demand in P1 (sold 250, demand 267), so I need to cover the current period's demand immediately. e) Final Order Logic: Since lead time is 0, I should order enough to cover the forecasted demand for Period 2.

Game history shows high early February demand (267, 354) followed by a sharp decline into March (277, then 166). This reflects a transition from early spring/pre-season interest to a stabilization phase. The promised lead time of 0 is confirmed by four consecutive periods (P1-P4) where orders arrived instantly.

Current on-hand inventory is 200, which is enough to satisfy this expected demand without an additional order.

This spike may be attributed to a 'spring refresh' or pre-Easter shopping behavior as temperatures begin to rise in late March. Lead time is confirmed as 0. Given the high demand in Period 6 (310) and current zero on-hand inventory, I need to order enough to fulfill expected high demand for Period 7. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), it is important not to over-order, but the cost of lost sales (lost profit) is also high.
