Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for this Jersey T-shirt shows a significant spike in late January (55 and 47 units) compared to early February (23 units). Given the product is a staple t-shirt, demand might stabilize after the late January surge. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no historical lead time data yet, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent volatility without overreacting to the single low point on Feb 4th. This balances the recent high demand with the most recent lower observation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 starts with 0 on-hand inventory because Period 1 demand (79) exceeded the arrive-on-the-same-day stock (32). The actual lead time for the Period 1 order was 0, matching the promised lead time. Historical demand samples (13, 21, 55, 47, 23) show a mean of 31.8, but Period 1 saw a significant jump to 79. This product is a 'Long T-shirt' (Jersey Basic), and the date is mid-February (shaping up for Spring). The recent volatility and the spike in Period 1 suggest we need to adjust for a higher demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma to capture this upward shift while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time 'L' remains 0 as confirmed by Period 1's conclusion.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Jersey Basic Long T-shirt (711053003). Historically, demand for early Feb was 13-55, but the last two periods (Feb 11, Feb 18) showed a significant spike to 79 and 115 respectively, likely indicating the start of a spring/pre-spring demand regime for basic jersey items. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have stocked out in both Period 1 and Period 2 because demand far exceeded the starting on-hand. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To address the stockouts and capture the current upward trend, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat (averaging the spike of 115, 79, and the last high historical sample of 47) and explicit sigma_hat set to a higher value (30) to account for recent volatility and avoid further stockouts in a high-demand phase. The OR backend will compute the base stock using these parameters to maximize profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: avg demand increased from ~32 (early Feb) to ~97 (last 2 weeks). Lead time remains 0 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Long T-shirt', which is entering peak spring demand in early March. Historical demand prior to Feb 11 averaged ~32 units. However, current game history (Period 1-3) shows a significant demand surge with demand values of 79, 115, and 96, averaging 96.7 units per period. The backend OR engine has been under-ordering (ordering 32, 50, and 73) because its internal statistics (using 'all samples') are lagging significantly behind the current regime. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to isolate these three recent periods (Period 1-3) to calibrate mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by 'conclude' messages showing same-period arrival. Ending inventory has been 0 consistently, indicating high lost sales and a need for a much higher base stock to maximize profit given the 1:1 Profit-to-Holding ratio (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Since 2019-02-11, average demand increased from ~32 to 96.7 (+200%). Lead time confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 711053003 (Long T-shirt) has undergone a significant regime shift starting from Period 1 (2019-02-11). Historical samples prior to Period 1 averaged ~32 units. Since Period 1, observed demand has been: 79, 115, 96, 117, averaging 101.75 units per period. This shift likely corresponds to the approach of Spring, increasing demand for short-sleeved basic t-shirts. In all 4 periods, stockouts occurred (sold = on-hand, ending inventory = 0), meaning true demand is likely higher than 101.75. Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this higher demand and stop the cycle of under-ordering, I will use the recent_N method with N=4 (covering the high-demand regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N will allow the OR backend to recalculate stats based on the latest spike while the base stock formula (z* for 50% service level due to $1/$1 profit-holding ratio) will target the mean, but the cap should allow for slightly more inventory to finally meet demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-02-11 confirmed: average demand increased from ~32 to >101.75 units. Frequent stockouts suggest true demand is higher than units sold.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. Historical demand data (pre-game) showed a mean of ~32, but since Feb 11th, demand has consistently surged, averaging roughly 97.6 units over the last 5 periods (79, 115, 96, 117, 81). The last period (P5) saw demand drop slightly to 81, which allowed us to keep some ending inventory (21 units) for the first time since the surge began, suggesting we are finally meeting demand. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the surge is now stable over 5 periods, I will use recent_N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this new regime's mean and volatility. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that covers the sustained higher demand while accounting for the significant variance observed (ranging from 79 to 117).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-02-11 confirmed over 5 periods: average demand settled at ~98 units per period (range 79-117). Lead time stable at 0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711053003' (Long T-shirt) is in a high-demand regime that began around 2019-02-11. Historically, demand in this new regime (Periods 1-6) has averaged ~96.7 units (79, 115, 96, 117, 81, 92). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message. In Period 5 and 6, we finally began ending with positive inventory, suggesting our base stock levels are now better aligned with true demand. Given the current date (late March), we should maintain this higher stock level to avoid the frequent stockouts seen in Periods 1-4. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (z=0), meaning the OR engine will target the mean. To ensure we don't stock out due to volatility, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current regime's mean and variance correctly.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053003 (Cotton blend T-shirt) entered a stable high-demand regime on 2019-02-11. Current demand observations for the last 7 periods are: 79, 115, 96, 117, 81, 92, and 95. The mean for this regime is 96.4 with a standard deviation of approximately 14.1. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning z* is 0. The OR backend will aim to set the base stock at the mean forecast (96.4). As demand has been extremely consistent since the shift (range 79-117), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this specific regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we cover the expected demand of ~96 while accounting for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), there was a massive demand spike to 190 units, far exceeding the recent average of ~93 units (Periods 5-7). This jump likely corresponds to seasonal spring/summer preparation for a 'Long T-shirt' in April. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the backend target service level (q) is 0.5, which leads to conservative stocking. However, the game history shows frequent stockouts (Periods 1-4 and Period 8), meaning 'true' demand is often higher than 'sold' units. To prevent lost sales during this clear upward seasonal shift, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 190 (the latest demand observation) to ensure the base stock captures this new peak. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the volatility seen during the recent period of higher demand. Lead time is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand spike detected: Period 8 demand jumped to 190 units (from ~93 avg), coinciding with seasonal transition for T-shirts in April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. We are in a high-demand period for this SKU (a cotton jersey T-shirt), likely driven by spring/summer seasonality. In Period 8 (April 1), we observed a massive spike to 190 units of demand, which resulted in a stockout. Period 9 saw demand return to 101 units, though this is still slightly higher than the previous baseline of ~93-98. Given the product's seasonal nature, volatility is high. The backend logic for base stock (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) where Profit=1 and Holding=1 results in a 50% service level (z=0), which effectively targets the mean and often leads to stockouts in volatile regimes. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the recent significant jump in both mean and variance (Periods 8 and 9), ensuring our safety stock calculation (via sigma_hat) accounts for the recent 190-unit spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand pulse confirmed in April: Demand reached 190 units (P8) before stabilizing at 101 (P9). High volatility requires N=2 for sigma tracking.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. We are managing a T-shirt SKU. Recent demand history shows a significant pulse in early April (190 units in Period 8), which has now stabilized back to around 81-101 units in the last two periods (P9 and P10). The average demand over the last two stabilized periods is 91 units. Since we are entering late April and demand has shown extreme volatility recently, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 2 to captures the post-spike stability. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=2 to reflect the high local variance between the spike (190) and the normalization (81). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all concluded messages.

Carry-over insight: Post-April-spike stability: Demand stabilized at avg 91 units (P9: 101, P10: 81) following the seasonal pulse in P8.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal pulse in Period 8 (April 1st, 190 units) which has since stabilized. The last three periods (P9-P11) have shown demand of 101, 81, and 74, respectively, averaging approximately 85 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. The Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.00), implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5, which leads the OR backend to target the mean demand. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to sensitive to the post-spike stabilization while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. This ensures we don't over-order based on the April 1st outlier while still covering the established baseline for this T-shirt SKU as we enter May.

Carry-over insight: Post-April-spike demand stabilization confirmed: Period 9-11 demand average is 85.3 units, significantly lower than the P8 peak of 190.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are in a stable post-April demand regime where T-shirt demand has normalized after a seasonal spike in Period 8. The demand in Period 12 was 104, which is higher than the previous three periods (101, 81, 74) but consistent with the established range (approx. 75-105). Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. To respond to the slight uptick in demand in Period 12 and maintain sufficient service levels for this jersey basic item, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the stable post-spike demand (P9-P12 avg demand is (101+81+74+104)/4 = 90). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to reflect the moderate volatility observed over the last few weeks (P10-P12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May. Following a seasonal spike in early April (P8 demand = 190), demand for the long T-shirt (SKU 711053003) has stabilized in a post-peak regime. Over the last five periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged 86.4 units (101, 81, 74, 104, 72). The most recent period (P13) saw demand of 72 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims to set the base stock close to the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the post-spike average, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the moderate volatility (std ~14) observed in this regime. This ensures inventory stays lean while covering current demand trends.

Carry-over insight: Post-April-spike demand regime (P9-P13) established: mean demand ~86 units with moderate volatility (standard deviation ~14).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a long T-shirt, which is currently in its main seasonal window. Demand has stabilized over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) following a significant seasonal spike in early April (P8). Since P9, demand values have been: 101, 81, 74, 104, 72, 81. This yields a mean of 85.5 units and a standard deviation of approximately 13.5. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-spike stability while maintaining enough responsiveness for late-spring fluctuations. The critical target is to prevent stockouts seen in Periods 8 and 12 where ending inventory hit zero.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for this T-shirt SKU has stabilized following an April spike. In the most recent periods (P13-P15), demand has been 72, 81, and 96, showing a slight upward trend as summer approaches. However, the last period (P15) ended in a stockout (demand 96, starting inventory 86), indicating that true demand might be slightly higher than sold units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the current regime and prevent stockouts while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (which targets a 50th percentile/median service level), I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most recent stability and slight upward drift. N=3 is chosen because it encompasses the post-stabilization period since mid-May.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27) shows a massive demand surge of 243 units, which is significantly higher than the previous April peak (190) and the recent average (~86). This appears to be a summer seasonal spike for T-shirts as we enter June. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, but due to the extreme stockout in Period 16 (only 83 units available for 243 demand), I must aggressively adjust for this new regime. Demand from P13-P15 was stable (~83), but P16 is nearly triple that. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat to capture this spike, setting it near the observed demand of P16 to avoid further heavy stockouts, while using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal demand spike detected: Period 16 demand surged to 243 units (previous avg ~86), indicating a high-volume regime for June.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand summer regime. Period 16 saw a massive spike to 243 units, and Period 17 confirmed this shift with a demand of 178 units. The average for the last two periods is approximately 210.5 units, which is significantly higher than the spring average of ~86. The profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a service level target (critical ratio) of 0.50 (z=0). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this new high-volume summer regime while remaining sensitive to recent volatility, I am using recent_N=2 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will ensure the base stock calculation reflects the June demand surge (243, 178) rather than being diluted by historical spring data.

Carry-over insight: Summer high-demand regime confirmed for June: average demand increased from ~86 to ~210 units (P16: 243, P17: 178).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer regime for T-shirts (June). History shows a demand surge starting in Period 16 (2019-05-27) with demand values of 243, 178, and most recently 132 in Period 18. The mean demand for this 3-period regime is approximately 184.3 units. While the demand declined from the initial peak of 243, it remains significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~86. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this new regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures we have enough safety stock to manage the high volatility (sigma) observed during the transition into summer while adjusting for the high average demand. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer high-demand regime demand stabilization: After a peak of 243 in P16, demand averaged 184.3 over P16-P18 (243, 178, 132).

Daily Reward (R_t): $185.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tess Tee' (a T-shirt SKU) has entered a high-volume summer regime starting mid-May. Following a massive demand spike of 273 in Period 19 (which resulted in a stockout), the demand average for the last four periods (P16-P19) is 206.5 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0. Given the current date is June 24th, we are in peak summer season for this category. The OR backend uses a capped policy based on the base stock z-score (which will be 0 as profit = holding cost = $1.0). I will use recent_N=4 to capture this local summer average of ~206 while maintaining responsiveness to the high volatility (sigma) observed during these peak periods (~64). This ensures the base stock reflects current high demand levels to minimize further stockouts during the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand accelerated: Period 19 reached a new high of 273 units. June average (P17-P19) is 194.3, up from Spring average of ~86 (+125%).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. We are in the peak of the summer demand season for t-shirts. Demand history for June (Periods 17-20) shows a significantly elevated regime: 243 (P16), 178 (P17), 132 (P18), 273 (P19), and 201 (P20). The average demand over these last 5 periods is 205.4 units, representing a sustained +140% increase over the spring base of ~86 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this summer growth and set a robust base stock that avoids the frequent stockouts seen recently (P16, P19), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering the June regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to target a service level appropriate for the summer peak using the most relevant recent volatility and volume metrics.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (June-July) confirmed: Average demand has risen to ~205 units (P16-P20), a +140% increase over spring averages (~86).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. We are in the middle of a high-volume summer regime for T-shirts. Demand has been elevated since late May (Period 16). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 197.8 units, though this includes some significant spikes (up to 273) and dips (132). The most recent period (P21) saw demand of 160 units, showing a slight cooling from the late June peak, but overall demand remains high compared to spring averages. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend targeted service level (q) is 0.5, effectively the median. Given the recent variability (\u03c3 is approximately 52 for P16-P21), I will use N=6 to capture this entire summer regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the base stock accounts for both the high summer volume and the recent variance to prevent stockouts seen earlier in June.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the peak summer demand regime for this SKU (T-shirt). Demand in Period 22 dropped to 109 units from higher levels in June/July (which saw peaks up to 273), but remains significantly above the spring baseline (~86). Historical evidence from Carry-over Insights shows that summer demand (late May through July) has averaged approximately 205 units, though recent periods (P21 and P22) show a potential cooling or stabilization (160 and 109 respectively). Given the high volatility observed in this peak season (P16-P22), I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the high summer average (approx 185) while allowing the model to start adjusting for the recent downtrend. I will use recent_N=7 for sigma_hat as well to maintain a high safety stock buffer due to the extreme variance seen during this season (samples ranging from 109 to 273). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime appears to be cooling: Period 22 demand (109) is the lowest since the surge began in Period 16, following Period 21 (160).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 711053003 (Long T-shirt) remains highly volatile in the summer season. While Period 22 slowed down (109 units), Period 23 surged back to 268 units, confirming that the high-demand summer regime is still active. Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), implying the OR backend aims for a 50% service level (the median). Given the stockout in Period 23 (starting on-hand 186, demand 268, sold 186), we must ensure base stock is high enough to capture these recurring summer peaks. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the high average demand of the last month (Avg P20-P23 \u2248 184 units) and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed (ranging from 109 to 268).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand remains active as of Period 23: Following a brief dip in Period 22 (109 units), demand spiked again to 268 units in Period 23. Average demand for July (P21-P23) is approximately 179 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-07-29. This SKU (T-shirt) is in the middle of its summer peak season. Analyzing demand since the start of June (Period 17 onwards): demand values have been 178, 132, 273, 201, 160, 109, 268, and 216. The average demand during this high-volume regime is approximately 192 units per period, with significant volatility (standard deviation ~55). Period 24 demand (216) indicates that the peak hasn't subsided yet. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current high-demand summer regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock level to handle these frequent spikes (e.g., the 216-273 unit range).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (June-July) remains high: mean demand from Period 17-24 is ~192 units, with high volatility (range 109-273).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711053003' (Long T-shirt) is currently in a sustained 'Summer high-demand' regime that began in June. Period 25 (Late July) demand was 168 units, continuing a pattern of high volume (average ~190 units over the last 9 periods). While the summer peak may begin to taper soon as we enter August (Period 26), there is no statistical evidence yet of a regime downshift. Historical data shows multiple stockouts (Periods 23, 24) when demand exceeded 200 units, indicating we should maintain a robust safety stock. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods. I will use recent_N=9 for both mean and volatility to capture the current high-demand summer regime (Periods 17-25) while excluding the lower spring averages. This balances the high service level required for the $1 profit/ $1 holding cost ratio (50% critical ratio) with the current market behavior.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the late summer period for a 'Long T-shirt in soft jersey'. Observations from Period 22 to 26 show demand figures of 109, 268, 216, 168, and 121. While the peak June-July demand (which saw peaks of 273 and 268) seems to be tapering off as we head into mid-August, demand remains significantly higher and more volatile than the Spring baseline of ~86. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 176 units. Given the high standard deviation (approx 65 over this 5-period window), I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent cooling trend while maintaining a relatively high stock level to guard against the remaining summer volatility. L remains 0. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current high-variance environment.

Carry-over insight: Mid-August demand tapering: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P22-P26) has decreased to ~176 units from the June-July peak (~205), though volatility remains high.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand shows the product (Tess Tee T-shirt) experienced a sharp summer peak from June through July (Periods 16-24), with demand often exceeding 200 units. However, demand has since cooled in August, with the last three periods recording 168 (P25), 121 (P26), and 106 (P27). This indicates a transition out of the peak summer regime. Mean demand over these last three periods is 131.7 units. Given the trend is clearly downward as we approach the end of summer, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this deceleration while maintaining enough safety stock for the lingering volatility. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand tapering confirmed: Mean demand for P25-P27 decreased to ~132 units from the June-July peak (~192), indicating the end of the summer seasonal surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the long T-shirt (SKU 711053003) is clearly tapering off as we move from the summer peak into late August. The 'Carry-over Insights' and recent history show a downward trend: demand from Period 25-28 has been 168, 121, 106, and 99 respectively. The average of the last 4 periods is 123.5, but the last 3 periods specifically (P26-P28) average 108.7. Given the context of the summer season ending, I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat to capture this immediate downward trend and avoid overstocking while holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0 each). Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to account for the reduced but still present late-season volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29 (late August), we observed a massive unexpected demand spike of 259 units, which is significantly higher than the recently established lower-demand regime (~100-110 units) and even rivals the mid-summer peak. This spike indicates a potential end-of-summer clearance surge or Labor Day weekend anticipatory demand (Sept 2 is the current date). Because this spike is an outlier compared to the last 3-4 periods (99, 106, 121), the 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 would capture some of this increase but might still undershoot if the surge continues. However, given the product (Long T-shirt), it is also possible this reflects a shift toward fall demand. I will use N=4 to balance the recent surge (259) with the previous tapering (121, 106, 99) to provide a robust safety buffer. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit/Holding cost ratio is 1.0, meaning the backend targets a 50% service level, essentially ordering the mean. Providing a high mu_hat via recent_N is critical to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Unexpected late-August demand spike: Period 29 demand reached 259 units, interrupting the previous tapering trend (P26-P28 avg ~109). Likely seasonal clearance or holiday event.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a transitional period after a summer peak (June-July avg ~192) and a volatile August. Period 29 (late August) saw a significant spike to 259 units, and Period 30 remained high at 179 units, likely due to Labor Day sales or seasonal clearance of 'Long T-shirts'. The detected tapering in early August (P26-P28) was interrupted by this late-season surge. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand (P29-P30) has averaged 219 units, I will set mu_hat to capture this recent volatility. Using N=3 for demand and sigma allows the model to react to the high-volume late August/early September data (P28: 99, P29: 259, P30: 179, avg=179) while accounting for the high standard deviation observed during these fluctuations. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Late-August demand surge confirmed: Demand spiked in Period 29 (259) and remained elevated in Period 30 (179), contradicting the mid-August tapering trend. Likely driven by late-summer clearance or Labor Day events.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053003 (Long T-shirt) is currently experiencing a second sustained demand surge, which began in Period 29 (late August). Initial thoughts that demand would taper off at the end of summer were incorrect; the last three periods have shown significantly elevated demand: P29 (259), P30 (179), and P31 (214), resulting in a 3-period average of 217.3. This surge likely corresponds to a back-to-school season or fall transition for 'Long T-shirts'. Notably, the system has stocked out in each of the last three periods (sold < demand), indicating that actual demand is likely higher than 217. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels during this active surge while balancing the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0), I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this higher demand regime (220) and sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in the recent spikes (approx 40).

Carry-over insight: Second seasonal demand surge confirmed starting P29: Average demand (P29-P31) is 217.3 units, significantly higher than the mid-August average (~109). Consistent stockouts suggest true demand exceeds observed sales.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 711053003 (Long T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 29 (late August), likely tied to late-summer/back-to-school or clearance events. While demand in Period 32 (141 units) was lower than the peaks of P29 (259) and P31 (214), it remains significantly elevated compared to the mid-August baseline (~109). Historical patterns show high volatility during these shifts, with frequent stockouts (P29, P30, P31 all resulted in 0 ending inventory and lost sales). Specifically, mean demand from P29-P32 is approximately 198 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain service levels in this volatile high-demand state, I am using a recent regime window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current elevated average (198.25), and N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the supply-limiting volatility. This approach ensures the base stock level (mu + z*sigma) targets the current regime while protecting against stockout risks seen in the past three weeks.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053003 (Long T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand regime that began in late August (Period 29), likely corresponding to late-summer clearance or back-to-school events. The average demand over the last five periods (P29-P33) is 194.4 units, which is significantly higher than the mid-August average (~109). Although demand in Period 32 dipped to 141, it rebounded to 177 in Period 33, confirming that the elevated regime persists. Volatility remains high (Std Dev \u2248 44 for P29-P33). I will use recent_N=5 to capture this current regime's mean and variance. Lead time is consistently 0. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), which implies a critical ratio of 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand for base stock. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods, we ensure the inventory levels are responsive to this late-season surge while preparing for the high volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Late-August demand surge (P29-P33) confirmed: mean demand shifted to ~194 units from the previous tapering avg of ~109. High volatility persists (range 141-259).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic Long T-shirt' is exiting its late-summer/September surge. Period 34 demand dropped significantly to 87 units from a previous 5-period average (P29-P33) of ~194 units. This likely signals the transition into a post-clearance/Autumn cooling phase. The current inventory (on-hand 107) is sufficient to cover this lower demand level if it persist. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the high volatility of the last surge while allowing the lower P34 value to begin pulling the mean down. This N covers the peak (P29-P31) and the cooldown (P32-P34), balancing protection against another small spike while acknowledging the tapering trend. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit/Holding cost ratio is 1:1, meaning the OR backend targets a 50% service level, which is appropriate for a product with high holding costs relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand transition: Period 34 demand (87) shows a sharp decline from the late-August/September surge average (~194), signaling the end of the second seasonal peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 711053003 (Long T-shirt) has transitioned from the 'late-August surge' (P29-P33 mean ~194) into a lower autumn regime. Period 34 demand was 87 and Period 35 demand was 95 (mean ~91). This matches historical patterns seen in April/May (P9-P14 mean ~86). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since the current regime length is 2 periods (P34-P35) after a clear changepoint, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this shift while incorporating the start of the decline from P33/P34. This choice of N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively weights the recent stabilization at ~90 units, preventing over-ordering based on the now-irrelevant September peak, while maintaining enough safety stock to handle early autumn volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Mean demand for P34-P35 is 91 units, down from the P29-P33 surge average of ~194 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period 36 conclude was 108 units, which aligns with the Autumn regime identified in Period 36 (average ~91 units across P34-P35, now ~97 units across P34-P36). This confirms a stabilization in demand following the late-summer clearance spikes. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will continue to use L=0. I am selecting recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this post-spike stability (P34-P36 demand: 87, 95, 108). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=3 to account for the current lower volatility compared to the summer surges. This approach ensures the OR backend targets the 50% service level (Profit $1 / (Profit $1 + Holding $1)) appropriate for the current stable, lower-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P34-P36) stable at mean ~97 units, significantly lower than the late-August surge (~194).

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019-10-21 (Period 37) saw a sharp spike to 185 units, interrupting the previously stable Autumn regime (averaging ~97 units). This spike likely corresponds to a pre-Halloween surge or a mid-season promotion. Since the product is a staple t-shirt (Jersey Basic), demand often exhibits these volatile bursts even outside of peak summer. The current on-hand inventory is 0. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=4 (P34-P37) to capture this latest spike while acknowledging the lower baseline of the previous three weeks. The average demand over these 4 periods is 118.75. Given the high volatility (range 87-185), I am using N=4 for sigma_hat to ensure the safety stock covers potential continued high demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Late October demand spike (185 units in P37) interrupted the stable Autumn regime (~97 units), possibly seasonal or promotional.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 711053003 (Long T-shirt) has entered a second seasonal surge in late October/early November. Period 37 saw demand jump to 185 units and Period 38 reached 146 units, both notably higher than the stable Autumn regime (~97 units). We have experienced stockouts for two consecutive periods, indicating current base stock levels are insufficient. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods. To capture this new pulse and prevent further lost sales, I will use recent_N (N=2) for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to weight the latest spikes heavily while acknowledging the inherent high variance of these seasonal transitions. These parameters (effective average ~165.5) will shift the base stock higher to meet the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Second seasonal demand surge confirmed starting P37: demand rose to 185 (P37) and 146 (P38), significantly above the Autumn mean of ~97. Multi-period stockouts suggest actual demand is higher.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 711053003 has entered a high-volatility regime since Period 37 (late October), likely due to early holiday shopping or pre-winter promotions. Demand shifted from an Autumn mean of ~97 to a more volatile state with recent peaks of 185 (P37) and 146 (P38), followed by a lower 85 (P39). The current on-hand inventory is 81. To capture this new regime while acknowledging the recent dip, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (averaging P37-P39: 185, 146, 85 = 138.6) to provide a responsive but balanced baseline. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to capture the increased standard deviation (approx 50.4) inherent in this surge phase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053003 (Long T-shirt) is currently in a high-volatility regime with a recurring late-autumn/winter demand surge. Period 40 (late-October/November) saw a demand of 162 units, resulting in a stockout. This follows a pattern where demand fluctuates significantly between ~85 and ~185 units. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P37-P40) is approximately 144.5 units, which is a significant increase from the early autumn mean of ~97. Given the alternating high/low demand and frequent stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this new elevated regime and volatility. Lead time is stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-Autumn high-demand regime confirmed (P37-P40): Average demand has shifted to ~145 units with high volatility, up from the post-September mean of ~97 units (+50%).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-volatility late-autumn regime (P37-P41). Demand for the last 5 periods has been 185, 146, 85, 162, and 59, averaging 127.4 units. Although P41 saw a pull-back to 59 units, following a peak of 162 in P40, the product description (Long T-shirt) and the current date (Nov 25) suggest continued relevance in late autumn/winter. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. However, given the frequent stockouts observed in the recent high-demand regime, a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for mu_hat is used to capture the current mean (~127.4), while a 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat is selected to account for the high volatility (\xb150 units) within this regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering early December (Period 43). Recent demand history indicates a volatile late-autumn regime (P37-P42). The last six periods have shown demands of 185, 146, 85, 162, 59, and 126. This averages to approximately 127 units per period, with significant fluctuations. The 'carry-over' note for Period 41 identifies this regime as having high volatility. Given the date (Dec 2), we must anticipate potential December holiday demand spikes for this long-sleeve cotton T-shirt, even though the immediate previous two periods (59, 126) were slightly below the regime average. Lead time remains consistently at 0. To ensure high service level given the unit profit equals the holding cost (resulting in a 50% critical fractile), I will use the recent_N method with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility regime and maintain enough inventory to cover potential spikes without excessive holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 711053003 (Long T-shirt) is currently in a late-autumn/early-winter regime. Starting from P37 (late October), we observed a spike followed by high volatility. Demand in the most recent periods has been: P40: 162, P41: 59, P42: 126, P43: 53. This high-low alternating pattern suggests significant volatility despite an average that remains roughly around 100-110 units. Because we are now in December (P44), we must be cautious of potential holiday-related demand spikes or clearance events, similar to the surge seen in late August. On-hand inventory is 75 units. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (since P37) to capture the current high-volatility regime (average approx 105), and use recent_N for sigma to account for the large swings (53 to 162). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December (2019-12-16). For the T-shirt SKU, we are observing a significant decline in demand as winter sets in. Following a late-autumn surge that averaged ~145 units (P37-P40), the last four periods (P41-P44) have shown a clear downward trend with demand values of 59, 126, 53, and 35, averaging 68.25 units. The most recent period (P44) hitting 35 units reinforces the seasonal cooling effect. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, making it critical not to overstock during this decline. I will set N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent deceleration and N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand decline confirmed: Mean demand for P41-P44 has dropped to 68.25 units from the late-autumn average of ~145 units (-53%).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. We are in a Winter demand regime. The carry-over insights and recent history (P41-P45) show a significant demand decline, with the mean dropping to approx 64 units (averaging P41-P45 demand: 59, 126, 53, 35, 47). This is a 50%+ drop from the Late-Autumn peak (~145). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 35 units. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, which aligns with using the mean (mu_hat) as the base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's statistics while ignoring the much higher autumn peaks.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (Dec-Jan) confirmed: Mean demand has leveled at ~64 units (P41-P45) from the late-autumn average of ~145 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019-12-23 (P46) spiked to 120 units, significantly exceeding the recent winter average (~64) and causing a stockout. This spike likely corresponds to the Christmas holiday week. The current date is 2019-12-30, representing the week between Christmas and New Year. Historically, post-holiday periods show a decline from peak spikes but may remain higher than seasonal lows due to clearance. Given the stockout in P46, true demand was likely higher than 120. To respond to this volatility while respecting the underlying low-season winter trend (mean demand since P41 is 73.3 units), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent regime shift including the spike, while setting sigma_hat with a small N (N=3) to aggressively cover against the high volatility observed in the last two periods (47 and 120). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 46 demand jumped to 120 units (from ~64 winter avg) during Christmas week.
