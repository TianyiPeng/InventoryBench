The promised lead time of 0 periods was confirmed in Period 1 (ordered 45, arrived 45). Current on-hand inventory is 1 unit. Given the recent demand of 44 and the general upward trend/seasonality, I will forecast Period 2 demand at approximately 45 units. To maximize profit while accounting for potential slight growth and mitigating the $1.0 holding cost (which equals the $1.0 profit), I aim to cover demand exactly.

Historical demand (Jan: 29, 32, 42, 38; early Feb: 37) showed a baseline around 35-40 units. However, Period 2 saw a massive spike to 114 units, causing a stockout (sold only 46). This indicates a significant regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). I need to satisfy the new high demand level. While 114 might be a peak, I must protect against lost sales since Profit equals Holding Cost ($1.0), making the risk of stockout high.

Historical data showed demand around 37 units in Jan/Feb. Starting in Period 2 (late Feb), demand surged (114, 75, 50, 50, 65). Period 2 was likely a peak due to weather change or a promotion, but the new regime (Period 3-6) averages ~60 units per week. Current Date is 2019/3/25, heading deeper into Spring, so demand should remain stable or slightly increase. Strategy: The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (immediate arrival within the period). Since lead time is 0, the required inventory for Period 7 is just the forecast for Period 7. On-hand is 75. Forecasted demand for the current period (Period 7) is ~65-70. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), overstocking is as expensive as losing a sale. However, maintaining a small buffer for late-March/early-April growth is prudent. With 75 units on hand, if I order 0, I cover a demand of 75. If demand hits 80, I lose 5 sales ($5 profit). If demand is 60, I pay $15 holding cost for the 15 remaining. To maintain a safety stock that accounts for the volatility seen (avg 60, but recent high of 114 and low of 50), I will target an end-of-period stock of ~20 units.
