Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks'. Initial on-hand and in-transit inventory is 0. Historical demand data shows a significant jump in the most recent week (2019-02-04: 112 units) compared to the previous four weeks (avg: 70.25). This likely indicates a seasonal shift as we move further into February, or simply a new demand regime. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no 'conclude' messages yet, I will assume the promised lead time of 0 is accurate for now. To set the base stock level, I will use a balanced approach: L will be 'default' (0). For mu_hat, the 'recent_N' method with N=5 will incorporate the recent spike while maintaining some stability from the earlier January data. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility. This will ensure the backend computes a base stock that covers the expected demand for the next period plus a safety buffer.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the history, this SKU (Socks) experienced a significant demand spike in Period 1 (142 units) compared to the pre-game samples (77, 59, 67, 78, 112). February 11-14 often aligns with Valentine's Day/early Spring transitions, which may explain the surge. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirm this (ordered 112, arrived 112). However, we sold out completely in Period 1 (ending inventory 0), indicating we under-ordered. To capture the recent upward trend and the high volatility of the last period, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and standard deviation to sensitize the model to the recent growth (112 and 142) while maintaining L=0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic 7-pack of trainer socks. Historical demand was low (mean ~79). However, Period 1 (142) and Period 2 (311) show a massive demand spike, likely due to a seasonal shift as we exit winter/enter spring or a specific promotion. Inventory has been stock-out for both periods because the backend 'cap' and our previous estimates (based on history) were too low. The promised lead time is 0 and has been confirmed as 0 in both P1 and P2. mu_hat needs to be set explicitly to capture this rapid growth regime (311 units last period) plus a buffer for the upward trend. I will set mu_hat to 450 to ensure the base stock calculation allows for a larger order to catch up with demand and stop the stock-out loop, while sigma_hat is increased to account for the high volatility of this jump.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P1: Significant upward trend (P1: 142, P2: 311). Expected demand now exceeds historical mean (>300). Lead time confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860002' (Women's Fine-knit trainer socks) is experiencing a significant demand regime shift. Historical mean demand was ~78 (Jan/Feb samples), but the last three periods show a much higher average (P1: 142, P2: 311, P3: 293). This shift aligns with early March (Period 4), which is the start of spring/transitional weather in many regions, likely driving demand for 'trainer socks'. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on P1, P2, and P3 conclusions. Since demand seems to have stabilized at a higher level (averaging ~302 over the last two periods), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the post-shift demand average while accounting for the high volatility observed. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand in Period 4 (calculated as (1+L)*mu_hat).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3658.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Fine-knit trainer socks' has shown a clear demand regime shift since February. While initial historical samples averaged ~79 units/week, demand desde Period 1 has consistently averaged ~237 (P1-P4: 142, 311, 293, 203). Although P4 showed a slight dip to 203, it remains significantly higher than the early January baseline. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all four completed periods. We have 199 units on-hand. Since L=0, the formula covers only 1 period of demand (1+L). I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new elevated regime while smoothing the P2/P3 spike against the P4 cooling. This balances the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which demands a high service level (95%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-February shift at an average of ~237 units/period (P1-P4 range 142-311), significantly above the 2019 baseline of ~79.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18, 2019. Historical demand for this '7p Basic Shaftless' (socks) SKU shifted significantly from a Jan/Early Feb mean of ~79 to a higher regime starting Period 1 (Mid-Feb). Demand in the last three periods (P3-P5) has stabilized somewhat with observations of 293, 203, and 201, averaging 232.33 units per period. This aligns with the carry-over insight of ~237. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 167 units on-hand. Since L=0, the OR backend logic with mu_hat and sigma_hat will calculate a base_stock to cover Period 6 demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-shift demand regime while ignoring the extreme outlier in Period 2 (311). This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate of ~232 units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product (7p Basic Shaftless Socks) experienced a significant regime shift starting in February (P1), moving from a historical average of ~79 units/week to a new average of ~231.5 units/week over the last 6 periods (P1-P6 demand: 142, 311, 293, 203, 201, 239). The demand in the last three periods (P4-P6) has stabilized around 214 units/week, though P6 showed a slight uptick to 239. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is low (80 units) compared to this demand level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the entirety of the new regime while being responsive to the recent stabilization, and N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in this new period (specifically the high P2 demand). This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level that covers the sustained higher demand profile.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which typically sees a seasonal demand increase in Spring. Demand in Period 7 spiked to 354, resulting in a stockout (sold 336, ended with 0 on-hand). The average demand over the last 7 periods is approximately 249, but recent performance suggests a higher mean is necessary to prevent lost sales during this upward trend. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime, while adjusting mu_hat towards the upper end of recent observations (approx 280-300 per period) to account for the stockout and spring seasonality.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in late March (P7: 354) suggests an early Spring seasonal peak for trainer socks. Current regime mean is higher than the P5 estimate, now trending towards ~280+ units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, and demand for fine-knit trainer socks is surging as we enter spring. Demand has increased significantly over the last two periods (P7: 354, P8: 385), confirming the seasonal upward trend noted in the carry-over insights. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives same-period), we must ensure on-hand inventory covers the current period's demand. The most recent demand regime (P7-P8) shows a mean of approximately 370 units. I will set mu_hat to 390 using the explicit method to proactively capture the continuing seasonal rise and avoid the stockouts seen in P7. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal peak confirmed: Demand surged in late March/early April (P7-P8 avg: 370), a ~56% increase over the P5-P6 average (~237). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. The product is shaftless trainer socks, which are experiencing a seasonal surge as Spring progresses. Recent demand history shows a significant shift: P7 (354), P8 (385), and P9 (282). While P9 dropped relative to the spike, the 'Spring peak' regime (avg ~340) is much higher than the earlier March regime (avg ~237). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current seasonal volume while accounting for the recent moderation in P9, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 for demand and volatility to focus on this active Spring window (P7-P9). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the anticipated high demand for this category in mid-April while maintaining a service level justified by the high profit margin ($19.0) vs. low holding cost ($1.0).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860002' (trainer socks) is in its spring seasonal peak. Historically, demand for this item surged starting in late March (Period 7) and has remained elevated through mid-April. Recent demand figures for Periods 7-10 are 354, 385, 282, and 382 units, respectively. This averages to approximately 351 units per period. The previous regime (Periods 4-6) averaged around 214 units, confirming a significant seasonal shift. I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand regime. This period is April 22nd, still within the peak season for shaftless trainer socks. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and responsiveness to current stock levels. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock that prioritizes avoiding stockouts given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which implies a target service level of 95%.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (April 29, 2019), the product '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks' is in the midst of a sustained high-demand Spring season. Observations over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) show demands of 354, 385, 282, 382, and 472. This period represents the transition into May, where spring weather continues to drive demand for trainer socks. The average demand of the last 5 periods (N=5) is 375, which is significantly higher than the previous baseline. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). In Period 11, demand reached a peak of 472, causing a stockout (on-hand is 0). To ensure we capture this peak demand and maintain high service levels (q = 19/20 = 95%), I will set mu_hat based on the recent N=5 average to reflect the current regime while using explicit sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed (std of last 5 periods is approx 70). mu_hat for L=0 is (1+0)*375 = 375.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed for April (P7-P11 avg: 375), marking a second tier of growth from the March average (~237). Stockouts in P7 and P11 indicate high volatility requiring larger safety stock.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860002' (trainer socks) is currently in a high-demand seasonal regime. Since late March (Period 7), demand has stabilized at a significantly higher level compared to the start of the year. Analyzing the most recent 6 periods (P7-P12), the average demand is approximately 386 units (354, 385, 282, 382, 472, 444), which is substantially higher than the P1-P6 average of ~231. Period 12 demand remained strong at 444 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Given the current date (May 6), we are likely at the peak or late-peak of the spring season for trainer socks. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while allowing for the volatility observed (range 282-472). L is set to default as 0-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime: Current training sock demand is sustained at a high plateau (P7-P12 avg: 386) with high volatility (sigma adjusted to recent levels). Transitioning from April growth to May stability/peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4722.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/5/13), we are in the middle of Q2. History shows that demand for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' has stepped up in stages: ~237 in March to ~386 in April/early May. However, Period 13 saw a significant drop to 261 units. While one data point doesn't confirm a regime change, the volatility in this SKU is high (peaks of 472, lows of 261). The current on-hand inventory is 237. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 2, 7, and 11, I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated but volatile demand levels established since late March (Period 7), while accounting for the recent low in Period 13. This ensures the base stock reflects the current high-plateau regime (~370 avg) while the OR backend's safety stock covers the observed variance. L is set to 'default' as actual lead time remains 0.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which typically see peak demand during the transition from Spring into early Summer. Looking at periods 7-14, there was a significant peak in April (averaging ~375 units), while the first two weeks of May (P13 and P14) have shown a drop to an average of 274.5 units (261 and 288 respectively). This suggests the season has moved past the initial spring surge into a more stable late-spring plateau. Since the promised lead time is 0 and consistently arrives in the same period, the backend logic must calculate base stock for (1 + L) = 1 period of demand. To reflect this recent recalibration to the May plateau and avoid excessive holding costs from over-stocking at April levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of 8 periods (P7-P14), which covers the entire spring peak and current stabilization, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for recent volatility (which included stockouts).

Carry-over insight: May demand stabilization: Demand has softened from April peaks (~375) to a late-May plateau of ~275 units (P13-P14 avg). Seasonal peak for trainer socks appears to have passed its crest.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which saw a significant demand surge throughout April (averaging ~375 units) but has recently entered a slightly lower and more volatile regime in May. Recent demand periods (P13: 261, P14: 288, P15: 350) show a mean of 299.6, which is lower than the April peak but still significantly higher than the February/early March baseline. The 'carry_over_insight' from Period 15 noted a stabilization around 275 units, but the most recent P15 demand of 350 suggests continued seasonal relevance or high volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage this transition, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period window (P12-P15) to capture both the end of the peak and the current plateau (avg ~335). Sigma_hat will also use a recent_N of 4 to reflect the current high volatility (std ~78) which resulted in previous stockouts.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by Period 16 conclude. The product (trainer socks) is in its summer demand phase. Previous insights suggested a softening in May, but the last two periods (P15: 350, P16: 379) show a resurgence in demand, likely due to warmer weather in June. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P13-P16) is 319.5 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this latest upward trend and ensure sufficient base stock for the upcoming June period, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent regime to prevent stockouts observed in the previous high-demand months.

Carry-over insight: Demand resurgence in late May/early June: Demand increased from a mid-May average of ~275 to ~365 (P15-P16 average), indicating sustained early summer demand for trainer socks.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. The product is 7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks, which typically sees high demand during late spring and early summer. Looking at the recent demand history (P15-P17: 350, 379, 268), the average across this window is approximately 332 units. While P17 showed a slight dip to 268, the overall trend since May has been consistently higher than the late-May plateau of ~275 noted in previous periods. As we are in prime June weather for trainer socks, I anticipate demand will remain strong. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this most recent June demand level (avg ~332) while accounting for volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the immediate upcoming demand period while the OR backend manages the safety stock via sigma_hat (also set to recent_N=3 to capture the higher variance observed recently).

Carry-over insight: June demand regime: Early June demand (P15-P17) is averaging ~332 units, higher than the mid-May plateau of ~275, confirming sustained early summer interest in trainer socks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/06/17) shows the SKU continues in a high-demand early summer regime. Looking at the last four periods (P15-P18), demand has been 350, 379, 268, and 286, averaging 320.75 units. This is slightly lower than the 'Period 18' carry-over insight average (332) but remains significantly elevated compared to the mid-May plateau. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To handle the high variability (standard deviation is approx 53 units over the last 4 periods) and the critical nature of trainer socks in June, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current mean more accurately than a long-term average, and recent_N with N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility. This provides a base_stock target around 410-430 units, which ensures high service levels for the remainder of June while remaining reactive to the slight softening seen in the last two weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7733.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, demand surged to 458 units, causing a stockout (sold 407, ending on-hand 0). This volatility is consistent with trainer socks during late June, as weather warms and summer styles are in peak demand. The current status shows 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit, as lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game history. To recover from the stockout and capitalize on the sustained high June demand (average of P15-P19 is ~348 units), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent mean of ~348 and high volatility (sigma). This covers the 1+L=1 period demand window for Period 20. Lead time method remains 'calculate' as it has been stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: June demand surge: Period 19 experienced a demand spike to 458 units, resulting in a stockout. The average demand for mid-to-late June (P15-P19) has risen to ~348 units, up from the mid-May plateau of ~275.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1) finds the demand for trainer socks entering a high-utilization summer phase. Demand in the most recent periods (P19: 458, P20: 405) has averaged 431 units, which is a significant increase over the previous June average of ~332. This rise aligns with peak summer seasonality for shaftless cotton socks. On-hand inventory is low (69 units) following high sales. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are sold within the same period. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand July period while accounting for the recent spike, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 6 periods (avg ~350) but adjusted for the upward trend, and using recent_N for sigma to capture high volatility (recent demands ranged from 268 to 458). N=6 is chosen to weight the mid-to-late June surge heavily while providing enough samples for a stable variance estimate.

Carry-over insight: July demand surge confirmed: Demand in late June (P19-P20) averaged 431 units, a ~30% increase over the early June average (~332), marking the start of the peak summer regime for trainer socks.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in early July (2019/7/08), which is the peak season for fine-knit trainer socks. Historical evidence from the last three periods (P19-P21) shows a high-demand regime with demand values of 458, 405, and 356 respectively, averaging approximately 406 units. This confirms the 'July demand surge' noted in the carry-over insights. The stockout in Period 19 highlights the sensitivity to demand spikes in this period. Since the lead time is consistently 0, I will set L to 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture this current high-demand summer peak (P19-P21) while remaining responsive to the high volatility observed. Profit is $19 and Holding Cost is $1, resulting in a target service level of ~95% (19/20), which the OR backend will calculate appropriately based on these parameters.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', currently in peak summer season (mid-July). Period 21 and 22 demand (356 and 354) shows stabilization following the late June surge. The current demand regime for July (P19-P22) averages approximately 393 units, though P21-P22 were slightly lower (~355). I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the specific July peak regime while acknowledging the slight cooling in the last two weeks. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for the volatility seen in the transition from June to July. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product (trainer socks) is in its peak summer season. Historically, demand surged in late June and early July (P19-P22 average ~393 units). However, the most recent periods (P21-P23) show a slight cooling or stabilization with demand values of 356, 354, and 333 (average ~348). We are likely at the summer peak plateau. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), but avoid excessive overstocking as we approach the end of July, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (P19-P23 mean: 381.2, std: 50.4). This N=5 captures the jump to >400 and the subsequent stabilization in the mid-300s, providing a robust buffer for the final weeks of July.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. This SKU is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand during late spring and summer. Following the peak observed in late June/early July (Period 19-20), demand has begun to stabilize at a lower but still elevated level. Specifically, demand in the last four periods (P21-P24) was 356, 354, 333, and 290, averaging ~333 units. This indicates the super-peak (400+) has passed, but demand remains higher than the mid-May plateau (~275). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 24 concluding messages. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient safety stock for late-summer volatility. The base stock calculation (q \u2248 0.95) will naturally favor a higher service level given the high profit/holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer peak (July): demand has moderated from late-June surges (~430) to a stable July plateau of ~333 units (P21-P24 average).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. We are observing a continued moderation of demand for trainer socks following the July summer peak. Demand in the last five periods (P21-P25) has averaged 319.8 units (356, 354, 333, 290, 266), showing a clear downward trend as the peak summer season winds down. Specifically, the last two periods (P24-P25) have dropped below the 300-unit mark. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs as we transition into late summer/early autumn, I am setting mu_hat using a recent window that captures this deceleration. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current moderated demand regime (~320 mean) while maintaining responsiveness to the recent weekly decline.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand moderation confirmed: Demand has dropped below 300 units in late July/early August (P24-P25 avg: 278), following the July plateau (~333).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in mid-August (2019-08-12). Demand for 'fine-knit trainer socks' has shown a clear downward trend following the summer peak (July demand ~333, late July/early August demand ~250). The last three periods (P24-P26) recorded demands of 290, 266, and 239, respectively. This signifies a post-summer moderation regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 (N=4 captures the transition from approx 290 to 240) to reflect this cooling demand while maintaining a buffer for potential late-summer variability. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to capture the volatility of the post-peak transition period, ensuring a responsive safety stock for potential late-season fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: August demand (P25-P26) has averaged ~253 units, a significant drop from the July plateau (~333) and June peak (~430).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late August (2019/8/19), moving past the peak summer demand for trainer socks. Demand has clearly entered a cooling regime following the June/July peaks. The last three periods (P25-P27) show a consistent downward trend in demand (266, 239, 221), averaging 242 units. This is a significant drop from the July average of ~333 and the late June peak of ~430. Since trainer socks are seasonal, we expect this moderation to continue as the weather cools. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this downward shift precisely and avoid overstocking while holding 157 units (about 65% of the current weekly mean) on hand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages for every period in history.

Carry-over insight: August demand cooling trend confirmed: Demand has dropped for three consecutive periods (P25-P27: 266, 239, 221), with the current 3-period average at 242 units, a ~27% decrease from the July plateau (~333).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is in a clear post-summer cooling phase. Demand has decreased steadily over the last four periods (P25-P28: 266, 239, 221, 208), with the most recent 3-period average at 222.67 units. This trend aligns with the product category as the peak summer season for shaftless trainer socks ends in late August. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this downward trajectory for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend adjusts the base stock down to avoid excess holding costs. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history through P28.

Carry-over insight: August cooling trend sustained: Demand has dropped for four consecutive periods (P25-P28) with a 4-period average of 233.5 units, down significantly from the July plateau (~333).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is in a clear seasonal downward trend as we enter September (P30). Recent demand has shown five consecutive periods of decline (P25-P29: 266, 239, 221, 208, 199). The average over the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is approximately 217 units, significantly lower than the July average (~333). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (P25-P29) to capture this cooling trend and avoid overstocking as the summer peak fades into autumn. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous historical data.

Carry-over insight: Late August/early September demand cooling confirmed: 5-period consecutive decline (P25-P29), with the current 5-period average at 226.6 units, a ~32% decrease from the July plateau (~333).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is in a sustained cooling phase as we transition from summer to autumn (early September). Historical demand analysis shows a six-period continuous decline from the July peak, with the most recent five periods (P26-P30) averaging 211.2 units (239, 221, 208, 199, 189). The 'recent_N' method with N=5 for mu_hat will effectively capture this downward trend while maintaining enough sensitivity to prevent over-ordering as the season ends. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game, so L is set to 'default'. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility observed during this steady decline phase, balancing the service level against holding costs for the current 82 units on hand.

Carry-over insight: September demand cooling confirmed: 6-period consecutive decline (P25-P30). Average demand for P26-P30 is 211.2 units, a ~37% decrease from the July plateau (~333).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is in a sustained cooling phase as we move into mid-September. Demand has decreased consecutively for the last seven periods (P25-P31: 266, 239, 221, 208, 199, 189, 168). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is approximately 197 units, which is a significant drop from the summer peak (~430) and the August average (~242). Given this clear downward trend, I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining sufficient stock for the coming week. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the stabilizing (though decreasing) volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Seven-period consecutive demand decline confirmed (P25-P31). September demand has dropped further, with the 5-period average (P27-P31) now at 197 units, down from the June/July peaks (~430) and the August cooling average (~242).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is in a significant seasonal decline as Northern Hemisphere weather cools (late September). We are observing an eight-period consecutive decline since the July peak. Demand has dropped from ~430 units in June/July to only 136 units in the most recent period (P32). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P28-P32) is approximately 180 units. Continuing the trend, P33 is likely to see demand between 110-140 units. Since on-hand inventory is 94 units and lead time is consistently 0 periods, we need to order enough to meet the current period's demand plus a small safety buffer, but must be aggressive in reducing stock to avoid holding costs on a declining product. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent cooling phase.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal decline confirmed: Eight-period consecutive demand decline (P25-P32). Demand has dropped ~68% from June/July peaks, with the P28-P32 average at 180 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is in a clear seasonal decline as we move into autumn (September/October), although Period 33 saw a minor uptick to 234 units (likely due to a small stockout buffer clearing). Prior to Period 33, demand had declined for eight consecutive periods. The recent 5-period average (P29-P33) is 185.2 units, but the broader 10-period trend shows a steady reduction from summer peaks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this cooling phase while accounting for the recent minor demand spike in P33, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to set mu_hat. This balances the long-term seasonal decline with the most recent data point. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: September/October demand transition: After eight periods of decline, Period 33 showed a slight uptick to 234. The 5-period average (P29-P33) is ~185 units, representing a stabilized autumn baseline for trainer socks.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7th, 2019. This SKU (Fine-knit trainer socks) is experiencing a transition from the significant seasonal decline observed throughout August and September to a stabilized autumn baseline. After eight consecutive periods of demand decline (P25-P32), Period 33 and 34 have stabilized with demands of 234 and 217 respectively. The recent 5-period average (P30-P34) is 188.8 units. Although trainer socks are typically summer-biased, the current demand level suggests a consistent autumn floor that is significantly higher than the early 2019 baseline (~79). Lead time remains reliably at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this stabilization phase while maintaining a high service level (due to high profit/holding cost ratio), I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this new 'post-peak' regime's mean and volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: After a long seasonal decline, demand has flattened in late September/early October (P33-P34). The current stabilized regime mean is approximately 190-220 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks has stabilized following a long seasonal decline from June/July peaks. For Period 36 (mid-October), recent demand (P33-P35: 234, 217, 169) suggests an autumn baseline. The 3-period average is approximately 207 units, which aligns with the 'Autumn demand stabilization' identified in the carry-over insights. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this current plateau and move away from the long decline phase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility as consumption patterns shift into late autumn.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is in a clear seasonal decline as we move further into October. After a long-term decline from summer peaks, demand stabilized briefly around 190-220 units (P33-P34), but the last two periods (P35: 169, P36: 117) indicate a secondary drop as the weather cools. The 5-period average (P32-P36) is approximately 175 units, but the most recent two periods suggest a lower baseline. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend (average ~184) while maintaining a safe buffer. Sigma is set using the same window to account for recent variability. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late October demand decline: Demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (P35-P36 avg: 143) compared to the early October stabilization (P33-P34 avg: 225), confirming the end of the autumn plateau.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' has exited the autumn stabilization phase (P33-P34 avg: 225) and entered a late-autumn decline. The average demand for the last three periods (P35-P37) is 145 units (169, 117, 150), which is significantly lower than previous months. As this product is 'trainer socks', we expect demand to continue softening as we move into November and colder weather. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining a high service level (z* \u2248 1.88 for q=0.95), I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this recent lower-demand regime. Using N=3 for recent_N captures the immediate drop seen in the last three weeks accurately.

Carry-over insight: Late October demand decline confirmed: Demand for trainer socks has dropped to a new regime of ~145 units (P35-P37 average), significantly lower than the early October stabilization (avg ~225).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, entering late autumn/early winter. Historically, demand for this trainer sock SKU has shown a strong seasonal decline from its peak summer levels. The carry-over insights and recent history (P35-P38) confirm a new stabilized lower demand regime averaging around 142 units (P35: 169, P36: 117, P37: 150, P38: 131). The most recent demand sample of 131 units fits this lower-level expectation. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory as demand cools further into winter, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4), which captures the late October/early November regime while filtering out the higher October stabilization data. This will lower the base stock level to align with current demand and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: November demand stabilization: Demand has settled into a late-autumn regime averaging ~142 units (P35-P38), down from the early-October stabilization of ~190-220 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for trainer socks has significantly dropped as we enter late autumn/early winter. The last period (P39) showed a demand of 86 units, following a regime that was already low (~130-150 units). The 4-period average (P36-P39) is approximately 121 units. Given the seasonal nature of 'trainer socks' and moving into colder months, demand is expected to continue softening or stabilize at this lower floor. On-hand inventory is 94, with no in-transit units. Predicted lead time remains stable at 0. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N=4 to reflect this late-autumn stabilization around 120 units, and use recent_N=5 for volatility to capture the recent range of observations.

Carry-over insight: November demand floor confirmed: Late autumn demand for trainer socks (P36-P39) has stabilized at an average of ~121 units, reaching a new seasonal low compared to the summer peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are managing 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a product with clear seasonal demand that peaked in Summer (June/July) and has been steadily declining through Autumn. The Carry-over Insights indicate a 'November demand floor' has been reached, with the mean demand over the last four periods (P36-P39) averaging ~121 units. However, looking at the most recent outcomes, demand has dropped even further in the last two concluded periods: P39 (86 units) and P40 (95 units). Given this is a low-top trainer sock, demand is expected to remain at a seasonal minimum as winter approaches. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a declining/low-demand product, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized late-autumn floor (P36-P40 average is 115.8), which is safer than the longer-term average. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current lowering volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the late autumn/winter season for trainer socks, which historically shows lower demand compared to the spring and summer peaks. The demand regime has consistently stabilized around a lower floor; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is approximately 110 units (150, 131, 86, 95, 88), and the most recent 3 periods (P39-P41) average 90 units. This confirms the seasonal decline noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time is reliably 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level (given the high profit margin), I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent low-demand stability using N=5 to capture the November floor and sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the reduced volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: November/December demand floor: Demand for trainer socks has settled into a winter baseline averaging ~90-110 units (P37-P41), significantly lower than the October average (~145).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). This is a low-demand winter period for trainer socks. However, Period 42 saw a significant demand spike to 182 units, up from the previous four-period average of ~87 units (P38-P41). This spike likely reflects early December holiday shopping or a pre-winter promotion. Starting on-hand is 0 due to the stockout in Period 42. Since lead time is consistently 0, the backend will order to meet the base stock target within the current period. To account for this recent uptick while acknowledging the low winter baseline, I will use a recent_N window (N=5) for demand forecasting (\u03bc\u0302) to balance the holiday volatility with the winter floor. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility seen in the Period 42 spike.

Carry-over insight: Early December demand spike: Period 42 demand rose to 182 units, nearly double the November average (~90-110), likely due to holiday seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. Period 42 saw a significant demand spike (182 units) compared to the November average of ~100 units, which I attributed to early December holiday demand in the carry-over insights. However, Period 43 demand dropped sharply to 69 units. This volatility is typical for December; high-demand shopping pulses (Black Friday/Cyber Monday and Christmas lead-up) are often followed by quiet weeks. Since promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has consistently been 0, I will set L=0. Demand forecasting at this stage must balance the recent spike with the subsequent drop. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (P39-P43) which averages to ~104 units, but given the proximity to Christmas, I expect another pulse. To prevent a stockout while avoiding excessive holding costs, I'll use \u03bc\u0302 based on the last 5 periods and recent_N for \u03c3\u0302 with N=10 to capture the increased December volatility. The system's base stock logic will handle the service level.

Carry-over insight: December demand volatility confirmed: P42 spike (182) followed by P43 drop (69) suggests pulsed holiday shopping patterns rather than a sustained high-demand regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-December (2019/12/16). Recent demand for fine-knit trainer socks has shown holiday volatility: a spike in Period 42 (182 units) followed by a sharp drop and stabilization (69 and 81 units in P43-P44). Historical performance suggests that demand for this SKU (trainer socks) typically hits a seasonal low in winter, but is subject to short-lived holiday spikes. The L-0 lead time remains consistent. With 103 units on hand and 0 in transit, we are well-positioned for the current low-demand floor (averaging ~75 units over the last two weeks). To reflect this 'stabilized winter baseline' while accounting for potential final holiday pulses, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=6 (covering the period from mid-November to present, encompassing the floor and the recent spike) to balance the forecast. Sigma_hat will use the same window to capture the increased volatility from the P42 spike.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). We are deep into the winter season for trainer socks. Historically, demand for this SKU dropped significantly in October/November (stabilizing around ~90-110 units). December has shown volatility (P42: 182, P43: 69, P44: 81, P45: 116). Period 42's spike was likely due to holiday shopping. As we approach Christmas/New Year, demand is expected to remain consistent with late autumn/winter baseline levels or potentially soften post-holiday. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 52 units, and there are 0 units in transit. The OR engine will use recent demand data to forecast for Period 46. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the December volatility while acknowledging the broader winter baseline (mean of P41-P45 is ~103 units).

Carry-over insight: December demand volatility: Trainer socks showing pulsed demand in December (P42: 182, P43: 69, P44: 81, P45: 116) with a 5-period average of ~107 units, up from the November low of ~90 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the final week of the year and transition into January. Historically, for 2019/01/07 and subsequent weeks, demand for this item (trainer socks) was low (77, 59, 67, 78) before rising significantly in February. Recent demand in December has exhibited 'pulsed' holiday behavior: P42: 182, P43: 69, P44: 81, P45: 116, P46: 129. The 5-period average (P42-P46) is 115.4 units, which is higher than the early November floor (~90) but significantly below the summer peak (~430). Given we are entering the post-holiday January period, demand is likely to revert towards the 70-80 unit baseline observed in early 2019. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current plateau while allowing for the downward post-Christmas trend. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent volatility seen in December.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand transition: Late December demand (P45-P46) averaged ~123 units, showing a slight uptick from mid-December but remaining in a winter low-regime relative to the annual cycle.
