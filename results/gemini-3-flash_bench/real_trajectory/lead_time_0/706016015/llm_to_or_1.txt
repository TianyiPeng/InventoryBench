Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 706016015 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS). Initial on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Historical demand data from the last five weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a decreasing trend: 484, 413, 366, 244, 255. The average demand across these 5 samples is 352.4 units per week. Given the product is 'superstretch denim' and we are approaching mid-February, we are seeing a post-holiday/post-January sales decline, stabilizing around 250 units in the last two weeks. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent history while acknowledging the downward trend. For lead time, the promised lead time is 0; I will use the default setting until actual arrival data suggests otherwise. Sigma will also be calculated using recent_N to reflect the current volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a basic garment item (super-skinny denim). The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0 (440 units ordered and arrived in P1). The demand history shows a downward trend: 484, 413, 366, 244, 255 (pre-game samples) and 227 in Period 1. The average demand across these 6 samples is 331.5. However, the last 3 observations (255, 244, 227) suggest a lower, stabilized regime around 240 units. Given the product is a denim basic, demand is likely to be relatively stable rather than volatile after this initial drop from Jan peaks (likely post-holiday clearance). I will use a recent_N approach to capture this lower mean to avoid excessive holding costs ($1/unit/period is high relative to $4 profit).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim', a core 'Divided Collection' item. Historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a declining trend: 484, 413, 366, 244, 255. In the first two game periods (Feb 11, Feb 18), demand was 227 and 192 respectively, confirming a stabilization or slight further decline post-January. The average demand across all 7 available samples is ~312, but recent demand (last 3 periods) is ~224. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the OR backend logic will target a base stock to cover current period demand. I will use recent_N=3 to capture the current lower demand level and avoid overstocking as the peak season seems to have passed. I will use the default sigma calculation which accounts for all historical volatility to maintain a safe buffer.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch high-waisted skinny jean. Looking at the demand history (Jan-early Feb: 484, 413, 366, 244, 255; Mid Feb-early Mar: 227, 192, 167), there is a clear downward trend in demand as we move past the initial post-holiday/early-year period. The average demand across all historical samples is approximately 293, but the most recent 3 periods (since Period 1) show a significantly lower mean of 195.3. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in P1, P2, and P3. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to better reflect this recent lower-demand regime (approx. 195 units/period) and avoid excessive holding costs from overstocking based on higher January figures. L remains at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Post-January demand has stabilized at a lower mean (~195 units/period) compared to January peaks (~350+ units/period).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS'. Historical demand shows a clear downward trend from January peaks (484, 413, 366, 244, 255) into a more stabilized lower regime in February/March (227, 192, 167, 141). The carry-over insight correctly identified this shift. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across the last 4 concluded periods. However, recent demand samples (P1-P4: 227, 192, 167, 141) show a continuing decline even within the 'low' regime. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs for this basic denim item, I will use a shorter window (N=4) to capture the current mean (~182 units) and volatility. Using 'recent_N' with N=4 reflects the post-January behavior accurately while discounting the high-volume early January outliers.

Carry-over insight: Demand continues to trend downward within the post-January regime: mean has shifted from ~250 in early Feb to ~150-170 in early March.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a pair of high-waisted skinny denim trousers. Historical data shows a clear downward trend since January: Jan (avg ~377), Feb (avg ~210), and early March (avg ~147). The most recent two periods (P4 and P5) had demands of 141 and 152 respectively, suggesting demand has stabilized at a lower level after the post-holiday drop. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 5 game periods. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower, stabilized demand regime (avg ~153 for review+lead period) while ignoring the higher Jan/early Feb peaks to avoid overstocking and high holding costs. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized in a lower regime for March: mean confirmed at ~150 units/period (P4-P5) compared to Feb average of ~210.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear downward trend since January: Jan avg ~370, Feb avg ~185, and March (Periods 4-6) avg ~131. The most recent demand (P6) was 101, suggesting a further decline or stabilization at a lower level. The carry-over insights already noted a drop to ~150, but the last period shows it might be even lower. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all six resolved periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), the backend needs to be conservative to avoid excess inventory. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent March stabilization (~131 units/period), as the earlier February data is no longer relevant for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for March: mean has dropped to ~130 units/period (P4-P6), down from the previously estimated ~150. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has shown a consistent downward trend since January. Looking at the last four periods (March), demand was 141, 152, 101, and 124, averaging 129.5 units. The Carry-over Insights for Period 7 confirmed a shift to approximately 130 units/period. The lead time has remained stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they were placed. To optimize for the upcoming April sales while maintaining low holding costs (profit/holding cost ratio is 4:1), I will use a 4-period window to capture the current stable March/early-April regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=1) based on the most recent demand level of ~130 units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS has stabilized following a significant decline from January peaks. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is 131.8 units, while the most recent two periods (P7-P8) suggest a minor uptick (124 to 141) likely coinciding with the beginning of April/Spring season. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is very low (8 units), requiring an order to meet current period demand. Given the stability in March and the slight uptick in April, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime while hedging against recent volatility. Lead time (L) is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized in the 130-140 unit range since mid-March (P4-P8 mean: 131.8). The downward trend observed in February has halted.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/04/15), we observe the SKU 706016015 (high-waisted superstretch denim) moving deeper into the spring season. Historical demand since mid-March has been somewhat volatile but stable in its average, with recent periods showing 141 (P8) and 88 (P9). The carry-over insights correctly identified a stabilization between 130-140 units, but P9's drop to 88 suggests that while the floor might be lower, the overall regime remains much lower than the January peaks. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be consistently met in all concluded history. To setting parameters: 1) L is set to 'default' as 0 periods is confirmed. 2) mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=6 (covering P4 through P9). This captures the entire post-February stabilization period, resulting in a mean of approximately 124.5 units per period. 3) sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current volatility (std approx 25.5) which ensures the backend can calculate an appropriate safety stock for this moderate service level (profit $4 vs holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Post-stabilization demand (P4-P9) is averaging 124.5 units; the 130-140 range identified earlier has slightly softened due to a low reading of 88 in Period 9.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for the Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS has significantly softened, dropping from an average of ~130 units in March/early April to 88 and 62 units in the last two periods respectively. This suggests a new demand regime shift or seasonality as we move deeper into spring. The mean of the last 3 periods (P8-P10) is 97 units, which is a more accurate representation of current demand than the longer-term average of 124 units. On-hand inventory is 84, and previous periods confirm a consistent lead time of 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a service level for this high-margin (75%) SKU, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent downward trend. L remains set to 'default' as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift detected starting Period 9: Demand significantly decreased from the ~130 level to a mean of ~75 units over the last two periods (Period 9-10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016015' is a fashion item (jeans) currently in Period 12 (late April). Demand has undergone a significant and sustained contraction. A regime shift was noted at Period 9, and the last three periods (P9-P11) have recorded demand of 88, 62, and 48, averaging ~66 units per period. This clearly contrasts with the March average of ~130. As we head further into the spring/summer season, demand for this 'Divided Collection' skinny denim appears to be tapering off. I will set N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific low-demand regime. This will prevent over-ordering as current on-hand inventory (83) already exceeds the recent average weekly demand. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all 11 previous 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand contraction confirmed from Period 9-11: mean has further dropped to ~66 units/period, down from the ~130 level observed in March.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016015) has entered a significantly lower, yet potentially stabilizing, regime. Starting from Period 9, demand readings have been 88, 62, 48, and 64, significantly lower than the ~130-140 unit range observed in March and early April. This decline coincides with the transition into late Spring (May 6th), where consumer interest in high-waisted skinny denim may be softening compared to earlier periods. The mean demand over the last four periods (Period 9-12) is 65.5 units. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this contraction while maintaining a buffer for demand volatility in this lower range (standard deviation of the last 4 samples is approx 16.5), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 samples (N=4) to capture the current mean of ~66 units per period. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 will align our safety stock with the volatility of this new low-demand environment, preventing overstocking and high holding costs in a declining market.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed in low regime starting Period 9: 4-period mean (P9-P12) is 65.5 units, representing a >50% reduction from the March baseline of ~130 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016015 has entered a stable low regime since Period 9 (late April). The demand observations for the last five periods are 88, 62, 48, 64, and 62. The average demand for this most recent regime (N=5, Period 9-13) is 64.8 units per period, which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 13 identifying a mean of approximately 65.5. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be highly reliable, as evidenced by every single order to date (Periods 1-13) arriving within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since we are currently in mid-May (2019/5/13) and the high-waisted denim skinny jeans are a staple item that saw higher demand in early spring, the current lower volume suggests we have settled into a balanced post-peak sales phase. I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this specific low-demand regime. This keeps the base stock aligned with the current sales velocity while avoiding overstocking on a product whose peak season appears to have passed.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand analysis shows a significant and sustained drop starting in early April (Period 9). For the first three months of the year, demand fluctuated between 130 and 400+ units, but has since stabilized into a much lower regime. The demand values for the last six periods (P9-P14) are 88, 62, 48, 64, 62, and 69. This results in a 6-period mean of 65.5 units and a standard deviation of approximately 12.8. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history (ordered and arrived in the same period). Given this stabilization, I am setting the lead time to 'default' (0) and using a 'recent_N' approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this current low-demand regime specifically while ignoring the high-volume peaks from earlier in the year. This prevents the OR backend from over-ordering based on outdated high-variance data while providing enough stock to cover the recent average demand of ~66 units/period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has remained in a low-volume stable regime since Period 9 (late April). The demand values for the last 7 periods (P9-P15) are: 88, 62, 48, 64, 62, 69, 49. The mean across this recent 7-period window is approximately 63 units, confirming the stabilization noted in Carry-Over Insights. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-contraction regime and avoid bias from earlier, higher-demand periods in February and March. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with every order arriving in its execution phase. The inventory position is currently 28 units on-hand; the system will aim for a base stock reflecting the 63-unit mean, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: The low-volume regime (May baseline) is confirmed with a 7-period mean (P9-P15) of 63.1 units/period, showing significant stability through throughout May.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand shows a persistent low-volume regime that started in mid-April (Period 9). The last eight periods (P9-P16) have seen demand fluctuate between 36 and 88, with a mean of 59.75 and a standard deviation of approximately 14.9. The most recent demand (Period 16) was the lowest yet at 36, continuing a cooling trend observed throughout May. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking in this declining environment while maintaining a safety buffer, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this low-volume May/June baseline. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock target that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost, given a 0-period lead time environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in a low-volume state for early June, with the 8-period mean (P9-P16) sitting at 59.8 units/period. The most recent demand of 36 units (P16) suggests a further softening or seasonal shift entering the summer months.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has shown a consistent and significant downward trend since the start of the simulation, moving from peaks over 400 in January to an average of ~60 units in May. In the most recent periods (P16 and P17), demand has further softened to 36 and 22 units, respectively. This aligns with the transition into summer (June), where super-skinny denim (a heavy garment) often sees lower demand compared to lighter apparel. The current on-hand inventory of 51 units is sufficient to cover these lower demand levels. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this immediate summer cooling, capturing the drop from 49 to 22. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'Period N conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected for early June: the May baseline of ~60 units has dropped to a mean of 29 units over the last two periods (P16-P17), indicating seasonal cooling for the super-skinny denim category.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has settled into a significantly lower seasonal regime as of June. The most recent demand samples are 36 (P16), 22 (P17), and 24 (P18), confirming the 'early June shift' identified in Period 18. The mean for these three most recent weeks is 27.3 units per period. This downward trend is seasonally expected for heavy-denim products entering summer. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To prevent overstocking and minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while maintaining a high service level for the remaining demand ($4 profit/unit), I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3-period regime. I'm choosing N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the current low-demand reality more heavily than the May baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for June confirmed as low-volume: 3-period mean (P16-P18) is 27.3 units/period, down from the May mean of ~60 units. This suggests a seasonal trough for super-skinny washed denim during summer months.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has settled into a low-volume summer regime. For June (Periods 16-19), demand has been consistently low: 36, 22, 24, and 34 units, yielding a 4-period mean of 29.0 units/period. This aligns with the seasonal cooling described in the carry-over insights. Total inventory is currently 0, necessitating an order. Since the lead time remains stable at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this summer baseline. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock for a lead time of 0 (L+1 = 1 period of demand coverage) while accounting for the lower mean and variance of this current regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime established (June): mean demand has stabilized at ~29 units/period (P16-P19), confirming a significant step down from the May baseline of ~60 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. The product (super-skinny denim) has entered a stable low-demand summer regime. Over the last five periods (P16-P20), demand has been consistently low: 36, 22, 24, 34, 27, averaging 28.6 units/period. The carry-over insights confirm this stabilization around ~29 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since the inventory position (on-hand 8 + in-transit 0) is well below the expected demand for the next period, and demand has shown stability at this low level for over a month, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture this specific summer regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current demand level without over-ordering during this seasonal trough.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (2019/7/1), demand spiked significantly to 121 units, up from the summer baseline of ~29 units established in the previous 5 periods. This spike coincides with early July, likely representing a 'Summer Sale' or a mid-summer promotional event for 'Divided Collection' denim. The system was unable to satisfy this demand due to low inventory levels (sold 34, demand 121), resulting in a stockout. Historical data for this SKU shows very high demand in January (~400/week) which then stepped down; it appears demand is volatile and sensitive to promotions. Given the current date (July 8) and the stockout in the prior period, I must guard against a sustained high-demand period after the July 1 spike. I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture the most recent spike for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base-stock level is high enough to satisfy immediate residual demand from the sale period. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected starting Period 21: demand jumped to 121 units (July 1), a 4x increase from the June baseline (~29 units), likely driven by a summer promotional event.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8) concluded with a stockout despite ordering 121 units (the previous period's demand). Demand remained very high at 122 units, confirming the July spike noted in the carry-over insights. Total inventory is currently 0 (on-hand + in-transit), meaning we are completely stock-out. The demand over the last two periods (P21, P22) has averaged ~121.5 units, which is a significant structural shift compared to the June baseline of ~29. I will set mu_hat using the last 2 periods to capture this high-demand promotional/peak regime. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=2 to reflect the current volatility within this spike, and Lead Time remains 'default' (0 periods) as shipments have consistently arrived in the same period.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime for July confirmed: demand has stabilized at ~122 units/period (P21-P22) following the June trough of ~29 units, representing a 4x increase likely tied to seasonal promotions.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently experiencing a sustained high-demand regime in July, likely driven by seasonal promotions or summer demand peaks. The last three periods show a significant and increasing demand trend: 121, 122, and 137. The previous June trough (~29 units) is no longer relevant for forecasting. I will transition mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new regime by using a recent_N of 3, capturing the July surge. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game history, so L remains at 'default'. The objective is to maintain inventory to satisfy this higher demand level (mean ~127) while minimizing stockouts, which have occurred in the last three periods due to on-hand inventory hitting zero.

Carry-over insight: July high-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand has shifted to ~127 units/period (P21-P23) from the June baseline of ~29 units, with a slight upward trend (P23 demand reached 137).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016015 (skinny denim) showed a sharp increase at the start of July (P21-P23), which was previously attributed to a summer promotional regime with a mean of approximately 127 units. However, Period 24 demand dropped to 76 units, suggesting the peak of the promotion or the seasonal shift has passed or is stabilizing at a lower level for late July/early August. To account for this recent deceleration while acknowledging the July baseline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 (P21-P24), which yields a mean of 114 units [(121+122+137+76)/4]. This balances the high-demand evidence with the most recent cooling signal. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods across all historical observations. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to capture the high volatility seen during this July period.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected in late July: The high-demand regime of ~127 units/period (P21-P23) dropped to 76 units in Period 24, suggesting the promotional peak or seasonal summer surge is cooling.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25 (July 29), demand spiked to 140 units, reversing the previous period's drop (76 units) and suggesting that the high-demand summer regime is still active into early August. This item (Jade HW Skinny Denim) appears to follow a promotional or seasonal trend where July/August demand (average ~120) is significantly higher than June (average ~29). The stockout in Period 25 (sold 137 vs 140 demand) leaves on-hand at 0. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will estimate mu_hat based on the high-demand July/August window (Periods 21-25), which has a mean of 119.2 units per period. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this current regime while ignoring the low June volumes. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility (76 to 140) observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in high-demand regime: Late July (P24-P25) showed wide swings (76 to 140 units), requiring higher safety stock for August.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016015) has entered a high-volume and highly volatile phase in August (Period 26 demand reached 180 units). Recent history shows a significant shift from the July baseline (~120 units) to a late July/early August surge with increased volatility (Period 24: 76, Period 25: 140, Period 26: 180). This likely corresponds to 'Back-to-School' shopping or a late-summer clearance peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To handle this surge and the associated volatility while at a zero-inventory position, I am switching to a 'recent_N' method using N=6 to capture the July-August regime (Periods 21-26). This encompasses the high-demand ramp-up and the recent volatility, ensuring the OR backend's service level calculation is based on current environmental conditions rather than the low-volume summer trough.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand surge confirmed starting August: demand increased from July mean (~120) to 180 units in Period 26, accompanied by high volatility.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-August Back-to-School (BTS) peak for skinny denim. Historical demand for the last two periods has been 180 and 184 units, significantly higher than the July average of ~120. The current date (August 19) suggests we are either at the peak or nearing the plateau of this seasonal surge. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since the inventory is currently empty (on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0), and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts (Periods 25-27), we must set the base stock high enough to capture this confirmed 180+ unit regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to anchor the forecast directly to the 182-unit average observed during the BTS surge (P26-P27) to avoid under-stocking. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=2 to reflect the recent high-volume volatility.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peak confirmed for mid-August: mean demand has increased to 182 units/period (P26-P27), up from the July mean of ~120.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Back-to-School demand surge has intensified significantly, with demand jumping from 184 to 272 in Period 28 (a 47% increase WoW). We have stocked out in four of the last five periods, indicating that our forecast is consistently trailing the actual demand ramp-up. We are currently in the peak of the Back-to-School season (late August). The mean demand of the last three periods (P26-P28) is 212 units, but the most recent observation (272) suggests we haven't hit the ceiling yet. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 280 to proactively cover this peak and prevent another stockout. Sigma_hat is set relatively high (explicitly at 50) to account for the increasing volatility observed during this surge. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School peak intensification: Demand surged to 272 in Period 28, a 47% increase over the previous week (~184). Mean demand for the late August peak (P26-P28) has reached 212 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/9/2, which typically marks the transition from the Back-to-School peak towards a more stable autumn demand period for denim. After a peak demand of 272 in Period 28, demand decreased to 215 in Period 29. While this indicates the absolute peak may have passed, demand remains significantly higher than the July/early August baseline. The mean demand for the last four periods (P26-P29) is approximately 213 units, which aligns closely with the most recent observation of 215. Given the product is a 'High-waisted skinny denim' trouser, it is a staple for the autumn season. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this current high-volume regime while acknowledging the slight cooling from the peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods will provide enough buffer for sustained high demand without over-ordering as the seasonal peak begins to normalize.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School demand stabilization: Following the P28 peak of 272, demand has settled into a 200-220 unit range (P29 demand: 215), establishing a high-volume autumn baseline compared to the 130-unit July levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016015 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-demand Back-to-School/Early Autumn regime. Period 30 saw demand surge to 300 units, exceeding the previous stabilization estimate of 200-220. With a current on-hand inventory of 0 and in-transit units at 0, aggressive restocking is required to prevent lost sales. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, the last two periods (P29-P30) have averaged 257.5 units, with the P30 peak reaching 300. Given the consistent upward volatility in late August and early September, I will use a recent_N of 3 (P28-P30) for mu_hat to capture this high-volume drift (average ~262). For sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 5 to account for the high volatility observed throughout August (ranging from 180 to 300). This ensures the base stock calculation (Profit=$4, Holding=$1 -> 80% service level) covers the current peak demand while protecting against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peaked reaching 300 units in Period 30, shifting the autumn baseline higher than the previously estimated 200-220 range. The Period 28-30 mean is 262.3 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-September (2019-09-16), a period following the Back-to-School (BTS) peak. Demand remains high but show signs of slight cooling from its peak. Period 30 saw 300 units, then Period 31 settled to 240 units. The 3-period mean (P29-P31) is 251.7 units. Given the high stockouts in recent periods (P25-P28, P30), I need to maintain a robust base stock to capture this elevated autumn demand while preparing for potential normalization as the BTS effect fades. I will set N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-volume regime (P28-P31) which averages 256.75 units per period. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 will account for the high volatility observed during the BTS surge (stdev is significant), ensuring adequate safety stock. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-BTS demand stabilization: The demand regime for early September has stabilized between 240-300 units (P30-P31 mean: 270), significantly higher than the August baseline of ~210 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 33 (late September) remains in the high-volume post-Back-to-School consolidation phase. Demand over the last three periods (P30-P32) has been 300, 240, and 279, resulting in a mean of 273 units. This aligns with the 'Post-BTS' stabilization noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this specific autumn regime while accounting for the recent volatility (standard deviation across P30-P32 is approx 30), I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current elevated demand level and stabilizes inventory after the stockouts seen in August. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the 273 units of expected demand plus a safety factor for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late September (P30-P32) has solidified around a mean of 273 units/period, confirming the high-volume autumn baseline post-BTS surge.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A massive demand spike occurred in Period 33 (704 units), which is more than double the previous autumn mean of ~273 units. Given the date (Sept 30), this likely represents a significant seasonal event or a major promotion. The system is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0). To capture this surge and prevent further lost sales while acknowledging the volatility, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the recent peak level (~700) to ensure the OR backend places a sufficiently large order. Although the mean might settle lower, the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) favors overstocking during this high-volume period over risking further stock-outs. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the sharp increase in volatility seen in the last period while maintaining a link to the stable autumn baseline.

Carry-over insight: Major demand surge detected Period 33: Demand jumped to 704 units, a 2.5x increase over the previous 3-period mean of 273. This indicates a high-intensity peak event for late September/early October.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (Sept 23), a massive demand spike of 704 units was observed, signaling a high-intensity peak event (likely a late September promotion or seasonal reset). Period 34 demand moderated to 397 units, which is still significantly higher than the previous autumn baseline of ~270. As of Period 35 (Oct 7), we are entering the mid-autumn period. The mean demand for the last two periods (P33-P34) is 550.5 units, but given the volatility (704 followed by 397), a purely mean-based forecast for the next period might be too aggressive if the peak is receding, or too passive if demand remains high. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 450 to reflect a stabilization above the old 270 baseline but below the extreme 704 peak. I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 150 to account for the ongoing high volatility (standard deviation of recent surges). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected Period 33-34: Autumn baseline has elevated significantly from ~270 to a higher range (recent mean 550.5), though demand is decelerating from the 704 peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is currently navigating the aftermath of a massive late September/early October surge (reaching 704 units in Period 33). The last two periods show a cooling trend (397 in P34, 250 in P35), but demand remains well above the pre-surge autumn baseline of ~270 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (Periods 33-35) to capture the elevated but decelerating demand profile (mean ~450). This remains conservative given the sudden 704 peak. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory of 327 reflects the large order placed in Period 34 to cover the surge. Since demand is softening, mu_hat=recent_N=3 will correctly guide the base stock toward a safer, lower level while maintaining enough coverage for continued autumn volume. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility observed during this peak-to-trough transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling from the Period 33 surge (704 units): mean for P34-P35 is 323.5 units, still ~20% higher than the pre-surge autumn baseline, but indicating the peak has passed.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has clearly entered a post-peak cooling phase following the massive surge in late September (P33: 704 units). Demand has declined sequentially from 704 to 397, 250, and most recently 197 units. This trend indicates the 'Autumn Peak' has passed, and we are returning toward the previous autumn baseline which was approximately 200-240 units. Current on-hand inventory is high (449 units) because the order placed in P34 was calibrated for a much higher demand regime. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the stabilized autumn demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P34-P36) which captures the downward trend (Mean \u2248 281). However, since the most recent demand was 197, I expect the next period to stay within the 180-220 range. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR engine to react to this cooling trend while accounting for the recent high volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed post-September peak: Demand has dropped for three consecutive periods (397, 250, 197) from the 704-unit high, returning towards the early-autumn baseline of ~200 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is currently returning from a significant late-September peak (704 units) and appears to be stabilizing in a late-October regime. Period 37 demand was 310, an increase from the previous week's 197, but substantially lower than the peak levels. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P34-P37) is approximately 288 units. Given the seasonality of denim (autumn baseline post-BTS), I am moving from the peak-handling 'explicit' values used previously to a 'recent_N' approach. Using N=4 for mu_hat (covering the post-peak descent) provides a mean of ~288, which aligns with the observed Period 37 demand of 310. Using N=4 for sigma_hat captures the remaining volatility from the transition out of the peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 139 on-hand, so a refill is needed to meet the expected 250-300 unit weekly demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-September peak demand (P34-P37) has stabilized at a mean of ~288 units/period, significantly lower than the 550+ range but still higher than the mid-summer levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has settled into a post-September peak regime. After the massive spike in Period 33 (704 units) and subsequent cooling, the last two periods (P37: 310, P38: 348) indicate a stabilized autumn/winter baseline around 330 units. This is higher than the early autumn baseline (~270) but significantly lower than the extreme outlier peak. The start of November (Period 39) often sees steady demand leading into mid-month promotions or holiday shopping. Since the lead time is consistently 0, I will use a recent_N strategy (N=4) to capture the current stable mean (P35-P38 mean: 276.25, but influenced by the 197 low) and ensure enough stock to cover the 310-350 range observed most recently. I choose N=4 to balance the cooling phase with the latest uptick. On-hand is currently very low (13), so the OR backend will trigger a significant order to reach the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-September peak demand (P35-P38) has confirmed a new baseline of approximately 275-330 units/period, stabilizing significantly above summer levels but well below the P33 outlier.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized into a post-peak autumn regime. Following the massive spike in Period 33 (704 units), demand has settled into a range of approximately 200\u2013350 units. The most recent three-period mean (P37\u2013P39) is 305 units, compared to the five-period mean (P35\u2013P39) of 272.4 units. Given we are now in mid-November (2019/11/11), there is a potential for an upcoming pre-holiday surge or Black Friday peak, similar to the surge observed in late September. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat slightly above the recent average using an explicit forecast of 320 to maintain high service levels while managing holding costs. Sigma_hat is set to 60 using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatility observed after the major September outlier. L remains at the promised 0 periods as arrivals have been consistently instantaneous.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for November (P37-P39) has stabilized with a mean of 305 units/period, showing a steady volume consistent with high-season denim demand but lower than the late-September peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized into a consistent November regime. Analysis of the the last four periods (P37-P40) shows demand levels of 310, 348, 257, and 260, resulting in a mean of 293.75 units per period. This confirms the carry-over insight that the late-autumn baseline is approximately 300 units, significantly lower than the late-September peak (704 units) but well above summer levels. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order. With on-hand inventory at 109 units and Period 41 demand expected to follow this established ~294 unit mean, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized November trend while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the observed variance (std \u2248 42). This ensures we satisfy the current demand and maintain the target service level as we move deeper into the high-volume Q4 season.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized in November following the volatile September surge and October cooling. For the last five periods (P37-P41), demand has been 310, 348, 257, 260, and 243, resulting in a mean of 283.6. While the last three periods show a slight downward trend, the overall average remains consistent with the high-season autumn baseline established in Carry-over Insights (Period 40: ~305 units). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this current stable average (283.6 per period) while allowing for the slight softening seen in the most recent three weeks. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture the current volatility (std approx 44), ensuring sufficient safety stock for the end-of-year season without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late November (P37-P41) has averaged 283.6 units/period, showing a slight softening from the early November mean of 305 but remains significantly above summer levels.

This represents a significant deviation from the previous November baseline of ~283 units. Historically, late September (Period 33) also saw a surge to 704 units, followed by a cooling period, but December demand for denim is typically robust due to gift-giving and winter shopping. Given the on-hand inventory is currently 0, we must aggressively restock to capture this higher demand regime and prevent stockouts. I will shift the demand forecast (mu_hat) to an explicit value of 450 to balance the extreme outlier of 598 with the previous 300-unit baseline, ensuring we are prepared for sustained December volume. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for high volatility observed during peak events. Lead time (L) remains 0 as per consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected Period 42: Demand jumped to 598 units (Black Friday week), a 2x increase over the November mean of ~283 units. This mirrors the late-September peak and establishes a high-volatility regime for December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2), we observed a demand of 131 units, which follows the sharp Black Friday spike of 598 units in Period 42. This pattern mirrors the late-September peak (704 followed by a cooling to 397). The current date is Dec 9, entering the peak holiday shopping season. While demand cooled significantly from the Black Friday peak, we should expect a sustained high-volume regime through December. The 'in-transit' is 0 and on-hand is 446. Given the holiday season, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the trend from November through the Black Friday event and subsequent cooling, which provides a mean demand of approximately 342. This covers both the volatility and the expected baseline for December. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand cooling post-Black Friday: Period 43 demand (131) settled significantly lower than the P42 peak (598), following a similar pattern to the late-September surge.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has significantly cooled following the major Black Friday spike (598 units in Period 42), with recent periods showing 131 and 171 units. Historically, after the late-September peak (704 units), demand settled into a baseline of ~275-300 units. A similar pattern is expected as we move further into December, though the approaching end-of-year holidays might bring one more minor surge or a sharp drop depending on local consumer behavior. The current on-hand inventory of 275 units appears sufficient to cover the next period given the recent downward trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the post-Black Friday cooling trend while weighting the Period 42 spike less heavily, but keeping sigma_hat at a larger window (N=6) to account for the high volatility observed during December.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), which is the peak holiday week leading up to Christmas. Historical demand shows a significant surge during Black Friday (Period 42, 598 units) followed by a cooling period in early-to-mid December (Periods 43-45 mean: 156.3 units). However, calendar knowledge suggests a late-December spike for last-minute holiday shopping and gift-giving. Since lead time is consistently 0 periods, the objective is to ensure on-hand inventory covers this week's potential surge without overstocking into the post-holiday lull. The most recent three-period mean (156) is likely too low given the date; I will use a larger N (recent_N=6) to capture the higher volume observed in late November/early December while accounting for recent deceleration. This provides a mu_hat basis of approximately 250 units (P40-P45 mean is ~261). With on-hand at 273, the OR backend will calculate a modest order if the base stock (incorporating safety stock for volatility) exceeds current levels.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand deceleration confirmed mid-December: Mean demand for P43-P45 is 156.3 units/period, following the Black Friday peak, but remains 5x higher than the summer trough (~29 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are in a post-holiday demand deceleration phase. Demand has dropped for three consecutive periods (171, 167, 106) following the Black Friday peak, and this final week of the year typically involves continued cooling as seasonal shopping ends. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P43-P46) is 143.75 units, but the most recent reading (106) indicates the regime is likely continuing to soften toward 100 units or less. With lead time consistently at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this downward trend without being overly aggressive, while maintaining a default sigma_hat to account for the residual volatility of the high-season period. On-hand inventory is currently high (301 units), which should safely cover the expected lower demand for this final period.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand regime (Late December): Demand has decelerated from a Black Friday peak to a mean of ~144 units/period (P43-P46), with the most recent reading of 106 units indicating a return to moderate volume levels.
