Current date is Feb 11, which is just before Valentine's Day. While the massive spike might subside post-holiday, the product is a 'skinny/stretch' fashion item likely to maintain a higher baseline than early January as spring fashion approaches.

In Period 1 (Feb 11), demand was 187, which exceeded our stock of 100. This confirms a significant upward demand regime, likely driven by spring fashion cycles or a specific trend for this product. The promised lead time of 0 periods was confirmed in Period 1 (order placed in P1 arrived in P1). For Period 2 (Feb 18), I expect demand to follow the current trend of ~180-200 units.

Target stock: ~250 units (to cover current demand and have a buffer for potential variability). Calculation: 250 (Target) - 82 (On-hand) - 0 (In-transit) = 168 units.

Period 8 (April 1) is typically a period of sustained spring demand. Analysis of lead time confirms it is 0 periods, meaning orders placed today will arrive in time to satisfy this period's demand. In Period 7, we stocked out with 0 ending inventory because demand (99) exceeded on-hand inventory (85), suggesting demand has increased from the previous floor of ~75.

  "rationale": "The product is a 'Push Up Jegging L.W', a staple ladies' denim item. Historically, September often sees a resurgence in denim demand as temperatures cool and back-to-university/autumn fashion cycles begin. Recent data shows high volatility: Period 30 demand was 87 and Period 31 demand reached 110, resulting in a stockout. This indicates a strong upward trend or a new high-demand regime for September (average ~98 units over the last two weeks). The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, allowing for 'Just-in-Time' replenishment. However, current on-hand inventory is 0 after the Period 31 stockout. Given the profit margin ($19) versus the holding cost ($1), it is optimal to carry enough safety stock to capture these triple-digit demand spikes. Anticipating the current regime of ~100-110 units, I will order 110 units to satisfy expected demand for Period 32 and mitigate risk of further stockouts.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is 'Push Up Jeggings', a staple items that experienced a significant peak in December (P44: 99, P45: 106) due to holiday shopping. Period 46 (Dec 23rd week) showed a decline to 85 units, signaling the end of the holiday surge. Period 47 (Dec 30th) marks the Transition into the New Year. Based on historical data from the beginning of the previous year (Jan 2019: 35-58 units), demand typically drops significantly in January after the December peak. However, it often remains slightly higher than the summer trough. I expect demand for the upcoming week to fall within the 40-60 range as holiday shopping concludes. Lead time is confirmed as 0. On-hand inventory is 35 units. To cover a forecast of 60 while maintaining some safety stock to avoid stockouts (as seen in P44), I will order enough to bring total availability to approximately 75 units.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-holiday demand cooling: Following the December peak (99-106 units), demand decreased to 85 units in Period 46 and is expected to return to January baseline levels (~40-60 units).",
