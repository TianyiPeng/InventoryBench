Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1: Starting with 0 inventory. The product is a staple women's vest top. Historical data from early January to early February shows a mean demand of 134 units across 5 samples, with a slight downward trend from 162 to 118. As we are currently in mid-February, I will use the recent 5 samples (N=5) to establish the forecast. The promised lead time is 0, so I will stay with the default. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical ratio is 0.95, justifying a healthy safety stock level to avoid stockouts. I will use the recent history (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand regime.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's jersey basic strap top. In Period 1, we ordered 166 units which arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), and demand was 157. This is slightly higher than the average of the five pre-game samples (162, 142, 115, 133, 118; Mean = 134). The current on-hand inventory is low (9 units). Given the high demand in Period 1 and the stable nature of 'Everyday Basics', I will use the last 5 pre-game samples plus Period 1 (N=6) to forecast demand. The actual lead time observed in Period 1 was 0, matching the promised lead time. I will maintain the default lead time setting but use recent_N for demand to capture the slightly higher recent volume.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are looking at SKU 108775044 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Top). The current date is 2019/02/25. Looking at the historical demand samples and recent performance: demand was relatively stable in Jan/early Feb (avg ~134). However, in Period 2 (Feb 18), demand spiked significantly to 244 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 170/demand 244). The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Since we have a stockout and a sudden surge in demand, and we are entering the spring season for a 'Jersey top with narrow shoulder straps', I expect demand to remain higher than the initial baseline. Averaging the available 7 samples (162, 142, 115, 133, 118, 157, 244) gives 153. Using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent uptrend (118, 157, 244) gives an average of ~173. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to balance the spike with the previous stable period, and default for others to handle the volatility. L remains 0.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' strap top. Historical demand samples (before P1) were around 115-162. Recent demand (P1-P3) has been 157, 244, and 175. The average of the last 3 periods is 192, compared to the pre-game average of 134. This suggests a shift toward higher demand as we move into March (spring seasonality for basics). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 61. There is no in-transit inventory. For Period 4, I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this elevated demand level, while keeping L at the default (0) and sigma_hat at default to handle the recent volatility (the jump to 244 in P2). The target service level is high (q = 19/20 = 0.95), so the OR backend will aim to cover demand spikes.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's strap top, a basic garment. Current date is March 11, 2019. Historically, demand has been relatively stable with an average of 144 units over the first 5 samples. However, in-game demand (Periods 1-4) has shown higher volatility and higher volume (mean = 181, std dev = 43.6). Specifically, Demand: P1=157, P2=244, P3=175, P4=149. The huge spike in P2 (244) suggests sensitivity to either early spring shopping or stockouts (P2 starting inventory was 170 against 244 demand, leading to lost sales). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently 112 units. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the higher in-game demand volume and volatility while L=0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's basic strap top (Everyday Basics). Historically, demand for these items often remains steady or begins to rise slightly as spring approaches (current date: March 18). Looking at the recent data, Period 2 saw a significant spike (244 units) which exhausted inventory, but demand has since stabilized between 138-175 in Periods 3-5. The mean of all historical samples (including pre-game data) is 153.2. Given that inventory ended at 115 units and there is no in-transit volume, we must ensure enough stock for the coming period. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the recent 5 periods (all available in-game data) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent stabilization while acknowledging the earlier spike. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for high-profit/low-holding-cost goods (Profit $19, Holding $1).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's strap top (Jersey Basic), typically showing stable demand in early spring (late February to March). Recent demand samples (Periods 1-6) are: 157, 244 (likely a spike/outlier), 175, 149, 138, 156. The mean demand of these 6 periods is 170 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently show an actual lead time of 0 periods, confirmed through Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 86. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the current demand regime. With L=0, the backend base stock logic (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) will target a high service level due to the $19 profit relative to $1 holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Strap top' (Womens Everyday Basics), which fits the profile of a staple item. Current date is 2019/04/01. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 2 (244 units) and recent demand in Period 7 (182 units) is trending upwards compared to the 130-150 range seen in Periods 4-6. As we enter Spring (April), demand for strap tops is expected to increase seasonally. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the recent upward trend and anticipate seasonal growth, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent higher demand observations (Periods 4-7: 149, 138, 156, 182) more heavily than the earlier periods. This results in a mu_hat based on an average of ~156 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3572.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top' (Women's Everyday Basics), which is highly susceptible to spring/summer seasonality. Current date is April 8, 2019. In Period 8 (April 1), demand spiked to 312 units, causing a stockout (on-hand 0). This follows a baseline of ~150 units. The spike (312) is likely the start of a spring upward trend. Historical samples (January-February) averaged ~134, while recent history (Periods 1-7) averaged ~171. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the target base stock needs to cover the current period's demand. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to account for this seasonal surge, setting it to an expected value higher than the recent average but tempered by the spike, targeting 300 units for this period. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand surge detected starting Period 8 (April 1), with demand jumping from ~150-180 to 312 (+70-100%). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (April 15, 2019). The SKU is a women's strap top, a product highly sensitive to warm weather. History shows a major demand surge starting in Period 8 (April 1) where demand hit 312, followed by 207 in Period 9. While Period 9's demand was lower than Period 8's peak, both are significantly higher than the February/March baseline (avg ~160). This indicates we have entered the spring/summer seasonal regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility of the new seasonal regime (mean of P8-P9 is ~260). L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently meeting arrival expectations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4118.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top/Vest top', which is seasonally relevant as we move into spring/summer (April). A significant demand surge was observed in Period 8 (312 units) at the start of April. While subsequent demand in Periods 9 and 10 was lower than the peak (207 and 225 units respectively), it remains significantly higher than the pre-April average (~157). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 8's demand (312) likely included some backlog or a massive initial spike, but demand remains elevated above the early-year baseline, I will use recent history to capture this new regime. Using recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) covers the April data (Periods 8, 9, 10), resulting in a mean of (312+207+225)/3 = 248. This protects against the higher volatility seen in this transition to spring. Sigma will also use recent_N=3 to account for this increased variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' strap top, which is entering its peak spring/summer season as of late April. Since Period 8 (April 1st), we have observed a significant demand shift. Demand in the last four periods (Periods 8-11) has been 312, 207, 225, and 273, respectively. This averages to approximately 254 units per period, compared to the pre-April average of ~150-180. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods (immediate delivery). To capture this higher seasonal volume while managing recent volatility (from 207 to 312), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the contemporary seasonal mean (~254 units). sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 4 periods to account for the increased variance observed during this high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top' (Women's Everyday Basics), which is highly seasonal as weather warms up. Current date is May 6. Since April 1 (Period 8), we have seen a sustained demand shift. Demand from Period 8 to 12 was: 312, 207, 225, 273, 270 (Average ~257). This is significantly higher than the February/March average (~160). Lead time is consistently 0. I will focus on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this new spring/summer baseline while accounting for the high volatility seen recently (Std Dev ~40 during this period).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Strap top' (Women's Everyday Basics), which typically experiences a seasonal demand increase during spring and summer. Current data confirms a demand regime shift that began in Period 8 (April 1). Demand in the pre-shift regime (Periods 1-7) averaged ~171, whereas demand in the current regime (Periods 8-13) has averaged ~247 (ranging from 199 to 312). Although demand dipped slightly in Period 13 to 199, the overall trend remains significantly higher than the initial weeks and aligns with seasonal expectations for May. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To accurately capture this higher seasonal baseline while account for recent variability, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (covering the period from the April 1 shift to the present). Lead time L is set to default (0).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top' (Womens Everyday Basics), which experiences higher demand during warmer months. Current history shows a significant demand regime shift starting in Period 8 (April). From Period 8 to 14, demand has averaged approximately 250 units (312, 207, 225, 273, 270, 199, 266), compared to the pre-April average of ~170. This period (May 20) is deep in this high-demand spring/summer season. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this sustained higher demand level for the OR engine, I will use a recent_N window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=7 covers the period since the April 1st seasonal shift, providing the most relevant mean and variance for the current regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current 250+ unit demand distribution rather than the lower full-history average.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top' (Women's Everyday Basics), which transitions into its peak summer season in late May (Period 16). Since the demand regime shift at Period 8 (April 1st), the average demand has settled into a higher range. Recent historical demand (last 8 periods since the shift) is approximately 253 units per week, with a recent 3-period average (P13-P15) of 244. Observations from the last two weeks (P14-P15) show consistent demand around 266-267. Given the warming weather (late May), demand is likely to remain high or slightly increase. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the full seasonal regime since April, which provides a mean of ~253. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. These parameters allow the backend to maintain a buffer that meets this heightened summer demand while minimizing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Since the April 1st seasonal shift, demand has averaged 252.8 units (Std Dev: ~37) over 8 periods, confirming a sustained high-demand period for the summer season.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 108775044 (Womens Everyday Basics strap top) has entered a stable high-demand summer regime since early April. Over the last 9 periods (P8-P16), demand has averaged 254.67 units, compared to the pre-April average of ~160 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods have shown very consistent demand (266, 267, 199 excluded, 263... actually P12-P16 demand: 270, 199, 266, 267, 263). The mean of the last 5 periods is 253.0 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level for this profitable item ($19/$1 profit/holding ratio implies a ~95% critical fractile), I will use the last 9 periods (the entire summer regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the policy captures the current seasonal elevation and variance while ignoring the lower winter demand baseline. Pipeline inventory is currently 0, and on-hand is low (53).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019, which is squarely in the peak summer demand season for 'Womens Everyday Basics | Jersey top with narrow shoulder straps'. Since the regime shift observed at Period 8 (April 1st), demand has remained consistently high. From Period 8 to Period 17 (10 periods), the average demand is 249.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 36 units. The most recent demand (Period 17) was 212 units, which is slightly below the regime average but within normal variance. I will use a N=10 window (covering the entire high-demand regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend captures the sustained 'summer' demand levels while smoothing out weekly fluctuations. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, allowing for 'same-period' replenishment to respond quickly to these demand levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a 'Strap top', which is seasonally highly relevant during the current summer period. We observed a significant drop in demand in Period 18 (92 units), which is well below the established regime average of ~252 units. However, looking at the history, demand has previously fluctuated (e.g., Period 13 was 199), and given the June date, this is likely a temporary dip rather than a permanent regime change toward lower demand. The 'Womens Everyday Basics' category usually maintains stability. I will use a slightly longer lookback (N=11) for mu_hat to include the full high-demand regime since April (Period 8) while dampening the impact of the Period 18 outlier. This avoids overreacting to one low week during peak season. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Strap Top', which is highly seasonal for the summer. After a confirmed demand surge starting April 1st (Period 8) where demand averaged ~250 units, we have observed a significant sharp decline in the last two periods (Period 18: 92 units, Period 19: 85 units). This suggest the peak summer demand phase for this 'Everyday Basic' item may be tapering off or experiencing a temporary dip (perhaps due to weather or post-peak saturation). Current on-hand inventory is 247, which is nearly 3x the most recent demand levels. To prevent excessive holding costs while still covering potential volatility, I am switching to a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this new, lower demand regime (Avg of Periods 17-19 is ~129 units). Lead time remains reliably 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Post-peak summer tail or mid-season dip. Demand dropped from an average of ~250 (Periods 8-17) to ~88 (Periods 18-19), a reduction of approx 65%.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top' (Womens Everyday Basics), which shows strong seasonality. Demand peaked between April and early June (Periods 8-17), averaging ~250 units/period. However, starting in Period 18 (June 10), there has been a drastic and sustained drop in demand (92, 85, 61), currently averaging 79.3 units over the last three periods. July 1st marks the start of Period 21; historically, such items may see a mid-summer lull or clearance phase after the initial summer rush. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Given the on-hand inventory of 186 units and the recent demand trend of ~80 units, we are currently overstocked (over 2 weeks of cover). I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to reflect this new lower demand regime and prevent further excess inventory accumulation. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to the recent volatility of this new regime to maintain an appropriate safety stock for the current lower volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: From Period 18 onwards (June 10), demand dropped from a summer peak average of 250 to a late-seasonal average of ~79 units (-68%).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top' (Women's Everyday Basics), which is highly seasonal. We are now in Period 22 (July 8, 2019). Historical data shows a clear regime shift: Period 8-17 (April through early June) saw peak summer demand averaging ~250 units. Starting in Period 18 (June 10), demand dropped significantly. Over the last four periods (P18-P21), demand was 92, 85, 61, and 27, respectively. The most recent demand (27) suggests we are exiting the peak summer season or hitting a mid-summer lull. Current on-hand inventory is 159 units. Using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 captures this new lower-demand regime (average ~66 units). Given the downward trend, stocking for the average of the last 4 periods provides a safe buffer while accounting for the high on-hand balance relative to the current sales rate. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand transitioned from late-season decline to a clear low-regime in July: demand has dropped every week since P18, reaching a low of 27 units in P21. Average demand for the last 4 weeks (P18-P21) is 66.25 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top' (Women's Everyday Basics), which shows clear seasonal demand patterns. Demand peaked during the summer (April\u2013early June) with an average of ~250 units, but has sharply declined as we move mid-July. Since Period 18, demand has dropped consistently: 92, 85, 61, 27, and 21. The current on-hand inventory is 138 units, which is significantly more than the most recent demand samples. To avoid racking up holding costs during this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (Period 18-22, average ~57 units). Lead time remains reliably at 0 periods based on the history of same-period arrivals. The OR backend will see that on-hand (138) > base_stock (derived from mu_hat ~57), resulting in zero orders this period, which is the desired outcome to burn off excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime solidified: Average demand for the last 5 weeks (June 10 - July 8) is 57.2 units, down from the peak season average of 250 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top' (Womens Everyday Basics), which has finished its peak summer season (April-May) and is now in a clear low-demand regime as of late July. Demand has dropped steadily from a peak average of ~250 units to a very low level: the last four weeks (P20-P23) show demand of 61, 27, 21, and 19 units respectively. The current sub-regime average (P21-P23) is roughly 22 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on historical arrivals. With 119 units currently on hand and a demand forecast of ~22-30 units, we are significantly overstocked for the current demand level. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this new low-demand floor and allow the on-hand inventory to deplete naturally without triggering new orders.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 108775044 (Womens Everyday Basics Strap Top) has entered a stable low-demand regime following its summer peak. Starting from Period 18 (early June), demand dropped significantly from an average of ~250 units to a much lower level. Over the last four periods (P21-P24), demand has been extremely consistent and low: 27, 21, 19, and 18 units, averaging 21.25 units. This aligns with the end of the peak summer season for a basic vest top. Current on-hand inventory is 101 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this current low-demand floor (~21 units) and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to minimize excess stock while maintaining high service levels for this low-volume period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime stabilized: Period 21-24 demand average is 21.25 units (range 18-27), down from peak seasonal average of 250 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top' (Women's Everyday Basics), which has transitioned from a summer peak (Avg ~250 units/period) into a late-summer/autumn low-demand regime. Since Period 21 (July 1), demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 22.4 units over the last 5 weeks (27, 21, 19, 18, 27). The current date is August 5, confirming we are well past the peak season for this item. On-hand inventory is 74 units, which is more than 3x the current average weekly demand. Given the high carry-over inventory relative to the low demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent 5-week low-demand regime (approx. 22 units/period) and use recent volatility (sigma_hat) for this period to help the OR backend avoid over-ordering while maintaining appropriate safety stock for this lower volume.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top/Vest top', which is highly seasonal. We are now in mid-August (Period 27). Historical demand since the end of the summer peak (Period 18) has consistently declined and stabilized at a very low level. Specifically, for the last 6 periods (P21-P26), demand has ranged between 16 and 27 units, with an average of 21.33 units. The current on-hand inventory is 58 units, which covers nearly 3 periods of recent average demand. Given that the lead time is consistently 0 periods (as confirmed by every order until P19), there is no immediate risk of stockout. I will use the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized 'low-regime' demand and avoid over-ordering as the summer season ends.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' vest top/strap top. Demand analysis shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high-demand regime during the summer (approx. 250 units/period from April to early June) followed by a significant and sustained drop starting mid-June. Since Period 21 (early July), demand has stabilized in a 'low-regime'. For the last 7 periods (P21-P27), demand has ranged from 12 to 27 units, with an average of approximately 20 units. The most recent demand (Period 27) was 12 units, confirming the continuation of this low-demand state. Currently, we have 46 units on-hand, which covers over 2 periods of recent average demand. Given the product's low current demand and the high on-hand relative to sales, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect this low-demand regime precisely. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on historical conclude messages. This approach minimizes holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current retail tail end.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime solidified (P21-P27): Average demand since July 1st is 20.0 units (range 12-27), marking the end-of-season tail for this summer item.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top', a seasonal summer item. We are now in Period 29 (late August), which is the end of the summer season. Demand has consistently declined and stabilized at a very low level. Since Period 21 (July 1st), weekly demand values have been: 27, 21, 19, 18, 27, 16, 12, 11. Over the last 5 weeks (Periods 24-28), the mean demand is 16.8 units with a low standard deviation. Current on-hand inventory is 35 units, which is roughly double the current weekly demand. Given the seasonal nature and the clear downward trend towards autumn, there is no need to order more stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering the low-demand regime since July) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect this stabilized low-demand tail, and keep Lead Time at the default 0.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top', a seasonal summer item. We are now in Period 30 (September 2), and demand history confirms a persistent decline as the summer season ends. Demand has dropped steadily since June, with the last 5 weeks (Periods 25-29) showing demand of 27, 16, 12, 11, and 7 units respectively. The current average demand over the last 5 weeks is 14.6 units, but the most recent trend (last 3 weeks) is even lower at 10 units. With 28 units currently on-hand and demand falling toward single digits, no new order is necessary. To prevent the OR backend from ordering against this low inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3-period window (N=3) to reflect this 'end-of-season' floor. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor reached: Since August 12 (P27), demand has stabilized at <15 units (averaging 10 units over P27-P29).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Strap top) is in an end-of-season demand floor. Since Period 27 (August 12), demand has consistently remained below 15 units, with the most recent three weeks (P28-P30) averaging 8 units (11, 7, 6). Current on-hand inventory is 22 units, which is sufficient to cover nearly 3 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has historically been 0, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P27-P30) to reflect this low-demand state and avoid over-ordering as the season concludes. The OR backend will see that on-hand (22) exceeds the calculated base stock for this low-demand regime, resulting in zero units ordered this period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top/Womens Everyday Basic', which shows a strong seasonal pattern. Demand peaked in the spring/summer (Periods 8-17) and has been steadily declining as autumn approaches. In the most recent four periods (P28-P31), demand has dropped to 11, 7, 6, and 4 units respectively, confirming an end-of-season floor. The current on-hand inventory of 18 units is sufficient to cover approximately 3-4 weeks of demand at the current average rate (~5-6 units/week). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid holding excess inventory during the off-season, I will continue to let the on-hand inventory deplete. I'm using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent late-season stabilization.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top', a summer seasonal item. We are now in late September (Period 33, September 23), and demand has predictably reached a seasonal floor. For the last 6 periods (P27-P32), demand has been: 12, 11, 7, 6, 4, 3. The average for this most recent regime (N=6) is approximately 7.17 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 15 units, which is already sufficient to cover approximately two weeks of current-level demand without any new ordering. Given the declining trend (down to 3 units last period), maintaining a lean inventory is prioritized to minimize holding costs as the season ends. I will set L=0, mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this low-demand state, and use the recent standard deviation to set sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand decline confirmed: Demand has dropped consecutively for the last 6 weeks (P27-P32), reaching a floor of 3 units, confirming the product is exiting its primary sales window.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (a jersey strap top) is at the extreme end of its seasonal lifecycle, entering October. Demand has declined monotonically for seven consecutive periods, reaching a floor of 3 units per week in Periods 32 and 33. Current on-hand inventory is 12 units, which covers 4 weeks of demand at the current rate (3 units/period). Given the high holding cost relative to the low end-of-season demand, and a lead time of 0, there is no immediate need to order additional stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the tail-end decline (Periods 27-33) and ensure the OR backend sees the correct low-demand regime, preventing over-ordering while maintaining a high service level for the remaining few customers.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Strap top/Womens Everyday Basics) is in a clear end-of-season decline. Demand has consistently stayed below 10 units since Period 29 (August 26) and has been 7 units or less for the last 5 weeks. Period 34 saw a slight uptick to 7 units from 3, but the overall trend is very low. With 6 units on hand and 0 in-transit, I will target a small base stock to cover this low-demand floor while minimizing holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use the last 5 weeks (Period 30-34) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the current 'off-season' stability better than the full history or the summer peak.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Strap top/Womens Everyday Basics) is in a definitive end-of-season low-demand regime as of mid-October (Period 36). Historical demand has plummeted from a peak of ~250 units in spring/summer to single digits over the last month. Specifically, from Period 30 to Period 35, the weekly demand values are 6, 4, 3, 3, 7, and 3. The average demand over the last 6 weeks (N=6) is 4.33 units with a standard deviation of 1.63. Since the lead time remains stable at 0 periods, I will use recent_N=6 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current low-demand floor, ensuring we hold minimal inventory for this seasonal basic. The on-hand inventory is currently 5 units, which is roughly one week of supply at the current rate.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top/Vest top', which exhibits clear seasonality. The demand peaked in April-June (averaging over 250 units) and has steadily declined through the summer and early autumn. We are now in Period 37 (late October). For the last 5 weeks (Periods 32-36), demand has been extremely low: 3, 3, 7, 3, 5, averaging 4.2 units per period with very low volatility. The current on-hand inventory is 3 units, which is nearly equal to this average. Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level, but we must set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect this 'trough' regime to avoid overstocking a seasonal item that is likely nearing the end of its lifecycle or entering a stable winter baseline. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized demand floor of the last month.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top', a classic summer seasonal item. The current date is October 28 (Period 38), which is well into the off-season for the Northern Hemisphere. Demand history confirms a steep decline from peak summer levels (~250 units) to a stable, very low floor. Over the last 11 periods (P27-P37), demand has averaged 5.0 units with a maximum of 12 and a minimum of 3. In the more recent 5-week window (P33-P37), the average is 4.2 units and the standard deviation is extremely low (~1.8). The realized lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a service level for the few remaining customers, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 11 periods to capture this 'end-of-season floor' regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top/Vest top', which is seasonally relevant for the summer. Demand significantly declined starting in June (Period 18) and has remained at an end-of-season floor since September. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 34-38), demand has averaged 5.2 units (range 3-8). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since the inventory is currently 4 units and the demand is very low but stable, I will use the last 5 periods to estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to avoid overstocking a seasonal item that is clearly in its terminal phase of the year. The backend will calculate base stock based on this recent low-demand regime, ensuring we maintain a small buffer for the occasional customer without incurring high holding costs on dead stock.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season floor solidified: Demand for Periods 34-38 (Oct-Nov) averages 5.2 units, indicating a stable but minimal off-season demand level.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 108775044 (Womens Everyday Basics Strap Top) is currently in its off-season floor regime. Following the high-demand summer peak (April-June), demand plummeted in July and has reached a stable low since September. For the most recent six periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 5.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 2.1 units. The previous carry-over insight from Period 39 correctly identifies this 'end-of-season floor'. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this low-volume period, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture the current stable off-season demand mean and variance. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current ~5 unit/week demand rather than being skewed by historical summer peaks.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (women's strap top) is in a stable off-season demand regime. Current date is November 18, 2019. Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), demand has consistently averaged 4.86 units (range: 3 to 8). On-hand inventory is 5 units, which is approximately one week's worth of demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain optimal inventory levels during this off-season floor without incurring excessive holding costs, I am using a recent_N approach with N=7 to capture the current stable demand mean and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the minimal current demand rather than the high summer peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top' (Womens Everyday Basics), which is a summer-seasonal item. We are currently in Period 42 (Nov 25), well into the off-season. Demand has stabilized at a minimal 'off-season floor' since Period 34. For the most recent 8 periods (P34-P41), demand has been very low and stable: [7, 3, 5, 3, 8, 4, 4, 3], averaging 4.625 units with a standard deviation of approximately 1.77. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To minimize holding costs while avoiding stockouts on this low-volume floor, I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific off-season regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the ~5 unit weekly demand with a small buffer, appropriate for a high-margin ($19) but low-turnover period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top', a seasonal item that has transitioned from its summer peak (~250 units/week) to a very low off-season floor. Current date is Dec 2, 2019. Over the last 9 periods (P34-P42), demand has averaged 5.3 units. Period 42 saw a slight uptick to 10 units (Black Friday/Cyber Monday week), which depleted the remaining on-hand inventory to 0. Given the off-season context and the small recent increase, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean around 5-6 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since on-hand is 0, the backend will calculate an order based on these parameters to meet the expected minor winter demand while avoiding excess holding costs for a summer item.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Strap top', a summer staple currently in its off-season (December). Demand has been extremely low and stable since October, averaging approximately 5 units per period. In the most recent periods (P39-P43), demand samples were [4, 4, 3, 10, 2], confirming this low-regime floor despite a minor outlier in P42. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. With 9 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~5, the current inventory level is sufficient for the immediate period, but slightly more is needed to maintain the target service level given the profit margin ($19) vs holding cost ($1). I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods (P38-P43) to capture the current off-season mean (~5 units) and variance, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers this minimal demand without overstocking as we approach the end of the game (Period 47).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Strap top/Vest top', which is seasonally relevant for summer but currently in a deep off-season (December). Demand has been consistently low for the past 11 periods (Periods 34-44), averaging approximately 4.8 units per week. Although there were slight fluctuations (e.g., a demand of 10 in Period 42 followed by 2 in Period 43), the overall trend is stable and minimal. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the high profit ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred, but excessive inventory must be avoided as the game nears its end (Period 47). I will use a recent window (N=11) to capture the current off-season mean and volatility while ignoring the summer peak data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Jersey top with narrow shoulder straps', currently in the deep off-season (Late December). Historical data for this period (Periods 39-45) shows demand is consistently low, with an average of approximately 4.7 units per week (4, 4, 3, 10, 2, 4, 7). Lead time has remained stable at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 2 units and a promised lead time of 0, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current stable off-season demand regime. This will set the base stock to cover the immediate period's demand without overstocking during this low-demand phase. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high (19:1), supporting a high service level, but the low absolute demand values mean the OR backend will keep orders small to minimize holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey top', which currently sits in its deep off-season floor. Period 47 (Dec 30) follows a slight uptick in demand during the holiday weeks (Periods 42-46 averaged 6.8 units), likely due to year-end gifting or travel, compared to the Oct-Nov average of 5.2. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 46. To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 38-46) to capture the stable off-season baseline while accounting for the recent minor holiday variance. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=9) to ensure the service level covers the recent fluctuations (std dev of ~3 units) without overstocking as we enter January.
