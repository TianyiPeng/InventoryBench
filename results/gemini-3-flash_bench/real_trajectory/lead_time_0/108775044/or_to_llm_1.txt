Lead time: History confirms lead_time = 0 periods (same-period arrival). This means an order placed now arriving during Period 4 must cover demand for Period 4. Inventory: On-hand is 85. In-transit is 0. OR Recommendation: 139 units. The OR mean demand (based on samples + P1-P3) is approximately (162+142+115+133+118+157+244+175)/8 = 156. However, demand spiked significantly in Period 2 (244). Given that this is a seasonal basic and we are moving into Spring, the OR recommendation of 139 units (which builds a base stock of roughly 224 including the on-hand 85) seems slightly conservative if demand hits P2 levels again.

Inventory & OR Analysis: The OR recommendation is 153 units based on historical averages. However, current on-hand is only 59.
