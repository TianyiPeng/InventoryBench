Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 574109012 (fine rib knit fitted top). Promised lead time is 0. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend lately (from 15 to 198, then settling around 60-68). The 198 spike on 2019-01-21 might be an outlier or a specific promotion. The most recent two weeks (60, 68) suggest a new mean around 64. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent behavior while including the spike's weight partially. Since the on-hand is 0, we need to establish a base stock immediately to meet demand occurring this period. L is set to default (0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'fitted top in a fine rib knit', which in Feb-March remains relevant for late-winter/early-spring fashion. Historical demand for the last few weeks has been: Jan-21 (198), Jan-28 (60), Feb-04 (68), and most recently Feb-11 (53). The spike on Jan-21 appears to be an outlier or a specific promotion, while the more recent demand has stabilized around ~60 units. Based on observed history from the 'Period 1 conclude' message, the actual lead time is 0 (order placed in P1 arrived in P1). For Period 2, on-hand is 184. Using a conservative recent average of the last 4 periods (excluding the Jan-21 outlier which is uncharacteristic of the current trend), the mean demand is roughly 60. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 samples (N=4) to capture this recent stability. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current lower volatility compared to the full history which includes the 198 spike.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th. We represent the 'Rachel LS TVP', a fitted rib-knit sweater from the Divided collection. Demand has shown a steady upward trend over the last 5 samples: 50, 198 (likely a spike/outlier), 60, 68, 53, and 80. The promised lead time of 0 is currently stable, as confirmed by arrivals in Period 1 and 2. Given we are in late February, demand for lightweight knitwear/fitted tops typically increases as consumers transition into spring styles. The recent demand jump from 53 to 80 suggests a possible regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture this recent behavior while smoothing the Period 1 spike. I will maintain L=0 as it is functioning as intended.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a fine rib knit fitted top (sweater/knitwear). Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: Jan samples 15, 50, 198 (outlier?), 60, 68 followed by observed game periods P1-P3 of 53, 80, and 88. The demand is clearly increasing as we move into the spring season, likely due to the product being a lightweight 'fine rib knit' suitable for transitional weather. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent growth (averaging ~74 units per period) and ensure the base stock covers (L+1) demand. For sigma, I will use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will calculate the order based on these parameters to maintain a high service level given the high profit/holding cost ratio ($19/$1).

Carry-over insight: Demand is trending upward from late Feb into early March (P1:53, P2:80, P3:88); Actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods for P1-P3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a fine rib-knit fitted top, which typically sees sustained demand during the spring transition. Historical demand patterns (P1:53, P2:80, P3:88, P4:75) show an upward trend followed by a slight stabilization. The carry-over insight confirms a lead time of 0 periods, which is consistent across all four concluded periods (P1-P4). Although the promised lead time is 0, on-hand inventory has dropped significantly to 29 units. To prevent stockouts during this seasonal window, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the higher demand levels seen since late February (averaging 81 units per week). I will use a conservative sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods to account for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1234.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. Demand for the product (a fitted knit top) showed a ramp-up from February into early March (Weeks 1-3), but has stabilized around 70 units over the last two periods (P4: 75, P5: 67). Historical data from Jan 2019 suggests a temporary spike in mid-January, which has since passed. Looking at the last 5 periods (P1-P5), the average demand is 72.6 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 39 units and no in-transit stock, we need to order to maintain a service level consistent with a high profit margin ($19.0) vs. low holding cost ($1.0). I will use a 5-period average for demand and volatility to capture the recent stabilization while acknowledging the upward trend from the start of February.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: After an early-season rise, demand has averaged ~72 units over P4-P5. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. The product is a lightweight sweater (long sleeve fine rib knit). Based on the calendar, we are in the early spring season. Historically, demand peaked in late January (198 units) and has since stabilized. In the game history (P1-P6), demand rose from 53 to 88 and then tapered off recently (75, 67, 51). The average demand over the last 3 periods is 64.3 units, compared to the earlier growth phase. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the most recent 3 periods (P4-P6) show a decline/stabilization relative to the early March peak, I will use a recent_N window of 4 to capture the current post-peak level while maintaining a buffer. The inventory on-hand (44) is slightly below one week's expected demand (~64), so the OR backend should trigger a restock order to reach the base stock level calculated for L=0.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand shows a peak in late January (198 units) followed by a gradual decline and stabilization throughout February and March. The most recent three periods (P5, P6, P7) show demand of 67, 51, and 32 units respectively, indicating a downward trend as we move further into Spring for this long-sleeve knit top. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (holding cost is $1.0 vs $19.0 profit) while demand is cooling, I will set mu_hat using a recent window of 3 periods to capture this downward momentum (averaging ~50 units). Sigma_hat will also use a recent window of 3 periods to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the initial high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: Post-winter stabilization followed by a spring decline (P5-P7 avg: 50 units, compared to P1-P4 avg: 74).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/04/08). The SKU is a 'Rachel LS TVP' sweater/knitwear. Looking at the demand history, there is a clear downward trend as we move further into spring: P4(75), P5(67), P6(51), P7(32), P8(20). This aligns with the seasonal nature of sweaters. The carry-over insights previously noted a regime shift starting at P8, but looking at the last 3 periods (P6-P8), the average demand is only 34.33 units, compared to the overall history. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods consistently. Since demand is rapidly declining, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent, significantly lower demand levels and avoid overstocking a seasonal item. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the current reduced volatility in this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand decline confirmed: Average demand dropped from 74 (P1-P4) to 34 (P6-P8), a decrease of ~54%, as the climate warms into April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the demand for this long-sleeved 'Knitwear' sweater continues its seasonal decline as spring progresses. Recent demand over the last three periods (P7-P9) has been 32, 20, and 17, averaging approximately 23 units per week. This is a significant drop from the early-period peak. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs for a seasonal item at the end of its peak, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods of data (P6-P9) to capture the current lower-demand regime. This provides a balance between the slightly higher demand in P6 (51) and the very low recent figures, ensuring the OR backend targets a lower base stock appropriate for the warming weather.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Rachel LS TVP' is a knit sweater, which is seeing a clear seasonal decline as we move into late April. Demand has dropped consistently from a peak in early March (mean of ~74 units) to a very low level recently (mean of ~17 units over P8-P10). Current on-hand inventory is 43 units, which is more than double the recent average weekly demand. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs for a seasonal item at the end of its peak, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P8-P10) to reflect the current low-demand regime, while using the 'calculate' method for lead time to maintain the 0-period expectation.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a fine rib knit sweater, which is highly seasonal and currently in a deep decline as we enter late April (Spring/Summer transition). Historical demand from P1 to P11 shows a clear downward trend: starting from peaks of 80-88 in late February, demand has dropped consistently to 13-17 in the last two periods. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P9-P11) is 15.67 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded shipments. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19), the OR backend will target a high service level, but we must lower mu_hat to avoid excess inventory during this off-season phase. I will use a recent window of N=4 (covering the April period) to capture the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a floor in April: P9-P11 demand has stabilized at a low level (avg ~16 units) compared to the March average (avg ~56 units), confirming the end of the peak sweater season.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/06. The SKU is a long-sleeved 'Rachel LS TVP' sweater, which is transitioning into a low-demand phase as spring progresses into summer. Demand reached a floor in April (averaging ~18 units over P9-P12). Although demand showed a slight uptick in the last two periods (17 and 25 units), this is still far below the February/March peak. I will use a short window (recent_N where N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low floor while accounting for the recent slight variance, ensuring we don't overstock as holding costs would erode profits on this low-volume period. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. The product is a fine rib knit sweater, which is past its peak winter/early spring season. Demand has significantly decreased since March and appears to have reached a stable floor. In April-May (Periods 9-13), demand has averaged 17.2 units (17, 13, 17, 25, 14). Specifically, the last two periods (P12-P13) showed demand of 25 and 14. Although there was a slight uptick to 25 in P12, the subsequent drop to 14 suggests there is no sustained recovery as summer approaches. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With 15 units currently on-hand and an average demand of ~17 units per period, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this low-demand regime and prevent overstocking of a seasonal item as the weather warms.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a fine rib knit sweater with long sleeves, which is a seasonal item for cooler weather. Historical demand shows a clear peak in February/March (averaging ~74 units) and a steady decline into May, reaching a low floor. Recent demand over the last 4 periods (P11-P14) has averaged 15.75 units (17, 25, 14, 7), with a notable drop to single digits in the most recent period as late spring/summer sets in. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game. Given the transition into warmer summer months, demand is expected to remain at this low structural floor. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain L=0 to ensure the backend bases inventory on immediate local demand without inflating for non-existent lead time delays.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved 'Rachel LS TVP' sweater, which is a seasonal item. As we progress deeper into the warmer months (May/June), demand has reached its seasonal floor. Over the last four periods (P12-P15), demand has been 25, 14, 7, and 6, averaging 13 units. However, the most recent values (7 and 6) show that demand is continuing to dwindle as summer approaches. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 23 units, we already cover almost four times the most recent week's demand. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this low-demand regime for mu_hat (avg ~13) and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory remains lean to minimize holding costs while the item phases out of its primary season.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a theoretical floor in late May: P14-P15 demand (avg 6.5) is now significantly lower than the P9-P11 stabilization point (avg 16), indicating a secondary seasonal drop as temperatures rise further.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved 'Knitwear/Sweater' item, which has experienced a significant seasonal decline as summer approaches. Demand in the most recent regime (P14-P16) is very low, averaging 5.67 units per week (7, 6, 4). Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. With 24 units currently on-hand and demand continuing to taper off, our current inventory is sufficient for roughly 4 weeks of sales. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the recent_N method (N=3) to reflect this lowest demand floor, as using a longer window would overestimate needs for a summer sweater. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the low volatility of this late-season demand. The OR backend will likely place a small or zero order to avoid excessive holding costs on a low-moving seasonal item.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10, well into the summer season for a long-sleeved 'fine rib knit' sweater. Demand has significantly decreased from its peak in Feb/March (~70-80 units) to a very low stabilization point in May/June. Over the last 4 periods (P14-P17), demand has been 7, 6, 4, and 6, averaging 5.75 units per week. This aligns with the 'secondary seasonal drop' noted in the Carry-Over Insights. On-hand inventory is currently 18 units, which is approximately 3 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this low-demand summer trough, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on high spring history. L is set to 'calculate' to continue leveraging the demonstrated 0-period lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '574109012' is a long-sleeved sweater, which is currently in its off-peak summer season (June 17). Historical demand since mid-May (P14-P18) has been extremely low and stable, with values of 7, 6, 4, 6, and 4 (averaging 5.4 units per period). Currently, on-hand inventory is 14 units with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods (as confirmed by the history), the base stock calculation targets (1+L) periods of demand. With a target service level of 95% (Profit=$19, Holding=$1), the current stock of 14 units is sufficient to cover nearly three periods of the current demand regime (14 / 5.4 \u2248 2.6). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this low-demand summer floor. This should prevent unnecessary ordering while maintaining a small safety buffer against the low volatility observed.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved fitted sweater (Rachel LS TVP), which is strongly seasonal for cold weather. We are currently in Period 20 (late June), which is the peak of summer in the northern hemisphere. Historical demand has consistently declined from its peak in Feb/March (~80 units) to a current low-volume floor. Over the last four periods (P16-P19), demand has been very low: 4, 6, 4, 2 (average 4.0). This confirms the 'secondary seasonal drop' noted in Period 16. On-hand inventory is currently 12 units, which is roughly 3 periods of supply at the current run rate. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid unnecessary holding costs for a low-demand seasonal item during its off-season, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect this summer floor (~4 units per period). Sigma_hat will also be adjusted using recent_N to reflect the reduced volatility at these low levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a summer floor in June: P16-P19 demand has averaged 4.0 units, down from the previous stabilization of ~6.5 units in May, reflecting minimal off-season interest in long-sleeved knitwear.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved rib-knit sweater, which is reaching its seasonal minimum in July (Summer). Demand has dwindled significantly, with the most recent Period 20 recording 0 units and the last 5 periods (P16-P20) averaging 3.2 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 12 units, which is more than sufficient to cover approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the $1.0 holding cost per unit and the extremely low demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (P16-P20) to reflect this summer floor. This should prevent the OR engine from triggering unnecessary orders while on-hand inventory is depleted towards a level more appropriate for the off-season.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is a fine rib knit long-sleeve sweater, which is currently in its deepest off-season (summer). Recent demand (P18-P21) has been minimal: 4, 2, 0, and 1 units respectively, confirming the summer floor previously identified. The average demand over the last 4 periods is 1.75 units. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (the last 10 orders with arrivals all had L=0, or no orders were placed). On-hand inventory is currently 11 units, which is significantly more than the current weekly demand, providing over 6 weeks of coverage at the summer rate. No new order is needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (P16-P21) to capture this low-demand regime, and L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019 (Period 23). This SKU is a long-sleeved sweater, currently in the depths of the summer off-season. Demand has been extremely low and stable for several weeks, with the last 7 periods (P16-P22) showing demand values of 4, 6, 4, 2, 0, 1, and 2, averaging 2.7 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. With 9 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, our current stock covers approximately 3 weeks of the current extreme-low demand regime. Since L=0, the OR backend's target base stock (calculated as mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) will be compared against (on-hand + in-transit). Given the seasonal nadir, I will use recent_N (N=7) for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this summer floor while maintaining a small buffer for any minor fluctuations. Setting L to calculate to maintain the 0-period lead time assumption.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019, which is the peak of the summer season. The SKU is a 'Rachel LS TVP', described as a long-sleeve knitwear sweater. Demand has been extremely low throughout June and July, averaging just 1.25 units per period over the last 8 periods (P16-P23: 4, 6, 4, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0). The 'summer floor' remains consistent with off-season sweater demand. On-hand inventory is 9 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 7 periods of current demand without ordering. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. To prevent unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this low-volume period, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 8 periods of summer demand. L remains at the promised lead time of 0.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, which is the height of summer for this long-sleeved 'Rachel LS TVP' knitwear product. Demand has consistently remained at a summer floor for the last several weeks (P20-P24 demand: 0, 1, 2, 0, 1). The average demand over the last 5 periods is 0.8 units per week. With an on-hand inventory of 8 units, we already have approximately 10 weeks of stock at current consumption rates. The OR backend needs parameters that reflect this extremely low, stable demand state to avoid unnecessary ordering and minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this most recent 'summer floor' regime (Period 20-24). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on all previous arrivals.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. We are in the extreme off-season for a long-sleeved rib-knit sweater. Demand has been consistently low throughout June and July, averaging roughly 1-2 units per period, with a slight uptick to 6 units in Period 25. Historical data from early 2019 shows that demand doesn't start to ramp up significantly until mid-February (50+ units). We currently have 2 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~95%). However, because we are still in August, there is no immediate seasonal trigger for a major inventory build-up. I will use a recent demand window of N=6 (Periods 20-25) to capture the current 'summer floor' which averages 1.67 units. This ensures we maintain just enough stock to satisfy the current trickling demand without incurring excessive holding costs before the autumn transition.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are entering the late-summer period where demand for long-sleeve knitwear (sweaters) historically begins to recover as retailers prepare for the fall season. Period 26 showed a significant demand spike to 21 units, up from the summer floor of ~2.5 units (P20-P25 average). We stocked out in Period 26 (sold 6 against demand of 21), leaving 0 on-hand. Given the product type and the timing, this represents the start of the 'Back-to-School' or early fall demand regime. Using N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat would be misleading due to the sudden jump from a floor to a spike; instead, I will use an explicit forecast to capture the transition. I estimate the new demand mean at approximately 25 units per period to ensure we recover from the stockout and meet the rising seasonal interest while keeping Lead Time at 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Summer floor (avg ~2.5 units) has ended; early fall recovery detected with demand jumping to 21 units (8.4x increase).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 574109012 (long-sleeved knitwear) has transitioned from its summer floor (avg ~2.5 units) into a significant fall recovery. Period 26 saw demand jump to 21 units and Period 27 saw a further increase to 32 units. This aligns with the seasonal shift towards autumn in late August. Inventory is currently low (7 units on-hand) following a stockout in Period 26. To capture the rising demand trend, I'm switching to a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the transition from low-demand Period 25 (6 units) to the recent high-demand periods (21 and 32 units). This will provide a more responsive base stock for the OR engine. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this regime shift. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall recovery confirmed: Demand increased from summer floor (~2.5 units) to 21 (P26) and 32 (P27), indicating the start of the autumn peak season for knitwear.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 574109012 (long-sleeved knitwear) is experiencing a sharp seasonal recovery as we enter late August/early September (autumn season). Demand has surged from a summer floor of ~2.5 units to 21 (P26), 32 (P27), and 42 (P28), showing a clear upward trend. The inventory is currently at 0 on-hand with 0 in-transit, following a stockout in Period 28 where demand exactly met or exceeded available supply (sold 42, ended with 0). To capture the current growth and avoid further stockouts during this recovery phase, I am selecting a recent_N approach for mu_hat focusing on the last 3 periods (P26-P28), which captures the new fall regime (average ~31.7 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all recent history (P26-P28 arrived same-period). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility associated with the demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Fall recovery accelerating: demand increased to 42 units in P28, confirming a sustained upward trajectory (P26: 21, P27: 32, P28: 42).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Rachel LS TVP' (a knitwear sweater) is in a clear seasonal upswing as we enter September (Period 30, 2019/9/2). Recent demand figures (P26-P29: 21, 32, 42, 37) confirm a fall recovery with an average of approximately 33 units. Comparing this to the previous spring/summer periods, the demand is scaling rapidly towards the levels seen in late February/early March (P1-P4 avg: ~74). The slight dip from 42 to 37 in the most recent period is interpreted as noise within a general growth trend. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current momentum and prevent stockouts during this accelerating 'back-to-school' and autumn phase, I will use recent_N with N=4 to anchor mu_hat on the autumn recovery trend, and use a recent_N sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility associated with the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Fall recovery stabilized at a higher level: Demand over the last 4 periods (P26-P29) has averaged 33 units, representing a 13x increase from the summer floor of ~2.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $912.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Rachel LS TVP knitwear SKU has experienced a massive spike in Period 30 (Date: 2019/9/2), reaching 123 units. This is a significant jump from the previous 4-period average of 33 units and aligns with the transition into September, a peak period for long-sleeved knitwear and sweaters as the 'back to school' and autumn season begins. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we completely stocked out in Period 30, losing substantial potential sales. Based on the historical spring peak (P3 demand was 88), and the accelerating momentum (P26: 21, P27: 32, P28: 42, P29: 37, P30: 123), I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture this rapid growth without over-relying on the single massive spike of 123, while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the increased scale and volatility of the new autumn regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn peak confirmed: Demand spiked to 123 units in Period 30 (early September), far exceeding the initial fall recovery average of 33 units. This confirms a high-volume seasonal regime for knitwear.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2261.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'Rachel LS TVP' (Knitwear sweater) is currently experiencing its sharpest seasonal demand surge as of September 16, 2019. In Period 30 and 31, demand reached 123 and 139 units respectively, leading to stockouts despite increased ordering. This confirms the 'Sustained autumn peak' noted in carry-over insights. Total on-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in transit. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this stability. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I am using an 'explicit' value of 145 (since L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*145). This value targets slightly above the most recent demand (139) to prevent further stockouts during this accelerating peak. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the high volatility seen in the last three weeks (37, 123, 139) to allow the OR backend to set a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak acceleration: Demand in early September (P30-P31) has averaged 131 units, a 4x increase from the late August recovery average (~33 units).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak autumn season (late September). Demand has transitioned from a summer floor (~2.5 units) to an initial recovery (avg ~33) and has now surged to a high-volume regime (P30: 123, P31: 139, P32: 121). The average of these last 3 high-volume periods is ~128 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With 115 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to ensure the base stock levels reflect this new high-demand regime to avoid the stockouts seen in P30 and P31. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current peak intensity while acknowledging the slight cooling from the extreme spike in P31.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak volume confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a high level for 3 consecutive periods (P30-P32), averaging 128 units, compared to the initial recovery average of 33 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 574109012 (knitwear sweater) is currently in its peak autumn seasonal regime. Demand has been extremely high and volatile throughout September (P30: 123, P31: 139, P32: 121, P33: 216). We just ran out of stock in P33 despite a starting inventory of 144 units, indicating the need for a significantly higher base stock. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture the current high-demand momentum and minimize lost sales during this critical window where profit ($19) far outweighs holding cost ($1), I will use an explicit forecast for demand (mu_hat). Calculating the average of the last 4 periods (P30-P33) gives a mean of 149.75 units. Given the jump to 216 units in the most recent period, I will set mu_hat to 160 (covering 1+L = 1 period) to account for the current upward trajectory. I will use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in this peak stage.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified in late September: Demand reached 216 in P33, a 69% increase over the P30-P32 average (128 units).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this long-sleeved knitwear remains in its high-volume autumn peak. Recent demand values exhibit significant volatility but maintain a high average: P31: 139, P32: 121, P33: 216, P34: 139. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P31-P34) is 153.75 units. Despite the high demand in P33 (216), the P34 demand returned to 139, suggesting that while the trend is strong, it may be stabilizing at a new high plateau rather than continuing to accelerate at a parabolic rate. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (the P34 order arrived immediately). I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this established peak volume while allowing the OR backend to handle the current volatility through sigma_hat, also calculated over the recent high-volume regime (N=5 to include the P30 spike). This ensures we maintain high service levels during the peak sweater season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak stabilization: Demand over P31-P34 has averaged 154 units, confirming a sustained high-volume regime approximately 4.5x higher than the initial fall recovery (avg 33).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-October autumn peak for 'Rachel LS TVP', a long-sleeved knitwear item. Demand has been high but volatile over the last few weeks (P33: 216, P34: 139, P35: 104). The average demand over the last four periods (P32-P35) is 145 units. Although there is a slight downward trend from the peak of 216, the product is highly seasonal and we must maintain sufficient stock to avoid the stockouts seen in P30, P31, and P33. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Since the Profit ($19) is significantly higher than the Holding Cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (q \u2248 0.95). I will set mu_hat using the recent 4-period average (N=4) to capture the current high-volume autumn regime while acknowledging the recent stabilization/slight decline from the late September peak. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the significant volatility observed during this peak season.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a fine rib knit sweater, which is currently in its autumn peak season (October). Demand peaked in late September (P33: 216 units) and has since stabilized at a slightly lower but still high volume. Over the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has averaged 111.0 units (139, 104, 90), showing a gradual deceleration from the late September high. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking as we move further into late October while maintaining a high service level for this profitable item, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this recent stabilization/slight decline. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect current volatility. This approach balances the need to cover immediate demand while acknowledging that the absolute peak may have passed.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak stabilization: Demand has averaged 111 units over P34-P36, reflecting a slight deceleration from the late September peak of 216 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 574109012 (Knitwear Sweater) is currently in its peak autumn/winter season. Demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P34-P37) following the late September spike. Recent demands are: P34: 139, P35: 104, P36: 90, and P37: 89, averaging approximately 105.5 units per period. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all recent concluding periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 64 units, which is below the expected weekly demand of ~105. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 to capture this stabilization around the 105-unit level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to capture the current volatility in this high-demand regime. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the anticipated demand of the next period with a buffer for variance, minimizing stockouts during the peak season while respecting the low lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak stabilization confirmed: Demand has averaged 105.5 units over P34-P37, showing a consistent level after the late September surge.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for this knitwear SKU has stabilized into a late-autumn regime after the late-September peak. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has been 139, 104, 90, 89, and 93, averaging 103 units per week. This indicates a consistent, high-volume baseline (approx. 100 units/week) as we move deeper into the cold season. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on the most recent 'conclude' messages. To maintain a high service level for this profitable item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stabilized autumn volume while ignoring the earlier September surge and the summer floors. This provides a forecast of ~103 units per period with appropriate variance protection for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization confirmed: Period 34-38 demand has averaged 103 units/week, establishing a high-volume cold-season baseline following the late-September peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, moving further into the peak cold-weather season for knitwear. Demand in Period 39 was 63 units, which is a decrease from the previous average of 103 units (P34-P38). Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 96.3 units with a standard deviation of ~25. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while adapting to the recent slight dip in demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current stabilized autumn/winter regime. mu_hat will be (1+0)*96.3 and sigma_hat will be sqrt(1+0)*std(P34-P39). L is set to 'default' as 0-period lead time is reliably confirmed.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the late autumn/pre-winter season for knitwear. Demand has shown a clear decelerating trend from the late September peak of 216 units down to 56 units in Period 40. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P38-P40) is 70.6 units, compared to the previous stabilization mean of ~103 (P34-P38). This suggests we have entered a late-season regime where demand is lower but likely to remain steady as winter arrives. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this most recent downward shift to ~71 units per week. I'll use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to capture the volatility seen throughout the high-volume fall season, ensuring the safety stock is sufficient for potential cold-weather spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 41: Late autumn deceleration confirmed. Average demand has decreased from ~103 units (P34-P38) to ~71 units (P38-P40), a 31% reduction.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand is in a cooling phase as we move deeper into late autumn, following the peak sweater season from September/October. The recent demand regime (P38-P41) has been 93, 63, 56, and 45 units respectively, clear evidence of a downward trend. Since P38, demand has averaged 64.25 units, significantly lower than the previous ~103 unit/week baseline. This indicates a seasonal shift as consumers potentially pivot away from basic knitwear or towards holiday-specific items. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this decline while maintaining a 95% service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent cooling trend (avg 64.25) rather than the long-term autumn average. L will remain at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Average demand has decreased for four consecutive periods (P38-P41: 93, 63, 56, 45), averaging 64 units compared to the early autumn baseline of 103 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1881.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand spiked significantly to 168 units, which is a major outlier compared to the previous four-period cooling trend (where demand averaged 64 units). This spike coincides with the date 2019/11/25, which corresponds to the Black Friday / Cyber Monday retail window. Given this is a sweater/knitwear SKU, such a spike is likely a temporary seasonal promotion rather than a return to the high-volume September regime (~150 units). However, the spike resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and prepare for early December demand (which historically remains moderate), I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to balance the recent cooling trend with the massive promotional spike. This provides a mu_hat calculation based on (45+56+63+93+168)/5 = 85 units per period. Since L=0, the target base stock will be roughly 85 plus safety stock, ensuring we replenish inventory lost during the stockout while remaining cautious about post-promotion demand drops.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday seasonal spike confirmed at Period 42: Demand jumped to 168 units (2.6x the previous 4-week average of 64), following a late-autumn cooling trend.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 follows the Black Friday boost (P42: 168 units) and the Cyber Monday week (P43: 65 units). Demand has cooled significantly from the peak of 168, but we are entering the mid-December period (pre-Christmas) where knitwear typically sees a secondary, smaller surge or at least stabilization before the holiday. The P43 demand of 65 units is consistent with the late-autumn cooling trend (P41: 45) being temporarily interrupted by seasonal promos. I expect demand for the next two weeks to settle between the late-autumn floor (~50) and the early-autumn baseline (~70). Using recent_N with N=6 captures the mix of the recent spike and the underlying cooling trend. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. The current on-hand of 102 units provides a safety buffer while the OR backend calculates the next order based on these adjusted parameters.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand stabilization: Period 43 demand (65 units) confirms a return to the late-autumn cooling trend baseline after the P42 promo spike.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has returned to its late-autumn cooling trend after the Black Friday spike (P42: 168). The post-spike demand over P43-P44 has averaged 55.5 units (65 and 46 respectively). This matches the pre-spike cooling trend observed between P39-P41 (avg ~55 units). Historically, at the start of the simulation in February, demand was around 50-80 units, suggesting that as winter progresses, interest in this 'Rachel LS TVP' knitwear remains steady but significantly lower than the September/October peaks. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P42-P44) which includes the spike and the subsequent correction, or better, use an explicit forecast to refine the expected baseline. Given P43 (65) and P44 (46), a mean of ~55 is appropriate for the current regime. With an on-hand inventory of 110, we are currently covered for about 2 periods of demand, so the OR engine should naturally target a replenishment that maintains a safety buffer without excessive holding costs as we head toward the end of the game (P47).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd (Period 46), which is the peak holiday shopping week. Historical data shows demand has been somewhat volatile recently: 168 (Black Friday), 65 (Post-BF), 46, and 85 in the most recent period (P45). The jump from 46 to 85 in mid-December suggests a pre-Christmas sales lift. Given the product is a fitted long-sleeve knit top, it is highly relevant for winter gifting and attire. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I expect demand for this final week of the year to remain elevated compared to the late-autumn baseline (approx. 50-60 reflecting P40-P44 cooling) but potentially slightly lower than the immediate pre-holiday peak as post-Christmas slowdown usually begins shortly after. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (averaging P43-P45: 65, 46, 85 \u2248 65.3) to capture the current late-season levels while tempering the spike. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the high recent volatility (standard deviation of ~20).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand lift confirmed: Demand increased from 46 (P44) to 85 (P45) in mid-December, indicating secondary peak activity before Christmas.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the transition from Christmas/New Year peak into the post-holiday January period. Historical data from early 2019 (P1-P3) shows demand starting around 53-88 units. Recent demand (P45-P46) was 85-93 units, indicating a sustained holiday lift. However, a significant drop is expected as we enter January, mirroring the lower levels observed at the start of the previous year. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the expected post-holiday slump while maintaining a buffer for the remaining winter demand, I will use a recent_N window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current high baseline (avg ~72) while the OR backend's high service level target (based on the 19:1 profit-to-holding ratio) will provide protection. Total demand for P43-P46 was 65, 46, 85, 93 (avg 72.25).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition detected at Period 47: Demand remains high (avg 89 units over P45-P46) compared to the late-autumn baseline (~64 units), but is expected to decline into January based on previous year patterns.
