Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 658030011 (Ladies Denim Trousers). Total historical samples provided: 5 (83, 67, 107, 53, 116). Calculated mean = 85.2, std \u2248 25.8. Since promised lead time is 0, we expect immediate arrival, but we should prepare for the current period's demand (Period 1 resolution occurs after our decision). Given the product is 'Ladies Denim' and we are in mid-February, we should watch for seasonal shifts as spring approaches, though current demand seems stable around the mean. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat which will use all available historical data to establish a baseline. Lead time is set to default (0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Push Up Jeggings' (Ladies Denim). Historical demand samples show values: 83, 67, 107, 53, 116. In Period 1, observed demand was 136, which is higher than any historical sample. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time=0), confirming the metric. However, we stock-outed in Period 1 (demand 136 vs on-hand 129). The demand trend seems to be increasing relative to the early 2019 samples (mean of first 5 samples ~85, Period 1 demand 136). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat to capture this recent higher demand while weighting against historical variance. For sigma, I'll use all samples to ensure enough safety stock for the high volatility shown (range 53 to 136).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 658030011 is a 'Push Up Jegging' which is a year-round staple but often experiences slightly higher demand in early spring. In Period 1, we experienced a stockout (136 demand, 129 sold). Period 2 saw a demand of 103. Combined with the pre-game samples (83, 67, 107, 53, 116), the recent demand (136, 103) indicates a shift towards a higher mean. The last 4 observations (107, 116, 136, 103) average 115.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promise. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture this higher demand regime while maintaining a standard volatility estimate to ensure the OR engine provides a safe buffer above the mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting late Jan/early Feb 2019: Average demand increased from ~75 to ~115 (+50%) based on last 4 observations.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The item is a 'Ladies Denim Jegging'. Historical demand data shows a regime shift captured in carry-over insights: initial demand (Jan) averaged ~77, but the last 5 observations (Feb-early March: 116, 136, 103, 96) average ~113. This represents a sustained increase as we enter the spring fashion season. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (ordered and arrived same period), matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 54 units, with no units in transit. To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical ratio ~0.95), I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=4 to capture the current higher Feb/March mean while ignoring the lower Jan levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for volatility (sigma_hat) to capture recent variability without the noise of the older regime.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is 'Push Up Jeggings'. The demand history shows a spike in Period 1 (136) followed by a stabilization between 84 and 103 in the last three periods. The earlier insight about a permanent shift to 115+ is currently not supported by the most recent 3 weeks (avg ~94). However, early March typically sees the start of spring fashion demand for denim items. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods consistently. With on-hand inventory at 64 and lead time at 0, the next order will arrive in the same period to meet Period 5's demand. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable-but-elevated level compared to the pre-February baseline, while avoiding the extreme outlier of Period 1. \u03c3\u0302 will also use recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Push Up Jegging L.W' is a denim staple. Since Period 1, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand regime shift noted in Period 3 (averaging ~115) proved to be a short-term peak; demand has since stabilized or slightly declined over the last four periods (103, 96, 84, 88), averaging 92.75. Given this recent downward trend from the early February peak, I will use a shorter window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid overstocking while maintaining enough inventory to satisfy the current steady demand level of ~90 units per week. The backend logic will use a high service level target (95%) because the critical ratio is high (19/(19+1) = 0.95).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. The product is a 'Push Up Jegging', which typically sees steady demand in spring. Demand history shows a shift in late Jan/early Feb (Period 3 carry-over), but recent realized demand (Periods 2-6) has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the initial spike. Specifically, the last 5 periods (Periods 2 to 6) show demand values of 103, 96, 84, 88, and 84, averaging ~91 units. This suggests the earlier estimate of 115 was slightly high. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will adjust mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this stable 'post-spike' regime, ensuring we hold enough safety stock for the skinny leg denim category without excessive holding costs given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower level (~91 units/period) between Period 2 and Period 6 after the early February spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1995.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7 (2019/3/25), there was a significant demand spike to 160 units, which exhausted all on-hand inventory (starting 105, demand 160). This suggests a volatility shift or a month-end/spring seasonal peak for 'Ladies Denim/Jeggings'. The mean demand over the last 7 periods is approximately 107 units, but the most recent 3 periods (88, 84, 160) average 110.6 units, and the standard deviation has increased due to the Period 7 outlier. Given the stockout, I need to adjust the OR parameters to capture this increased demand and volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the mean of the last 5 periods (96, 84, 88, 84, 160, avg=102.4) while allowing for the higher standard deviation of this more recent window to increase the base stock level via sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike confirmed at Period 7 (demand=160, +75% vs previous 3-period average). Possible seasonal peak for spring apparel.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a 'Push Up Jegging' (Spring apparel). In Period 7 (late March), demand spiked to 160 units, which I previously flagged as a potential seasonal peak. However, Period 8 demand returned to 97 units, closer to the historical average for February/March (~91 units). This suggests the Period 7 spike may have been a one-time event or a very volatile start to the spring season. Since lead time has consistently been 0 periods (all orders arrive in the period they are placed), I will maintain L=0. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent volatility (averaging 160 and 97 with earlier data) without overreacting solely to the spike. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to incorporate the high variance from Period 7 into the safety stock calculation, ensuring we are protected against another potential spring demand surge while managing holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Push Up Jegging' shows a significant spike in Period 7 (March 25, 160 units), followed by a return to more typical levels in Periods 8 and 9 (97 and 82 units respectively). This pattern suggests that Period 7 was likely an isolated peak, perhaps related to a specific seasonal launch or spring promotion. The average demand across the last 4 periods (P6-P9) is 105.75 units, which is influenced by the outlier. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. To avoid over-ordering following the normalization of demand, I am using a localized N=4 for mu_hat to capture the recent mean (105.75) while including the volatility from the spike to ensure a safe buffer. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 will correctly weigh the recent increase in variance observed in late March.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. The product is 'Push Up Jeggings', a staple denim item. Following a significant demand spike in Period 7 (160 units), demand has been steadily declining over the last three periods (97, 82, and 51 units respectively). This suggests the spring peak identified in Carry-over Insights has passed, and we are entering a lower demand regime. The average demand of the last three periods is approximately 76.6 units, which is a better reflection of current momentum than the historical mean include the spike. Lead time 0 is consistently confirmed across all 10 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend while providing some cushion for volatility, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on these recent samples to avoid over-ordering as demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand contraction observed: demand dropped from 160 (P7) to 51 (P10), averaging 76.6 over the last 3 periods (-40% vs P1-P7 average).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12 (2019/04/29). Historical lead time calculation from Period 1 to 11 consistently shows lead_time=0 (W = X - Z). Consequently, L is set to 'calculate' to reflect this pattern. Demand analysis shows a clear contraction after the Period 7 peak (160 units). Over the last three cycles (Periods 9, 10, and 11), demand has been 82, 51, and 53 respectively, averaging approximately 62 units. This represents a significant drop from the earlier April/March activity. Given this post-peak stabilization, I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the inventory strategy toward this lower demand regime, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level justified by the $19.0 profit/unit vs $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed (Periods 9-11): Average demand has stabilized at ~62 units/period, a ~40% decrease from the mid-season average.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '658030011' (Low Waist Push Up Jegging) is currently in a post-peak period following a spike in late March. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks: 97, 82, 51, 53, 89) show a mean of ~74.4. The most recent demand (89) indicates a slight recovery or stabilization after two very low weeks. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N (N=5) to capture this post-peak stabilization. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain. Given the inventory level of 31 and the current demand trend, the OR engine needs to re-establish a safety buffer to prevent stockouts like those seen in Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (Periods 8-12): Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~74 units/period compared to the mid-season average of ~100, though with high relative volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13, 2019), the SKU (Push Up Jegging) has moved past its spring peak (late March) and is operating in a post-peak stabilization regime. The demand in Period 13 was 73 units, closely following an average of 71.25 units over the last four periods (P10-P13). This confirms the 'Post-peak demand regime' noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand (37) is relatively low relative to recent demand, necessitating a restock. I will use the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower, post-peak demand level while accounting for the moderate volatility seen lately. This approach balances the high service level (95% target due to high profit-to-holding-cost ratio) without over-ordering during a seasonal decline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1323.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/20. Historical demand analysis shows a stabilization in the 'Post-peak' regime. Over the most recent 6 periods (Periods 9-14), demand has averaged approximately 70 units (82, 51, 53, 89, 73, 71). The standard deviation in this relative steady-state period is approximately 14.7. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 26 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. To maintain a high service level given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend will calculate a base stock based on our provided mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N=6 captures this settled demand regime best, avoiding the noise of the earlier spring peak while covering the current sales velocity. This ensures we order enough to meet expected demand of ~70 units while accounting for the moderate volatility seen since late April.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (Periods 9-14): Demand has fully stabilized at ~70 units/period (average over last 6 periods) with a lower standard deviation (~15) compared to the spring volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a staple denim item (Push Up Jegging). Analysis of the last 7 periods (P9-P15) shows a stable demand regime after the spring peak, with demand values of 82, 51, 53, 89, 73, 71, and 74. The mean for this recent regime is approximately 70.4 units/period with a standard deviation of 14.1. This is significantly lower and less volatile than the mid-spring period (which saw a peak of 160). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 15 concluded periods. To maintain the target service level (~95% based on the $19 profit / $1 holding cost ratio) while avoiding excess inventory as we move into summer, I will use a recent_N of 7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the post-peak stabilization while ignoring the obsolete high-demand outliers from March and April.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a 'Push Up Jegging', a staple denim item. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand has entered a stable regime since early April (Period 10). Over the last 7 periods (P10-P16), demand figures were 51, 53, 89, 73, 71, 74, and 65, resulting in a mean of 68.0 units and a standard deviation of 12.3. This aligns with the 'post-peak' lifestyle demand after the initial spring spike in March. I will use N=7 to capture this stable post-peak regime for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers current demand expectations while the 0-period lead time minimizes inventory holding risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further (Periods 10-16): Mean demand is 68.0 units/period with a standard deviation of 12.3, indicating a consistent summer baseline for this staple item.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a staple item (5-pocket jeggings) which has historical evidence of a spring demand peak (late March) followed by stabilization into the summer. Recent carry-over insights and historical data since mid-April (Period 10) show a consistent demand regime. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P10-P17) show a mean demand of 66.125 units with relatively low volatility. The most recent demand (P17) was 53, following a pattern of slight contraction but within a stable range. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Therefore, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture this stabilized post-peak baseline for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintaining the 'default' lead time (0). This approach balances the stock levels for a high-profit item (95% service level requirement) against the low holding cost, ensuring we meet current summer baseline demand without overstocking.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 (Push Up Jegging) has entered a stable summer demand regime as of mid-June 2019. Initial demand in early 2019 showed a spike (reaching 160 units in P7), but consumption has since settled into a lower, consistent pattern. Over the last three periods (P16-P18), demand was 65, 53, and 55, respectively (mean = 57.7). Looking back at the last 6 periods (P13-P18), the mean demand is 61.8 with moderate volatility (std dev \u2248 9.0). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals. Given the critical 1-period look-ahead requirement (L=0 means we must cover demand for the current period), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods to reflect this stabilized summer baseline while maintaining enough buffer for small fluctuations, as on-hand inventory is currently low (33 units).

Carry-over insight: Summer stabilization regime confirmed (P13-P18): Demand mean has leveled at approximately 62 units/period with significantly reduced volatility compared to the spring peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $679.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 (Ladies Jegging) has settled into a stable summer demand regime. Since Period 13 (late May to mid-June), demand has ranged between 38 and 74 units. The most recent observation (Period 19) showed a drop to 38, bringing the average of the last 7 periods (P13-P19) to ~61 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. To optimize for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx. 95% service level requirement), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this current summer stabilization while being responsive to the slight downward trend observed in the most recent two weeks. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to capture the relatively low volatility of this current regime compared to the spring peak, ensuring we don't carry excess inventory for a peak that has passed.

Carry-over insight: Summer stabilization regime (P13-P19): Demand mean has leveled at approximately 61 units/period (last 7 weeks average) with significantly reduced volatility (standard deviation ~13) compared to the spring peak.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 20: 22 units, Period 19: 38 units) indicates a significant downward trend below the previously established 'summer stabilization' mean of ~61. The current date is July 1st, entering the peak of summer when jeans demand frequently dips. The average demand across the last 4 periods (P17-P20) is 42 units, a substantial drop from the 68 units averaged in the prior regime (P10-P16). To prevent excessive holding costs given the current on-hand inventory of 62 (which already covers nearly 1.5 periods of recent demand), I will shift the \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 calculation to focus on the last 4 periods (N=4). This allows the OR backend to quickly adjust the base stock downward to match this new lower-demand summer trough. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so the 'calculate' method is appropriate for L.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 21: Demand has dropped significantly in late June/early July, with the last 4 periods (P17-P20) averaging 42 units/period compared to the previous summer baseline of 68 (+38% decrease).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ladies Denim Jeggings' has entered a new lower regime since late June (Period 19), with the most recent three periods (P19-P21) averaging 29.3 units/period (38, 22, 28) and the prior four periods (P17-P20) showing a similar downward trend. This confirms the summer contraction first identified in the carry-over insights. To align with this sustained lower demand and avoid excess holding costs (on-hand is currently 40, which exceeds the recent average demand), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5, covering P17-P21) to capture the current mean of ~39 units/period. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by every concluded period in history. sigma_hat is set to the same recent window to reflect the reduced volatility observed during this stabilization phase.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P18-P21): Demand has dropped to a summer low, averaging 35.75 units/period over the last 4 weeks, a ~40% decrease from the early June baseline of ~60 units/period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Push Up Jegging (SKU 658030011) has entered a distinct low-demand summer regime starting around Period 19 (mid-June). The last four periods (P19-P22) have recorded demands of 38, 22, 28, and 39 respectively, resulting in a mean of 31.75 units/period. This is a significant decrease from the previous summer baseline of roughly 60-68 units/period observed in early June. Given the skinny, low-waist denim product type, this dip likely represents the peak summer heat trough before late-summer or back-to-school interest returns. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new, lower demand level and prevent excessive inventory accumulation while maintaining the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough confirmed (P19-P22): Average demand has dropped to ~32 units/period, a nearly 50% decrease from the early summer baseline of ~61 units/period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 (Push Up Jegging) has experienced a significant demand drop since late June, reaching a mid-summer trough. In Period 23, demand spiked unexpectedly to 54 units, causing a stockout as it exceeded the 46 units on hand. This suggest that the recent 'trough' may be transitioning into a slightly higher baseline or experiencing mid-summer clearance interest. The last 4 periods of demand (P20-P23) are 22, 28, 39, 54, showing a clear upward trend from the absolute low of 22 units. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this recovery while remaining cautious of over-stocking during a generally low-demand season. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand recovery observed (P20-P23): Demand has increased from 22 to 54 units (+145%) over the last 4 periods, suggesting the seasonal trough has passed.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 (Push Up Jegging) has experienced a significant mid-summer demand trough followed by a recovery attempt. Demand dropped to a low of 22-28 units in late June/early July (Periods 20-21) but spiked to 54 in Period 23 before settling at 28 in Period 24. This suggests the summer 'floor' is around 30 units, with periodic spikes. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 34.2 units/period. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the recent variability (28, 54, 28) and the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a protective buffer. Using N=5 allows the model to capture this recent regime shift while smoothing the recent outlier spike in Period 23.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand recovery (Periods 20-24): Demand has exited the deep trough (low of 22) and is stabilizing around a new baseline of ~34 units/period, despite a temporary spike to 54 in Period 23.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1064.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, demand spiked to 72, which is significantly higher than the mid-summer average (~34). This suggests either a late-summer clearance spike or an early transition into the back-to-school season (August). Total inventory ended at 0 after stockouts in Periods 23 and 25, indicating that recent order caps were too low for this sudden demand resurgence. To capture this recovery without overreacting to a single high data point, I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods (P20-P25) for mu_hat. This period includes the deep trough (22) and the recent spike (72), resulting in a mean of ~40.5. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=6 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last three weeks (28, 54, 28, 72). This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock that better protects against the current upward trend while the lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand recovery confirmed: Demand increased from a mid-summer average of 32 to a 6-period average of 40.5 (P20-P25), including a peak of 72 in Period 25, suggesting seasonal transition.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 is currently entering a late-summer/pre-autumn transition phase. After a mid-summer trough where demand dipped as low as 22-28 units, the last two periods have seen a significant spike in demand (72 units in both P25 and P26). This aligns with seasonal patterns for 'Push Up Jeggings' as customers prepare for the 'Back to School' or autumn season in mid-August. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P23-P26) is approximately 56.5 units, which is significantly higher than the mid-summer average of ~32 units. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this upward shift while maintaining enough sensitivity to the recent spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand surge confirmed (P25-P26): Demand has spiked to 72 units for two consecutive weeks, significantly exceeding the previous 4-week average of 37 units (+94% increase), likely signaling the start of the autumn sales season.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 (Push Up Jegging) has exited its mid-summer trough and entered a significant late-summer/early-autumn demand surge. Demand in Period 27 reached 98 units, following several weeks of increasing demand (28 -> 72 -> 72 -> 98). The last three periods (P25-P27) average 80.6 units, compared to the summer average of ~32-40 units. This pattern aligns with late August retail seasonality, where 'Back-to-School' and transition-to-autumn demand for denim typically peaks. Inventory has stocked out for three of the last five periods (P23, P25, P27), currently leaving 0 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the recent growth aggressively, and sigma_hat using the same window to address the high volatility seen during this transition. This will allow the OR engine to set a base stock that accounts for the current mean of ~81 units plus significant safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: Demand has increased from an average of ~35 in July to an average of ~81 units/period over the last 3 weeks (P25-P27), a >100% increase signaling the start of the peak autumn denim season.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 (Push Up Jegging) is currently experiencing a sustained autumn demand surge. Demand over the last four periods (P25-P28) has been 72, 72, 98, and 94, averaging ~84 units/period. This is a significant increase from the mid-summer trough where demand averaged ~35 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 28 conclude' message showing the P28 order arrived in the same period. Since on-hand inventory is very low (12 units) and demand is stabilizing at this higher autumn level, I will use a recent_N approach for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime specifically. This will ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent stockouts during this seasonal peak while keeping the lead time estimate grounded in recent observation.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P25-P28) confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized at ~84 units/period, representing a ~140% increase from the mid-summer average of 35 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has significantly shifted from a mid-summer trough (approx. 35 units/period) to a robust autumn regime starting around Period 25 (late July/early August). Demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) has been 72, 72, 98, 94, and 78, yielding a mean of 82.8 units/period. This aligns with seasonal expectations for denim as schools reopen and autumn collections launch. Although the Period 29 demand (78) was slightly lower than the previous two weeks, it remains firmly within the high-demand regime. The stock depleted to 0 in multiple recent periods (P25, P26, P27), leading to lost sales, which suggests the need for a protective buffer. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use the last 5 periods (the start of the autumn surge) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current high-volume, high-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime confirmed (P25-P29): Mean demand is 82.8 units/period, representing more than double the summer baseline. High volatility persists during this seasonal transition.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 (Ladies Push Up Jegging) is currently in a high-demand autumn regime. Period 30 recorded a significant demand spike of 130 units, which is a 57% increase over the average of the previous four periods (~82.8). This aligns with expectations for autumn denim sales. My current on-hand inventory is 0 after stock-out in Period 30. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To handle this demand surge and high volatility (Std Dev ~22 over the last 6 periods), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the autumn regime (P25-P30 average = 90.6 units). I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to account for the increased variability observed during this seasonal transition. This will signal the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the higher mean and provides a safety buffer for the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed at Period 30: Demand spiked to 130 units, pushing the 6-period average (P25-P30) to 90.6 units/period, a significant increase from the initial autumn estimate of 82.8.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 (Push Up Jegging) is currently in its autumn peak season, as evidenced by demand spiking to 130 and 124 units in the last two periods (P30, P31). The mean demand over the last 3 periods (P29-P31) is 110.6 units, while the peak average since the seasonal shift (P25-P31) is 95.4 units. Given the high criticality of maintaining supply during this peak (profit $19 vs $1 holding cost), and the recent stockouts/low inventory levels (ending OH has been 0 or near 0 for several weeks), I will increase the demand forecast. I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the full autumn regime including the recent high-demand weeks. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use a recent_N method for sigma_hat to reflect the high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Autumn season peak sustained. Demand for the last 7 periods (P25-P31) averages 95.4 units, a significant increase from the previous summer baseline. Late-season volatility is high (stdev ~24).

The autumn peak season is firmly established. Demand over the last 8 periods (P25-P32) has averaged 98.9 units, significantly higher than the summer baseline. The last three weeks specifically (P30-P32) have shown a higher plateau with demand values of 130, 124, and 123 (mean = 125.7). This suggests demand has transitioned from the initial surge to a sustained high-activity level for the jeans category in September/October. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the full autumn regime, while sigma_hat will also use recent_N=8 to account for the high volatility observed during this transition (std ~23 over this period). Lead time remains stable at 0. The objective is to maintain high service levels to capture the $19.0 profit per unit while minimizing stockouts, which have occurred twice in the last 6 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand plateau confirmed (P30-P32): Demand has stabilized at a higher mean of ~125 units/period compared to the early autumn average of ~85.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 (Push Up Jegging) is experiencing a massive autumn demand surge. In Period 33, demand reached 230 units, its highest level yet, far exceeding the previous stabilization plateau of ~125 (Period 30-32). This indicates the seasonal peak is intensifying or moving into a hyper-growth phase. Since lead time is consistently 0, the current priority is to aggressiveley capture this high demand to avoid stockouts, which have occurred frequently in the last few periods (P30, P33). I am shifting to a very recent demand window to capture the momentum while increasing volatility estimates (sigma_hat) to account for the large demand variance observed. I will use the last 4 periods (P30-P33) for mu_hat to capture the jump to 230.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak autumn regime at Period 34: Demand surged to 230 units in Period 33, increasing the 4-period average (P30-P33) to 151.75 units/period, a ~60% increase over the early autumn average.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak autumn season (October). In Period 33, demand reached a super-peak of 230 units. While Period 34 demand retracted to 117 units, the overall autumn trend (P30-P34) remains significantly elevated with an average of 144.8 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 121 units, which is almost exactly one period of average current demand. Given the high volatility observed in this season (stdev ~45-50), I will target a base stock levels that account for the 'Super-peak autumn' regime. I'm using N=5 for mu_hat (P30-P34) to capture the recent surge and N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the high seasonal volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 34 historical concluded periods.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak autumn regime (P30-P34): Demand mean has shifted to approximately 144.8 units/period, a significant increase from the early autumn average of ~85. High volatility persists (stdev ~51).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 is currently in a super-peak autumn regime. Demand over the last 6 periods (P30-P35) has averaged 140.5 units/period (130, 124, 123, 230, 117, 119), which is a significant increase from the early autumn average (~85). The massive spike to 230 in Period 33 appears to be an outlier or ultra-peak, as the subsequent two weeks have stabilized around 118 units. However, because the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is very high (19:1, implying a service level target of ~95%), it is safer to bias the forecast slightly higher to capture potential volatility. I will use the last 6 periods to calculate mu_hat, capturing this high-demand plateau while smoothing the P33 spike. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn super-peak regime (P30-P35) confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a higher mean of ~140 units/period (avg of last 6) compared to early autumn, with high potential for volatility spikes.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 658030011 is currently in a sustained 'super-peak' autumn demand regime. Over the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has been very stable around the mean, recording 117, 119, and 118 units respectively. This follows a highly volatile peak in P33 (230 units). The current context is late October, which is a key period for denim apparel. While the recent 3-week stability suggests a lower immediate risk of a massive spike like P33, the overall autumn regime (P30-P36) has an average of 140 units. I will set mu_hat to reflect this current regime using recent_N=7 (P30-P36) to capture both the super-peak spike and the subsequent stabilization, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers these higher volumes. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: After the P33 peak of 230 units, demand has stabilized at ~118 units/period over the last 3 weeks (P34-P36), confirming a high-plateau regime for late October.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context for Period 38 (late October) shows a clear stabilization following the 'super-peak' autumn period that centered around Period 33 (demand 230). For the last four consecutive periods (P34-P37), demand has been remarkably stable, recording 117, 119, 118, and 115 units respectively. This indicates a consistent high-plateau regime for this denim product as we exit October. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. To set parameters for the OR backend, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this specific post-peak stabilization. This period range (P34-P37) has a mean of 117.25 and a very low standard deviation of approximately 1.7, which will allow the backend to maintain a safe but efficient inventory level without over-adjusting for the earlier September volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late October demand stabilization (P34-P37): Demand has fully stabilized at a high-plateau mean of 117.25 units/period with minimal volatility (stdev ~1.7), following the late September peak season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2299.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has entered a new phase as of early November. After staying remarkably stable at ~117 units for four weeks (P34-P37), Period 38 saw a significant spike to 150 units (+28% vs. previous 4-period mean). This increase likely correlates with the 'Single's Day' (11/11) and pre-Black Friday shopping ramp-up in November. Since lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to lock in this performance. For demand, I am shifting focus to the most recent window (P34-P38) to capture both the high plateau and the new upward momentum. mu_hat will use the mean of the last 5 samples (117, 119, 118, 115, 150), which is 123.8 per period. Given the 0-period lead time, (1+L)*mu translates to 123.8. sigma_hat will also use the last 5 samples to reflect the recent volatility spike caused by the 150 unit demand event (stdev ~14.7). This ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock to protect against further November surges while maintaining high service levels.

Carry-over insight: Early November demand surge: Demand increased to 150 in Period 38, signaling the start of the holiday shopping season (Nov/Dec) and breaking the late October plateau of 117.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-November holiday shopping period (Date: 2019/11/11). Historically, demand for this item is volatile but elevated during seasonal transitions. In Period 38, we saw a demand surge to 150 units, followed by a contraction to 97 units in Period 39. Despite the drop in P39, we anticipate sustained higher demand compared to the October 'plateau' of ~117. The current on-hand inventory is 52 units. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To capture the current holiday regime while accounting for recent high-demand spikes and the subsequent drop, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (averaging periods 36-39: 118, 115, 150, 97), which yields a mean of 120 units. This provides a buffer against holiday volatility without over-reacting to the single 150 peak. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N of 4 to reflect the increased standard deviation seen in the early November shift.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand volatility confirmed: Demand shifted from a stable 117 (late Oct) to 150 (P38) then 97 (P39), indicating high variance as the peak shopping season begins.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18 (Period 41). We are entering the pre-holiday shopping period. Historical data shows a steady lead time of 0 periods. Demand has recently fluctuated following the October plateau of ~117 units/period, with observations of 150, 97, and 92 over the last three periods (Avg: 113). Since this is a holiday-sensitive item (Ladies Denim), I expect demand to remain elevated but volatile as we approach Black Friday and December. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent post-plateau volatility which averages 113 units, and recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to account for the wider variance observed since the October peak (including the 150 spike and subsequent drop to ~90s). On-hand inventory is 65, and with L=0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover current period demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is the peak holiday shopping season (leading into Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Historically, demand for denim products often spikes during late November due to gift-giving and seasonal promotions. Looking at the recent history (P38-P41), demand has been erratic but consistently high compared to the summer baseline, averaging 108.5 units/period over the last 4 weeks. However, specifically the last 3 periods (P39-P41) have stabilized at a mean of 94.6 units with very low volatility (stdev ~1.5). Given the holiday context, I must prepare for potential surges while respecting the immediate stability. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current holiday regime mean, but I will use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the known volatility of the season (as seen in P38's 150 units demand), ensuring we don't under-order if a Black Friday spike occurs. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand regime confirmed (P38-P41): Demand is averaging 108.5 units/period (+50% vs summer baseline). While recent weeks (P39-P41) show temporary stability at ~95, high volatility (e.g., P38 spike to 150) is characteristic of the November retail period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019, which marks the start of the core holiday shopping season (post-Cyber Monday). Historical evidence for the 'Push Up Jegging' shows that demand in November shifted from the October plateau (avg 117) to a more volatile regime (P38-P42 average: 108.6). Specifically, the last four periods (P39-P42) show a very stable mean of approximately 98 units (97, 92, 95, 109). However, given the proximity to mid-December peaks for denim and trousers, I expect a seasonal uptick. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current stable baseline of ~98, while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen across the broader holiday window (P38-P42). Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) will naturally buffer against 'sold out' situations seen in earlier peaks (e.g., P33, P38).

Carry-over insight: Holiday stabilization regime (P39-P42): Demand has converged to a mean of 98.25 units/period (stdev ~7.5), following the early November volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Push Up Jegging L.W' has significantly dropped in Period 43 to 44 units, which is a departure from the holiday stabilization average of ~98 units/period (P39-P42). This drop occurs in the week of December 2nd, which can sometimes be a mid-holiday 'lull' between Cyber Monday and the final Christmas rush. However, given that there are only 4 periods remaining in the simulation, a conservative approach is necessary to avoid high holding costs from overstocking a seasonal item. I will use a recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent high average while incorporating the Period 43 drop, as 5 periods cover the most relevant holiday behavior (P39-P43: 97, 92, 95, 109, 44; average = 87.4). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early December demand drop: Period 43 demand fell to 44 units, representing a >50% decrease from the late November average of 98, potentially signaling a mid-holiday lull or the start of a post-peak decline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in the late holiday season for 'Push Up Jeggings'. The demand in Period 43 (Dec 2) showed a significant drop to 44 units, followed by a slight recovery to 77 units in Period 44 (Dec 9). This pattern suggests we have moved past the late autumn/early holiday peak (where mean demand shifted between 98-117) and are entering a lower-demand regime or a late-December lull. Using a recent_N of 2 for mu_hat would capture this drop too aggressively given only two data points; however, the Carry-over Insights from Period 44 highlight this decrease as a potential shift. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (averages P40-P44: 92, 95, 109, 44, 77 = 83.4) to blend the recent high-demand history with the late-season cooling. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this transition (stdev is higher due to the 44-unit outlier).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand decline confirmed (P43-P44): Demand has dropped from a Nov average of ~100 to an early Dec average of 60.5 units/period (-40% decrease).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 43-45) has been lower, averaging 71 units/period (44, 77, 92) compared to the late November average of ~100. As we approach December 23 (Period 46), we are in the tail end of the holiday season, which typically sees a sharp drop-off in denim sales as consumer focus shifts away from apparel. The 'Post-holiday demand decline' noted in Carry-over insights is manifesting. I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture this lower mean (71) for mu_hat. The volatility remains moderate (stdev ~24 for latest 3), so I will use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat as well to provide a conservative buffer against any final holiday spikes. Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 47 (Dec 30, 2019), which is the final week of the year and the tail end of the post-holiday season. After the early December trough (44 units), demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P44-P46) at an average of 81.3 units (77, 92, 75). This indicates that the steep holiday decline has leveled off into a late-winter baseline. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the transition into the new year, I will base the forecast on the most recent stable regime (N=3) which captures this 81-unit average. This ensures we don't over-order based on the high performance of autumn/early November while maintaining enough stock to cover the consistent demand observed in late December.

Carry-over insight: Late-winter demand stabilization (P44-P46): Demand has stabilized at an average of 81.3 units/period following the mid-December trough, establishing a new baseline for the year-end transition.
