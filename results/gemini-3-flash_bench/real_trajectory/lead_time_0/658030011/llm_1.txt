Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 83, 67, 107, 53, 116, averaging ~85 units/week with significant variance. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available for this period's demand (2019-02-11). To satisfy expected demand and establish a small safety stock buffer for the high variance observed (max 116), I will order 105 units.

Since I ended Period 1 with 0 inventory, I need to cover the full expected demand for Period 2.

World knowledge suggests September is a peak 'Back-to-School' and 'Fall Wardrobe' transition month, typically showing high demand for denim. Recent demand history confirms an upward trend throughout August (72, 98, 94, 78) culminating in a significant spike in Period 30 (demand 130). This spike caused a stockout (sold 110 of 130 demanded), meaning actual demand is at least 130. Given the lead time is consistently 0 (orders arrive same-period), I must order enough to cover Period 31's forecasted demand. Considering the recent peak of 130 and the seasonal strength of early September, I forecast demand at approximately 130-140 units. Since current on-hand inventory and in-transit units are both 0, I will order 140 units to capture this high demand while maintaining a small buffer for variance, as under-stocking costs considerably more ($19 profit) than holding ($1 cost).",

  "rationale": "The product is a 'Push Up Jegging' (stretchy, low-waisted denim), a staple fashion item affected by seasonal transitions and holiday pulses. Current date is Dec 23rd, 2019 (Period 46). Demand history shows recent volatility: a Black Friday peak (P42: 109 demand), followed by a post-peak slump (P43: 44), and a recovery in mid-December (P44: 77, P45: 92). Given the date (week of Christmas), a minor spike or sustained demand is expected as shoppers use holiday gift cards or purchase last-minute outfits, followed by a potential New Year's lull. Based on the last two weeks (avg ~84), I anticipate Period 46 demand to remain around 85-100 units. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Starting on-hand is 48. To cover Period 46's expected demand (~90) and maintain a small safety stock for the end of the year, I will order enough to bring total availability to 140 units.",
  "carry_over_insight": "End-of-year seasonal recovery confirmed: Demand rose from P43 low (44) to P45 (92), indicating a pre-Christmas stocking regime of ~85-95 units/week.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Push Up Jegging' (Ladies Denim), which exhibits clear seasonal volatility. Period 47 (Dec 30) is the final period of the fiscal year and falls between Christmas and New Year. Recent demand has stabilized into a 'pre-Christmas/end-of-year' regime: Period 44 (77), Period 45 (92), and Period 46 (75), averaging approximately 81 units. However, this is the final period of the game (Period 47 / 47). In the terminal period, there is no value in holding inventory as there are no future periods to sell. The goal is to maximize total reward (Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory). Current on-hand inventory is 65 units. Given the recent average (81) and historical context, demand is likely to meet or exceed the current 65 on-hand units. Ordering more would likely result in ending inventory that incurs a holding cost without contributing to sales, as this is the final resolution. Therefore, the optimal strategy for the final period is to order 0 and satisfy demand from existing stock.",
