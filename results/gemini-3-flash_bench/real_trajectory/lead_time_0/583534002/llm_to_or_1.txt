Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Joggers in lightweight sweatshirt fabric'. Historical demand shows a clear downward trend over the last 5 weeks: 367, 213, 219, 181, 125. The mean of these 5 samples is 221, but the most recent sample is significantly lower (125). No in-transit or on-hand inventory exists. Since the promised lead time is 0, the OR backend will calculate base stock for 1 period (L+1). Given the sharp decline in demand as we move deeper into February, I will use a recent_N of 3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the cooling trend while tempering the extreme low of the most recent week. I will use the default sigma_hat to maintain a buffer, as the early weeks were quite volatile. Lead time (L) is set to default (0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Women's Everyday Basics Joggers'. Period 1 observed a demand of 123, which follows a declining trend from the initial historical samples (367, 213, 219, 181, 125). The mean of the last 3 samples (including Period 1) is (181 + 125 + 123) / 3 = 143. The lead time was confirmed as 0 periods in Period 1. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent plateau at a lower level compared to the early January peak, which was likely driven by New Year fitness resolutions or seasonal clearance. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock that reflects the current lower demand regime while maintaining appropriate safety stock for the observed volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a pair of women's lightweight joggers, a staple fashion item. Examining the demand data including the provided pre-game samples (367, 213, 219, 181, 125) and recent periods (123, 165), there is a clear downward trend from the early January peak, followed by a slight stabilization/rebound in February. The mean demand across all 7 available data points is approximately 199. However, the last 4 points (181, 125, 123, 165) show a lower average of 148.5, indicating a regime shift post-January peak. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on the conclusion of Period 1 and Period 2. The inventory position is currently very low (6 units). I will use recent_N to capture the post-peak demand level for Period 3 to avoid overstocking while ensuring enough units are ordered to meet the stabilized demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Post-January demand (since 2019-01-28) is significantly lower than early January, averaging ~149 vs ~266.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/3/4. The product is a lightweight sweatshirt jogger (Womens Everyday Basics). Observed demand for the last three periods (Period 1-3) has been 123, 165, and 82. This aligns with the transition out of the peak early-January period into a lower, more volatile late-winter regime. The average demand over these 3 weeks is 123.3 units. The Carry-over insight noted a shift to ~149 average since Jan 28, but the most recent 5 samples (including those provided in the starting data) show 181, 125, 123, 165, 82. Lead time (L) is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average ~135) to capture this lower demand regime while accommodating the high variance (sigma_hat) seen in the recent fluctuations. This helps the OR backend avoid overstocking as we move into March.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey jogger for women. Historically, we observed a peak in early January followed by a decline. Recent demand samples show a significant and sustained downward trend: Period 3 (82) and Period 4 (51), following the 2019-02-04 sample of 125. The 5-period average (including the last historical sample and the 4 game periods) is (125+123+165+82+51)/5 = 109.2. However, the most recent 2 periods average only 66.5. Given the product is 'lightweight sweatshirt fabric', demand might be stabilizing at a lower level as we move further into spring compared to winter peaks. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent cooling trend (avg 165, 82, 51 = 99.3) while maintaining a buffer against volatility. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect current variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift confirmed: Demand has continued to decline through February and early March, moving from a mean of ~149 (late Jan/early Feb) to ~99 in the last 3 weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $581.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/18. The SKU is a women's lightweight jogger, which typically sees declining demand in early spring after the post-New Year fitness surge. Historical demand samples showed a peak in early Jan (367, 213, 219) followed by a decline in late Jan/early Feb (181, 125). Game history shows demand for the last five periods has been 123, 165, 82, 51, and 146. While there was a spike to 146 in Period 5, the overall trend since Period 3 averages ~93 units per week. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been perfectly consistent across all 5 game periods (confirmed by 'arrived=X... lead_time was 0 periods' in every conclude message). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat), despite the last period spike, the 'recent_N' approach with N=3 captures the lower 3-week average of ~93, which is more aligned with the seasonal exit of joggers. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen in the 51-146 range, ensuring the controller maintains enough safety stock for the noisy demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently observed as 0 periods over 5 consecutive cycles. Demand remains volatile but centered around a lower mean (~93-100) compared to early January.

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product (women's joggers) has experienced a recent demand spike, with Period 6 demand reaching 151, causing a stockout (ending inventory 0). This follows a period of lower demand. Looking at historical samples, early January saw very high levels (up to 367), and we may be seeing a recovery or stabilization as spring begins. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and adapt to the rising demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand and volatility, which captures the uptick from P5 (146) and P6 (151) better than the longer-term average. This will increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend sets a higher base stock, preventing further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected: Demand increased significantly in Periods 5 and 6 (avg 148.5) compared to the previous Period 3-4 average (~66), suggesting the seasonal trough has passed.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is lightweight sweatshirt joggers (Womens Everyday Basics). Demand has spiked significantly over the last three periods: P5 (146), P6 (151), and P7 (187), compared to the earlier late-Feb/early-March lows of ~50-80. This trend aligns with seasonal shifts toward lighter spring-weight apparel. Despite ordering 164 units in P7, we stock-outed (on-hand 0). History confirms a lead time of 0 periods consistently. To prevent further lost sales during this upward trend, I am increasing mu_hat using a recent 4-period window to capture the current mean (~141) plus the upward momentum. I will use the recent_N method for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge confirmed: Demand increased for three consecutive periods (146, 151, 187), indicating a departure from the winter-ending trough and a new high-demand regime for lightweight spring joggers.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/08. Demand for the 'lightweight sweatshirt joggers' has stabilized following a spring surge, with the most recent demand at 90 units, though the previous three weeks (146, 151, 187) showed much higher activity. The 'Spring demand surge' noted in carry-over insights seems to have moderated slightly this week, but it remains significantly higher than the February trough. Looking at the history, the lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 93 units. With demand showing signs of stabilization but still being in a higher regime than late winter, I will use a recent_N approach for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focusing on the last 4 periods (146, 151, 187, 90) to capture the current spring regime while acknowledging the recent dip. This will ensure we have enough stock for potential spring spikes while accounting for the current on-hand position.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand for these lightweight joggers showed a spring surge (approx. 150-180 units) in mid-to-late March, but the last two periods (90, 59) show a sharp decline. Given the nature of a 'lightweight sweatshirt fabric' jogger, demand likely peaks in early spring and may cool off as temperatures rise further into April/May. However, the 'Everyday Basics' category suggests a sustainable floor. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the recent volatility and the downward trend from the peak, while maintaining enough stock to cover a potential rebound. This averages the peak weeks (151, 187) with the recent drop (90, 59), providing a balanced mu_hat for the immediate future.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand peaked in late March (Period 6-7, avg ~169) and has entered a cooling phase in early April (Period 8-9, avg ~75).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the demand for lightweight sweatshirt joggers has settled into a cooler phase following the late March spring surge. Over the last three cycles (Periods 8, 9, 10), demand has been 90, 59, and 44, averaging 64.3 units. This confirms the 'cooling phase' identified in the previous period's insights. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (holding=$1, profit=$4), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this most recent low-demand regime, and N=4 for sigma_hat to include slightly more volatility from the transition. This targets a base stock that covers the expected lower demand while preventing stockouts if the rate stabilizes above 44.

Carry-over insight: Post-spring surge demand cooling confirmed: mean demand over periods 8-10 is ~64 units, down significantly from the ~169 peak in periods 6-7.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/29. The product is a lightweight sweatshirt jogger. Demand has significantly cooled following a March peak (151, 187) and an early April surge. The last three periods (P9-P11) show demand levels of 59, 44, and 34 units respectively, resulting in a mean of 45.6. This confirms the 'cooling phase' noted in Carry-over Insights. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). With 93 units on-hand and declining demand, the current inventory is likely sufficient to cover the upcoming period without a large new order. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect this low-demand regime (approx. 45.6 per period). Given the low demand and 0 lead time, the OR backend's base-stock calculation (with mu_hat ~ 46) will subtract the 93 on-hand and likely result in a recommendation of 0 or a very small order, which is appropriate to avoid unnecessary holding costs as we move further into late spring.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level: Late April (P9-P11) demand averaged ~46 units, a significant drop from the early April average of ~75.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/06. The product is a lightweight sweatshirt jogger. Demand has significantly decreased and stabilized during April into May, with the last four periods showing values of 90, 59, 44, 34, and 33. The carry-over insight from Period 12 confirms a stabilized low-demand regime at ~46 units. Lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 60 units, which is sufficient to cover another period of demand at the current average. To capture the most relevant recent behavior while acknowledging the steady decline, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand and volatility. This focuses on the periods since late April (44, 34, 33), where the mean is ~37. This setting allows the OR backend to maintain a lean inventory posture as we move further into the warmer season for this \u2018lightweight sweatshirt\u2019 product, preventing overstocking and high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: May demand stability: Demand has settled into a low-volume regime (avg ~37 units over last 3 weeks) following the post-spring surge cooling.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). Historical data shows that demand for these lightweight joggers peaked in late March (Period 7) and has since stabilized at a much lower volume. Over the last three periods (P11-P13), demand has been consistently low and stable: 34, 33, and 35 units respectively. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed in all historical 'conclude' messages. Given the stability of the current low-demand regime, I am using a recent_N strategy with N=3 to capture the precise mean (~34) and low volatility of this late-spring phase. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that minimizes holding costs while covering current demand expectations.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand shows a persistent cooling phase for these lightweight joggers after a late March peak. Demand has transitioned from averages around 170 (P6-P7) down to ~37 (P11-P13), and most recently dropped further to 18 units in Period 14. This suggests the product is entering a late-spring/early-summer low-demand trough as consumer preferences shift away from sweatshirt fabrics. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (ratio 4:1 Profit/Holding), I am using N=4 to capture the most recent, lower volume regime (P11-P14, mean ~25) which accounts for the most recent drop to 18. This conservative approach balances service level against the risk of overstocking a product in clear seasonal decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Demand reached a new low of 18 units, continuing the downward May trend (mean over P11-P14 is ~25 units).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a lightweight sweatshirt jogger, which is experiencing a seasonal decline as late spring transitions into summer. Historical demand has consistently dropped: Period 14 saw 18 units and Period 15 saw 23 units, following a May average (P11-P14) of approximately 25 units. The 3-period trailing average (P13-P15) is 25.3 units. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. Inventory levels are currently low (14 on-hand), and since the lead time is 0, we need to ensure the base stock covers the demand for the current period. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-volume, end-of-season regime while maintaining a tight inventory to minimize holding costs ($1/unit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at end-of-spring low: Mean demand for periods 13-15 is ~25 units, reflecting the final seasonal decline for this product category.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (lightweight joggers) is currently in a low-demand, late-spring/early-summer regime. The last three periods (P14-P16) have shown extremely low and stable demand (18, 23, 15), averaging 18.7 units per week. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the low profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) which implies a target service level of 80%, the goal is to maintain lean inventory to minimize holding costs while covering this low-volume demand. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low regime, and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed 0-period performance.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is lightweight sweatshirt joggers, which are entering a low-demand phase as the summer season progresses. Demand over the last 4 periods (P14-P17) has been very low and stable: 18, 23, 15, and 20 (mean = 19). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the low holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 vs $4.0), the inventory risk is manageable, but with demand cooling significantly since the spring peak, there's a risk of overstocking if we use a long lookback. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current stable 'end-of-season' low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has been extremely reliable.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand regime identified (Periods 14-17): Mean demand has stabilized at ~19 units, reflecting the final cooling phase for lightweight joggers.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight sweatshirt jogger, currently in the mid-June period (Period 19, 2019/6/17). Historical demand shows a clear seasonal decline: from a late March peak (Period 7: 187 units) down to an early summer low. The most recent demand regime (Periods 14-18) shows extreme stability with demand values of 18, 23, 15, 20, and 11, averaging 17.4 units per period. The lead time has consistently returned as 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the low holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), the backend base-stock policy will target a high service level, but we must use a narrow window (recent_N=5) to reflect the current low-demand summer floor and avoid over-ordering based on spring peaks. Parameters set to capture this specific summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime identified (Periods 14-18): Mean demand has further softened to ~17 units, maintaining the seasonal low for lightweight joggers.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-06-24. We are in a mid-summer demand regime for 'Joggers in lightweight sweatshirt fabric', which is typically a low-demand period for this product category. Examining the recent demand history: Period 17 (20), Period 18 (11), and Period 19 (5). This shows a clear decelerating trend within the already low summer regime (average over the last 3 periods is ~12 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all previous order history. To avoid overstocking during this seasonal low while maintaining a sufficient service level (q = 0.8), I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P15-P19) which captures the current low-volume summer stability, averaging approximately 14.8 units. I will use the last 5 periods for sigma_hat as well to capture the recent volatility correctly. The lead time L is set to 0 based on consistent historical evidence.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (Periods 17-19) shows further softening with demand dropping to single digits by P19, averaging ~12 units/week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. The product is a lightweight sweatshirt jogger, which is typically a spring/autumn item and experiences low demand during mid-summer. The CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS and recent history confirm a significant demand softening, with demand dropping to single digits (11, 5, 5) over the last three periods (P18-P20), averaging 7 units per week. The promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time has consistently been 0 for all 18 concluded orders. With 16 units currently on hand and a mean demand around 7-10 units, the inventory is sufficient for the current period without a large order. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent mid-summer trough (averaging ~7 units) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain lead time at L=0 (explicitly set to 0 to align with high confidence in the immediate arrival pattern).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough confirmed: Average demand for Periods 18-20 reached a new seasonal low of 7 units/week.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight sweatshirt jogger, currently in the mid-summer seasonal trough (July). Historical demand for the last three periods (P19-P21) has stabilized at a very low level of 5 units per week, following the 11-15 range observed in early June. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Given that the current on-hand inventory is 11 units and the expected weekly demand is only 5 units, the existing stock covers over two periods of demand. To minimize holding costs ($1.0/unit/period) while maintaining the 80% service level (q = 4/(4+1)), no new order is necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the current 5-unit baseline and sigma_hat similarly to capture the low volatility of this trough period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is lightweight sweatshirt joggers, which are currently in a mid-summer seasonal trough. Period 22 observed a slight uptick in demand (15 units) compared to the very low single-digit demand of previous weeks (P19-P21 average was ~5 units). However, the overall trend remains low. On-hand inventory is now 0. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods since the start of the game. I will set L to 0. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), the last 3 periods (P20-P22) have averaged (5+5+15)/3 = 8.33 units. I'll use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent activity while acknowledging the summer low. sigma_hat will also be based on N=3 to account for the recent variance between the single-digit demand and the Period 22 spike.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer trough continues: Average demand for Periods 20-22 is 8.33 units/week, though P22 showed a small isolated spike to 15.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019, which is the peak of summer. The product is a lightweight sweatshirt jogger, typically out of season for summer. Demand has been consistently low for the past several months, with the most recent 'mid-summer trough' (Periods 21-23) averaging approximately 10.33 units per week (5, 15, 11). Lead time remains reliably at 0 periods as evidenced by Period 23's immediate arrival. With on-hand inventory at 3 and demand expected to stay in this low trough regime, I will setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (average ~10.3) to prevent overstocking high-holding-cost inventory during a low-demand season. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to capture the recent slight increase in volatility (P22's spike to 15).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is lightweight joggers, which is experiencing a deep summer trough. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Demand has been extremely low and volatile recently: P21-P24 demand was 5, 15, 11, and 2, averaging 8.25 units/week. Over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), the mean is 7.6 units. The 'on-hand' inventory is currently 13 units, which already covers more than one week of average demand in this low-volume regime. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current summer trough while accounting for the high volatility (spikes to 11 and 15). The OR backend will likely compute a base stock level around 12-15 units based on these parameters and the 80% critical fractile ($4 profit / ($4 profit + $1 holding cost)). Since on-hand is already 13, the order will be minimal to zero, which is appropriate for minimizing holding costs in the off-season.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jogger, which is currently in its mid-summer seasonal trough. Period 26 corresponds to early August (2019-08-05). Demand has been consistently low and volatile, with recent demand figures of 11, 2, and 8 units over the last three periods (mean: 7.0). Although there was a slight increase to 8 last period from the previous 2, the overall trend remains stabilized at a very low level. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Given the low demand and high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 vs $4.0), I will use a recent N window (N=5) to capture the current trough while smoothing out minor weekly fluctuations. This N=5 window (P21-P25: 5, 15, 11, 2, 8) gives an average demand of 8.2 units and captures the appropriate volatility for this low-volume regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jogger (everyday basic), currently in the mid-to-late summer period (August 12th). Historical demand analysis shows a sustained low-volume regime following the spring peak. Recent demand reflects this trough: P23 (11), P24 (2), P25 (8), and P26 (4), averaging 6.25 units over the last 4 weeks. This aligns with the 'Mid-summer trough' identified in previous carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 (the order arrives the same period it is placed). Given the low demand and relatively high holding cost ($1 vs $4 profit), I will use the recent 4-week window to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This prevents over-ordering during a period where inventory decay is more likely than a sudden spike, while the 0-day lead time allows for rapid reaction if demand increases in late August.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019 (Period 28). The product is a lightweight jersey jogger, which typically sees its lowest demand during the peak of summer (July/August) before potentially picking up for the back-to-school or early autumn transition in late August/September. Since Period 21, demand has been extremely low and relatively stable, averaging approximately 8.3 units per week (periods 21-27). Specifically, the last three periods (25-27) had demands of 8, 4, and 13, averaging 8.33. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we must order to meet any demand this period. The observed lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mid-summer low-demand regime while allowing for the slight volatility seen in recent weeks (e.g., the jump from 4 to 13). This helps the OR backend maintain a low base stock suitable for the current low-demand trough while avoiding excessive holding costs for a product at its seasonal minimum.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019 (Period 29), which is the late summer/early autumn transition. The product 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Joggers' previously showed a significant mid-summer demand trough. Recent demand in August (Periods 25-28) has been 8, 4, 13, and 5 units respectively. The average demand for the last 4 weeks is 7.5 units, which is consistent with the 'mid-summer trough' identified in the Carry-over Insights (Period 21/23). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. As we approach September, demand for 'Everyday Basics' joggers typically stabilizes or undergoes a slight seasonal increase, but there is no strong evidence of a sustained upward shift yet. Therefore, I will use a recent_N strategy (N=4) to capture this low-volume regime and ensure lean inventory, while maintaining the established lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand (August) remains stable at the mid-summer seasonal trough level, averaging ~7.5 units per week (Periods 25-28).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, entering the transitional period between summer and autumn. Historically, this product (lightweight joggers) saw high demand in late winter/early spring (Jan-March). While demand has been in a sustained seasonal trough (averaging ~7.5 units in August), we should anticipate a potential 'back-to-school' or early autumn lift as temperatures begin to cool. The last 4 periods of demand were 4, 13, 5, 4. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low baseline while allowing for a slight uptick, and maintain L=0 as consistently observed. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost, maintaining approximately an 80% service level.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019 (Period 31), transitioning from late summer into autumn. Historically, this product (lightweight joggers) saw high demand in early spring (March/April). With the arrival of September, we anticipate a potential secondary seasonal lift as weather cools, similar to the pre-spring behavior. However, the most recent demand (Periods 25-30) remains low and stable, averaging ~6.33 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent window (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current stable trough while allowing for a slight upward adjustment if an autumn rebound begins, and maintain the default sigma_hat to account for historical volatility in this SKU.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historically, demand for this 'Women's Everyday Basics Jogger' witnessed a significant spike in mid-September (Period 31 demand was 8, but historical data from the start of the year shows high demand in January). As we move into the tail end of Q3 and approach cooler months (fall/winter), demand for joggers typically rises. Although recent periods (P25-P31) averaged ~7.4 units, the initial historical samples from 2019-01 (Jan 7-28) averaged ~244 units. The transition from late summer to fall represents a major seasonal changepoint. I am anticipating a significant demand surge similar to the early-year levels. Period 31 had a large order of 77 units reflecting expectations of this shift, leaving 72 units on hand. To prepare for the fall comeback, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 150 (a conservative midpoint between the summer trough of ~8 and the winter peak of ~244), while keeping sigma_hat relatively high (recent_N=5) to account for the volatility seen during regime shifts. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal transition detected: Transitioning from summer trough (~8 units/week) toward anticipated higher fall demand based on January history.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are entering the fall season for this 'lightweight sweatshirt fabric jogger', which historically saw very high demand in January (averaging ~266 units/week). While recent demand (P29-P32) has remained very low (averaging ~6.75 units/week), we have already proactively built up inventory (on-hand is 146) to prepare for the seasonal transition. However, current demand has not yet spiked. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for the expected uptick, I will set mu_hat using a 4-period average (capturing the very recent trough) but keep a high sigma_hat via the default method to allow the OR engine some safety stock for the transition. Lead time remains consistently 0.

The current date is September 30, 2019. We are in the fall seasonal transition.

Currently, we have 140 units on-hand, which is more than enough to cover over 20 weeks of current demand. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set L to 0. Given the high on-hand inventory and the lack of an actual demand spike in September, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 3 to reflect the current stagnant demand regime (mean ~7). This will prevent the OR backend from ordering more units while we burn through existing stock, avoiding unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Fall transition delayed or softened: Despite historical January highs, September demand (P31-P33) averaged only 7 units/week, significantly lower than expected transition levels.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Historical demand for January (given in the header) ranged from 125 to 367, suggesting a significant winter/holiday surge for these lightweight joggers. However, recent performance (P31-P34) shows an average demand of only ~6.5 units/week, indicating the fall transition is much slower than anticipated. Despite the expected seasonal rise, we currently have 135 units on-hand, which covers roughly 20 weeks of current demand or 0.5-1 week of peak January demand. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), the priority is avoiding overstocking while the seasonal shift remains unconfirmed. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to reflect the current stagnant demand (~6.5 units), and a recent_N of 4 for sigma_hat to capture the low volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0. The high on-hand inventory should buffer any sudden uptick in demand next period without requiring new orders yet.

Carry-over insight: Mid-fall stagnation: Demand for Periods 31-34 has remained at an average of 6.5 units/week, failing to show the seasonal increase expected from historical January data.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Despite moving deeper into fall, demand for these lightweight joggers continues to stagnate at mid-summer trough levels, with an average of 5.33 units per week over the last three periods (P33-P35). Historical January data suggests high demand (>200), but the expected seasonal ramp-up has not yet materialized in the September/October data. On-hand inventory is currently very high (130 units) due to aggressive ordering in P31-P32 that preceded the observed stagnation. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (P31-P35) to better reflect this lower-than-anticipated fall demand and prevent further overstocking while holding costs accumulate.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Fall demand stagnation confirmed; average demand for P31-P35 is 6.2 units/week, drastically underperforming January historical benchmarks.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 21, 2019. We are in a persistent low-demand regime for lightweight sweatshirt joggers. Despite the expectation of a fall demand increase based on early January historical data, demand hasn't materialized; the average demand from Period 31 to 36 is only ~5.8 units/week. We are currently overstocked with 126 units on-hand, which is significantly more than our expected demand needs (approximately 21 times the current weekly average). To stop incurring excessive holding costs and allow the inventory to deplete naturally, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6, covering the entire fall/September-October stagnation period). This will result in a base stock much lower than current on-hand inventory, effectively halting new orders. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand remains in a significant trough, despite the expectation of a seasonal increase based on early January performance. Recent demand (P33-P37) has been extremely low: 6, 5, 5, 4, 16, averaging ~7.2 units per week. The spike to 16 in P37 is the first double-digit demand in 7 periods, but it is not yet evidence of a sustained regime shift. On-hand inventory is 110 units, which covers over 15 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the massive overstock (service level target is q=0.8), I will set parameters to prevent any further ordering. I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture this stagnant demand regime while allowing the spike in P37 to slightly influence the sigma, ensuring we stay well above the 110 units currently held before the system triggers a new order.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand remains at summer-trough levels through late October; P37 shows a minor uptick (16 units) but not a regime shift.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. This product (lightweight joggers) has been in a prolonged stagnant demand phase since September (P31), with demand averaging only 6.7 units per week over the last 8 periods. Despite historical highs in January (367 units), the expected fall rebound has not materialized as of late October. Recent demand remains very low (P38: 4 units). On-hand inventory is currently 106 units, which is enough to cover over 15 weeks of demand at the current rate (~6.7 units/week). To minimize holding costs while the product remains in this low-demand state, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N approach (N=8) to capture this sustained stagnation. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 8 periods to reflect the low volatility currently observed. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-November (2019-11-11). Historical demand from early 2019 (January) was very high (367, 213, 219, 181), but recent performance from September through early November (Periods 31-39) has been stagnant, averaging only 7.1 units per week. While a seasonal uptick for joggers (lightweight sweatshirt fabric) might be expected as winter approaches, there is no evidence of this yet in the data; the small blips in P37 (16) and P39 (10) are well within normal variance for the current low-demand regime and do not justify a massive stock-up. On-hand inventory is currently 96 units, which covers over 13 weeks of current average demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will maintain parameters that prevent further ordering until on-hand inventory depletes to a level more in line with observed demand, while keeping volatility (sigma) calculated over a recent window to account for potential sudden shifts.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Despite moving deeper into the fall/winter season, demand for these lightweight joggers (583534002) has not realized the levels seen in early January (~200+ units). Instead, demand has remained extremely low and stagnant, averaging only 7 units per week over the last 10 periods (P31-P40), with the most recent demand being only 1 unit. We currently have 95 units on-hand, which represents nearly 13 weeks of stock at the current 'low' regime. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high inventory and low demand, no new orders should be placed. I will use a limited window of the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current stagnant demand regime while the OR backend's inventory balancing (base_stock calculation) naturally suppresses new orders due to the high existing on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Late fall stagnation confirmed: Demand (P31-P40) has averaged only 7 units per week, showing no recovery toward early-year historical levels.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product is a lightweight jogger, which is experiencing a sustained period of low demand. Since Period 31 (Sept 9), demand has remained in a 'stagnation' regime, averaging only 6.7 units per week. This is significantly lower than the early year historical benchmarks (January mean was ~266). Given the current on-hand inventory of 93 units, we have over 13 weeks of stock at the current burn rate. The target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) suggests a relatively lean stock position to avoid holding costs. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N method with N=10 to capture this stable, low-demand late-fall regime (Periods 31-40) to prevent the OR engine from over-ordering based on distant historical spikes. No new orders are expected or needed.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019. Demand for this SKU (lightweight sweatshirt joggers) has remained extremely low throughout the fall, averaging approximately 7.2 units per week over the last 11 periods (P31-P41), contrary to the high demand observed in early January 2019. This suggests that the product is either out of season or that the initial 2019 data represented a clearance or specific peak that is not repeating. With 82 units on-hand and a mean demand of ~7 units, we have over 11 weeks of inventory. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the lack of a seasonal upward trend as of late November, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 12 periods (P31-P42) to reflect this 'late-year stagnation' regime. This will prevent the OR backend from ordering more stock while on-hand inventory is already excessive for current demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime (P41-P42): Early December continues the low-volume trend seen since September, with recent samples (1, 2, 11) maintaining a low average (~4.7) and no sign of a year-end spike.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019 (Period 44). The product is a lightweight sweatshirt jogger, which is currently in a deep seasonal trough. Historical data from early January 2019 shows significantly higher demand (367, 213, 219, 181), suggesting a likely rebound as we approach the new year. However, the last 13 weeks (P31-P43) have consistently averaged only ~6.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 77 units, which provides over 11 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate and even covers roughly 2 weeks of the high-volume demand seen in January. Given the proximity to the end of the year and the current high inventory levels (relative to current demand), I will keep lead time at the promised 0 periods and set demand parameters to reflect the recent stable low-volume regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the entire fall/winter stagnation period while ignoring the irrelevant spring/summer fluctuations. This will prevent further ordering until the existing inventory is depleted or demand spikes significantly.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). The product is a lightweight jogger, which is experiencing a prolonged low-demand regime. Since September (Period 31), demand has remained consistently low, averaging approximately 6-7 units per week. The most recent three periods (P42-P44) show demand of 11, 5, and 3, maintaining this low-volume trend into mid-December. With an on-hand inventory of 74 units, we have over 10 weeks of stock at the current consumption rate (~6.6 units/week). Given that the game ends in Period 47, there is a significant risk of incurring unnecessary holding costs on existing stock and no justification for new orders. I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) using the last 14 samples (since Period 31) to reflect this stable, low-demand fall/winter regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which I will continue to utilize.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, entering the Christmas week. Historically, this product (lightweight joggers) saw very high demand in January 2019 (averaging ~260-360 units), but throughout the fall and early December (P31-P45), demand has stagnated at a very low level, averaging ~6 units per week. While a seasonal spike is expected in January, current on-hand inventory is 72 units. At the current demand rate (~6/week), this provides ~12 weeks of cover. Even if demand triples to ~20 units/week during the transition, the 72 units on-hand are sufficient to avoid stockouts without additional orders, especially given the observed 0-period lead time. I will maintain the current mu_hat based on the late-year stagnation (last 10 periods) to avoid over-ordering, as 72 units already significantly exceed the base stock level for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Late-year demand stagnation (Sept-Dec) confirmed: Average demand for P31-P45 is approximately 6.5 units/week, showing no pre-holiday or early winter recovery toward Jan 2019 levels.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the final decision period (P47). The product is 'Joggers in lightweight sweatshirt fabric', which showed high demand in early January 2019 (367, 213, 219, 181, 125 units). However, throughout late 2019 (P31-P46), demand has stagnated at a very low level, averaging 6.4 units per week. Although we are entering the same calendar month as the high-demand historical samples, there is no evidence of a build-up or recovery in the last 15 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (68 units), which covers over 10 weeks of current demand and significantly offsets even a potential spike, the priority is to avoid further holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer in case the January seasonality returns. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 10-week average (approx 5.3 units/week) to keep the base stock calculation realistic relative to current trends, rather than historical spikes that haven't materialized yet. L remains at 0 based on consistent lead time history.
