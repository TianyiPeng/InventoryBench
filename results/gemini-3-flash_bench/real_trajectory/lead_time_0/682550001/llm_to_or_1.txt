Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic' hoodie. Based on the 5 historical demand samples (45, 45, 110, 34, 50), the average demand is 56.8 units per week. The spike of 110 on Jan 21st suggests some volatility, but the most recent 2 weeks (34 and 50) are closer to the mean. With a promised lead time (L) of 0, the backend will target a base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. The profit is $19 and holding cost is $1, leading to a high target service level (q \u2248 0.95), meaning we want to cover roughly the 95th percentile of demand. Since we start with 0 inventory (on-hand + in-transit), the first order will be placed to reach this base stock level. I will use 'default' for L (0) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent volatility for the initial stocking decision.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Jersey Basic' zip-up hoodie. The initial demand samples from Jan/Feb (45, 45, 110, 34, 50) and Period 1's actual demand (37) suggest a baseline demand mean around 53.5 units. The surge to 110 in late January appears to be an outlier or a specific promotion. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0 (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). With 70 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we are reasonably covered for the next period, but we should maintain a base stock to handle the observed volatility. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=6 (including historical samples and Period 1 demand) to capture the current demand regime which seems lower than the early January spike. L=0 is confirmed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU is a 'Uno Hood', a jersey basic sweatshirt. Historical demand data shows five pre-game samples (45, 45, 110, 34, 50) and two game periods (37, 47). The spike of 110 on 2019-01-21 appears to be an outlier or a specific event not currently reflected in the recent trend. The average of the most recent samples (last 5 including game periods: 34, 50, 37, 47) is approximately 42. Since we are in late February moving into March, there is no immediate seasonal peak identified for basic hoodies in this specific context yet. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=5) to smooth out the older 110 spike while being responsive to the recent stable demand of ~40 units. This helps the OR backend maintain a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=1).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4th, 2019. This SKU is a basic zip-up hoodie. The historical demand samples (45, 45, 110, 34, 50) and recent game history (37, 47, 49) show a relatively stable baseline after a large spike on Jan 21st. The mean demand for the most recent 3 game periods is 44.3, which aligns well with the pre-spike January samples. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will use N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this settled post-spike regime. Since it is currently March, we are moving away from deep winter but jersey basics generally maintain steady demand in early spring.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/11. The product is a jersey hoodie (basic). We are moving from late winter into early spring. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (including samples provided) has been: 45, 45, 110, 34, 50, 37 (P1), 47 (P2), 49 (P3), 40 (P4). There was a significant spike of 110 (2019-01-21), but recent performance (P1-P4) is stable around 43 units. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods for P1, P2, and P3 (meaning same-period delivery). No order was placed in P4. On-hand at start of P5 is 18 units. Expected demand for P5 is ~43. To avoid stockouts while maintaining a lean inventory of this basic item, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current stable demand regime (P1-P4 mean = 43.25). L is set to 'calculate' as the 0-period lead time is proven.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a basic hoodie. Historical demand across five given samples (45, 45, 110, 34, 50) and five game periods (37, 47, 49, 40, 34) shows an average demand of approximately 50. Excluding the outlier of 110 on 2019-01-21, the demand is very stable around the 35-50 range. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time consistently equals 0 (orders placed in P1, P2, P3, and P5 arrived the same period). There are no missing shipments or pipeline inventory (In-transit=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is 19 units, which is below the expected period demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at default (0). This will target a base stock sufficient to cover Period 6 demand, given that arrivals occur immediately.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The SKU is a 'Uno Hood' hoodie. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has been stable, averaging approximately 50 units/week. However, Period 6 saw a demand spike to 63, which led to a stockout (ending inventory 0, sold 52). Looking at the calendar, we are entering the transition to spring, where hoodies remain relevant but likely stable. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0. Because we stocked out in Period 6 and demand is slightly increasing (recent 3-period mean is ~46, but excluding the zero-order Period 4 anomaly, recent demand is 49-63), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent mean of ~46.6 units, while maintaining a standard 'default' sigma to ensure a safe buffer. Using N=5 covers the game history while acknowledging the stockout risk.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is a basic zip-up hoodie (Uno Hood), which typically shows stable demand but can experience fluctuations due to weather or sales. Analyzing the history: the promised lead time of 0 periods is consistent across all 7 periods (arrivals occur in the same period as ordering). Demand has been relatively stable, with a notable spike in Period 6 (63 units) that led to a stockout, followed by a correction in Period 7 (43 units). The average demand over the last 5 weeks (Periods 3-7) is 45.8 units, while the full history (12 samples including pre-game) averages 49.5 units. Given the recent stockout in Period 6 and the stable nature of the product, I will use a recent N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat targeting the last 5 periods (roughly the last month) to ensure we are responsive to the most current demand level while capturing the recent volatility. Setting L to default (0 periods) matches the consistent observed lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 682550001 (Uno Hood) is currently in a stockout situation (Ending inventory=0 in Period 8, On-hand=0 at start of Period 9). Historical demand samples and game history show high volatility with recent spikes (P6: 63, P8: 76) compared to the early-year average (~45). The date 2019/4/8 suggests early spring, where casual hoodies remain relevant. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded orders. Given the lost sales in Period 8 (demand 76 vs sold 64), I need to increase the safety stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the game history) to capture the recent higher demand variance. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed spikes rather than the more stable pre-game samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a basic hoodie (Jersey Basic/Divided Basics). Looking at the history, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all completed cycles (ordered and arrived in the same period). Demand has shown some volatility: the average demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 49.7 units, but periods 6 and 8 saw spikes to 63 and 76 respectively, resulting in stockouts. The last period (Period 9) had a demand of 55. Given the stockouts in P6 and P8, the OR backend's service level calculation based on recent volatility is necessary. I will set L to 'calculate' (which has been 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the recent higher demand variance and mean (avg ~56 over last 5 periods) compared to the earlier periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/4/22), we observe the SKU 682550001 (Uno Hood). The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages consistently confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods. Inventory is currently 56 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Demand over the last 10 periods has fluctuated between 26 and 76, with an average of approximately 47 units per period. The most recent demand (P10) was 26, which is lower than the previous weeks, but P8 and P6 showed significant spikes (76 and 63), leading to stockouts. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level. To capture the recent variability while smoothing out the low P10, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (covering the last 5 weeks of demand: 63, 43, 76, 55, 26; mean=52.6) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to ensure the buffer accounts for the volatility seen in P8. L will remain at the promised 0.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a basic hoodie. Historical demand from the initial samples and the first 11 periods shows a generally stable pattern with some volatility (demand ranges from 26 to 110, but mostly oscillates between 30 and 60). Average demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 46.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will continue using recent data to parameterize the OR engine, specifically focusing on the last 5-8 periods to capture current demand levels. I will set N=8 for demand mean and volatility to balance historical stability with recent fluctuations, ensuring sufficient safety stock for a high service level (profit/holding ratio is 19:1).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are looking at a zip-up hoodie (SKU 682550001). Historical demand shows fluctuations but has remained relatively stable within a range (average demand is ~46.5). No clear seasonal spike for May is evident in the data or typical for this product type. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 21 units on hand and 0 in transit. To set the OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 0 periods. 2) mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=12 to average the demand since the start of the simulation (average ~47), covering the one-period review cycle. 3) sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture recent volatility (std dev ~14). This approach maintains a target service level appropriate for the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19/$1).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/13. The product is a 'Jersey Basic' hoodie. Analysis of historical demand (Periods 1-13) shows a stable average of approximately 46 units per period, with no significant seasonal trend yet apparent for mid-May in this category. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. The last four periods (P10-P13) show demand of 26, 38, 54, and 40, leading to a recent mean of 39.5. Given the target service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, I will use a larger N (N=10) to capture the overall stability of the SKU while smoothing out the noise observed in the peak demand periods (e.g., P8 and P6). This will prevent over-ordering on moderate fluctuations while maintaining sufficient safety stock to cover the 0-period lead time effectively.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a hoodie, which typically experiences stable demand with potential minor fluctuations during seasonal transitions. Current date is May 20, 2019 (late spring). Evaluation of historical demand samples (including the initial pre-history data) shows a relatively steady state: Period 1-14 demand has a mean of approximately 45.4 units with a standard deviation of 13.9. Most importantly, the history shows a consistent actual lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all successful orders, confirming the promised lead time holds. Period 14 ended with 40 units on-hand. Since L=0, the target base stock must cover Period 15's demand. The OR backend will calculate the optimal base stock using the profit/holding ratio (q=19/20=0.95). I am using 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the stability of the demand observed throughout the game history while filtering out the distinct pre-game surge (110 units on Jan 21), which appears to be an outlier or a different season.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a SKU 682550001 (Jersey Hoodie). Recent demand (Period 1-15) has averaged 45.1 units per week, showing stability relative to the pre-history mean (approx 56). Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 25 units. There are no missing shipments. As we move into late May and June, demand for jersey hoodies typically remains stable or slightly softens before transitioning to summer items, but no significant regime shift is yet detected in the local data (last 3 periods: 40, 32, 43). I will use a recent window of N=15 to capture the full game history mean while allowing the OR engine to adapt to the slightly lower average compared to the initial pre-history seeds. Setting L=0 as confirmed by all 14 successful arrivals.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic zip-up hoodie. We are entering June, where demand for 'soft brushed inside' hoodies typically softens in most regions. Historical demand average across 16 periods is ~45. However, there's high volatility (last week saw a spike to 82, resulting in a stockout). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and handle moderate volatility while acknowledging the transition into warmer months, I will use a recent_N (N=8) to capture the slightly higher recent activity (Periods 9-16 avg approx 46) compared to the start of the year. I'll maintain a slightly higher sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to protect against spikes like the one seen in Period 16.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a hoodie, which typically experiences lower demand as summer approaches. Historically, demand has fluctuated but shows no clear upward trend (most recent samples: 40, 32, 43, 82, 43). The peak of 82 in Period 16 appears to be a transitory spike. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory is currently at 33 units with zero in-transit. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (mu_hat and sigma_hat) with N=7 to capture the demand behavior over the last two months, allowing the model to adapt to the recent volatility (the spike in P16 followed by a return to mean in P17) without overreacting to the single high demand point. L remains default as 0 is stable.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a lightweight hoodie, which generally sees steady demand throughout the spring and early summer. Observed lead times consistently show L=0 (same-day arrival). Demand has been relatively stable with occasional spikes (e.g., Period 8 and Period 16), but no significant long-term regime shift is evident. Mean demand from the provided historical samples and the 18 periods of play is approximately 45-50 units per period. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to maintain the observed L=0 behavior. For \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 to capture the full range of recent play performance while filtering out very old pre-game samples, ensuring we cover the current season's volatility and mean accurately.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a hoodie, which typically experiences lower demand during the summer months. Recent historical demand (last 10 periods) shows a mean of 45.4 units per period, while the overall average is 46.1. However, the last 3 periods specifically (P17-P19) show a slight cooling trend (avg 38.0). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable-but-moderate demand environment while excluding early volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. The product is a 'Divided Basics' hoodie, which typically experiences lower demand during summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Looking at the history, demand has dropped from a peak in early June (P16: 82 units) to a fairly consistent lower range (last 3 periods: 32, 25 units). I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward summer trend while maintaining enough buffer for occasional spikes. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time. On-hand inventory is 44, and with expected low summer demand, I want the OR backend to target a base stock that avoids overstocking during the off-season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 19: mean weekly demand decreased from ~45 to ~28 during the summer transition.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. The product is a hoodie, which typically sees lower demand during the summer months. As noted in the carry-over insights, a demand regime shift occurred around Period 19, where mean demand dropped from ~45 to ~28. However, Period 21 saw a spike in demand to 54, which resulted in a stockout (ending on-hand: 0). This spike may be a temporary fluctuation or a response to early summer clearances, rather than a full return to high demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the overall lower summer trend, I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat (averaging periods 19, 20, and 21: (32+25+54)/3 = 37) and sigma_hat to capture the recent increase in volatility. This provides a safety buffer against the volatility seen in Period 21 without over-ordering for the remainder of the summer.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jacket in sweatshirt fabric' (hoodie), which typically experiences lower demand during summer. We are currently in mid-July (Period 23). While a previous insight suggested a demand drop in June, recent activity in Period 21 (demand=54) and Period 22 (demand=55) indicates a significant mid-summer spike or volatility, possibly due to summer clearance sales or early back-to-school preparation. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent increase in demand and volatility while staying responsive to shifting trends, I will use a short-window 'recent_N' approach (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the transition from the end of June into July (Periods 19-22: 32, 25, 54, 55).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge observed in July (Periods 21-22): demand increased from avg ~30 to ~55. This offsets the previously noted summer decline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a zip-up hoodie. We are currently in late July (Period 24, 2019/7/22). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed in all recent concluded periods. A demand shift occurred in July: Periods 21-23 showed demands of 54, 55, and 43 (average ~51), which is significantly higher than the previous June regime (average ~28). This likely represents a mid-summer peak or early 'back-to-school' preparation for lightweight layers. Given this sustained increase over the last 3 periods, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volatility and mean. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the current period's demand (L=0, so 1+L=1 period of coverage). With an ending inventory of 24 units and current demand averaging ~50, a significant reorder is expected from the backend.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a zip-up hoodie. We are currently in late July (Period 25). Historically, demand showed a regime shift in mid-June (avg ~28) followed by a July surge (avg ~55 in periods 21-22). The last two periods (23 and 24) have seen demand soften again to 43 and 29 respectively. As we approach August, we should anticipate the 'Back to School' transition, which typically increases demand for basics like hoodies. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the recent variability and the anticipated seasonal uptick, I will use a recent_N window of 4 periods (covering the July surge and the subsequent two weeks) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a balanced forecast that accounts for the higher volatility seen in July while not being overly reactive to a single low-demand week.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26 (August 5, 2019). The product is a zip-up hoodie. Analysis of recent demand shows a shift from the mid-July surge (avg ~55) back towards a varied but stable pattern. Demand in the last five periods (P21-P25) was 54, 55, 43, 29, 48, averaging 45.8 per week. This aligns more with the broad historical average than the summer low previously noted. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is low (18 units), so we need to restock to cover the (L+1) period demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma estimation to capture the current volatility while ignoring the early-summer regime shift that is no longer representative.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-12. The product is a jersey hoodie. Historically, we saw a demand surge in July (avg ~55), but demand in the last two weeks (Periods 25-26) has moderated (48 and 28 respectively). As we move into mid-August, we expect the transition toward late summer / early autumn ('Back to School' season) to begin, which typically favors lightweight outerwear like zip-up hoodies. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Because demand fluctuates between 28 and 55, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture the higher July-August volatility while centering the mean on the current mixed levels. This N=6 window (Periods 21-26) covers the high-demand July surge and the recent cooling, providing a balanced forecast for the upcoming transition.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019 (Period 28). We are transitioning out of the peak summer months. Historically, demand for this hoodie has fluctuated between 25 and 55 units over the last 10 periods, with an average of approximately 40 units (Periods 19-27). The most recent demand (Period 27) was 51 units, following a lower 28 units in Period 26. As we approach late August and early September, we anticipate the 'Back to School' season and cooler weather, which historically drives demand for outerwear like hoodies. Therefore, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (Periods 23-27, average ~40) to capture the recent moderate-to-high volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for rapid response to demand shifts. Setting N=5 for sigma_hat provides a localized volatility estimate to buffer against recent demand spikes seen in Periods 25 and 27.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late July/August (Periods 25-27); demand shifted from avg 30 (Periods 24-26) to 51 (Period 27), likely indicating the start of pre-autumn/back-to-school demand scaling.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019, which is the peak of the back-to-school season for a hoodie (SKU 682550001). Historically, late July into August has shown increased demand volatility (Period 27: 51 units, Period 28: 34 units) compared to the mid-summer average. As we transition into September, cooler weather usually drives higher demand for upper-body garments like hoodies. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To account for the expected seasonal ramp-up and higher volatility, I am using a recent_N window of 8 periods (covering the start of July to now) for mu_hat to capture the shift from summer lows to pre-autumn levels. For sigma_hat, I am using a shorter window (N=5) to more aggressively weight the recent demand spikes in late August.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school seasonal ramp-up confirmed: demand in late August (Periods 25-28) is higher and more volatile than early summer; expect further increases as September approaches.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. The product is a hoodie, which typically experiences a significant seasonal increase in demand during the autumn/winter transition (Back-to-School and cooling weather). Recent history (Periods 25-29) shows high volatility (demand: 48, 28, 51, 34, 18). While Period 29 showed a dip (18), the overall trend in August averaged ~37 compared to the mid-summer average of ~30. Given the September date, I anticipate a regime shift where demand will increase as consumers look for 'garment upper body' items like hoodies. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods. To capture the immediate ramp-up for September without over-reacting to the single low data point in P29, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the August trend (avg ~35.8) but explicitly set mu_hat slightly higher to anticipate the seasonal shift. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased volatility seen in late August.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal transition confirmed: Demand for jersey basics/hoodies is entering a peak autumn regime. Transitioning from August base (avg ~36) to expected higher September levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (Sept 9) marks the entry into the autumn peak for hoodies (SKU 682550001). Historical demand shows a volatile but upward-trending back-to-school pattern since late July. Most recent demand in Period 30 was 50 units. While Period 29 was low (18), the overall trend in August/September aligns with a transition to a higher mean. A review of 'conclude' messages confirms that the actual lead time (L) has remained consistently 0 periods. To capture the current seasonal shift while smoothing out the volatility of the recent weeks, I will use EWMA_gamma=0.3 for mu_hat. This weight acknowledges the high recent demand (50) without overreacting to the single outlier (18). Sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=6 (Periods 25-30) to capture the increased volatility of the current autumn regime (Std Dev ~13.5). This approach ensures the base stock calculation, which uses a 95% service level factor (z* \u2248 1.64), maintains enough stock to meet the expected seasonal peak while minimizing holding costs if demand returns to August averages.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed September seasonal peak for hoodies: Period 30 demand (50) corroborates the transition to high-season demand after the late-August volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in the middle of a confirmed high-demand season for hoodies (September/autumn peak). Over the last five periods (P27-P31), demand has been 51, 34, 18, 50, and 59. While P29 was an outlier at 18, the most recent two periods (50 and 59) strongly signal the move into a higher demand regime as temperatures drop. The on-hand inventory is critically low at 6 units with 0 units in-transit. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. To handle the observed volatility and ensure a high service level during this peak, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent autumn ramp-up (P27-P31), effectively setting the base demand around 42-45 per period. The 19:1 ratio of profit to holding cost ($19 vs $1) justifies holding buffer stock to avoid stockouts in this high-demand window.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product is a zip-up hoodie, which is highly seasonal and enters its peak demand period during the autumn transition (September/October). Period 32 experienced a significant spike in demand (94 units), which far exceeded the available inventory (70 units), resulting in stockouts. This 94-unit demand is a clear signal that the previous 'high-season' estimate (avg ~50-60) was too conservative for the actual September peak. The last 4 weeks of demand (Periods 29-32) are 18, 50, 59, and 94. The mean of these 4 weeks is ~55, but the trend is sharply upward. Specifically, the average of the last 3 weeks (Periods 30-32) is ~68. Given the stockout evidenced in Period 32 and the product's relevance to the cooling weather in late September, I will shift mu_hat to reflect this higher volume. I'll use recent_N with N=3 to capture this immediate peak while maintaining sensitivity to the volatility (sigma_hat). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September peak intensified: Period 32 demand reached 94 (+59% vs previous week), confirming a high-velocity autumn regime for hoodies. Mean demand for the last 3 weeks (P30-P32) has shifted from ~45 to ~68.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2014.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Uno Hood' is experiencing a significant autumn/winter peak. Last period (P33), demand surged to 140 units, resulting in a stockout despite a large order. The last four weeks (P30-P33) show demand of 50, 59, 94, and 140, respectively. This confirms a rapid ramp-up in the hoodie category as we enter October. To capture this growth and avoid further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat to a value of 180, which anticipates continued growth from the P33 level of 140. sigma_hat is set to 50 to handle the high volatility typically associated with seasonal peaks and recent stockouts. Lead time (L) remains 0 as orders consistently arrive within the same period as placed.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn demand acceleration: Demand has increased for four consecutive weeks (P30: 50, P31: 59, P32: 94, P33: 140), confirming a high-velocity peak season for the hoodie SKU.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Uno Hood (682550001) has entered a high-velocity autumn regime as indicated by the September spikes (94 units in P32, 140 in P33). Although Period 34 demand showed a drop to 74 units, this must be interpreted cautiously; it remains significantly higher than the summer average (~35) and likely represents a stabilization at a new high level rather than a return to summer lows. The date is October 7th, which is squarely in the peak season for hoodies. To avoid stockouts during this high-revenue period while acknowledging the P34 variance, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 (P31-P34) to capture the autumn regime shift (average: 91.75 units). Lead time remains consistent at 0. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 189 units due to a large order last period, ensuring we are well-covered for potential demand surges.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime confirmed: Average demand for September/October (P31-P34) is 91.75 units, a 160% increase over the summer baseline (~35).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019, positioning us in the peak autumn season for the 'Uno Hood' SKU. Demand history shows a massive surge in September (P32: 94, P33: 140) which appears to have stabilized into a high-velocity regime in October (P34: 74, P35: 82). The average demand of the last 4 periods (P32-P35) is 97.5 units. Given the transition from early September volatility to more consistent high demand in October, using a recent window (N=4) for mu_hat correctly captures this peak. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to address the high volatility observed during the scale-up (std of P32-P35 is ~29). Lead time has remained consistently 0, so 'calculate' is appropriate. High on-hand inventory (107) exists due to a large order in P34, but current demand levels require sustained high base stock levels to prevent stockouts as we remain in the peak hoodie season.

Carry-over insight: Stabilized autumn high-demand regime: Average demand for the most recent 4 weeks (P32-P35) is ~98 units, confirming a baseline shifted significantly upward from the summer (~35) and initial September ramp-up (~68).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Uno Hood' is currently in its autumn high-demand season (late October). Analysis of the recent demand regime (Periods 32-36) shows a sustained shift: demand values are 94, 140, 74, 82, and 87. The average demand for these last 5 weeks is 95.4 units, which is consistent with the 'stabilized autumn high-demand regime' noted in the Period 36 carry-over insight. Using N=5 for mu_hat captures this specific regime while excluding the earlier ramp-up phase. For sigma_hat, using N=5 accounts for the high variability seen during this peak (e.g., the spike to 140 in P33 and the subsequent stabilization near 80-90). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 60, which is below the expected weekly demand, necessitating an order to maintain the target service level (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Historical data shows that demand for hoodies (SKU 682550001) entered a high-velocity autumn regime in September, with demand peaking at 140 and then stabilizing. For the last 4 periods (P34-P37), demand has been 74, 82, 87, and 96, showing a steady upward trend and a mean of ~85 units. This indicates that while the extreme 140 surge was an outlier, the 'new normal' for October is significantly higher than the summer base. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent sustained high demand while filtering the massive P33 spike, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat (covering the stable October trajectory) and recent_N with N=6 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility without overreacting to the P33 outlier. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for high-profit margins ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: October demand stabilized into a high-velocity regime following the September ramp-up; mean demand for the last 4 weeks (P34-P37) is approx. 85 units, showing a consistent weekly increase.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the peak autumn/winter season for hoodies. Historically, demand for this SKU surged starting in late September (P32-P33) and has stabilized at a high level. In the last four periods (P35-P38), demand has been 82, 87, 96, and 83, yielding a mean of 87 and a standard deviation of 6.2. The 'September peak' noted in previous insights has transitioned into a steady 'October high-velocity regime' which is expected to continue into November. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level for this high-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am focusing on the most recent 4 weeks (P35-P38) to capture the current stabilized high-demand regime, ensuring we cover the expected mean of ~87 units plus a buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: November demand stabilization: Autumn high-demand regime has stabilized in the 80-100 unit range (P35-P38 avg: 87) following the volatile September ramp-up.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in November (Week 40). Looking at recent history, demand significantly ramped up in September and October (range of 74-140) and appears to have stabilized recently. The demand in Period 39 was lower (48) compared to the preceding weeks (83, 96, 87, 82), which might be a one-off fluctuation or the start of a winter stabilization. However, since the product is a hoodie, demand usually remains high throughout the colder months. I will set the demand horizon to look at the last 8 weeks (P32-P39) to capture the full 'Autumn/Early Winter' regime which averages approximately 88.5 units per week. This N=8 window filters out the extreme 140 peak and the most recent 48 dip, providing a balanced baseline for the backend OR engine. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all concluding history, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: November Demand: After the intense September peak, demand has settled into a high-utility baseline. The Period 39 dip (48) is the first significant deviation below 70 units since August, but require more data points to confirm a new regime shift.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the post-peak autumn period for hoodies. Demand has stabilized but shows some cooling compared to the September/October high. Specifically, demand in the last two weeks (P39: 48, P40: 68) is lower than the previous October average of ~87. However, the last 5-week average (P36-P40) is 76.4, which still represents a high-velocity regime. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (N=5) to capture this slight stabilization at a slightly lower level than the peak, while maintaining enough buffer for potential late-autumn volatility. For sigma_hat, recent_N=5 will also be used to reflect the narrowed variance seen in the last 5 weeks compared to the extreme spikes in September. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so L is set to default.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for the Uno Hood (a jersey hoodie) has shown a clear decline over the last three periods (P39: 48, P40: 68, P41: 32). This indicates that the peak autumn high-demand regime, which averaged ~90-100 units from late September through October, is transitioning into a lower-velocity late-autumn/early-winter regime. The mean demand of the last three periods is ~49 units. This drop is significant and sustained enough to warrant a reduction in mu_hat to avoid overstocking and high holding costs. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this most recent downward shift. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the consistent 'conclude' messages appearing in the same period as the order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Autumn peak has ended; demand has decreased from ~85 to ~50 units over the last 3 periods (P39-P41).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). I am managing a hoodie SKU. Demand history shows a clear decline from the autumn high (approx. 90 units) to a lower winter/holiday regime. While Period 42 saw a temporary demand spike to 72, the preceding 3 periods (P39-P41) averaged 49.33 units. Historically, the early-year baseline (Feb/Mar) was also in the 40-50 range. Therefore, I'm setting mu_hat for a regime of approximately 50 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the target base stock (L+1) needs to cover 1 period. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this most recent late-autumn/early-winter behavior, which better represents expected December demand than the long-term history or the peak autumn period. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 4 periods to capture current volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the hoodie SKU (682550001) is clearly in a post-autumn decline, transitioning from the high-velocity September/October peak (~85-100 units) to a significantly lower late-year regime. Recent demand points (P39: 48, P41: 32, P43: 28) show a sustained drop, though P42 (72) was a notable outlier likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday week (Nov 25-Dec 2). Excluding that outlier, the baseline has shifted toward ~35-40 units. Current on-hand is 58 units, which covers nearly two weeks of the current demand pace. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 45 to account for the current lower-demand regime while allowing for some minor holiday-related volatility (sigma_hat=15). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. This strategy prevents overstocking during the end-of-year wind-down whilst maintaining a safe service level for any remaining December interest.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn demand decline confirmed: Dec demand (P41-P43 avg excluding outlier: 30) has returned to summer baseline levels (~35) following the peak season and Black Friday volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). Demand has clearly exited the high-velocity autumn regime and stabilized at a lower level characteristic of the December/holiday period for basic hoodies. Demand over the last 4 periods (P41-P44) has been [32, 72, 28, 46], averaging ~44.5 units, which aligns with the post-autumn decline noted in the Carry-over Insights. The Period 42 spike to 72 was likely related to Black Friday/Cyber Monday volatility. Given that we are now mid-December, I expect demand to remain in this stabilized lower range (~45 units) as the peak gift-shopping season concludes. Leading time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current December baseline while accounting for the recent volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). Demand in the last two periods (P44: 46; P45: 64) has shown a slight uptick compared to the early December average (~30), likely due to last-minute Christmas shopping for jersey basics/hoodies. However, we are now entering the final week of December, where demand traditionally drops significantly post-Christmas. Reviewing the historical data for the start of the year (Jan 7: 45, Jan 14: 45), a baseline of approx. 45 units is expected for January. Given the current on-hand inventory of 14 units and a lead time of 0, I will set mu_hat to 45 to align with the post-holiday baseline observed in early 2019 samples. Sigma_hat is set using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture recent volatility without overreacting to the P45 spike. Lead time remains 'default' (0) as all historical orders have arrived within the same period.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday stabilization: Demand is returning to the early-year baseline of ~45 units after the mid-December holiday spike (P45: 64).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that the high-velocity autumn/early-winter peak has ended. Product (Hoodie) demand is returning to a stable post-holiday baseline. Over the last three weeks (P44-P46), demand has averaged 45.67 units (46, 64, 27), which aligns with the early-year baseline of ~45. Period 46 saw a dip to 27, likely after the Christmas peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while demand settles, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this immediate post-peak regime. This level provides sufficient buffer for the current on-hand inventory of 54 units.
