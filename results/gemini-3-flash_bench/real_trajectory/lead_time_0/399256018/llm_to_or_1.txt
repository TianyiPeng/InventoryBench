Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 399256018, which is a pair of women's skinny ankle jeans. Historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a clear upward trend (72, 81, 87, 104, 149), suggesting a demand regime shift or strong seasonality leading into spring. The most recent demand (149) is significantly higher than the average. To capture this momentum, I will use a mu_hat based on an explicit forecast. Calculating the average of recent samples (104 and 149) gives ~126.5. Including L=0, mu_hat = (1+0) * 126.5. Given the trend is accelerating, I'll set mu_hat explicitly to 150 to ensure adequate stock for the upcoming period. Sigma_hat is calculated explicitly based on recent volatility (approx 25). Promised lead time is 0, so I will use the default L.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18) for Women's Ankle-length jeans. The historical demand shows a clear upward trend leading into mid-February: 72, 81, 87, 104, 149, and most recently 195. This matches the known fashion retail cycle where Spring collections begin to see increased demand in February. Lead time for the previous order was 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, Period 1 ended with a stockout (172 units available vs 195 demanded), meaning current on-hand is 0. To capture the recent accelerating growth, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will base the forecast on the latest three samples (104, 149, 195) to better track the current regime rather than the lower January levels. L is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Weekly demand increased from under 100 in January to 195 by mid-February, indicating seasonal growth for women's bottoms.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of women's ankle-length jeans, a staple item. Current date is 2019-02-25. Historical data from Jan-Feb shows a clear upward trend (72, 81, 87, 104, 149) and the first two simulated periods confirm a new demand level (195, 179). The mean demand of the last 3 samples (149 from Feb 4, 195 from P1, and 179 from P2) is approximately 174. Given the seasonal nature of spring apparel, demand is likely to remain elevated or continue to grow. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is low (9 units) after P2 sold out nearly all stock. I will use recent_N=3 to capture the recent regime shift in demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use default (promised lead time 0) for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~180-190 units/week following seasonal growth in early February (last two actual samples: 195, 179).

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is a women's ankle-length jean. Historical demand shows a seasonal shift from ~80-100 in January to an average of ~187 in early to mid-February. However, Period 3 saw a significant drop to 119 units. Looking at the date (2019/3/4), this corresponds with the post-Valentine's/early March lull often seen in fashion retail before spring/Easter peaks. The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by the arrival history (all orders arrived the same period). Given the recent drop, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility (195, 179, 119) rather than relying on the very low values from January. L is set to default as the promised 0-day lead time is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in March: Period 3 demand dropped to 119 units, deviating from the ~180-190 trend established in February.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 399256018 (Ankle-length jeans) showed a seasonal peak in February (averaging ~187 units), but has experienced a significant decline over the last two weeks (119 and 96 units). This suggests that the early seasonal peak for this specific wash or style of trousers has passed, or consumer interest is shifting. On-hand inventory is currently high at 103 units, which is greater than the most recent period's demand. I am switching mu_hat to a recent_N method with N=3 to capture this downward trend (averaging ~131 units) while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to capture the increased volatility observed throughout the transition from the peak to the current lower demand phase. The lead time remains 0 based on consistent order arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-February peak, weekly demand has declined significantly from ~180-190 units to an average of 107.5 units over the first two weeks of March (Periods 3 and 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. Demand for this SKU (Womens Ankle-length jeans) has shown a clear downward trend since the mid-February peak (~180-195 units/week). The last three actual demand observations are 119, 96, and 85, confirming a shift to a lower demand regime as the early spring peak fades. The current mean for the last three periods is 100 units/week. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). The backend OR parameters will be set to reflect this lower mid-March demand to avoid excessive holding costs as inventory build-up is a risk. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this downward momentum and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility levels (~17.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Weekly demand has settled into a lower range (average ~100 units/week) compared to the February peak of ~185.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. Based on the product description (Women's Skinny Ankle Jeans) and historical demand data, we have moved past a February peak (avg ~187) into a more stable March regime. Recent demand over the last four periods has been 119, 96, 85, and 101, averaging approximately 100 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they were placed. The 'Period 6 conclude' shows ending on-hand inventory is 14 units with 0 in-transit. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this updated demand regime of ~100 units/week. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time has consistently been 0, I will use the 'default' method for L. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to reflect the current period-to-period volatility of the post-peak demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans spiked significantly in Period 7 (2019/3/25) to 211 units, which is double the previous several periods' average (~100). This likely corresponds to a spring fashion peak as April begins. Our on-hand inventory was completely depleted, resulting in lost sales. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 7 periods. Given the sharp increase in demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture the most recent spike (211 units) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high for the coming week, moving away from the lower levels seen in March. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this most recent period will help the OR backend adjust to this new seasonal demand level.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand spike detected: Period 7 demand surged to 211 units, up from a previous 4-week average of ~100 units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256018' (Womens Everyday Trousers) is experiencing significant demand volatility typical of the spring season. After a sharp spike to 211 units in Period 7 (2019/3/25), Period 8 demand moderated to 144 units. The historical data (samples + game history) shows a pattern: Jan (~90), Feb (~185), early Mar (~100), and now a late Mar/April surge (avg ~177 over last two weeks). On-hand inventory is 125 units with zero in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture the current elevated spring demand level (average of 211 and 144 is ~177.5). Given L=0, mu_hat should reflect demand for the current period. I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed through the recent spike and subsequent drop, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient buffer to avoid another stockout like the one in Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand volatility confirmed: Demand surged to 211 in late March and moderated to 144 in early April, establishing a higher but volatile baseline compared to the March average of ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $343.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256018' (Womens Trousers) has entered a volatile Spring demand phase. Since Period 7 (late March), lead times have consistently been 0 periods. Demand surged to 211 (P7), then moderated to 144 (P8) and 113 (P9). This suggests the initial spring spike is tapering as we enter mid-April. Over the last 3 periods (P7-P9), the mean demand is 156.0 with a standard deviation of approximately 50. Setting N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the model to capture this recent higher-volatility spring regime while beginning to adjust for the tapering demand seen in the most recent period. Current on-hand inventory is 109 units, which is nearly a full week's coverage at current rates; the backend policy will calculate the required restock based on the 156/week baseline provided by the recent_N method to maintain service levels without excessive holding costs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 9 and 10) has moderated to 113 and 88 units respectively, following a spring peak of 211 in late March. The current period date is 2019/04/22. Historically, the demand for this SKU (ankle-length jeans) spiked in February and late March. We are currently seeing a post-peak settling. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 10 completed cycles. With a high on-hand inventory of 111 (higher than the most recent demand), the priority is to avoid overstocking while maintaining coverage for the upcoming week. I will use a 3-period average (N=3) for demand (mu_hat) to capture this most recent cooling trend (Avg ~115) and a default lead time of 0. Sigma_hat is set using N=3 to reflect the moderate current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: April demand has cooled significantly from the late March spike (211), averaging ~100 units over the last two weeks (Periods 9-10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is women's skinny ankle jeans. Demand has stabilized following the late March spring spike (211 units). Over the last three weeks (Periods 9, 10, and 11), demand has been 113, 88, and 89 respectively, averaging 96.6 units. This confirms the 'Demand regime shift' noted in Period 11, where demand returned to the ~100 units/week baseline observed in early March. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 50 and there is no in-transit stock, an order is needed to meet the expected demand of ~100 units. I am setting N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent stable baseline (Periods 9-11) while excluding the volatile late March data. I will set sigma_hat to the same recent period to reflect current lower volatility compared to the high-variance spring spike period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Late April demand (Periods 9-11) has settled at a mean of ~97 units/week, reversing the volatility seen in late March.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, transitioning into the summer season for 'Womens Everyday Trousers'. Historical demand shows a cooling period through mid-to-late April (averaging ~97 units from Periods 9-11), followed by a sudden spike to 132 units in Period 12 (Apr 29). This spike likely indicates the start of pre-summer peak demand for ankle-length denim. Current on-hand inventory is 0 after stock-out in Period 12. Although the recent mean is lower, the most recent datum (132) and the seasonality of 'ankle-length jeans' in May warrant a more aggressive forecast. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (covering Periods 9-12) to capture the recent upward movement while balancing it against the preceding weeks, and use explicit sigma to account for the increasing volatility observed in pre-seasonal spikes.

Carry-over insight: Early May demand spike detected: Period 12 demand rose to 132 units from a 3-week stable average of ~97, likely signaling early summer seasonality for ankle-length jeans.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the product experienced significant stockouts for the second consecutive week, selling 127 units with 0 ending inventory and actual demand for Period 13 recorded at 130. This confirms a new demand regime identified in the Period 13 carry-over insight (Average ~131 units over Periods 12-13). As we move deeper into May (May 13), demand for 'Skinny Ankle jeans' is likely benefiting from warmer weather seasonality, transitioning from the April stabilization (~97 units) to a higher baseline. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To ensure we capture this growth and minimize stockouts (which have occurred in both Periods 12 and 13), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot directly to the current May performance level.

Carry-over insight: May seasonality confirmed: Weekly demand shifted from an April average of ~97 units to a May average of ~131 units (+35%) over the last two periods (P12-P13).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256018 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a May seasonal regime. History shows a clear escalation from April's average (~97 units) to a higher May baseline. Although Period 14 (May 13) recorded a slightly lower demand of 106 units, the three-period average for May (Periods 12-14) is approximately 122.6 units. This confirms the earlier insight of a +30% growth compared to April. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, allowing for highly reactive ordering. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition into the May sales volume while accounting for the moderate volatility (132, 130, 106). This period's focus is to restore safety stock levels after the stockouts in Periods 12 and 13.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256018' (Womens Ankle-length jeans) is currently in a stable May demand regime following a seasonal increase from April. Over the last four periods (P12-P15), demand has been 132, 130, 106, and 110, resulting in a mean of 119.5 units/week. This represents a confirmed shift from the previous April average of approximately 97 units. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels are low at 25 units on-hand with nothing in-transit, following a period where demand (110) was nearly equal to the starting inventory + arrival (135). To maintain service levels during this May/June seasonal window, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 weeks (N=4) to capture this stabilized higher demand baseline, while allowing the OR backend to calculate volatility (sigma_hat) from the same recent period to account for the variation between the early May spikes (~130) and the mid-May moderation (~108).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in May (P12-P15) at a mean of 119.5 units/week, up from the April average of ~97 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. The product is skiny ankle-length jeans, which historically saw a demand increase in May (avg ~119.5). However, the most recent period (P16) showed a slight dip to 100 units. Early June represents a transition into full summer demand for this category. Analyzing the 'May regime' (P12-P16), demand has averaged 115.6 units with moderate volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (all historical orders arrived in the same period). Given the seasonal nature of ankle-length jeans in June, I will maintain parameters aligned with the stabilized May average to ensure sufficient stock for potential summer demand while preventing excessive inventory costs, given the $1/unit/period holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand for these ankle-length jeans showed a stabilized regime throughout May (Periods 12-16) with a mean of approximately 119.5 units. However, the last two periods (P16 and P17) have shown a decline to 100 and 79 units respectively. This drop likely reflects a transition out of the peak late-Spring demand into a mid-summer phase where long trousers may see reduced interest. The Lead Time is consistently 0 periods. To account for this recent downward trend while maintaining enough safety stock for potential volatility, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=4 (covering the tail end of May and the start of June) to capture the cooling demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the decreased volatility observed in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Early June demand (P16-P17) has decreased to an average of 89.5 units, down from the May average of ~120 units, suggesting a seasonal slowdown for denim trousers as summer progresses.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 399256018 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) shows a clear downward seasonal trend into June. Demand in Period 18 dropped to 52 units, following values of 79 and 100. The average demand over the last three periods (P16-P18) is 77 units, and the average of the last two periods (P17-P18) is 65.5 units. Given the transition into mid-summer, a continued lower demand regime is expected. I am setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining a small buffer for volatility. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently verified by history, so L remains at 'default'.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: June demand (P16-P18) has declined to an average of 77 units/week, down from the May average of ~120 units, reflecting late-season slowdown for these specific jeans.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a pair of skinny ankle-length jeans, which has seen a sustained demand decline since late May. In June, demand dropped from a May average of ~120 units to a June average (Periods 16-19) of 71.75 units (100, 79, 52, 56). The most recent two periods (P18-P19) show even lower demand averaging 54 units. As summer progresses, interest in full-length denim often wanes in favor of lighter clothing. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat to capture the June slowdown (average ~72) while giving slightly more weight to the low values of the last two weeks (52, 56) to avoid overstocking during this clear downward seasonal trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 42, which is close to the recent demand levels, so the OR backend should order only enough to reach the lower base stock level reflecting the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late June: Average weekly demand has dropped to ~54 units (P18-P19), continuing the decline from the June average of ~72 units and May average of ~120 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256018' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is showing a clear seasonal decline characteristic of denim as summer heat intensifies (July 1st). Demand has consistently dropped from a May average of ~120 to a late June low. Specifically, the last three periods show demands of 52, 56, and 29. The most recent demand (29) indicates the regime has shifted even lower than the previous ~54 units/week forecast. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (which are $1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the most recent 3-period average (~46 units) to catch the downward trend without over-reacting to a single week (29), while using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the lowered volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for July: Demand has dropped significantly, with the most recent sample at 29 units, suggesting a seasonal trough for ankle-length jeans in high summer (P18-P20 average ~46 units).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans is in a confirmed seasonal trough as of early July. The demand over the last four periods (P18-P21) has been 52, 56, 29, and 32, with an average of 42.25 units/week. Specifically, the last two weeks have stabilized around 29-32 units. Given the transition into high summer (July), a significant demand rally is unlikely for this specific SKU. Current on-hand inventory is 30 units, which almost perfectly matches the most recent weekly demand. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat to reflect this current low-demand regime using the last 4 weeks (N=4) to capture the stabilization after the June decline, while keeping L at the default (0). This will result in a lean inventory position, minimizing holding costs while meeting the current low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in seasonal trough (July): Average weekly demand for P20-P21 is ~30.5 units, down from the June average of ~62.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Skinny Ankle Jeans', which are highly seasonal. We are currently in mid-July (Period 23), which is a historical seasonal trough for this SKU as consumer interest shifts away from denim trousers during the height of summer. Demand has been steadily declining from a May average of ~120 to a June average of ~62, and now a July average (P20-P22) of approximately 33.3 units/week. The most recent demand sample was 39. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs during this low-demand period while maintaining a sufficient service level for the $4 profit margin, I am setting the demand parameters based on the most recent 4-period regime (P19-P22), where mean demand is approximately 39 units. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current 15 units on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in seasonal trough (July): Average weekly demand for P19-P22 is ~39 units, confirming the significant decline from June levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256018 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a seasonal trough typical for late July. Demand has stabilized significantly over the last four periods (P20-P23) with values of 29, 32, 39, and 37, resulting in a mean of 34.25 units. This is a sharp decline from May/June levels. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability and low volume of this current regime, I am choosing N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific trough. The OR backend needs to maintain a low inventory profile to avoid holding costs on a low-margin ($4 vs $1 holding cost) item during its off-season. Current on-hand is 13, and recent demand is ~35, so a modest replenshment is appropriate to meet upcoming demand without overstocking.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399256018 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) has stabilized in its seasonal trough throughout July. The demand samples for the last five periods (P20-P24) are 29, 32, 39, 37, and 30, resulting in a mean of 33.4 units/week with low volatility. Given the current date is late July (2019/7/29), we expect this low-demand regime to persist as consumers typically shift away from denim trousers during the height of summer. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stable, low-volume baseline while maintaining a lean inventory to minimize holding costs, especially since on-hand inventory is already at 9 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th (Period 26). The product is 'Skinny Ankle Jeans', which typically experiences a seasonal trough in July. Historical demand data shows a significant decline from May (~120 units/week) and June (~72 units/week) to a very stable July/early August trough. The last five demand samples (P21-P25) are 32, 39, 37, 30, and 29, yielding a mean of 33.4 units/week with very low variance. Back-to-school shopping may trigger a demand increase later in August, but as of the most recent data (P25), demand remains in the trough. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime while remaining responsive to any slight uptick that might signal the start of the next season. The base stock calculation will ensure service level while minimizing holding costs for this low-margin/high-holding cost ratio ($4 profit vs $1 holding).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for Period 26 (2019/8/5) shows a significant spike to 74 units, which is more than double the average of the previous four periods (P22-P25 average ~34). This suggests the beginning of a late-summer/fall transition regime, where demand for ankle-length jeans typically recovers from the July trough. The system currently has 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory after the stockout in P26. I am shifting the target demand (mu_hat) to reflect this new upward trend by using the last 3 samples (P24-P26), which average 44.3 units. Using N=3 captures the sharp increase while tempering it slightly to avoid over-ordering on a single-point anomaly. Lead time remains stable at 0. Volatility (sigma_hat) is set using recent_N=3 to account for the sudden shift in variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: August demand (Period 26) surged to 74 units, ending the late-summer seasonal trough (P22-P25 average ~34 units). This likely signals a pre-fall seasonal recovery.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256018 (Women's Ankle-length jeans) is entering a pre-fall seasonal recovery. Demand in Period 26 (74) and Period 27 (75) has jumped significantly from the late-summer trough (average demand ~34). This confirms a new regime shift. Between Period 26 and Period 27, demand has stabilized at ~74.5 units/week. Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0, I need to set parameters that capture this new level while providing enough safety stock for the high volatility typically seen at the start of a new seasonal peak (as seen in the Spring spike in Periods 7-8). I am using recent_N with N=2 to focus exclusively on this new August recovery phase for mu_hat, and N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the transition volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall recovery confirmed: Demand in Periods 26-27 stabilized at ~74.5 units/week, up from the July average of ~34 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' is experiencing a pre-fall seasonal recovery. Demand increased from a July average of ~34 units to 74, 75, and 85 over the last three periods (P26-P28). This confirms a sustained recovery trend. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this new regime for the mu_hat calculation (mean of last 3 samples: 78). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all history. Sigma_hat is also updated using recent_N to reflect the current, slightly higher volatility in this recovery phase. Current on-hand is low (12), but the OR backend will calculate the necessary order based on the new base stock derived from these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall demand recovery confirmed (Late August): Weekly demand has stabilized at ~78 units (P26-P28), more than double the July average of ~34.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Historically, this SKU (skinny ankle jeans) showed a pre-fall recovery in August, with demand rising from a July trough of ~34 units to an average of ~78 units across Periods 26-28. However, Period 29 showed a significant drop to 45 units. This could be a temporary fluctuation or a shift in the recovery trend as we enter September. Given the 'Womens Everyday Collection' and 'Ankle-length jeans' description, we are likely entering a peak season (Back-to-School/Fall). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To manage the recent volatility (74, 75, 85, then 45), I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the August-September transition average (~70 units) while using a slightly wider sigma_hat window (N=5) to account for the variability seen during the recovery phase. This ensures we stay responsive to the seasonally expected autumn demand while tempering the reaction to a single low-demand period (P29).

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Pre-fall recovery volatility observed; Period 29 demand dropped to 45 units compared to the August average of ~78, suggesting potential stabilization or shifting trends as September begins.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256018' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently transitioning from a late-summer trough into a pre-fall demand pattern. Recent demand data shows a surge in August (P26: 74, P27: 75, P28: 85), followed by a dip in early September (P29: 45, P30: 58). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 67.4 units. Given we are entering mid-September, demand typically stabilizes or begins to climb slightly for 'Womens Everyday' autumn wear. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the pre-fall level while smoothing the recent volatility. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect historical performance and mu_hat using the last 5 samples to provide a base stock that covers the ~67 units/week average.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall demand baseline established: Average demand for late August/early September (P26-P30) is ~67 units/week, significantly higher than the July trough of ~34 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256018' (skinny ankle jeans) is currently in a pre-fall demand phase. Demand in Period 31 was 86 units, following a volatile early September where demand fluctuated between 45 and 86. The average demand for the last five periods (P27-P31) is ~69.8 units. The stockout in Period 31 (sold 81, demand 86) indicates that current supply is slightly trailing the recovery. Given the transition into late September, I expect demand to remain stable or slightly increase as fall shopping continues. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this post-August recovery average (approx 70 units per period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the recent volatility (range 45-86). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in the pre-fall demand phase for skinny ankle jeans. Demand over the last 7 periods (P26-P32) has been 74, 75, 85, 45, 58, 86, and 60. This averages to approximately 69 units/week, which is a significant recovery from the July trough (~34) but remains volatile. The recent_N approach (N=7) is appropriate here to capture this post-August recovery regime while smoothing out the week-to-week volatility (ranging from 45 to 86). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. I will maintain L=0 and use N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure we have enough stock to meet this higher demand baseline while protecting against the observed high variance.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer recovery stabilized (P26-P32): Demand remains volatile but has established a higher baseline of ~69 units/week (Range: 45-86) compared to the July low of ~34.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans. Current date is September 30, entering October. Historical data shows a post-summer recovery starting in August (P26), with demand averaging ~73 units over the last 8 periods (P26-P33). However, Period 33 demand surged to 101 units, indicating a potential upward shift as we enter the peak fall retail season. The service level for this item is relatively high (Profit $4 / Holding $1, roughly 80%), justifying a slight stock buffer. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the post-summer recovery trend (P26-P33) for mu_hat, while allowing the OR backend to handle the slightly higher volatility (45-101 range) observed in this regime. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer recovery stabilized (P26-P33): Demand has established a higher baseline of ~73 units/week compared to the July low of ~34, with a recent spike to 101 units in P33 suggesting fall seasonality.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256018 (Ankle-length jeans) is currently in a fall demand regime. Since late August (Period 26), demand has shifted from a summer trough of ~34 units/week to a higher baseline. Specifically, over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), average demand is ~73.6 units/week. More recently, in the last 4 periods (P31-P34), demand has averaged 81.75 units (86, 60, 101, 80), showing increased volatility and a slight upward trend as we enter October. The most recent demand (P34) was 80 units. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for the recent volatility and the risk of stockouts during fall demand spikes (like the 101 units in P33), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current 80+ unit pace, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the higher volatility observed in the last month compared to the summer period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 33-35) has been consistent with a fall recovery baseline, averaging approximately 85 units per week (101, 80, 73). Period 35 demand (73) shows a slight cooling from the late September peak of 101, but remains significantly above the summer trough. The system on-hand inventory is 24 units. Since the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 0. For \u03bc\u0302, I am using a recent window (N=3) to capture the current fall demand level (average ~85), ensuring the base stock covers localized demand volatility while maintaining a healthy service level. \u03c3\u0302 is set using the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime confirmed (Periods 33-35): Weekly demand has stabilized at ~85 units/week, up from the August/early September average of ~67 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256018 is currently in a stable fall demand regime. Since Period 33, demand has averaged 81.25 units (P33: 101, P34: 80, P35: 73, P36: 71). The trend shows a slight cooling from the late September peak of 101, settling around 70-75 units in the most recent two periods. In terms of lead time, all recorded shipments since Period 1 have maintained an actual lead time of 0 periods, consistent with the promised lead time. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this stabilized fall baseline while moving away from the higher September spike. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for current volatility. L remains at the default (0) as reinforced by history.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime stabilized (Periods 33-36) at an average of ~81 units/week, with a most recent 2-week baseline of ~72 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256018' (Skinny Ankle Trousers) is currently in a stable fall demand regime. Recent demand samples for Periods 34-37 are 80, 73, 71, and 84, resulting in a 4-period average of 77 units/week. Since the last regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (Period 36) established a baseline of ~81-85 units, the recent performance aligns well with this target. The promised lead time of 0 periods has remained consistent across all 37 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable fall baseline while allowing for slight fluctuations in weekly demand. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock that covers the expected demand and a reasonable safety buffer without excessive holding costs, given the current on-hand inventory of 9 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The product is women's skinny ankle jeans, which typically experience stable demand in late fall before holiday peaks. Since Period 33, demand has stabilized in a 'Fall' regime ranging between 69 and 101, with a recent average (P34-P38) of 75.4 units. The most recent demand was 69 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this fall baseline (P33-P38 mean: 79.6) and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to account for the moderate volatility (std \u2248 11). This will ensure sufficient stock for the current stable period while avoiding excessive holding costs before potential winter shifts.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256018 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) has maintained a stable fall demand regime. Over the last five periods (P35-P39), demand has averaged 72 units per week (73, 71, 84, 69, 63), confirming the stabilization noted in the carry-over insights. Total inventory currently stands at 27 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Given the lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, the objective is to maintain a base stock that covers the upcoming period's demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand level while accounting for the moderate volatility observed in October. This provides a balanced buffer for the OR backend to compute an order that replenishes on-hand inventory to meet the expected 70-80 unit demand range.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime stabilized further in late October/early November (P35-P39) with an average of 72 units per week, slightly lower than the early October peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is a pair of skinny ankle-length jeans. Demand has been steadily declining from the late October peak (~80 units) to a current 3-week average of 60.3 units (P38: 69, P39: 63, P40: 49). This consistent downward trend indicates a shift away from fall seasonality towards a late-year slowdown, which is typical for this product category as winter approaches. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history. I am setting L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture this current cooling trend (average of last 4 samples is 66.25, giving a mu_hat of ~66). For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=6 to capture the volatility of the transition from late October to November.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: November demand has declined from the October average of ~72 units to an average of ~56 units over the last two weeks (P39-P40), reflecting a late-fall seasonal slowdown.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans is currently in a late-fall seasonal slowdown. Over the last three periods (P39-P41), demand has been 63, 49, and 61 units, respectively, averaging approximately 58 units/week. This is a significant drop from the October average of ~72 units/week. Given the product (ankle-length jeans) and the approaching winter season, a further decline or sustained lower level is expected until any potential holiday clearance or spring resurgence. Promised lead time is 0 and has remained consistent. I am setting L to default (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture this November demand shift (N=3 reflects Periods 39-41). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that inventory levels can settle into without excessive holding costs during the seasonal trough.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime confirmed: Average weekly demand has decreased to ~58 units (P39-P41), down from the October average of ~72 units, indicating a seasonal transition toward winter lows for ankle-length denim.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 42 surged to 114 units, significantly higher than the previous 3-week average of ~58 units (P39-P41). This spike coincides with late November/early December (December 2nd decision date), which likely reflects Cyber Monday or early holiday shopping traffic for this item. Given this sudden departure from the November slowdown, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this upward momentum (averaging the spike of 114 with the preceding values of 61 and 49) while remaining cautious of over-ordering if this is a single-week event. On-hand inventory is 0, and the lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand rose to 114 units from a November average of ~58, likely due to Cyber Monday/holiday seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256018' is an ankle-length skinny jean. Period 44 (2019/12/9) is in the mid-December holiday season. We observed a significant demand spike in Period 42 (114 units), followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (48 units). This volatility is typical around major promotional events like Cyber Monday (observed in P42). Historically, early-to-mid December demand for jeans often fluctuates before another potential late-December gift-giving surge. The lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. To balance the risk of high holding costs against potential holiday demand recurrence, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3. This captures the current volatile window (114, 48, and the preceding 61) to create a centered forecast. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 (P39-P43) to better capture the recent increase in variance compared to the stable October period. Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods through P43.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: Observed a 114-unit spike (P42) followed by a 48-unit drop (P43), indicating high variance in the December demand regime compared to the stable November baseline (~58 units).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for the SKU (ankle-length jeans) has shown a significant holiday spike in P42 (114) followed by a return to lower levels in P43-P44 (48, 47). This pattern suggests that the initial holiday surge has passed, and we are likely entering the post-holiday/pre-Christmas stabilization phase. The November average (excluding the spike) was approximately 58 units. Given the recent two weeks of stable demand (48 and 47), I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P42-P44) to capture the spike while heavily weighting the subsequent drop. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on an average of (114+48+47)/3 = 69.6 units per period. With L=0, the OR engine needs mu_hat for one period. Sigma_hat is calculated similarly using recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility introduced by the P42 spike, ensuring the safety stock can handle any secondary pre-Christmas surges without excessive holding costs for the year-end close.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). Following the holiday demand spike (P42, 114 units), demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P43-P45) at an average of 48 units per week (48, 47, 49). This indicates a post-holiday demand plateau as we approach the end of the year. The inventory position is healthy with 53 units on-hand. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the consistent ~48 units/week trend while accounting for the low volatility observed in the last 3 samples. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new, stable post-peak regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Weekly demand has settled at ~48 units (Periods 43-45) following the early December spike.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30 (Period 47). The demand has stabilized at a lower post-holiday level, with an average of approximately 46.25 units over the last four periods (P43-P46: 48, 47, 49, 41). The early December spike (114 units) was successfully navigated and demand has now reverted to a consistent winter baseline. On-hand inventory is currently at 12 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a lean inventory while ensuring high service levels for this stable demand regime, I am setting L to default (0), and using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent post-holiday stability without the influence of the Cyber Monday surge.
