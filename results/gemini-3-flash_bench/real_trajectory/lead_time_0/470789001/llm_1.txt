Historical demand (Jan-Feb 2019) shows a range of 69-105 units with a mean of approximately 92.4 units per week. The date is Feb 11, 2019, which is the week leading up to Valentine's Day (Feb 14), a period typically seeing higher demand for lingerie. Given a promised lead time of 0 periods, an order placed today should arrive this same period and satisfy current demand. Current stock is 0. To cover the anticipated Valentine's week demand (which might peak slightly above the historical average of ~92) and maintain a buffer for next week (Feb 18, post-holiday regression), I will order 120 units. This serves to fulfill immediate demand and establish a modest safety stock, balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost risk.",

Since Period 46 demand was 79 (down from 94 and 103), I anticipate a further slight decrease as the holiday season concludes, settling toward the early-year baseline of ~80-90 units seen in January/February of the previous year. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Inventory on hand is 21 units. To cover an expected demand of ~80-90 units for Period 47 while maintaining a small safety buffer (aiming for ~100 total availability), I will order 80 units.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-holiday decay detected: December demand peaked at 103 and has fallen for two consecutive weeks (94, 79). Expected transition back to a stable baseline of 80-90 units for January.",
