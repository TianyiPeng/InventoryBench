Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the Gyda blouse. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to establish an initial order. The product is a women's blouse, which is generally a staple but influenced by spring seasonality. Historical demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) are: 162, 139, 126, 85, 138. The mean of these 5 samples is 130 and the standard deviation is approximately 28.5. Since we are entering mid-February, demand for spring attire like blouses typically maintains or increases. The promised lead time is 0. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (matching the provided history) to capture the base demand level while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock level reflecting the cost ratio (Profit $4 / Holding $1 -> roughly an 80% service level).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a 'Gyda blouse', a staple women's garment. Historical demand has been fairly consistent, ranging from 85 to 162 with an average of 131. The Period 1 demand was 113. No major seasonal spikes are immediately expected in mid-February, though we are approaching the transition to Spring. The actual lead time observed in Period 1 was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will maintain L=0. For demand forecasting, I'll use the average of all available samples (including the most recent Period 1) to derive mu_hat and sigma_hat, as there is no evidence of a regime shift yet (N=6 total samples).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th. We have historical demand samples for the Gyda blouse (a soft weave blouse) showing weekly demand of 162, 139, 126, 85, 138, and most recently 113 (P1) and 144 (P2). The mean of the historical samples and recent performance is approximately 130 units. The promised lead time is 0, and the actual lead time observed in Periods 1 and 2 was indeed 0. On-hand inventory is very low at 6 units. To ensure high service levels while accounting for the current on-hand position, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (N=5 covers the shift back to higher demand seen in P2 and the pre-game data) and use recent_N for sigma to capture the current volatility. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $564.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand shows a consistent upward trend: 85 (Jan 28), 138 (Feb 4), 113 (P1), 144 (P2), and 174 (P3). The inventory is currently 0, and lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To meet the increasing demand and avoid stockouts observed in Period 3 (sold 141 out of 174 demand due to inventory limits), I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=3. This focuses on the last 3 weeks where demand averaged 143.7, though I'll go higher because the trend is sharply linear (+30 units/week). I will use explicit mu_hat to capture the expected demand of ~200 for this period and a higher sigma_hat to buffer against volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand growth regime: demand increased from ~100 to 174 over the last 4 weeks (+74%); lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a women's blouse. Historically, we saw a demand surge in Period 3 (174 units) followed by a slight decrease in Period 4 (150 units), though Period 4 demand might have been constrained by earlier stockouts influencing the backend's data. Looking at the pre-start samples, the mean was approximately 130. Recent demand (Periods 1-4) has averaged 145.25. Given the product type (blouse) and the arrival of Spring in March, we are in a high-demand seasonal window. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 3's demand of 174 was the peak and Period 4 stayed high at 150, I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat covering the last 4 periods to capture this shifted regime (average ~145). For sigma_hat, I will also use the last 4 periods to capture the increased volatility (ranging from 113 to 174). With L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*mean, and sigma_hat represents sqrt(1+0)*std.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th (Period 6). The product is a women's blouse, which experiences seasonal demand as people update their spring wardrobes. Demand over the last 5 periods (113, 144, 174, 150, 168) shows a significantly higher level compared to the initial historical samples (averaging ~125). In Period 5, we stock-outed slightly (sold 167 against a demand of 168), leaving 0 on-hand. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods across all recent orders. To maintain a high service level for this growth phase and accommodate potential spring peaks, I will use recent demand (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current mean (~150) and volatility rather than the much lower historical start of the year.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime shift confirmed (P1-P5): Mean demand increased to 150 from initial ~125 (+20%) during the transition into Spring retail season.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. We are entering the peak Spring retail season for women's blouses. Historical demand since Period 1 has fluctuated with a notable mean of approximately 144.5 units per period. Specifically, the last three periods (P4-P6) show demand of 150, 168, and 118, averaging 145.3 units. The dip in Period 6 (118) follows a high demand period where we stocked out (P5 demand was 168+), suggesting some demand volatility as the season progresses. Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods consistently. I am using recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized higher demand regime observed since late February, as the early historical samples (85-139) are likely too low for the current Spring season. The profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio suggests a target service level of 80% (q = 4/(4+1)), which the OR backend will calculate using these parameters.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-01, entering the peak Spring season for women's blouses. Statistical analysis shows that over the last 7 periods, demand has averaged 151.1 units with a standard deviation of 26.6. However, there is a clear upward trend and high volatility, with the last period (P7) reaching 181 units, causing a stockout. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The confirmed lead time remains 0 periods. To account for the seasonal upturn and the recent high demand (P7=181, P5=168, P3=174), I am using N=5 for the demand forecast period (mu_hat) to capture the higher recent mean (~158) rather than the all-time mean. Given the stockouts in P3, P5, and P7, I will use a slightly higher N for sigma_hat (N=7) to capture full historical volatility and ensure a more robust safety stock to protect against the high cost of lost sales (Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand and stockout frequency: 3 out of last 7 periods resulted in stockouts (P3, P5, P7). Average demand in the last 5 periods (P3-P7) has been 158.2 units, significantly higher than the initial weeks.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632002 (Womens Blouse) is in a clear upward demand trajectory as it enters early April (Spring retail season). In Period 8, demand reached a new high of 220, leading to another stockout. Comparing the initial 5 weeks of pre-season demand (mean ~130) to the last 4 weeks (mean ~167.3), there is a significant shift in volume. The last two periods (P7, P8) had demands of 181 and 220, respectively, showing accelerating momentum. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high stockout frequency (4 out of 8 periods), I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility observed in the last month, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to service this growing demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed for Spring season: Mean demand in P7-P8 increased to 200.5 units (+20% vs P5-P6 mean). Frequent stockouts (50% of history) indicate the current safety stock is insufficient for actual demand volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15th, mid-Spring season for the 'Gyda blouse'. Demand has been highly volatile with confirmed upward shifts in recent weeks (Demand in P8 was 220, dropping to 142 in P9). Despite the lower demand in P9, the history shows significant stockout risk (P3, P5, P7, P8). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent demand surge and the retail season, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) which captures the average of P7-P9 (approx 181 units). Setting L to 0 explicitly as it is stable. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen in the last 5 periods (118 to 220 range) to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Gyda blouse' has shown significant volatility throughout the Spring season, with frequent stockouts between Period 3 and Period 8. In the last two periods (P9 and P10), demand has cooled slightly to an average of 129 units, down from the earlier Spring peak of ~180-220 units. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize recent demand data to capture this slight tapering while maintaining enough safety stock to protect against the volatility observed in March. I choose N=4 for mu_hat (covering Period 7 to Period 10) to balance the high peak demand of P8 (220) with the moderation in P9 and P10. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to account for the high variance observed in this regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Gyda blouse' showed a significant peak in late March and early April (reaching 220 units in Period 8), aligning with the peak spring fashion season. However, the last three periods (P9-P11) have seen a stabilization in demand with values of 142, 116, and 121 (average = 126.3). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods. The previous strategy of aggressive ordering based on the peak (avg ~200) led to high stock levels but successfully avoided stockouts in the last three periods. Given the recent softening of demand as we move past the spring peak, I am shifting mu_hat to a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to better capture this new, lower demand level while maintaining the promised lead time of 0. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus on current volatility and avoid over-ordering based on the high-variance peak period.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-Spring peak (P9-P11) has stabilized at a lower mean of 126.3 compared to the peak average of ~200 during P7-P8 (-37% shift).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Period 12 showed a total stockout with 157 units of demand against an inventory of 138, confirming that demand remains significantly higher than the 126 average previously noted. Over the last four periods (P9-P12), demand has been [142, 116, 121, 157], averaging 134 units. The product is a women's blouse, which is highly relevant in May. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout history. To prevent the recurring stockouts (P3, P5, P7, P8, P12), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current mean of 134. I will use a larger N (N=10) for sigma_hat to capture the historical volatility which has caused multiple stockouts, ensuring the safety stock calculation reflects the actual demand spread. Since lead time is 0, mu_hat represents (1+0) periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Demand volatility remains high post-Spring peak; target mean for the current regime (P9-P12) is 134 units. Stockouts have occurred in 42% of all periods (5/12), warranting higher safety stocks.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Gyda blouse' shows a clear seasonal peak in March and April (P7-P8 reached 220 units), followed by a stabilization phase. Over the last five periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged 134.8 units (142, 116, 121, 157, 138). While Period 12 resulted in a stockout (demand 157 vs sold 138), the most recent demand (P13) was 138. The demand regime has clearly shifted away from the Spring peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this post-peak stabilization. I will also use N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current, slightly lower volatility compared to the transition months.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for the Gyda blouse (P10-P14) shows a mean of 140.4 units, with a noticeable increase in P14 (170 units) which resulted in another stockout. Looking at the full history, stockouts have occurred in 7 out of 14 periods (50%), occurring whenever demand spiked above on-hand inventory. The current date is May 20th. This product is a 'Womens Tailoring Blouse', which is susceptible to late Spring/early Summer demand. Given the stockout in P14 despite a starting inventory of 149 units, I need to adjust mu_hat to capture the current mean more accurately while allowing for volatility. Setting N=5 for mu_hat captures the post-Spring-peak stabilization and the recent upward tick. I am using recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat as well to ensure a responsive safety stock calculation, given the extreme volatility and frequent stockouts observed (sigma for the last 5 periods is approximately 22, whereas the overall population sigma is higher due to the April peak). Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Stockout frequency remains extremely high at 50% (7/14 periods). Recent demand (P10-P14) has stabilized around a mean of 140 units, but shows high sensitivity to supply, resulting in frequent lost sales.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'Gyda blouse' is entering the late spring/early summer season (late May). Observed demand history shows a highly volatile pattern with frequent stockouts (8 out of 15 periods, or 53%). Recent demand (P13-P15) has averaged 164.3 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization estimate of 140. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and lead time is consistently 0 periods, I must ensure the order covers the upcoming period's expected demand plus a substantial safety stock buffer to mitigate the recurring stockouts. Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (P11-P15) captures the current elevated demand level and high variance (Mean ~154, StDev ~27) better than the long-term average. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for the frequent excess demand observed in this seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains critical: Stockout frequency has increased to 53% (8/15 periods). The mean demand for the most recent 5-period window (P11-P15) has risen to 154.2 units, up from the P9-P13 average of 134, indicating a secondary peak or sustained high demand in the late May period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/3. We are managing a women's blouse which has shown high demand volatility and frequent stockouts (53% of history) throughout the spring season. The most recent demand (P16) was 117 units, following a peak of 185 (P15) and 170 (P14). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is approximately 153.4. Given the transition into early June, we expect demand to remain robust but potentially start stabilizing from its late-May highs. The stockout frequency (9 out of 16 periods) clearly indicates that the standard service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) is being overwhelmed by demand spikes. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to capture the current regime which includes both high-peak and moderate weeks, and a slightly longer recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to provide a more robust buffer against the observed high volatility and minimize the persistent stockout risk. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historically, this SKU (Gyda blouse) has shown significant demand volatility and frequent stockouts (9 out of 17 periods, or 53%). However, the most recent two periods (P16-P17) show a downward trend in demand (117 and 100 units respectively) compared to the mid-May peak. This suggests the Spring/Early Summer peak may be subsiding as we move further into June. Despite this, the cumulative stockout history indicates the OR backend's default safety stock is often insufficient for the observed variance. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead time has consistently been 0. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (P13-P17) to capture the current post-peak stabilization; the mean of these five periods is 142.0. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to encompass the high volatility observed throughout May to ensure the safety stock remains robust against sudden spikes, even as the mean demand slightly dips.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-May peak: Mean demand for P16-P17 decreased to 108.5 units, a 30% reduction from the P13-P15 average of 164.3 units, signaling a transition out of the late Spring peak.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical data and recent demand segments indicate a clear cooling-off period following the Spring/May peaks. Period 18 demand (87) confirms the downward trend identified in Period 17 (100). The mean demand over the last three periods (P16-P18) has dropped to 101.3 units, compared to the peak levels regularly exceeding 150-180. Given this transition into the early summer period for a 'Womens Tailoring' blouse, demand is expected to remain lower and stabilize. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will adjust the demand parameters using a recent window (N=3) to reflect this lower regime (mu_hat approx 101 per period) and prevent overstocking as we exit the high-season volatility. The system will calculate safety stock based on the variance of these three periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-Spring peak confirmed: Mean demand for P16-P18 stabilized at 101.3 units, representing a significant reduction from the May average of ~150-160.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632002 (blouse) has entered a lower demand regime following the Spring/May peak. Demand over the last four periods (P16-P19) has consistently decreased (117, 100, 87, 79), with a current mean of approximately 95.75 units. This aligns with standard fashion cycles where spring items see reduced interest by late June. On-hand inventory is 35 units with no pipeline. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while demand is trending downward, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the current lower mean (approx 96 units). Sigma_hat is set using a slightly longer window (recent_N: 5) to account for residual volatility from the May period without being overly influenced by the historical high peaks, allowing the OR engine to maintain a leaner inventory profile suitable for the current seasonal decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed post-Spring peak: Mean demand for P16-P19 has stabilized at 95.8 units, continuing the downward trend from the May average of ~150-160.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historical analysis shows a clear transition from the peak Spring/May season (where demand averaged ~150+) to a significantly lower Summer regime. Over the last five periods (P16-P20), demand has been: 117, 100, 87, 79, and 49. The mean for the most recent 4 periods (P17-P20) is 78.75 units, showing a distinct downward trend. Stockouts have ceased, and ending inventory has remained healthy, confirming that the high-demand volatility seen earlier in the year has subsided. For Period 21, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this lower Summer demand regime while maintaining some buffer against the sharp drop seen in the most recent week. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to Summer lows confirmed: Mean demand for P17-P20 dropped to 78.8 units, a ~50% decrease from the May peak (~150-160).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. We are in the mid-summer period for the 'Gyda blouse', which has shown a definitive downward shift in demand following the Spring/May peaks. Recent demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has been: 100, 87, 79, 49, 64. This averages to 75.8 units per period, a substantial decline from the 150+ levels seen earlier. The lead time has remained consistently 0 throughout the history. To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the recent stabilization at lower volumes. The backend will calculate the base stock using these parameters to align with current seasonal demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product (Gyda blouse) is in the middle of the summer retail season. Historical data shows a clear downward shift in demand following the spring peak. The mean demand for the most recent 6 periods (P17-P22) is roughly 72.3 units (100, 87, 79, 49, 64, 55), significantly lower than the May peak of ~150-160. Recent observations (P20-P22) suggest demand has stabilized around 56 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N window of 6 to capture this lower summer demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as P17 (June 3) marked the start of the sustained drop below 100 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. We are in the mid-summer season, and demand for this SKU (Gyda blouse) has significantly declined from its Spring peaks. Over the last four periods (P20-P23), demand has been 49, 64, 55, and 78, with a mean of 61.5. This confirms a sustained low-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'concluded' messages. Current on-hand inventory is 11 units, which is quite low relative to the recent mean, requiring a replenishment order. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized summer demand profile, which will scale the base stock to cover one period (L=0, so 1+L=1) while maintaining a safety buffer appropriate for the current lower volatility. This strategy minimizes holding costs while protecting against the slight uptick seen in P23.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand regime firmly established (P20-P23): Mean demand has stabilized around 61.5 units, down ~60% from Spring peaks.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632002 (Womens Blouse) is in a stable Summer low-demand regime. History shows a clear trend: the Spring peak (April-May) averaged ~150-160 units, while the recent 5 periods (P20-P24) averaged 58.6 units (49, 64, 55, 78, 47). The most recent period (P24) saw a demand of 47. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this low-demand phase while maintaining responsiveness to minor fluctuations, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this established Summer baseline. Sigma_hat is also set to the last 5 periods to reflect current lower volatility compared to the high-variance Spring season.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, and we are in a sustained summer low-demand regime for the Gyda blouse. Historical demand over the last 6 weeks (P20-P25) has averaged 58.5 units (49, 64, 55, 78, 47, 58), significantly lower than previous spring peaks. There is no evidence of a late-summer uptick yet. On-hand inventory is currently low (12 units) with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage costs while maintaining a high service level (as profit is $4 vs $1 holding cost), I will set the demand mean (mu_hat) based on the last 6 samples to capture this stabilized lower demand regime. N=6 is chosen as it covers the period since the confirmed downward shift in Period 20.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse (695632002) saw a significant and unexpected spike in Period 26, reaching 127 units. This is more than double the average demand of approximately 60.5 observed during the summer low-demand regime (Periods 20-25). This sudden increase likely signals the start of the 'Back to School' or 'Early Autumn' transition in mid-August. Because the previous period ended with a stockout (0 units on-hand), the current demand is under-represented by the 'sold' quantity. To respond to this regime shift while acknowledging the volatility, I am increasing mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the upward trend (averaging the spike with recent lows), and setting sigma_hat explicitly to a higher value to protect against further stockouts during this transition. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 26: Demand spiked to 127 units (+110% vs P20-P25 mean of 60.5), signaling the end of the Summer low-demand period and the start of the Autumn transition.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Gyda blouse' has clearly shifted from the summer low (avg ~61) to an Autumn transition phase. Period 26 saw 127 units of demand and Period 27 saw 116 units, despite a stockout in P26. The current date (August 19) is the start of the typical retail \u2018Back to School\u2019 or Fall season rollout. History shows lead time is consistently 0 periods. Based on the last two periods (P26-P27), demand has stabilized around ~121 units. I will set mu_hat to reflect this new mean using N=2 (the length of the new regime) to quickly adapt to the higher volume and prevent further stockouts, as we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition confirmed (P26-P27): Demand increased from summer average of ~61 to ~121 units (+98%), signaling the start of the Fall retail season.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632002 (blouse) is currently in an Autumn transition phase. After a summer low (avg ~61), demand spiked in P26 (127) and P27 (116) before dipping in P28 (76). The current date is August 26, 2019, which aligns with the back-to-school and late-summer/early-autumn retail period where demand for blouses typically increases and becomes more volatile. The current on-hand inventory is 53. To estimate demand, I am focusing on the most recent regime shift (P26-P28) where average demand is approximately 106.3 units. Using a 3-period window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat will capture this new higher mean while accounting for the recent dip in P28. I will use the recent_3 window for sigma_hat as well to account for the increased volatility observed during this transition (demand varied from 127 down to 76). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632002 (Gyda blouse) has transitioned out of its summer low-demand period (avg ~61) into an Autumn regime. Demand in the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 127, 116, 76, and 86, yielding a mean of 101.25. While Periods 28 and 29 show a slight cooling from the initial August spike, the overall floor has clearly risen. The product is a blouse, which typically sees sustained demand in the transition to cooler weather (September/October). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new floor (mean ~101). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility (std dev ~24) compared to the stable summer. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during the Autumn transition while maintaining a reasonable holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition stabilized (P26-P29): Demand floor has shifted from a summer average of ~61 to a new mean of 101.25 (+66%) as of early September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has transitioned from a summer low (~61 units/period) into an autumn regime. Observations from the last 5 periods (P26-P30: 127, 116, 76, 86, 108) show a new mean of approximately 102.6 units. Period 31 (Sept 9) aligns with the typical start of the autumn retail season for women's tailoring/blouses. Although there's a slight dip in P28-P29, the demand is significantly higher than the summer baseline and remains volatile (stockouts occurred in P26 and P27). I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach to capture this new elevated mean and volatility, while setting the lead time to its consistently observed value of 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn regime mean demand confirmed at ~103 units (P26-P30), a +68% increase from the summer low mean of ~61.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 31 (154 units) follows a pattern of increasing Autumn demand, where the mean for the Autumn transition regime (P26-P31) has moved to approximately 111.3 units, up from the summer low of ~61. The current date is mid-September, a key retail period for 'blouses/womens tailoring' as consumers refresh wardrobes for the cooler season. A stockout occurred in Period 31 (on-hand 0), indicating that the previous base stock was insufficient for the volatility in this new regime. To prevent further lost sales during this upward trend, I am increasing mu_hat using the last 6 periods (the start of the Autumn regime) and using recent volatility with N=6 for sigma_hat to capture the increased variance seen in the last two weeks (demand 108 then 154). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand surge confirmed (P26-P31): Mean demand has shifted to 111.3 units (+80% vs summer low), with a recent high of 154 units in Period 31.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/9/23. The item is a women's blouse, which is currently in its Autumn/Back-to-school peak. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. We observed another stockout in Period 32 (on-hand 135, demand 153), confirming that demand is consistently exceeding recently set base stock levels. The mean demand for the last three periods (P30-P32) is 138.3 units, significantly higher than the early September average. To capture this acceleration and mitigate the frequent stockouts (50% of the last 4 periods), I will use the recent_N method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will sensitize the OR backend to the higher mean and the increased volatility observed during this seasonal peak. A profit/holding cost ratio of 4:1 implies a target service level (q) of 0.8, but due to high volatility and 0 lead time, capturing recent high standard deviation is vital for the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand peak intensification: Mean demand for P30-P32 has risen to 138.3 units (with 50% stockout rate), confirming a higher demand regime than the early September average of ~103.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has entered a major seasonal peak as of late September (Period 33), with demand spiking to 290 units\u2014nearly double the previous peak of 154 in P31. This aligns with a transition into deep Autumn retail activity. Period 33 resulted in a significant stockout (sold 161, demand 290), leaving on-hand inventory at 0. Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, I must place an order that covers this new, higher demand regime immediately. The last three periods (P31-P33) show a rapidly accelerating trend: 154, 153, 290. Using N=3 for mu_hat captures this spike better than a longer average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to adjust to this high-volume, high-volatility phase, ensuring the base stock is sufficiently high to minimize further lost sales during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak acceleration: Period 33 demand spiked to 290 (+135% vs P26-P32 mean of 123), confirming a high-intensity seasonal regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695632002 is currently in a high-demand Autumn peak. In Period 33, demand reached a cycle-high of 290 units, followed by 192 units in Period 34. The current demand regime (P33-P34) has a mean of 241 units. Although the 'conclude' message for Period 34 shows an ending inventory of 74, this represents the state at the end of Period 34 AFTER arrivals and demand were resolved. In Period 35, the target base stock must account for the high volatility and the seasonal peak which is currently active (Sept/Oct). Given the profit/holding ratio of 4:1, the OR backend targets an 80% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to focus exclusively on this elevated peak demand (mean 241) to ensure the system places an order sufficient to cover this high-intensity period and prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 31-33.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified in late September (P33-P34): Mean demand surged to 241 units, a 95% increase from the early September mean of ~123.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-October period for the 'Gyda blouse'. Historical data from the last few weeks (P33-P35) showed a significant demand surge (mean of 219.7 units), peaking at 290 units. Period 35 demand (177) suggests the peak may be cooling slightly but remains much higher than the early September baseline (~103-111). Given the product is a blouse with long sleeves, we are likely in a sustained Autumn/Early Winter demand regime. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To handle the observed volatility and prevent the frequent stockouts seen in P31-P33, I will use a 4-period window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, covering the entire defined peak period (P32-P35: 153, 290, 192, 177). This results in a forecast mean of approximately 203 units per period. Using recent_N for sigma captures the increased variance during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak plateau detected: Mean demand for P33-P35 stabilized at 219.7 units, significantly above the early Autumn mean of ~111.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has transitioned from its peak Autumn acceleration (P33-P34: ~241 units) into a more stable but still elevated plateau. Period 36 demand was 145 units, following Period 35's 177 units and Period 34's 192 units. This indicates a cooling off from the late September peak of 290 units. The mean demand for the most recent 3 periods (P34-P36) is 171.3 units, down from the P33-P35 average of ~220. Given the 'Womens Tailoring' category and October date, demand is expected to remain firm but likely stabilize as the peak 'back-to-school/autumn' surge passes. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 3 to reflect this downward stabilization while maintaining enough inventory to prevent the frequent stockouts seen earlier in the season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak cooling: Mean demand for P34-P36 has decreased to 171.3 units from the P33-P35 mean of 219.7 (-22%), indicating a transition from peak surge to a mid-autumn plateau.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is entering late October, where demand has shown a recent spike back to 200 (Period 37) following a mid-autumn cooling trend. The current inventory is 0, indicating a stockout in the previous period. The recent regime (P34-P37) shows significant volatility with demands of 192, 177, 145, and 200, resulting in a mean of 178.5 units. Given the stockout in P37 and the unpredictable late-autumn demand patterns for this women's blouse, I will use a recent_N window of 4 periods to capture this high-volatility plateau. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current mean of ~179 and the high variance observed in this seasonal window, ensuring sufficient inventory to recover from the stockout while acknowledging the lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand remains volatile: Period 37 saw a return to high demand (200 units), resulting in a stockout. The mean demand for the late-October regime (P34-P37) is 178.5 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/04, moving into the early November period. Following the Autumn peak (P33-P34), demand stabilized into a plateau. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), the average demand has been 175.4 units (samples: 192, 177, 145, 200, 163). While P37 saw a stockout, Period 38 ended with 36 units on-hand, suggesting the current inventory levels are better aligned with the mid-autumn plateau. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistently verified by historical arrivals. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient safety stock via sigma_hat to avoid the frequent stockouts observed in October.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn plateau confirmed (P34-P38): Mean demand has stabilized at 175.4 units, representing a 20% cooling from the late-September peak mean of 219.7.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the mid-autumn plateau for this woman's blouse, transitioning towards the late-year holiday season. Demand in the most recent window (P36-P39) has been 145, 200 (stockout), 163, and 135 units, resulting in a mean of 160.75 units. This confirms the 'cooling' from the late-September peak (219.7 mean) into a more stable plateau around 160-170 units. I will set my parameters based on this recent 4-period regime (P36-P39) to maintain adequate service levels while avoiding excessive holding costs, as on-hand inventory is currently 60 and lead time remains consistent at 0. Choosing N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat reflects this plateau phase accurately.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/18, approaching Black Friday (late November). Demand has been consistently strong throughout the autumn, with the mid-autumn plateau confirmed at a mean of 175.4 units (P34-P38). Recent periods P38-P40 show demand values of 163, 135, and 166. While Period 39 was slightly lower, Period 40 returned to the high 160s. Given the proximity to the major retail peak in late November, I expect demand to remain at least at the current plateau level or increase. Historically, lead time has been extremely stable at 0 periods. However, stockouts are a persistent risk (on-hand is currently low at 19). I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5-period average (P36-P40), which captures the current late-autumn demand density (approx 162 units per period), to ensure we are sufficiently stocked for the upcoming holiday week.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn plateau remains stable through Period 40: Mean demand for P36-P40 is 161.8 units, sustaining the high-demand environment established since late September.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25 (Period 42). We are in the mid-to-late Autumn retail season, approaching the December holiday period. Demand for this item (Gyda blouse) has stabilized into a plateau since Period 34. The mean demand for the most recent 6 periods (P36-P41) is 162.2 units, showing remarkable consistency (145, 200, 163, 135, 166, 164). Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Despite high demand, the system managed to satisfy sales in the last four periods with low ending inventory, though a stockout risk remains given the on-hand inventory of 19. To maintain the service level while transitioning toward the end-of-year season, I will use a recent_N window (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized plateau (approx 162 units/period) while acknowledging the volatility observed during this regime.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand plateau (P36-P41) confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized at 162.2 units with moderate volatility, following the late-September peak.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Date: 2019/11/25) experienced an extreme demand outlier of 862 units, likely corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. This is an 814% increase over the previous 4-period mean of ~157. Given the SKU is a 'Gyda blouse', this spike is strongly seasonal and expected for major retail events. Since we are now in Period 43 (Dec 2), demand is expected to remain high during the holiday shopping season, though likely not at the Black Friday peak intensity. Historically, following high-demand stockouts in this game, demand has shifted regimes (e.g., September peak). I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the elevated autumn floor, but I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 200 to account for the extreme holiday volatility and ensure the OR backend generates a larger order to recover from the current stockout (on-hand is 0). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 862 units (+530% vs previous seasonal mean), indicating extreme volatility and high potential for lost sales in December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak December retail season. Period 42 showed an extreme demand spike (862 units), likely a Black Friday/Cyber Monday event. Period 43 demand (227 units) remains significantly elevated compared to the pre-holiday plateau (average ~162). With a promised lead time of 0 (confirmed consistently in history), we must maintain high stock levels to capture this seasonal surge. The mean demand for the last two periods (P42-P43) is 544.5 units, but using this as a mu_hat would lead to excessive holding costs if P42 was an outlier. However, we must protect against further holiday volatility. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 450 units (blending the extreme P42 spike with the elevated P43 baseline) and 'explicit' sigma_hat at 300 to provide a robust safety buffer for potential pre-Christmas spikes.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed (P42-P43): Extreme spike in P42 (862 units) followed by sustained high demand in P43 (227 units). The new demand floor for December is significantly higher than the mid-autumn plateau of ~162.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the December holiday season (Dec 16). Period 42 saw a massive spike of 862 units, followed by a correction to 227 (P43) and 131 (P44). While 131 is lower, the holiday season often experiences a 'secondary peak' just before Christmas or during post-Christmas clearance. The current on-hand inventory is 572 units. Lead time is confirmed as 0. Because of the extreme volatility observed in P42, a simple mean will under-forecast. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the mean of the high-demand December window (P42-P44), which is (862+227+131)/3 = 406.6. This protects against another potential spike. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent extreme variance caused by the holiday spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), which is the final peak before Christmas. Historical data shows an extreme spike in Period 42 (862 units) followed by a normalization to a higher floor (avg ~172 over P43-P45). While demand has slowed down from the immediate Black Friday/Early December surge, the proximity to Christmas suggests one last potential impulse peak or a sustained high floor before the post-holiday drop. The on-hand inventory is high at 584 units due to prior aggressive ordering triggered by the P42 outlier. Lead time is confirmed as 0. I will adopt an EWMA approach for the mean demand to allow the model to gradually weight down the extreme P42 spike while acknowledging the higher December demand regime compared to the autumn plateau. I will use recent_N for sigma to capture the high volatility seen in the last 5 periods (P41-P45), ensuring sufficient safety stock given the history of stockouts (50%+).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peaked significantly in P42 (862 units) and has since stabilized at a new December mean of ~172 units (P43-P45), which is higher than the mid-autumn plateau of ~162.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the transition from the Holiday peak into the New Year. Historical data (P1-P2) from the same February timeframe suggests demand initially was around 113-144 units. Recent demand has cooled significantly from the December peak (862 in P42) to 83 units in P46. The current on-hand inventory is 501 units, which is quite high relative to the projected post-holiday demand. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs on the 501 units, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P43-P46) to reflect the cooling demand (mean ~150), allowing the OR backend to draw down the existing surplus before ordering more. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling confirmed: Demand dropped to 83 units in P46, following a December mean (P43-P45) of ~172 units. Transition to early-year baseline underway.
