The product is a women's basic cotton jersey T-shirt, which is a staple item with relatively stable demand throughout the year, though it might see slight increases as spring approaches. Historical data shows an average demand of approximately 100 units per week (119, 73, 98, 97, 113). The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and can satisfy demand in the same period. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there is nothing in transit, I need to place an order to cover the demand for the current period (Period 1). Given the historical average of 100 and the most recent observation of 113, I will aim for a slightly higher inventory level of 120 to ensure a high service level while managing holding costs ($1/unit).

Since lead time is 0, orders arrive immediately to satisfy demand in the current period. Target Stock: Given the jump in P1 and seasonal trends, I will forecast P2 demand conservatively at 150 units.

Given the upward trend (147 -> 214), I anticipate Period 3 demand could reach or exceed 250 units.

September traditionally marks the beginning of the 'Back to School' and autumn transition; however, for a jersey basic t-shirt, we often see a secondary, smaller bump as customers refresh basics for layering, though not a return to spring peak levels. Recent demand (P26-P29) has been 25, 38, 20, 13 (avg ~24). Current on-hand inventory is 57. Given the lead time is 0, I can afford to wait for a confirmed trend reversal before placing a large order. I will order 13 units to reach a target stock of 70, which provides safety cover for approximately 2-3 times the current trough-level demand, protecting against a potential early September uptick while minimizing holding costs if the trend remains low.",
