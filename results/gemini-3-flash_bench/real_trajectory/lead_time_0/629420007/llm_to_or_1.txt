Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 629420007 (Womens T-shirt). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5 historical demand samples (119, 73, 98, 97, 113), the mean demand is 100 units per week with a standard deviation of approximately 17.3. Given the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt and it is mid-February, we are approaching the spring season where demand for basics typically remains steady or starts to increase slightly. Since we have no lead time history yet, I will use the 'default' method for lead time (L=0). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent statistics while keeping the forecast stable. The OR engine will use these to set a base stock level that balances the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost (equivalent to aiming for a ~95% service level).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's basic cotton t-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) averaged 100 units (73-119 range). However, Period 1 (Feb 11) saw a significant jump to 147 units, which resulted in a stockout (130 ordered, 130 sold, 0 ending inventory). This jump signals a potential pre-spring demand shift or a higher baseline than the initial samples. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirm this (ordered P1, arrived P1). Given the stockout and the high demand in P1, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this upward trend while still incorporating some recent historical context. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility seen in the transition from ~100 to 147.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3078.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' cotton t-shirt. Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Both periods 1 and 2 showed 100% stockouts (demand exceeded supply). Historical demand was around 73-119 in early Jan. Demand increased to 147 in Period 1 (mid-Feb) and surged to 214 in Period 2 (late Feb). This suggests a strong upward regime shift as we enter the spring season for basic jersey wear. Since stockouts occurred, the 'demand' numbers 147 and 214 are the actual demand, which is significantly higher than the initial historical mean (~100). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been maintained (confirmed arrivals in P1 and P2). To capitalize on the profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent samples (97, 113, 147, 214) to better reflect the current trajectory, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a higher safety stock to prevent further stockouts in this rising demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~180+ (+80%) between early Feb and late Feb, consistent with spring seasonality for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey tops.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The product is a women's basic cotton t-shirt, which typically sees rising demand as spring approaches. Historical demand samples (Early Jan-Early Feb) averaged 92 units. However, recent performance shows a significant structural shift: Period 1 (147), Period 2 (214), and Period 3 (181). The average of these last 3 periods is 180.7, confirming the demand regime shift noted in carry-over insights. Promised lead time is 0, and all shipments to date (P1, P2, P3) have arrived in 0 periods. Inventory is currently 62 units. To prevent the stockouts observed in P1 and P2 (where sold < demand), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period regime (~181 per period). Since lead time is 0, mu_hat represents (1+0) * 181. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility of this new higher-demand period.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' cotton t-shirt. Current date is 2019/3/11. Initially, demand jumped from ~100 (Jan history) to ~180+ in Feb, signaling a transition to the spring season. However, the most recent period (P4) showed a drop to 110. Current on-hand is 126. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the elevated early-spring demand (avg: 163) while accounting for the recent fluctuation. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to ensure the OR backend captures the increased volatility (standard deviation ~45) observed during this demand ramp-up. L remains at the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2603.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'claudine' is a basic T-shirt, which typically enters a higher demand regime in spring. Historical data prior to Feb showed demand between 73-119, while the last 5 periods (Feb 11 - Mar 11) have shown a higher average demand of 158.8. Specifically, the last three weeks demand levels (181, 110, 142) show volatility but remain above the early-year baseline. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times have consistently been 0 periods, I will maintain L at 'default'. For demand forecasting, I'll use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current spring regime while smoothing out the recent dip in Period 4. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated spring demand compared to the January baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2975.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th. We are managing 'claudine', a jersey cotton T-shirt, which is a staple for spring and summer seasons. History shows the lead time is consistently 0 periods. Demand over the last 6 weeks (Periods 1-6) has averaged 159 units (147, 214, 181, 110, 142, 160). Period 4 was a significant outlier at 110, possibly due to weather fluctuations, but demand rebounded in Periods 5 and 6. Given the product category and the transition into spring, I expect demand to remain elevated. I will use a recent_N method with N=6 to capture this 'spring regime' while smoothing out the Period 4 dip. With L=0, the OR backend aims for a base stock covering the current period's demand (1+0 periods). Sigma will also be calculated using the recent 6 periods to capture the volatility of the new demand level. Inventory is currently at 65 units, which is low for the average weekly demand observed recently.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a women's cotton jersey t-shirt. Reviewing historical demand, we see a significant jump in Period 7 (March 25th) to 260 units, which represents a 60% increase over the previous three-period average (~160). This aligns with the transition into spring/summer for basic apparel. Every order to date has arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, confirming the promised lead time is being met reliably (L=0). My ending inventory for Period 7 was 0, with 42 units of unmet demand (stockout). To prevent future stockouts during this high-demand spring phase, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the most recent 3 periods (Periods 5-7: 142, 160, 260) which more accurately reflects the current upward trend than the full history. This will increase the order volume to satisfy current demand and rebuild a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-volatility spring regime; Period 7 showed a major spike to 260 units, suggesting the late March/early April 'spring refresh' peak is active.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'claudine' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently experiencing a significant spring demand surge. Observed demand has risen from ~150 units in early March to a peak of 311 units on April 1st. As of Period 9 (April 8th), we are in the heart of the spring retail season. Historical demand for the last three periods (P6-P8) averaged 243.6 units, but the most recent two periods (P7-P8) averaged 285.5 units, with the latest observation at 311. To avoid further stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I will forecast demand based on the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture this rising trend while maintaining an explicit lead time of 0 as confirmed by 8 consecutive periods of zero-day arrivals. The service level target remains high due to a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: Demand increased from an average of ~137 (P4-P5) to ~244 (P6-P8), with a peak of 311 at P8, indicating peak spring seasonality for basic jersey tops.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' cotton t-shirt. Current history shows we are in a high-demand spring phase. Historical demand for the most recent regime (Periods 7-9) is 260, 311, and 283 units, yielding a mean of approximately 285 units per period. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. We are entering mid-April (2019/04/15), which generally marks the continuation of the spring season for basic jersey tops. To avoid stockouts seen in Period 7 and Period 8, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this elevated seasonal level. Sigma_hat is also set to N=3 to capture the high volatility (standard deviation ~25) observed during this peak. This setting will allow the OR engine to maintain a sufficient base stock level for the immediate demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 11 (2019/4/22), we remain in a high-demand spring seasonality regime for SKU 629420007 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt). Demand over the last 4 periods (P7-P10) has been 260, 311, 283, and 318, averaging 293 units per period. The on-hand inventory is critically low (9 units) and there is no inventory in transit. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid stockouts during this peak period, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period average (N=4) to capture the current demand plateau. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 4 periods to account for the high volatility seen during this peak (reaching up to 318 units). The OR backend will use these parameters to target a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), ensuring the order + 9 units on-hand meets the base stock requirement for this period.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime stabilized: Period 7-10 demand consistently high, averaging 293 units (range 260-318), confirming we are in the peak of spring seasonality.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '629420007' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a sustained peak spring demand regime. In Period 11 (2019/4/22), demand surged to 396 units, the highest recorded to date. The last 5 periods (P7-P11) show a high-demand regime with a mean of 313.6 units (260, 311, 283, 318, 396). The current date is late April, typically the tail end of the spring refresh peak before entering early summer levels. Observed lead time consistently remains 0. Inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit, following a stockout in Period 11 where demand (396) exceeded supply (337). To capture this high-demand level and prevent further stockouts while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a recent window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the mean of ~314 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand peaked at 396 units in Period 11; the high-demand spring regime (P7-P11) now averages 314 units, up from the previous regime average of ~244.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 13 (early May). Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey tops has transitioned through a high-demand spring regime (P7-P12). The last 3 periods (P10-P12) saw demands of 318, 396, and 340, confirming a stable peak in the 300-400 range. The average demand across these last 3 periods is 351 units. With a promised lead time of 0 periods, which has been consistently met (actual lead time 0), the OR backend needs to cover demand for the current period (L+1 = 1 period). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this peak stabilization, as it reflects the most current demand level (avg 351) better than the 59-day average (approx 190) or a larger window. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility observed during this peak (std ~39). This approach maintains a high service level for a high-profit item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1) during its seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak stabilization: Average demand for Period 10-12 reached 351 units, confirming the plateau of the spring seasonal surge first noted in late March.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (May 6th), we observed a significant demand drop from 340 to 193 units, which is a 43% decrease. This suggests that the 'Peak Spring' regime, which averaged ~314 units over the previous five periods (P8-P12), may be transitioning into a late-spring or pre-summer stabilization phase as the initial seasonal refresh surge subsides. This is common for 'Womens Everyday Basics' after the April peak. Because the drop is sudden and only one data point, I am shifting mu_hat downward but remaining cautious to avoid understocking if this was a holiday-related outlier (e.g., post-May Day). I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent high volume while starting to weigh the latest lower demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 13 (May 6th): Demand dropped to 193 from a 5-period average of 314 (-38%), suggesting the end of the peak spring seasonal surge.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late May (2019/05/20). The high-demand spring peak (averaging ~314 units) concluded around Period 13 (May 6th). Demand in the last two periods (P13: 193, P14: 230) confirms a new, lower-demand regime as we move past the spring peak for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. The average of the last two actual demand observations is 211.5. To capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient service level for potential late-May residuals, I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This calculates parameters based on the most recent demand drop. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, which I will reflect with the 'calculate' method to ensure the OR engine recognizes the 0-day lead time observed in all 14 previous periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: After the late-April peak (~314 units), demand has stabilized at a lower level for May, averaging 211.5 units over P13-P14 (a ~33% drop from peak).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt has transitioned out of its peak spring surge (which averaged ~314 units from P7-P11) into a lower May plateau. Post-peak demand over the last 3 periods (P13-P15) has been 193, 230, and 259, averaging 227 units. While demand is lower than the April peak, P15 showed an upward tick (259 units), resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand 0). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts while acknowledging the stabilization below peak levels, I will use a recent_N strategy for both demand and volatility. I am choosing N=3 to specifically capture the post-peak May regime (P13-P15). This targets a mean of 227.33 units per period. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will maintain a high service level to capture the remaining late-spring demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (May) is stable at a lower average of ~227 units, compared to the April peak of ~314.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. We are in a post-peak spring regime for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt. Previous carry-over insights and recent history (Periods 13-16) show demand has stabilized significantly lower than the April peak. Demand for the last four periods was: 193, 230, 259, and 218, resulting in a mean of 225 units. While the carry-over insight noted a drop at Period 13, the regime has remained consistent at this level through May. Since promised lead time is 0 and historical lead times have consistently been 0 (arrived same period), L remains default (0). I will set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect this stable May/early June baseline of ~225 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to capture current volatility without being inflated by the high-variance April peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (May/early June) stabilized at an average of ~225 units (P13-P16) following the April peak of ~314.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt. Historical data confirms a shift in demand regimes: a peak spring surge occurred in April (averaging ~314 units), followed by a notable drop starting May 6 (Period 13). Over the last five periods (P13-P17), demand has stabilized at a lower average of approximately 208 units (193, 230, 259, 218, 160). Period 17 showed the lowest demand in this regime (160), suggesting we have exited the spring peak and are entering a standard summer baseline for basic jersey tops. Given the inventory position (On-hand: 111, In-transit: 0) and a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period regime (P13-P17) to prevent overstocking as the seasonal surge dissipates. L is set to default as observations consistently show a 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 13 (early May): Peak spring surge ended, transitioning to a stable post-peak average of ~208 units (P13-P17), down from the April peak of ~314 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' cotton t-shirt. Historical data confirms we are past the spring seasonal peak (late March to late April, where demand averaged ~314 units). Since Period 13 (early May), demand has trended downward, and specifically over the last two periods (P17-P18), demand has dipped further to 160 and 124 units. This suggests a new early-summer regime where demand is lower than the May average of ~208 units. Given today's date (June 17th), we expect demand to remain stable or slightly decrease before any potential summer sale surge. Period 18 demand was 124, and on-hand inventory is 150 units. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels, I will use a recent N (last 3 periods: 218, 160, 124) to calculate mu_hat, reflecting the current downward trend. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Demand has dropped from a May average of ~208 to a June average of ~142 (P17-P18), marking the start of a lower summer demand phase.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late June (Period 20). Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high-demand spring regime (averaging ~314 units in April) followed by a gradual decline as we move into summer. The demand since Period 17 (early June) has stabilized at a lower level: Period 17 (160), Period 18 (124), and Period 19 (135). This historical sequence yields a three-period average of 139.7 units. The carrying insights already flagged a regime shift starting Period 17 towards a 'lower summer demand phase'. I will use the last 3 periods (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stabilization at lower demand levels. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time, so I will use the default lead time method.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (Periods 17-19): Demand has stabilized at a lower average of ~140 units, representing a ~33% drop from the May average of ~208 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '629420007' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a summer demand regime. Historical demand for the last four periods (P17-P20) has stabilized at an average of 132 units (160, 124, 135, 109), down significantly from the May average of ~208 units. As of July 1st (Period 21), we expect this lower baseline to continue through the peak summer months. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-20. I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) using the last 4 periods (N=4) to accurately capture this established summer baseline while minimizing excess inventory. The OR engine will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that balances the high unit profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '629420007' has transitioned from a spring peak into a stable summer regime. Demand for the last five periods (P17-P21) has been 160, 124, 135, 109, and 81, respectively, showing a clear downward trend and stabilization at a lower level compared to May. The average demand for the last five periods is 121.8, and for the last three periods (P19-P21) is 108.3. Given the current date is July 8th, we are well into the summer season for basic jersey t-shirts, and demand is expected to remain around this lower baseline or continue a slight seasonal decline as the 'summer clearance' phase eventually approaches. The observed lead time consistently remains 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the transition to 121.8/period) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility accurately. This balances the risk of overstocking as demand cools against the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (July) further stabilized: Average demand for the last three periods (P19-P21) dropped to 108.3, confirming a continued decline from the June average of ~140.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey tops has entered a low summer regime. The most recent demand samples are 135 (P19), 109 (P20), 81 (P21), and 54 (P22), showing a consistent downward trend throughout June and July. The average demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 95 units, significantly lower than the June average of ~140 and May average of ~208. Given this steady decline during the peak summer weeks, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand level (approx. 95 units/period) and volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals in history.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand decline confirmed through July: Demand has dropped significantly throughout Periods 19-22, averaging ~95 units, which is a ~32% reduction from the June average of ~140.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's Jersey T-shirt) is in a clear summer low-demand phase. The weekly demand has consistently declined throughout July, with the last three periods (P21-P23) showing demand of 81, 54, and 56 units respectively, averaging ~64 units. This is a significant drop from the early summer average (~108 units) noted in the previous regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this lower demand level, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the most recent July cooling-off period (average 63.7 units). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect the current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand regime shift confirmed for July; average demand for P21-P23 has dropped to ~64 units, down from the early-July average of ~108 units (-40%), marking the mid-summer low for basic jersey tops.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' cotton jersey T-shirt continues its seasonal decline as we move into late July. The summer demand regime remains stable at a significantly lower level compared to the spring peak. The last three periods (P22-P24) show demands of 54, 56, and 38, respectively, averaging approximately 49 units. This represents a further contraction from the early-July average of ~64. Given the seasonal nature of basic jersey tops, we expect demand to remain low or continue a slight downward trend through the remainder of the summer. Lead time remains stable at 0. To prevent excess holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this low-demand period, I will adjust mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on this most recent mid-to-late summer decline. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the reduced volatility observed in the current period.

Carry-over insight: Late-July demand regime confirmed (P22-P24): Demand has further declined to an average of ~49 units, down from the early-July average of ~64 units (-23%), reflecting the deep-summer seasonality for this basic T-shirt SKU.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '629420007' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a deep summer low. Demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P22-P25) with values of 54, 56, 38, and 43, resulting in an average of 47.75 units. This confirms the 'late-July/early-August' demand regime noted in the carry-over insights. With the date being August 5th, we are likely at the bottom of the summer trough before any potential back-to-school or autumn transition. On-hand inventory is 23 units, which is roughly half of the current weekly demand. Given the promised lead time remains 0 and consistently arrives as 0, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this localized summer floor, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the ~48 units expected for the next cycle while accounting for the low but present volatility (std dev ~8.6).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the mid-to-late summer period for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirts. Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward trend from the April peak (~314 units) through July. Recent demand data for Periods 24-26 (July 22 - Aug 5) are 38, 43, and 25 units respectively, averaging 35.3 units. This confirms a low-demand mid-summer regime. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. I will use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this current low-demand trough and avoid overstocking while transitioning into late summer. The parameters are set to balance the high profit margin and low holding cost relative to this lower demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime for jersey tops stabilized at a low average of ~35 units (P24-P26), down from the late-July average of ~49 units (-28%).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts has stabilized in a mid-summer low-demand regime. Average demand over the last four periods (P24-P27) is 36.0 units (38, 43, 25, 38). Previously, there was a steady decline through July, but late August demand appears to have plateaued at this lower level. The observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory is low (13 units on-hand), so an order is necessary to maintain service levels. I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable late-summer plateau while remaining responsive to any slight variance. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime for jersey tops stabilized: Average demand for Period 24-27 is 36.0 units, following a significant decline from early July levels.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P24-P28) shows a stable mid-summer low for this jersey basic SKU, with demand samples of 38, 43, 25, 38, and 20. The average demand over these last 5 periods (since the end of July) is 32.8 units. The current date is August 26th, which typically marks the tail end of the 'deep summer' season before potential back-to-school or early autumn shifts, although for 'Everyday Basics', a significant upward shift usually lags until September. Given the consistency of the low-demand regime throughout August (averaging 27.6 units over the last 3 periods specifically), I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stabilized low-demand level. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. This conservative parameterization prevents overstocking during the absolute trough of the product's seasonality while maintaining enough stock for the observed volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a deep-summer low demand period. Analyzing the most recent 6 periods (P24-P29) as a single regime, demand has averaged 29.5 units (38, 43, 25, 38, 20, 13). There is a visible downward trend even within this low regime (P28 and P29 hitting 20 and 13 respectively), suggesting we are approaching a local minimum before any potential early autumn recovery. Despite the downward trend, N=6 is chosen for stability given the low absolute volumes. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The parameters are set to match this observed low-demand regime to avoid overstocking and unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the remaining summer customers.

Carry-over insight: Mid-to-late summer demand floor confirmed: From P24-P29 (late July to August), demand averaged ~30 units, down from early summer (June) averages of ~140 units, reaching a periodic low of 13 units in P29.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9th, 2019. We are in a deep-summer/early-autumn low-demand phase for this SKU (soft cotton jersey T-shirt). Demand has consistently declined and stabilized at very low levels, averaging (~14.7 units) over the last 3 periods (P28-P30) and (~22.5 units) over the last 6 periods (P25-P30). There is no yet visible signal of a back-to-school or autumn inventory build-up. I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to capture this low-demand state while allowing for slight volatility (sigma_hat, also recent_N=6). The actual lead time remains 0 periods as verified by recent arrivals (P30 arrived in P30). Pipeline inventory is currently 0, with 39 units on-hand, which covers nearly 3 periods of current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor confirmed: P28-P30 demand averaged ~15 units, indicating a continued low period for jersey staples following the summer decline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. This SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a deep late-summer/early-autumn demand floor. Historical data from P28-P31 shows extremely low and stable demand: 20, 13, 11, and 13 units respectively (mean ~14.25). The carry-over insights confirm this floor. Given the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met (actual lead time 0), I will target this current low regime. I'll use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized floor (P28-P31) and avoid over-ordering based on higher spring/summer data. This will maintain a lean inventory (on-hand is currently 34) while the backend OR logic balances the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a deep summer/autumn trough. Demand has consistently declined from spring peaks (~314 units) to a stable floor in September. Over the last five periods (P28-P32), demand has been very low: 20, 13, 11, 13, and 8 units, averaging 13.0 units. With current on-hand inventory at 26 units and zero lead time (L=0), the current stock covers approximately two periods of the current demand regime. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for this basic staple, I will align parameters with this recent low-demand regime (N=5). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor confirmed: P28-P32 demand averaged 13.0 units, stabilized at the lowest levels seen in the 2019 cycle for this jersey staple.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently at its historical demand floor. Demand has consistently stayed between 8 and 13 units for the last 6 periods (P28-P33), averaging approximately 10.7 units. The mid-summer to early-autumn trough for this product category appears stable. With the date being September 30th, we are transitioning into the autumn/winter season. While 'Everyday Basics' may see a slight seasonal shift as consumers move to layering, there is no evidence yet of a demand increase. The current on-hand inventory of 17 units covers roughly 1.5 periods of the current average demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a lean inventory while covering potential minor volatility at these low volume levels, \u03bc\u0302 is set to 11 units (reflecting the recent regime) using a recent_N of 6, and \u03c3\u0302 is calculated from the same period to capture the low variance.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt has stabilized at its seasonal floor. Over the last seven periods (P28-P34), demand has consistently remained in the single or low double digits, averaging approximately 9.6 units (20, 13, 11, 13, 8, 9, 3). No seasonal uptick for autumn is yet visible in the data. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this high-margin staple, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7-period window (N=7). This specifically targets the current stagnant demand regime observed throughout September and early October.

Carry-over insight: October demand floor confirmed: P28-P34 demand averaged ~9.6 units, maintaining the lowest levels of the 2019 cycle for this jersey staple with no autumn recovery yet detected.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a deep-autumn demand floor. As of Period 36 (October 14, 2019), demand has been consistently low for seven weeks (P29-P35), averaging only 7.1 units per period. The most recent two periods (P34-P35) recorded demand of just 3 units each. Seasonality analysis for 'Everyday Basics' suggests no immediate autumn recovery is likely until pre-holiday or winter transitions. The current on-hand inventory is 17 units, which covers more than two periods of the current average demand (7.1) and nearly six periods of the most recent demand (3). Given the promised lead time of 0 and actual lead time confirmed consistently at 0, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the stabilized floor (avg ~7.2) while allowing the OR backend to minimize orders until on-hand inventory is depleted to the base stock level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the significantly reduced volatility (standard deviation ~4.1) compared to earlier in the year.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 629420007 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) remains at its annual floor, typical for late October. Demand over the last five periods (P32-P36) has been extremely low and stable, with values of 8, 9, 3, 3, and 4 (average 5.4 units). Previous carry-over insights correctly identified the descent from summer highs to this autumn trough. The on-hand inventory is 13 units, which currently covers over two periods of expected demand at the current rate. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this low-volume period, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture this specific floor regime. This will likely result in a very small or zero order, allowing the system to bleed off the remaining on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a deep-autumn demand floor. As of late October (Period 38), demand has remained consistently low for the last 10 periods (P28-P37), with an average of approximately 9.9 units per period and a very low standard deviation. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P34-P37) show demand values of [3, 3, 4, 5], yielding a recent mean of 3.75 units. This represents the lowest activity phase in the product's 2019 lifecycle. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level, but the absolute order quantities will be small due to the low demand mean. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this stabilized floor while allowing for the extreme low-end variability seen in the last few weeks.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4th, 2019. This product, a basic jersey T-shirt, has been in a sustained low-demand regime since late July. Over the last 11 periods (P28-P38), demand has been consistently minimal, averaging approximately 8.5 units per period. The most recent three periods (P36-P38) show demand levels of 4, 5, and 5. There is no evidence yet of a late-autumn or winter recovery for this specific 'Everyday Basics' item. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. Given the low and stable demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized floor while maintaining a small inventory buffer (on-hand is currently 13). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed history of 0-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn demand floor: Demand has further stabilized to an average of ~8.5 units over Periods 28-38, down from the September average of ~13 units, confirming the deepest part of the low-season for this jersey staple.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt) remains in its deepest seasonal trough as of November 11th. Demand consistently remains under 10 units per week, with an average of 4.2 units over the last five periods (P35-P39). The Carry-Over insights confirm a long decline from the April peak of ~314 units to the current autumn floor. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire game history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 14 units and the extremely low demand levels, the inventory sufficiently covers more than three periods of forecast demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the most recent stabilized floor of ~4.2 units) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current low volatility. L remains at the promised 0 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The focus for Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019) is managing the prolonged low-demand phase for SKU 629420007 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt). Demand has been extremely low and stable since September (Period 31), averaging approximately 7 units per week over the last 10 periods (P31-P40). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P36-P40) show a mean demand of 3.8 units and a standard deviation of 0.84. With upcoming dates approaching late November and December, there is a possibility of a minor uptick for basic staples, but currently, the signal is purely one of a deep floor. Actual lead time remains 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the priority is maintaining a slim but safe inventory (targeting ~2-3 weeks of cover). I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most stable recent demand floor while filtering out the volatile spring/summer data.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a deep autumn/winter low-demand phase. Demand has been exceptionally low and stable since Period 28 (late August), averaging approximately 8.5 units over the last 14 periods. The most recent demand samples (P39-P41) are 4, 3, and 2 units, continuing the downward slope as we approach the end of November. There is no evidence of a pre-holiday or winter surge for this basic jersey staple yet. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 10 units and recent demand between 2-4 units, we have enough stock to cover approximately 3 weeks of the current demand regime. I will use the recent_N method with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable low-demand floor while maintaining a small safety buffer for minor fluctuations.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd, 2019. The SKU 629420007 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a persistent low-demand period typical for jersey staples in winter. Demand over the last 10 periods (P33-P42) has been extremely stable and low, averaging 4.2 units per period (range 2-9). Most recent demand (P42) was 4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 13 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of the current average demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs in this low-velocity phase, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 samples (N=10) to reflect this stable autumn/winter floor. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as historical performance consistently matches the promised 0 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th (Period 44). We are in the deepest part of the low-season for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 11 periods (P33-P43) has been extremely low and stable, averaging approximately 3.3 units per week (ranging from 0 to 9). The demand floor noted in the carry-over insights (~8.5 units) has actually softened further as we enter the holiday season, with most recent weeks showing even lower numbers. Currently, we have 13 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods and weekly demand is <4 units, 13 units represents nearly 4 weeks of safety stock. No additional orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (last 10 periods) to avoid over-ordering based on the high spring/summer volumes, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the low volatility of this current floor.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor update: Demand has settled into an extremely low late-autumn regime (P34-P43), averaging ~3.3 units per week, which is lower than the previous floor of ~8.5 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). The product, a basic jersey T-shirt, is in a deep late-autumn/winter demand floor. Over the last 11 periods (P34-P44), demand has averaged approximately 3.3 units per week, with extreme lows (e.g., 0 units in P43). On-hand inventory is currently 10 units with no units in transit. Given the low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19), the service level target remains high, but the absolute volume is minimal. I will use a recent_N window of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'floor' regime. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history, so L is set to default.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' cotton jersey T-shirt. We are currently in an extremely low-demand late-autumn/winter regime. Over the last 12 periods (P34-P45), demand has consistently averaged ~3.1 units per week, with recent demand being even lower (0, 3, and 1 units in the last three weeks). There is no evidence of a holiday spike for this basic staple item in the lead-up to Christmas. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations confirm actual lead time remains 0. With 9 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~3 units per period, the current inventory is sufficient to cover approximately three weeks of demand. Given the low holding cost ($1) but high margin ($19), the OR backend will maintain a small safety stock. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to reflect this stabilized low-demand floor, and use the default lead time of 0.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the final period of the year. The product is a staple jersey T-shirt, which has been in a sustained low-demand floor since early November. Over the last 13 periods (P34-P46), demand has averaged approximately 2.5 units per week, with the most recent four periods showing demand of 0, 3, 1, and 1. On-hand inventory is currently 8 units, which is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the upcoming period without additional ordering. Given that this is the end of the 2019 cycle and demand is extremely low, I will maintain the current parameters using a recent_N window (N=13) to reflect this late-autumn/winter floor. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.
