Inventory: 63 on-hand + 0 in-transit, sufficient buffer. Demand analysis: Recent history volatile - summer peak P13-18 avg~100+, post-June decline P19-21 avg50, early July uptick P20-22 avg69/P23:76, but P24 sharp drop to 21 (-72%). Carry-over insights note early July uptick sustained P20-22, but P24 single-period drop not yet sustained (needs 3+ periods). Late July (2019/7/29) for summer necklace accessory: possible end-of-summer softening, no major holidays imminent. Full history mean diluted by early lows; recent 10-period avg ~83, last 5 avg~64, but P24 low pulls down. OR rec=0 (base_stock <=63 given L=0 and historical stats), aligns with high inventory vs recent low/decline signals.
