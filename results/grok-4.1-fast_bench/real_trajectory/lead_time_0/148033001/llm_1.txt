World knowledge: Mid-August 2019 (summer peak, northern hemisphere) drives low demand for tights due to warmer weather favoring bare legs; back-to-school starts late Aug but minimal impact on tights vs. school uniforms/socks. Matches seasonal pattern: Jan highs ~50, April decline noted, summer drop P17+ avg~23. (b) Demand regime: Sustained summer low confirmed (P21-26: 22,29,22,14,30,21; avg=23, consistent with P17-20 drop vs. May avg45). No new shifts; stable low variance ~14-30. (c) Lead time: Consistently 0 periods across all 26 periods (every conclude: 'lead_time was 0 periods'); no in-transit or lost orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=10, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Post-P26: ended with 10 after demand=21. (e) Final order logic: Forecast P27 demand~23 (recent avg+seasonal low); with LT=0, order arrives before demand. Target total inventory=35 (on-hand10 + order25) for full service (covers 95th%ile recent demand~30) + buffer; expect sold~23, ending~12 (holding cost $12 low vs. $19 profit/stockout risk); balances over 47 periods.",
