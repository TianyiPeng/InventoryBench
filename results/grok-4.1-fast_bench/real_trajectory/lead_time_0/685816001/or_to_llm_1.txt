{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods consistently (e.g., P46: arrived=106 (ordered on Period 46, lead_time was 0 periods)), matching promised; no lost shipments or in-transit delays (current in-transit=0). Inventory analysis: On-hand=90, in-transit=0, so pre-order position=90. Demand analysis: Product is basic men's cotton jersey round-neck t-shirt (undershirt category), with strong seasonality per carry-over (summer peaks 150-200+, fall/winter decline to 30-80). Recent winter P37-P46 demands: 80,75,64,30,38,150,46,49,107,84 (avg 72.3, high vol sd~36 due to holiday spikes like P42=150 Thanksgiving?, P45=107 pre-Christmas). Post-Christmas P47 (12/30) likely low-moderate ~60-85 (similar to P46=84 Christmas week, but post-holiday drop expected for undershirts). OR rec=84 implies base_stock~174 (84 +90), overly high due to full-history avg inflated by summer (~100+ overall mu_bar); ignores seasonality. Adjusted forecast: mu=72 recent winter avg, sigma~30 (smoothed vol), L+1=1, critical z=1.645 (q=19/20=0.95), base_stock~72+49=121; order_raw=121-90=31. Round to 30 for conservatism, minimizing holding risk (expected end inv~121-72=49, cost~49) while avoiding stockout (lost profit ~5% tail). No cap issue as low quantity.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR's 84 to 30 units - OR base inflated by summer history; recent winter avg demand 72 (P37-P46) with high vol, post-Christmas 12/30 expects ~70-80, on-hand 90 +30 reaches seasonal base ~121 (95% service).",
