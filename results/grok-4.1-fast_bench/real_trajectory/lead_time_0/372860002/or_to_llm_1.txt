Demand analysis: Long decline sustained P23-P43 (carry-over avg ~177, -51% vs high regime P7-P22 avg 358); recent P44-P46 (81,116,129) slight uptick but still low (~109 avg), post-Christmas (P46=12/23 demand=129) into New Year's (P47=12/30); socks as winter product may see mild recovery but no evidence of regime shift back to high (historical pre-spike avg~78, high regime was anomalous). OR rec=0 uses promised L=0 and full history (mean likely pulled down by decline), base_stock exceeded by 510 inv. Strategy: Follow OR=0; high inv avoids holding costs ($1/unit/period) while covering low demand outlook; no override needed as no seasonality spike evident yet (monitor Jan for winter surge).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - on-hand inventory of 510 exceeds base stock needs given sustained demand decline and recent low averages (~110 over P44-P46), minimizing holding costs.",
