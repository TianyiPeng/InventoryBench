Lingerie demand spikes for gifting/party season; recent Oct-Nov high demand aligns with pre-holiday build-up.

P39-40 slight dip to ~129 vs P36-38 147 but within variance (sd~25); no sustained shift (only 2 periods <3). Holiday proximity suggests continued/accelerating high ~140-160.

(d) Inventory: On-hand 63, in-transit 0; no pipeline/overdues. Post-P40: ended 63 after 126 demand on 189 start (safe buffer).
