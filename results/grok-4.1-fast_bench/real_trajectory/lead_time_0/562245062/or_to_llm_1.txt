Wait, history shows previous orders aligning. Regardless, recent data better: override to target recent base_stock=65 total IP, order=65-37=28. But to buffer stable low, conservatively order 60 to target IP~97? No, stick to calc: but given profit>holding, slight safety up to order 35 for IP=72 matching OR quantity but adjusted. Final: blend - recent justifies reducing OR 72 to 55 (IP=37+55=92, covers 60+5\u03c3~90 with buffer). Wait, precise: order 28 too low-risk stockout if demand 60-70; OR's safety wise for variance.
