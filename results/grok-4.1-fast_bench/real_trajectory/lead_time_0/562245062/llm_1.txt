Date 2019-02-11 (Mon), near Valentine's Day (Feb 14) but jeans not strongly tied to it; late winter/early spring transition with steady everyday demand. Historical data shows strong relevance: prior weeks Jan7-Feb4 demands 59\u2192144, aligning with potential post-holiday ramp-up or seasonal clothing refresh. No major spikes expected immediately. (b) Demand regime: Clear sustained upward trend over 5 historical weeks (59,78,96,123,144); weekly increases 19,18,27,21 (avg +21 units). Projected Period 1 demand: 144+21=165, with std dev ~20-25 suggesting range 140-190. No regime shift yet, trend intact. (c) Lead time: Promised 0; no prior orders/concludes to infer actual or missing shipments. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0, in-transit 0; fully depleted, no coverage for imminent demand. (e) Order logic: With lead time ~0, order covers Period 1 demand post-decision. Target 165 forecast +40 safety (for trend/upside risk, ~25% buffer) = 180 units. Balances stockout risk (lost $4P profit) vs holding ($1/unit); excess if low demand carries cheaply to Period 2 reforecast.",
