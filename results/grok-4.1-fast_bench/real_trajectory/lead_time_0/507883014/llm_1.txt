Date 2019-02-11 is mid-February, 3 days before Valentine's Day (Feb 14), a major driver for lingerie demand spikes due to gifting/romance (often 50-100%+ uplift in retail). Historical data shows ramp-up: Jan 7:31, then 60-70 range, Feb 4:68, confirming seasonal build toward V-Day. (b) Demand regime: Early data low (31), shifted to sustained ~65 mean (last 4wks: 60,70,64,68 avg=65.5, +110% from start), now V-Day proximity suggests further spike to 90-120. (c) Lead time: Promised 0; no prior orders/concludes, cannot infer yet; no missing orders. (d) Inventory: On-hand 0, in-transit 0; empty pipeline, must order to cover Period 1 demand post-arrival. (e) Order 100: Covers forecasted V-Day spike (~65 hist +50% uplift), high profit($19):holding($1) favors overstock vs stockout; sets base for multi-period coverage assuming lead=0 confirmation next period.",
