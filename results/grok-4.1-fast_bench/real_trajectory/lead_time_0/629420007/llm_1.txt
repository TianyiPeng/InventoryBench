Late fall (2019/11/11, mid-Nov near Veterans Day), cold weather suppresses T-shirt demand; no major spikes expected pre-Thanksgiving/Black Friday for basics (more outerwear/holiday gifts). Historical pattern: spring peak, steady decline to very low fall (per carry-overs). (b) Demand regime sustained very low mid/late fall (~3-5 recent); P36-39: 4,5,5,4 avg 4.5 (stable vs P34-36 avg 3.3, no significant shift); forecast ~4-5/period. Total remaining (P40-47, ~8wks) ~32-40. (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods (all concludes confirm); no in-transit, no missing orders. (d) On-hand 37, in-transit 0; covers ~7-9 periods at 4-5 demand/period (exact for expected total ~32-40). (e) Order 0: high inventory covers forecast without stockout risk (37>32 expected total), minimizes new holding ($1/unit/period) while LT=0 allows reactive ordering if needed; prioritizes sell-through of existing stock.",
