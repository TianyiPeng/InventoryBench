Feb 11, 2019: Mid-winter northern hemisphere; skirts typically off-peak (favor pants/leggings), but steady historical sales suggest year-round base demand. Recent Chinese New Year (Feb 5) passed; Valentine's Day (Feb 14) upcoming but unlikely major driver for skirts. No strong seasonal spike expected. (b) Demand regime: Historical (5 weeks Jan-Feb): 71,79,82,90,80; mean=80.4, stable low variance (~6 std), no regime shift. Forecast Period 1: ~80-85. (c) Lead time: Promised 0; no game history to infer actual (Period 1 first). No in-transit/missing orders. (d) Inventory: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; pipeline empty. Must order to cover immediate demand (post-decision arrival if LT=0). (e) Order logic: Order 85 (historical mean + minor safety for variance/Valentine's uncertainty). Covers expected demand, minimizes initial overstock (holding=$1 vs profit=$4); reassess post-Period 1 conclude.",

Recent P33-P38: 120,90,81,54,105,127 (avg96); volatile but P36 dip (54) followed by sustained highs P37-38 (avg116), suggesting continued ~100-120 regime into Nov without contradicting prior upshift.
