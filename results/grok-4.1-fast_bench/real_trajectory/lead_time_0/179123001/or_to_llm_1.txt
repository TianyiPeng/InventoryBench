Date 2019/11/25 (pre-Thanksgiving Mon Nov25, Black Friday Nov29 upcoming) for women's long leggings (winter jersey basics) suggests potential demand uptick from holiday shopping/cold weather, but no sustained shift yet (recent still low, no new evidence for carry-over). OR recommendation: 37 units, likely targeting base-stock ~141 (historical mean pulls up vs pure recent low), capped policy smooths. Strategy: High on-hand covers current low demand risk; slight override upward to 50 builds modest safety for (L+1=1)-period horizon plus proactive holiday anticipation (Black Friday/Christmas boost for apparel), balancing low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19); avoids overstocking with 6 periods left.",
