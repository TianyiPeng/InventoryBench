Strategy: Override OR downward to 35 units - targets recent P6-8 avg=34 demand forecast + modest safety (z~1 for q=0.95, low vol now), avoids excess holding ($1/unit/period) on already-high 91 on-hand; post-order inventory ~126 before P9 demand ~25-35, expected ending ~95-100 (manageable holding).

No in-transit or lost shipments (in-transit=0). Inventory position: On-hand=0, pipeline=0, so order quantity directly sets starting inventory for P43 demand (arrives same period). Demand analysis: Product is long-sleeve ribbed knit sweater (winter apparel).
