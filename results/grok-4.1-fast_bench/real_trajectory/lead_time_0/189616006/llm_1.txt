(b) Demand regime: Historical weekly data shows ramp-up Jan-Feb (37\u219295\u2192121\u2192153\u2192145); recent mean ~140 (last 3 periods avg 140), high variance early but stabilizing ~150 peak.

(e) Order logic: Cover Period 1 demand (~150) post-decision arrival (L=0 expected); high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1) favors slight safety buffer over stockout risk; order 150 balances immediate need + minor future hedge.",
