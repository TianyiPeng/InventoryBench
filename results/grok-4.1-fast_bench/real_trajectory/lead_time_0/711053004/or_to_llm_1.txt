Demand analysis: Jersey T-shirt in late July 2019 (summer peak season, warm weather drives high demand). Full history shows summer surge P16-P24 avg ~142 (1275/9 periods), recent P22-P24: 103/76/188 avg 122 but volatile with P24 spike to 188 confirming elevated levels (+280% vs pre-summer P13-15 avg39 per carry-over). Carry-over notes post-peak softening P21-P23 avg115 (-28% vs P16-P20), but P24=188 rejects full softening, demand remains strong/volatile at ~140-170 range. OR rec=145 uses full history (diluted by early low demands) and promised L=0 with safety (q=19/20=0.95 fractile), aligns with ~1-period base-stock ~mu +1.645 sigma. Adjustment: Increase OR by 25 to 170 for recency-weighted summer mean ~150 + extra safety (low holding $1 vs profit $19, recent stockouts P17/P19/P24), covers high end of recent (e.g., 188) while avoiding excess hold. Strategy: Order 170 to target ending inv ~20-50 assuming demand 120-150, prioritizing sales over hold.",
