Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), first period for CARINA HIGH SUPPORT BRA (sports bra). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no prior order/arrival/demand history visible. Historical samples (5 weeks ending 2019-02-04): demands 81,48,71,68,74 (mean~68.4, steady, no changepoint/seasonal shift evident; early Feb, no major events like holidays spiking sports bra demand). Promised L=0. No observed lead times. Use defaults: backend computes mu_hat=(1+0)*68.4~68, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*std~15 (std~14.6), yielding base stock ~ mu + z*sigma with q=19/(19+1)=0.95 (z~1.645), balancing high service vs low holding.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18, Presidents' Day US holiday). Sports bra (CARINA HIGH SUPPORT BRA, H&M Sport) - steady demand category, no strong holiday tie-in expected. Period 1 demand=56 (lower than hist mean 68.4 from samples 81,48,71,68,74 and recent 74), but single period - no confirmed changepoint (within ~1.5 std ~13-15). Lead time confirmed 0 periods from P1 conclude (arrived same period). On-hand=33, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments. Pipeline covers 0 periods. Defaults use L=0, mu_hat=68.4, sigma_hat~13.4 (sqrt(1)*std), yielding high base stock ~68+1.645*13~90 to cover ~1 period demand at q=19/20=0.95 service, order-up-to from 33 balances profit vs holding.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25), late February, sports bra product - no major calendar events or seasonal spikes expected (post-Valentine's, pre-spring). Recent demands: P1=56, P2=60 (avg 58); historical samples avg ~68.4 (81,48,71,68,74). Slight softening possible from last historical 74 to 56/60 (-20-24%), but only 2 periods - not sustained changepoint (needs 3+). Lead times confirmed 0 periods for P1 and P2 orders (arrived same period, no losses, in-transit=0). On-hand=27 low vs expected ~60 demand; pipeline=27 total. Use defaults: L=default (promised/observed 0), mu_hat=default ((1+0)*mean all samples ~68), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+0)*std all ~12-14). Yields base_stock ~68 + 1.645*13 ~88, order ~61 to cover demand+safety pre-demand resolution. Balances high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs low holding ($1), proactive for potential stockout risk.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, sports bra with steady demand expected (no major events). Game demands: P1=56, P2=60, P3=54 (avg 56.67, stable around 55-60 vs historical avg 68.4). All lead times confirmed 0 periods (P1 order arrived P1, etc.). On-hand=31 (from P3 end), in-transit=0, covers ~0.5 periods. No overdue/lost shipments. Use recent_3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to match current lower/less volatile regime (std~2.45 vs historical higher); default L=0 confirmed. Ensures high service (q=19/20=0.95) with minimal holding via current demand params.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (P1-3 orders all arrived same period); Demand regime stable at avg 57 (P1-3: 56,60,54, lower than historical 68)

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11), early March, sports bra with steady demand, no major events. Lead time confirmed 0 for all P1-4 concludes (each arrived same period). Recent demands P1-4: 56,60,54,65 (avg 58.75, std ~4.2), lower mean than historical ~68 but stable recent regime (P1-3 avg 57, P4 65 slight uptick not sustained). On-hand 0, in-transit 0, no overdue. Use default L=0 (matches actual). recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to base forecast on current lower-demand regime, ensuring base stock ~59 + 1.64*4.2 ~67 covers 1-period demand at high service (q=19/20=0.95) while minimizing hold cost vs prior stockouts.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): Early spring, sports bra (H&M Sport), no major calendar events or seasonal spikes imminent; demand stable at recent avg ~57 (P1-5: 56,60,54,65,52), lower than historical ~68, no new changepoint (P4=65 was transient). LT consistently 0 periods confirmed (P1-5 all same-period arrivals), no in-transit/overdues. On-hand=15 low vs expected demand ~57; pipeline=0. Use default L=0 (promised/actual match). recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on current stable lower-demand regime (ignores pre-game hist), yielding mu_hat=1*57.4\u224857, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*~4.6; supports base_stock ~57 + safety, balances high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1) for service without excess inventory.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), late March, sports bra (CARINA HIGH SUPPORT BRA) - steady demand expected, no major calendar events. Lead time consistently 0 periods across P1-6 (all arrived same period, no losses). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent stockouts in P4&P6 signal need for coverage. Game demands P1-6: [56,60,54,65,52,70], mean=59.5 (vs hist ~68), recent P4-6 mean=62.3. Stable regime but variance up recently. Use default L=0 (confirmed). recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture full game history mean/volatility (~60, std~7), scaled by (1+0)=1. Ensures base_stock ~60 + high z*sigma covers demand while minimizing hold cost; backend cap prevents overorder.

Carry-over insight: Demand variance increased at Period 4: std ~3 (P1-3) to ~9 (P4-6); mean slight uptick to 62 (P4-6 vs 57 P1-3)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1), sports bra in early spring; no major calendar events, demand stable post-changepoint at P4 (carry-over confirmed). Lead time consistently 0 across P1-7 (no in-transit/overdues). Recent demand P4-7: 65,52,70,63 (avg 62.5, std ~7.6, higher variance/mean vs P1-3). On-hand=8 low vs ~60 demand, pipeline=0. Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained regime (length=4 >=3), L=default (confirmed 0). Parameters boost base_stock ~62.5 +1.645*7.6 ~76 (high q=19/20=0.95), order~68 after on-hand, balancing stockouts vs holding; cap irrelevant.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early spring; sports bra demand steady post-winter, possible fitness season uptick but no major events. Lead time consistently 0 periods (P1-8 all confirmed 0, no losses or drifts). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, frequent stockouts (P4 lost5, P6 lost4, P8 lost6) due to demand volatility/uptick. All-history demand mean=62.6 (501/8), recent P4-8 mean=66.2 (regime post-P4 changepoint noted in carry-over), std recent higher ~11 vs early ~3. Use recent_N=5 (regime length=5 since P4 variance shift) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture higher mean/volatility, L=default (stable 0). This raises base_stock targeting ~66 +1.645*~11*sqrt(1)=~85, balancing high profit-driven service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding, covering expected demand+buffer to avoid losses.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15), mid-April approaching Easter (4/21), but sports bra demand unlikely strongly affected. All observed lead times (P1-9) confirmed 0 periods, matching promised; no in-transit or delays. Demand history: P1-9 avg 59.6 (lower than historical ~68), stable early low variance (P1-3 avg57 std~3), shift at P4 to higher mean/variance (P4-6 avg62 std~9, carry-over noted), continued volatility P7-9 (63,81,35 avg60 std~23), P9 anomalously low at 35. Regime from P4 (length 6): P4-9 demands avg61 std~16. On-hand 49 sufficient for ~1 period but risky with volatility. Set L default (0), mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=6 (P4-9 regime) to adapt backend to current lower mean/higher vol regime vs historical; base_stock ~61 + 1.645*16 \u224885, expected order ~85-49=36 balances high service (q=0.95) vs holding, anticipates coverage for 1+L=1 period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter (April 21). Sports bra demand shows recent sharp drop P9=35, P10=34 after P8=81 peak (possibly spring/Easter spike). Overall game avg demand=57 (10 periods), recent_5 (P6-10:70,63,81,35,34) mean=56.6 captures volatility without overreacting to short low-demand regime (only 2 periods). Lead time consistently 0 across all 10 periods, no in-transit or losses. On-hand=54 covers expected ~57 mean demand (low holding risk). recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat adjusts for confirmed variance increase (carry-over P7) and recent patterns, enabling high service (q=19/20=0.95) while minimizing overstock vs historical prior ~68.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29): Sports bra in late April (spring/summer approach, but no major events; post-Easter P11 4/22 demand low). On-hand=60 covers 2+ recent low demands (~33); in-transit=0; all historical lead times=0 confirmed (P1-11). Demands: P1-8 avg=62.6 (std~11), P9-11 sharp drop to avg=33.7 (std~1.3, changepoint at P9 sustained 3 periods, -46% mean, low vol). Use L=default (matches observed 0). mu_hat=recent_N N=3 captures new low regime for (1+0)*33.7. sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 for low vol. Ensures OR backend targets base_stock ~34 +1.645*1.3~36 (high service q=19/20=0.95), orders ~36-60=0 but adjusts for cap; prevents overorder amid drop while covering low demand, minimizes holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: avg dropped to 33.7 (P9-11:35,34,32) from 62.6 (P1-8, -46%); variance dropped to std~1.3 (P9-11) from ~11 (P1-8)

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6, early May, sports bra - potential Mother's Day uptick May 12). Demand history: P1-8 avg~63 high variance; shift at P9 to low regime P9-11 avg33.7 std~1.3 (confirmed in carry-over); P12=51 (+51% vs P11, avg P9-12=38). Most recent changepoint P9 regime now length 4 (sustained low-med demand), N=4 (min(4,20) max3). On-hand=9 low, no in-transit, no overdue (all L=0 confirmed P1-12). Use L default=0 (stable). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=4 for recent regime forecast ~38 mean, ~8 std; scales to (1+0) periods. High q=19/20=0.95 ensures service vs holding; cap prevents excess. Recent params adapt to low regime recovery, balance stockout risk with low holding.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20, late spring/early summer; sports bra - potential seasonal uptick in activewear but data shows post-April drop). Lead time consistently 0 periods (all P1-14 orders arrived same period, no losses or in-transit). Recent demand regime post-changepoint P9 (length=6 periods P9-14: 35,34,32,51,47,36; avg=39.2, std~7.8). On-hand=18 low vs ~39 expected; no pipeline. Use L=default (confirmed 0). mu_hat=recent_6, sigma_hat=recent_6 to capture current lower-mean/higher-variance regime (vs early ~62/11). q=19/20=0.95, z~1.645 \u2192 base_stock~39+1.65*7.8~53; OR orders ~35 (after 18 on-hand), arrives same period pre-demand, balances stockouts vs holding (profit dominant). No overdue shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptick post-P12: avg 44.7 (P12-14:51,47,36) from 33.7 (P9-11, +33%); variance up to std~7.8 from ~1.3

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, late May, approaching summer - potential fitness/sports bra demand uptick). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline. Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 15 prior periods, no losses. Demand history: recent regime post-P12 shift (sustained 4 periods P12-15: demands 51,47,36,66; mean=50, std\u224812.4), up from P9-11 low mean=33.7, confirming volatile uptick noted in carry-over. Overall historical mean\u224853.5 (P1-15). Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target recent regime (mu_hat=1*50=50, sigma_hat=\u221a1*12.4\u224812.4), balancing against holding cost with q=19/20=0.95 (z\u22481.645, base stock ~50+20=70). L=default (0) as confirmed stable. Addresses stockouts (e.g., P15) by adapting to recent higher/variable demand without overstocking vs historical.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-P12 now sustained 4 periods: avg=50 (P12-15:51,47,36,66, +48% vs P9-11 33.7), std=12.4 (up from ~1.3 P9-11)

On-hand=34 covers ~1 period (recent avg~47), in-transit=0, all prior orders arrived LT=0 (no losses/overdues). No calendar spikes imminent (pre-summer steady). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on current regime (length=5>3), L=default (confirmed 0). OR backend: high q=19/20=0.95 targets base_stock~47 + 1.64*12 ~66 (L=0), orders to refill post-demand, minimizing hold cost on excess while covering vol/stockouts.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/6/17, mid-June summer onset); sports bra demand typically steady for fitness but recent post-P12 regime (P12-18: avg 45.3, std~10.7) shows volatility with P15 spike (66) then stabilization lower; on-hand 25 sufficient for ~40 demand but low buffer, in-transit 0, no overdue/missing shipments (all historical LT=0 confirmed P1-18). L default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat recent_7 (N=7 for 7-period post-P12 regime length, captures current mean~45 vs overall~51). sigma_hat recent_7 (N=7, reflects regime vol~11 vs earlier lower). Params tune OR base_stock to recent lower mean/higher vol for high service (q=19/20=0.95) minimizing hold cost on overstock amid fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-P15: avg down to 39 (P16-18:37,40,40, -22% vs P12-15 avg50), std down to ~1.5 from 12.4 (low variance sustained 3 periods)

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8, early summer Monday), sports bra (H&M ladies' activewear) - demand lower post-winter highs, no major events but seasonal dip possible in summer. Confirmed L=0 all periods (latest P21: ordered=52 arrived=52). On-hand=33, in-transit=0, no losses/overdues. Demand regime post-P9 shift sustained 13 periods (P9-21: demands 35,34,32,51,47,36,66,37,40,40,55,51,25; mean=42.2, std\u224813.1 vs historical ~68 mean/12 std). P16-18 low-mean/low-var (39/1.5), but P19-21 (55,51,25 avg43.7 std=15.1) resumes volatility around 42 - no new sustained changepoint. Use recent_N=13 (regime_length=13) for mu_hat/sigma_hat: mu_hat=1*42.2, sigma_hat=1*13.1. q=19/20=0.95 (z\u22481.64), base_stock\u224842+21=63; order\u2248min(63-33, cap\u224842+8)=30. Covers expected ~42 demand (on-hand33 + order30), minimizes holding on 33 while protecting against volatility/upside (e.g. P15/P19 spikes).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/07/15, mid-summer). Sports bra demand typically steady in summer fitness season, no major holidays. Lead time confirmed 0 across all 22 periods, no in-transit or losses. On-hand 23 low vs recent demand ~40-45. Demand regime since P12 changepoint (post low P9-11 avg33.7): P12-22 (11 periods) avg44.2, std~12.5 (volatile, e.g., highs 66/55, low 25 P21). Use recent_N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained post-P12 regime (N=max(min(11,20),3)=11); L default (confirmed 0). mu_hat=(1+0)*44.2=44.2, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*12.5~12.5.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22, summer Monday). Sports bra demand in summer shows variability; recent P19-23 demands (55,51,25,38,48) avg=43.4, std~12.1, changepoint post-P18 (P16-18: avg39 std~1.5 low variance). Confirmed LT=0 all 23 periods, no in-transit/overdues, on-hand=15 low vs recent demand~48. Use recent_N=5 (regime length=5>=3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target current lower mean/higher variance regime vs historical ~68; L=default (promised/actual=0). Adjusts base_stock=~43 + z*12 (q=19/20=0.95, z~1.64) ~59, covers (1+0) demand + safety, minimizes holding on 15 OH while preventing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-P18: avg 43.4 (P19-23:55,51,25,38,48 +11% vs P16-18 39), std~12.1 (up ~700% from P16-18 ~1.5); variance increase sustained 5 periods

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29, late July summer; sports bra - stable seasonal demand expected, no major events). Lead time consistently 0 across all 24 periods, no intransit or overdue shipments (on-hand=40 covers recent ~40 avg demand). Demand regime post-P18 sustained 6 periods (P19-24:55,51,25,38,48,24; avg=40.2 -11% vs prior regimes, std~14.0 high volatility sustained). No new changepoint (P24=24 fits high variance, not sustained low shift). Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target current low-mean/high-var regime: mu_hat=1*40.2 (lowers base_stock vs all-history ~55), sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*14 (safety for vol); L=default=0. With q=19/20=0.95 (z~1.645), base_stock~40+23=63 (order ~23 to top-up from 40 on-hand, minimizing hold cost on excess while high service).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5, early August summer - sports bra demand may dip post-peak season). Lead time confirmed 0 periods consistently (P25 order arrived same period, no in-transit or losses). Recent demands P21-25: 25,38,48,24,29 (avg=32.8, std~10.1), lower mean than prior regime P19-23 avg43.4 (possible summer slowdown, 3 lows in 5 periods but not fully sustained changepoint). On-hand=34 covers expected ~33 demand + safety (no stockout risk). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to adapt to recent lower mean/vol, reducing base_stock vs all-history (~47) to minimize holding ($1) while q~0.95 service handles var. L=default (promised 0 confirmed).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12), late summer for sports bra (activewear steady demand expected, no major events). Lead time consistently 0 across all 26 periods, no in-transit or losses. On-hand 16 covers partial recent demand (~30-40). Recent regime post-P18 (P19-26: demands 55,51,25,38,48,24,29,34; avg=38, std~11.3), sustained 8 periods with high variance (matches carry-over P24 note, extended). No new changepoint (P24-26 avg29 lower but within variance, only 3 periods). Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current mean/variance (mu_hat=38, sigma_hat~11.3), default L=0. OR backend base_stock~38+1.645*11.3~57, order~57-16=41 (covers demand, low holding via high q=0.95).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019/8/19, mid-late summer, no major holidays; sports bra demand typically steady but volatile seasonally). On-hand=1, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time consistently 0 periods across all 27 periods). Recent demand regime post-P18 (P19-27: 55,51,25,38,48,24,29,34,57; avg=40.1, std\u224812.9) sustained 9 periods with high variance (consistent with carry-over Period 24 noting shift to avg43.4/std12.1 for P19-23, continued volatile). No new sustained changepoint (P24-27 avg36/std\u224814 volatile, not significantly different). L='default' (promised 0 confirmed). mu_hat='recent_N' N=9 and sigma_hat='recent_N' N=9 capture current regime (mu_hat\u224840.1, sigma_hat\u224812.9), yielding base_stock\u224840+1.645*13\u224861 (q=19/20=0.95 high service); order\u224860 covers recent demand/volatility while minimizing holding (low on-hand).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26): Late summer for sports bra; back-to-school may influence but demand volatile. Lead time consistently 0 across all 28 periods, no in-transit or losses. On-hand 35 sufficient for low recent demand but recent regime shift post-P23: P24-28 demands 24,29,34,57,27 avg=34.2 (down 21% from P19-23 avg43.4), std~13.2 (high variance sustained). No calendar spikes evident. Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime length=5) to adapt to lower mean/high vol, ensuring base_stock ~34 + 1.65*13 ~55 covers (1+0) periods demand post current on-hand, balancing high profit/high service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-P23: avg down to 34.2 (P24-28:24,29,34,57,27 -21% vs P19-23 43.4), std stable ~13.2 (high variance sustained 5 periods)

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16, mid-September, early fall/back-to-school season for sports bras - no major spikes expected, demand aligns with steady fitness/underwear patterns). Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 31 periods (no in-transit, no losses). On-hand=27, sufficient for recent low demand but with high variance risk.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Late September, sports bra demand typically steady but recent history shows sustained low-demand high-volatility regime post-P23 (P24-32: demands 24,29,34,57,27,31,41,27,16; avg=31.8, std\u224812.5), confirmed by prior insights (P24-28 avg34.2 std13.2). No seasonal spikes anticipated soon (post-summer, pre-holidays). Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 32 periods, no in-transit or losses. On-hand=36 covers ~1-2 weeks of recent demand (~16-41). Use recent_9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target base_stock for current regime (mu_hat\u224832, sigma_hat\u224812.5), balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding; default L=0 as stable.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): Late September, sports bra (H&M ladies sportswear) - no major seasonal events like holidays or back-to-school peaks evident; demand likely steady post-summer. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time consistently 0 across all 33 periods). Recent demand regime sustained post-P23 (10+ periods P24-33: demands 24,29,34,57,27,31,41,27,16,54; avg=34.0, std=13.2), confirming carry-over low mean ~34 (-21% vs prior), high variance sustained. P33 demand=54 (stockout). Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target current regime (backend: mu_hat=1*34=34, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*13.2=13.2); L=default (0, confirmed). Balances service (q=19/20=0.95, z~1.645, base_stock~34+1.645*13.2~55) vs holding, covering volatile demand without overstocking given low mean.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7): Sports bra (CARINA HIGH SUPPORT BRA), early October - no major seasonal spikes evident (pre-Halloween, potential gym season steady). On-hand=26 (covers ~1 period at recent avg), in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (all historical LT=0 confirmed). Demand regime sustained low mean=33.6 (P24-34:11 periods, 370/11), high std~12.4 (consistent with carry-over high variance post-P23). No new changepoint (P29-34 avg~33.2, volatile 16-54 but mean stable). L=default (promised/observed=0). mu_hat=recent_N N=11 (regime length=11, (1+0)*33.6). sigma_hat=recent_N N=11 (sqrt(1+0)*12.4, captures sustained high vol). Balances high service (q=19/20=0.95, z~1.64, base~33+20=53) vs low holding with recent low mean, orders ~27 to target w/o overstock.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=43 covers expected ~32 demand + buffer; in-transit=0, all past orders arrived with L=0 (no losses/overdues). Use recent_N=12 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current low mean/high vol regime (regime_length=12); L=default (promised=0, confirmed consistently). High profit/holding ratio favors service; recent params ensure base_stock ~32 + safety for vol, minimizing stockouts/holdings.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21), late October approaching Halloween; sports bra demand in low seasonal fall regime with high variance (no major event spike expected). Lead time confirmed stable at 0 across all 36 periods (no in-transit or losses). On-hand=35 covers ~1.5-2x recent avg demand (~20-30), low holding risk given $1/period. Recent changepoint post-P28: sustained 8-period low demand avg=28.8 (P29-36:31,41,27,16,54,30,12,19, -16% vs prior P24-28 34.2), std~13 (high variance sustained). Use recent_8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to lower mean forecast (base_stock ~29 + safety) while maintaining volatility buffer for q~0.95 service; L=default (0). Balances low holding vs high service given recent low/volatile demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-P28: avg down to 28.8 (P29-36:31,41,27,16,54,30,12,19 -16% vs P24-28 34.2), std~13 high variance sustained 8 periods

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Late October, sports bra demand likely stable/low as winter approaches (indoor fitness steady, no Halloween spike). Confirmed LT=0 all periods, no in-transit/overdues. Demand regime post-P28 sustained 9 periods (P29-37: demands 31,41,27,16,54,30,12,19,17; avg=27.4, std\u224813.1 high variance/low mean continues, P37=17 fits). No new changepoint (last 3 periods 19,17 low but variance high, not shifted mean yet). On-hand=35 covers ~1.3 periods. Use recent_N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=9) to set mu_hat=27.4*(1+0), sigma_hat=13.1*sqrt(1); default L=0. OR base_stock\u224827 + 1.645*13\u224848 targets service level q=19/20=0.95, orders ~13 to cover demand while minimizing holding on excess.

Recent demand regime post-P28 sustained 10 periods (P29-38: demands 31,41,27,16,54,30,12,19,17,34; avg=28.1, std~12.2, low mean high variance confirmed). On-hand=16 low vs expected ~28, risk of stockout. Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to match current regime (regime_length=10); L=default (promised 0, matches all observed).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25), Black Friday week (Nov 29 within week), sports bra likely sees retail holiday demand spike; proactively anticipate higher demand from recent low regime but no prior BF data confirms yet. Lead time confirmed 0 across all 41 periods, no overdue/missing shipments (in-transit=0). Recent demand regime post-P28 sustained 13 periods (P29-41 avg=27.8, std~12), low mean/high var vs prior; on-hand=17 low vs expected ~30+, risk stockout. Use L default (promised/actual 0). mu_hat recent_N N=13 reflects sustained low mean regime (chgpnt post-P28, length=13). sigma_hat recent_N N=13 captures sustained high var. Yields base_stock~28 + 1.645*12~48 (order~31 after -17 onhand), high service (q=0.95) covers possible BF spike to 50+ while minimizing hold cost; adapts OR to recent shift vs default higher historical mean.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2, Cyber Monday) follows P42 Black Friday (2019/11/25) demand spike to 123 (+300% vs P29-41 avg ~28). Sports bra demand surges in holiday retail peak (Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales, activewear/gifts). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time consistently 0). No new changepoints; prior low-demand/high-var regime (P37: avg28.8 P29-36, std~13 sustained) but holiday calendar overrides for mu. L default (promised/actual 0 confirmed all periods). mu_hat explicit=120 forecasts Cyber Monday demand matching BF scale + resolution boost. sigma_hat recent_N=10 (P33-42 demands:54,30,12,19,17,34,25,26,30,123; mean37, std~32) uses post-P24 high-var regime (carry-over) incl. spike. Parameters yield base_stock~120+1.645*32~173 (cap similar), high service (z~1.645, q=0.95) prioritizes profit vs low holding amid stockout risk.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), approaching Christmas (Dec 25, ~2.5 weeks away); sports bra demand shows holiday volatility with Black Friday P42 spike=123 (+330% vs recent ~30 avg), P43 drop=22. On-hand=152 ample (> recent max 123), in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments (all historical orders arrived same period, lead=0 confirmed). Recent regime post-P28 sustained ~15 periods (P29-43 demands:31,41,27,16,54,30,12,19,17,34,25,26,30,123,22; mean=33.8, std~28 est); no new sustained changepoint (spike isolated, variance already high per carry-over). Set L=default (promised=actual=0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=15 (regime_length=15, <20 cap) for low mean/high vol adaptation, yielding base~34+1.645*28~79<<152 \u2192 order=0, minimizes holding on excess inv while high service level (q=0.95) covers holiday vol spikes.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), week of Dec 16-22 includes Super Saturday (Dec 21), peak pre-Christmas retail shopping similar to Black Friday P42 demand=123 (+250% vs prior avg~35). Sports bra likely sees holiday/fitness demand surge. Recent P43-44 low (22,9 avg=15.5, -75% post-spike), P38-44 avg=38 std~36 high variance sustained per carry-over. On-hand=143 covers ~4 weeks at recent mean but risks stockout on spike like 123 (prior P42 lost ~76 sales). No in-transit/overdues (LT consistently 0). Explicit mu_hat=70 (recent 38 + ~80% holiday uplift toward historical peaks ~70) and sigma_hat=50 (>recent ~40 for tail coverage) targets base_stock~70+1.645*50=152>143 for small top-up order~9, balancing high service (q=0.95) vs holding (low $1/unit). L default (promised/observed=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2907.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23, pre-Christmas Monday week). Sports bra likely sees holiday gift/fitness demand spike, similar to P42 (11/25 Black Friday, demand=123), P45 (12/16, demand=211). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (all historical orders arrived with lead_time=0). Recent changepoint at P42: holiday regime avg=91 (P42-45:123,22,9,211, +260% vs P37-41 avg~26), std~91 (vs prior ~13), sustained 4 periods with calendar evidence (Black Friday/Christmas shopping). Use recent_N=4 (regime_length=4, max(min(4,20),3)=4) for mu_hat/sigma_hat: mu_hat=91, sigma_hat=91 (L=0). Base_stock \u224891 + 1.645\xd791 \u2248241, covers expected ~200-250 demand post-stockouts P42/P45, high q=19/20=0.95 prioritizes sales over low holding. L=default (promised=0, all observed=0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-P41: holiday high demand/volatility avg=91 (P42-45:123,22,9,211 +260% vs P37-41 ~26), std~91 sustained 4 periods; calendar Black Friday P42/Christmas P45 confirmed

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30), post-Christmas (P46=12/23 was Christmas week demand=185). Sports bra demand spiked during holidays (Black Friday P42=123, Christmas P45=211, P46=185), with erratic pattern (lows P43=22,P44=9). Carry-over confirms holiday regime post-P41: avg~91 (P42-45), now extended with P46 high. Expect post-holiday drop similar to post-BF (P43-44 lows), but NY fitness resolutions may sustain elevated demand/volatility for sports gear. On-hand=63 (from P46 end), in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments (all historical LT=0 confirmed). No changepoints needing explicit override. Use recent_N N=5 (P42-46 regime length=5, sustained high/vol per carry-over evidence: avg=110, std~92) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture holiday dynamics; L=default (promised/actual=0). This sets high mu_hat=110, sigma_hat~92, yielding base_stock~110+1.645*92~261 (q=19/20=0.95), order~198 to cover volatility/spike risk, prioritizing profit over low holding.
