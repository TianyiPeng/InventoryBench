Demand analysis: Fall regime downward shift to avg~62 (P34-37), holding ~50-60 through P38-40, but P41 spiked to 110 (11/18) pre-Thanksgiving; current 11/25 is week of Thanksgiving (11/28 Thu) + Black Friday (11/29), likely driving retail surge for casual 'Cat Tee' t-shirts (novelty basic jersey, suitable for holiday casual/gifting). Recent 5-period avg (P37-41:57/53/37/57/110)=62.8, but volatility high + holiday context warrants upward adjustment beyond fall baseline. Last 10-period avg~77.5. OR rec=96 uses full history (diluted by early low demand) with L=0, reasonable baseline but underweights recent holiday signal. Strategy: Override OR up to 120 = recent 10-period avg(78)+~50% safety buffer for holiday volatility/stockout risk (profit=holding=1, but stockouts lose full profit); covers expected 80-110+ demand.
