Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), first decision. Product: women's fine-knit cotton blend socks, winter season with steady demand. Historical samples (5 weeks prior to current date): 70,77,91,79,73; mean~78, std~8. No prior orders, on-hand=0, in-transit=0. No conclude messages, so no lead-time evidence; use promised L=0. No changepoints detected. Defaults use full historical mean/variance scaled by (1+L), balancing service (q=19/(19+1)=0.95) vs holding. Ensures initial base stock ~78 + z*8 covers demand with cap consideration.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18, Presidents' Day retail holiday - potential apparel demand uptick for socks). Historical demands avg 78 (std ~8), Period 1 demand=54 (-31% vs hist avg, post-Chinese New Year Feb 5?), but single period insufficient for regime shift (needs 3+ sustained). Lead time confirmed 0 periods (P1 order arrived same period). On-hand=38, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments. Pipeline covers ~0.5 periods demand; default params yield mu_hat~78, sigma~8, base_stock~78+1.645*8~91, expected order~91-38=53 (replenish proactively for holiday, high profit=19 favors service over holding=1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), late February winter period for women's socks; steady seasonal demand expected, no major events imminent (post-Valentine's). All observed lead times=0 (P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2), matching promised. Demands: hist [70,77,91,79,73] avg=78 std~8.4; game P1=54 (possible post-holiday dip), P2=72; all7 avg~73.7, no sustained changepoint (variability consistent, dip not repeated). On-hand=23 low vs ~70 demand, in-transit=0 no losses/overdues. Defaults use full history for mu_hat=(1+0)*73.7~74, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*8.4~8.4; high q=19/20=0.95 implies z~1.65, base_stock~74+14=88, order~88-23=65 (covers demand, minimizes stockout risk vs holding cost).

Daily Reward (R_t): $867.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4): Women's socks, early March post-winter, likely seasonal demand softening. Recent demands P1:54, P2:72, P3:48 (avg 58, std ~12.5), down from historical samples avg 78 (std ~8.1). Regime shift to lower mean and higher volatility confirmed over 3 periods. All orders arrived same-period (LT=0 consistently: P1,P2,P3). No in-transit, on-hand 45 sufficient for ~0.8 periods at recent avg but volatile. L default (promised 0 confirmed). mu_hat explicit 58 to reflect new lower regime mean over 1+L=1 period. sigma_hat explicit 12.5 for elevated recent volatility. This lowers base stock vs historical default (~78 +1.645*8=94) to ~58+1.645*12.5~78, balancing reduced mean but added buffer for variance, minimizing holding on excess while high service (q=19/20=0.95). OR will order ~78-45=33 (capped if needed), covering P4 demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: historical mean 78 to P1-P3 mean 58 (-25%), higher std from ~8 to ~12.5; sustained 3 periods

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11), early March for women's socks; no major calendar events, steady post-winter demand. Carry-over confirms demand regime shift to lower mean (~58 P1-P3) vs historical 78, now P1-P4 demands [54,72,48,38] mean=53 (-32%), std~14.3 (up from hist ~8), sustained 4 periods with downtrend (P4=38 lowest). All prior orders arrived LT=0 (promised), no in-transit/overdues; on-hand=41 covers ~1 period recent demand. Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect sustained low-demand/high-var regime, lowering base_stock forecast vs default (which uses all hist high mean); default L=0 matches observed. High q=19/20=0.95 favors service, but recent params prevent excess holding on dropping demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand downtrend strengthening: P1-P4 mean 53 (-32% vs hist), std~14 (+75%), P4=38 lowest; sustained 4 periods

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18), early spring; socks demand declining seasonally post-winter (hist Jan-Feb avg78, now P1-P5:54,72,48,38,37 avg49.8 std~14.3, -36% mean +75% std vs hist). Carry-over confirms sustained downtrend from P1. All LT=0 confirmed (5 observations). On-hand=40 covers ~1 recent demand period; no in-transit/overdues. Use recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set base_stock to lower recent regime (mu_hat~(1+0)*49.8=50, sigma_hat~sqrt(1)*14.3), balancing high profit service (q=19/20=0.95) vs low holding by avoiding hist-overestimate; L=default (promised/observed 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand downtrend persists and strengthens: P1-P5 mean 49.8 (-36% vs hist 78), std~14.3 (+75%), P5=37 new low; sustained 5 periods

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Late March, spring transition; women's socks demand downtrend persists post-winter (hist Jan-Feb mean~78, P1-P6 demands [54,72,48,38,37,31] mean=46.7 (-40%), std~15.4 vs hist~8). On-hand=43 covers ~1.4 recent demands; no in-transit, all prior orders arrived LT=0 (6 observes: P1-P6 all 0). Changepoint at P1 confirmed sustained 6 periods. L=default (promised 0, matches all). mu_hat=recent_6, sigma_hat=recent_6 to lower base_stock for reduced mean/volatility regime, balancing high profit($19) vs holding($1) by cutting overstock risk amid decline. OR backend caps order sensibly.

Carry-over insight: Demand downtrend strengthens: P1-P6 mean 46.7 (-40% vs hist 78), std~15.4 (+90%), P6=31 new low; sustained 6 periods

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1): Early spring for women's fine-knit socks; demand likely low/declining as weather warms, no major events boosting socks. Confirmed downtrend from carry-over: P1-P7 demands [54,72,48,38,37,31,38], mean=45.4 (-42% vs hist mean~78), std~14 (+75% vs hist~8); regime sustained 7 periods since P1 (chngpt evidence: consistent drop below hist, new lows P6=31). LT consistently 0 across all 7 periods (e.g., P7 order arrived P7). On-hand=34 covers ~1 period demand, in-transit=0, no overdues/losses. Use default L=0 (promised/observed). mu_hat recent_7: backend computes (1+0)*45.4=45.4, targets base_stock for lowered mean. sigma_hat recent_7: backend uses sqrt(1+0)*14=14, captures elevated vol. Balances high profit($19) service vs low holding($1) by focusing on recent low-demand regime, avoiding overstock.

Carry-over insight: Demand downtrend persists: P1-P7 mean 45.4 (-42% vs hist 78), std~14 (+75%), P7=38 consistent with regime; sustained 7 periods

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8, early spring): Post-winter socks demand remains in sustained downtrend regime (P1-P8 demands: 54,72,48,38,37,31,38,34; mean=44 (-43% vs hist ~78), std~13.6 (+70% vs hist ~8)). Lead time consistently 0 across all 8 periods (no in-transit, no losses). On-hand=35 sufficient for expected ~35-40 demand this period. No calendar events imminent. Use recent_N N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor low-demand regime (backend: mu_hat=1*44=44, sigma_hat=1*13.6); L=default (0) as confirmed reliable. Balances low overstock risk (high profit/holding ratio favors service) with reduced mean/volatility inputs.

Carry-over insight: Demand downtrend persists: P1-P8 mean 44 (-43% vs hist 78), std~13.6 (+70%), P8=34 consistent low; sustained 8 periods

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15): Early spring for women's socks; no major calendar events or seasonal spikes expected (post-winter, pre-summer). Demand downtrend persists (carry-over confirmed sustained 8+ periods): P1-P9 demands [54,72,48,38,37,31,38,34,31], mean=42.6 (-45% vs hist ~78), std~14.3 (+75% vs hist ~8); P9=31 consistent low. Lead time consistently 0 across P1-P9 concludes (no in-transit, no losses). On-hand=36 covers ~1 period; no overdue shipments. Use default L=0 (matches observed). recent_N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=9 since P1 shift, N=max(min(9,20),3)=9) to lower base_stock targeting recent low mean/vol, balancing high profit ($19) vs holding ($1) by reducing overstock risk.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), late spring; women's socks demand downtrend persists seasonally as weather warms, with P10 demand=20 (new low). Full regime P1-P10: 10 periods sustained, mean=40.3 (-48% vs historical 78), std~14.5 (+80% vs hist ~8). Lead time consistently 0 across all 10 prior orders, no in-transit or losses. On-hand=45 covers recent low demand. Use default L=0 (promised/observed). recent_10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures low-demand regime, lowers base_stock to ~40+ z*14.5 (q=19/20=0.95, z~1.64), targets ~58 inventory position, reduces holding costs vs historical default ~78+ while maintaining high service.

Carry-over insight: Demand downtrend persists and strengthens: P1-P10 mean 40.3 (-48% vs hist 78), std~14.5 (+80%), P10=20 new low; sustained 10 periods

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29): Late spring, approaching summer; socks demand seasonally low, no major events. Sustained downtrend (per carry-over) strengthens with P11=17 new record low (vs P10=20, prior lows ~31). Recent changepoint ~P10: demand drops sharply to sub-25 (P10-P11 avg=18.5, -40% vs P1-P9 ~42). Regime length=2, so N=max(min(2,20),3)=3; last 3 demands (P9-P11:31,20,17) mean~22.7, std~7.4. On-hand=48 high (covers >2yrs recent demand), in-transit=0, all 11 prior orders arrived LT=0 (no losses/overdues). L=default (confirmed 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_3 yields low base_stock~22.7+1.645*7.4~35 <48, triggers order~0 to cut holding costs ($1/unit) while LT=0 preserves flexibility vs stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand downtrend persists and strengthens: P1-P11 mean 38.2 (-51% vs hist 78), std~14.5 (+80%), P11=17 new record low; sustained 11 periods

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6): Early May spring season for women's socks; demand logically low as weather warms, aligning with persistent downtrend since P1 (no counter-signal). P1-P12 demands sum=439, mean=36.6 (-53% vs hist 78), std\u224814.5 (+80% vs hist ~8); P12=19 consistent low, regime sustained 12 periods (changepoint at P1 confirmed). All historical arrivals confirm actual L=0 (e.g., P12 ordered=0 arrived=0 same period); no in-transit or losses; on-hand=29 covers ~1.5 periods at recent mean. Use recent_N=12 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set low (1+0)*36.6\u224837 mu, sqrt(1)*14.5 sigma; L=default=0. This lowers base_stock\u224837 + 1.645*14.5\u224860 (q=19/20=0.95), order\u2248min(60-29, cap) low to avoid excess holding on 29 units amid low demand/volatility captured in recent data.

Carry-over insight: Demand downtrend persists and mean drops further: P1-P12 mean 36.6 (-53% vs hist 78), std~14.5 (+80%), P12=19 consistent low; sustained 12 periods

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13): Late spring, women's socks demand remains in persistent downtrend (carry-over confirmed 13 periods, P1-P13 mean ~35 vs hist 78, -55%). Recent changepoint at P10: P10-P13 demands [20,17,19,17] mean 18.25 (-57% vs P1-P9 mean 42.6), regime length 4 periods, std~1.5 (low vol). On-hand 46 covers ~2.5 recent periods; in-transit 0; all 13 observed LT=0 (no losses/delays). Mother's Day (5/12) passed with no demand spike (P13=17 low). Set L default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=4 to target low-demand low-vol regime: lowers base_stock (mu~18, sigma~1.5), reduces holding on excess 46 while maintaining high service (q=19/20=0.95).

Carry-over insight: Further demand drop at P10: P10-P13 mean 18.25 (-57% vs P1-P9 42.6), std~1.5 (low vol); sustained 4 periods

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20): Late spring/early summer; socks demand seasonally low in warmer weather. Demand downtrend persists: P10-P14 demands [20,17,19,17,21] mean=18.8 (-55% vs hist ~78, -56% vs P1-P9 ~43), std~1.8 (low vol vs hist ~8 or early ~14); regime sustained 5 periods since P10 changepoint (sharp drop from P9=31). All historical lead times=0 (no losses/overdues, in-transit=0). On-hand=25 covers 1+ recent demands. L=default (promised=0 confirmed). mu_hat=recent_5 captures low mean*1; sigma_hat=recent_5 reflects low vol; lowers base_stock to ~19 + safety, reduces overstock/holding vs default high mean/std, balances high profit vs low holding given low demand.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime persists P10-P14: mean 18.8 (-56% vs P1-P9 42.6), std~1.8 (low vol); sustained 5 periods

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, late May): Socks demand in low seasonal regime per carry-over (P10-P15 recent mean ~21, down 45%+ vs hist 78). P15 demand=33 spike (+76% vs P10-P14 mean 18.8) caused stockout (sold=25/33), but single outlier not sustained changepoint (needs 3+ periods). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (all historical orders arrived same-period, L=0 confirmed across 15 periods). No lost shipments. Use L=default (promised=0 matches all observed). mu_hat=recent_N N=6 (P10-P15 regime length=6, changepoint P10 drop confirmed; mean~21 covers low demand + recent spike buffer). sigma_hat=recent_N N=6 (vol up to ~5.5 from prior low ~1.8 due to P15, but regime-appropriate). Parameters ensure base_stock ~21 + 1.645*5.5 \u224830 (q=19/20=0.95 high service), low holding risk given $1 cost vs $19 profit, covers expected demand while adapting to downtrend/spike.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3, early summer - potential seasonal dip for socks). Persistent low demand regime from P10-P16 (7 periods, changepoint evidence: mean 20.3 vs prior P1-P9 ~44 (-54%), std~6 vs earlier low vol ~1.8 now higher vol from P15=33/P16=15 but sustained low mean). All historical lead times=0 (16 observations, no drifts/losses, in-transit=0). On-hand=17 covers expected ~20 demand but recent stockout P15 warrants buffer. Use recent_7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on current regime (mu~20.3, sigma~6); L default=0. OR backend targets q=19/20=0.95 (z~1.645), base_stock~20+10=30, order~13 to cover 1-period demand while minimizing holding on low-demand summer socks.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10): Early summer, seasonal low demand for women's socks expected and confirmed by sustained downtrend. Recent demands P10-P17 (20,17,19,17,21,33,15,12): mean 19.25 (-75% vs hist 78), std ~6.8 (elevated vol from P15=33 outlier but overall low mean). Regime length 8 periods since P10 changepoint (carry-over). On-hand 19 covers expected ~19 demand (no stockout risk), in-transit 0, no overdue/missing shipments (all historical LT=0 confirmed in concludes). L default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=8 weights low-demand regime, ensuring base_stock ~19 + 1.645*6.8 ~30 (q=19/20=0.95), low holding vs high service given profit imbalance.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime persists P10-P17: mean 19.25 (-75% vs hist 78), std~6.8 (mod vol post-P15 outlier); sustained 8 periods

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17), mid-summer; socks demand seasonally low, continuing persistent downtrend. Low demand regime P10-P18 (9 periods): demands [20,17,19,17,21,33,15,12,9], mean=18.1 (-77% vs hist 78), std\u22486.4 (similar to prior ~6.8). Recent P16-P18 mean=12 (-43% vs P10-P15 mean 21.2), indicating strengthening drop. On-hand=21 covers ~1-2 periods at recent levels; no in-transit, all past orders arrived same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed 18+ periods). L=default (promised 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=9 captures sustained low regime (regime_length=9, max(9,3)); base_stock\u224818 + 1.645*6.4\u224828.7, expected order\u22488 to buffer volatility/stockout risk (lost profit $19>>holding $1) while minimizing excess holding.

Carry-over insight: Further demand drop P16-P18: mean 12 (-43% vs P10-P15 21.2), std\u22482.9 (low vol); sustained 3 periods

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24, late June summer - low seasonal demand for women's socks expected, aligning with ongoing downtrend). Recent demand P16-P19: 15,12,9,4 (mean=10, std~4.7, -17% vs prior P16-P18 mean 12, consistent low vol low mean regime sustained 4 periods). All historical lead times=0 (no drifts/losses, in-transit=0). On-hand=26 covers ~2.5x recent mean demand; no overdue shipments. Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current low regime (changepoint ~P16, regime_length=4 >=3), default L=0. This lowers base_stock to match low mu/sigma, minimizing holding costs (q~0.95 but low levels prevent overstock), while covering (1+0) periods.

Carry-over insight: Further demand drop P16-P19: mean 10 (-17% vs P16-P18 12, -87% vs hist 78), std~4.7 (low vol); sustained 4 periods

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demands P16-P20: 15,12,9,4,7 (mean=9.4, std\u22484.3), confirming sustained low-demand regime (per carry-over). On-hand=19 covers ~2 periods at recent mean; no in-transit or overdue shipments (all historical orders arrived with L=0). No new lead-time issues. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect current low mean/vol regime, lowering base_stock to minimize holding costs (19/20=0.95 service) while covering 1+L=1 period demand. L=default (promised 0, consistently observed).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8, summer): low sock demand expected seasonally. On-hand=10, in-transit=0; all historical orders arrived same-period (LT=0 confirmed across 20+ periods, no losses/overdues). Recent demand P16-P21 (6 periods post-changepoint ~P16): 15,12,9,4,7,9; mean=9.33 (-88% vs hist 78), std~3.8 (+/- low vol vs hist ~8). Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target low regime (mu~(1+0)*9.33=9.33, sigma~3.8); base_stock~9.33+1.645*3.8~15.4, order~5 (min(15.4-10,cap)), covers demand w/ low holding (q=19/20=0.95 high service). L=default (promised=0 confirmed).

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime persists P16-P21: mean 9.33 (-88% vs hist 78), std~3.8 (low vol); sustained 6 periods

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22, mid-summer): women's socks in low-demand season, no major events; persistent low demand regime from P16-P23 (8 periods sustained per carry-over pattern): demands [15,12,9,4,7,9,11,7], mean=9.25 (-88% vs hist 78), std~3.4 (low vol vs hist~8), consistent with downtrend strengthening. Chngpt at P16-P19 confirmed sustained. All historical arrivals (P1-P23) confirm LT=0 (no losses/overdues), in-transit=0, on-hand=9 covers ~1 period demand. Use L default (promised 0); recent_N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to downweight high hist samples, set low mu_hat~(1+0)*9.25 & low sigma_hat~sqrt(1+0)*3.4 for OR base_stock matching regime (lowers orders/holding, high q=19/20=0.95 service).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29, late summer): Women's socks demand remains in sustained low regime from P16-P24 (9 periods), mean demand 8.67 (-89% vs historical ~78), low std ~3.8 confirming low volatility; no major calendar events, summer seasonality supports low sock demand. Lead time consistently 0 across all 24 concluded periods (no in-transit or losses). On-hand=11 covers ~1-2 recent demands (~7-9); no overdue shipments. Use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture ongoing low-demand/low-vol regime (changenoint ~P16 per carry-over, regime_length=9, N=max(min(9,20),3)=9), L=default (promised 0 confirmed). This lowers base_stock to match low mu_hat~(1+0)*8.67=8.67, sigma_hat~sqrt(1+0)*3.8=3.8, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding cost with minimal overstock.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5): Early August summer period for women's fine-knit socks; seasonal low demand expected (no major events). Low demand regime persists P16-P25 (10 periods): demands [15,12,9,4,7,9,11,7,4,5], mean=8.3 (-89% vs hist ~78), std~3.6 (low vol), confirmed sustained drop post-P15 outlier. On-hand=10 covers ~1-2 periods; in-transit=0, all past orders arrived LT=0 (no losses/overdues). Use recent_N N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low regime (changepoint ~P16, regime_length=10); L=default (promised=0 consistent across 25+ observations). Parameters target base_stock ~14 (mu=8.3 + 1.645*3.6~14, q=19/20=0.95 high service), balancing low holding vs high profit/missing sales risk.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

Persistent low demand regime P16-P27 (12 periods, mean~9.2 vs hist 78 (-88%), std~4.3 low vol); P27=18 spike (+100% vs recent mean) causes stockout but single period, not sustained shift. Use recent_12 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect low regime with emerging variability; L=default (stable LT=0 confirmed across 27 periods). Parameters lower base_stock vs default (all-data mean~78), minimizing holding costs on low demand while sigma covers spikes for high service (q=0.95).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=4 low vs P28 demand=13, in-transit=0, all historical LT=0 confirmed. No overdue shipments. Changepoint at P16 low regime (13 periods to P28), N=max(min(13,20),3)=13 for recent_N on mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect low mean/vol, reducing base_stock to match (~9 per period).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2): Early September, potential fall/back-to-school uptick for women's socks as summer lows transition. Persistent low demand regime (P16-P26 mean ~8.5) but clear changepoint at P27: P27-P29 demands 18/13/14 (mean 15, +76% vs prior regime), std~2.2 (low vol); sustained 3 periods with no stockouts since P27 order. On-hand=3 critically low, in-transit=0, all historical arrivals confirmed L=0 (no losses/drift). Recent uptick risks renewed stockouts (as P27 lost 3 sales). Set L=default (promised 0 confirmed). mu_hat=recent_N N=3 captures new higher mean~15 for (1+0) periods. sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 for low recent vol~2.2. Yields base_stock~15 + 1.645*2.2~19.6 (q=19/20=0.95), order~17 post pipeline, covers uptick while minimizing holding on low-demand product.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9): Early September, potential back-to-school seasonal uptick for women's socks (historical Jan highs ~70-90, summer lows ~8-9). Recent demands P27-P30: 18,13,14,34 (mean 19.75 +130% vs prior summer regime ~8.5, std~9.7 up from ~3-4 low vol), P30=34 caused stockout (end inv=0). Confirmed lead time=0 across all 30 periods, no in-transit/overdues. On-hand=0, no pipeline. Use L=default (0); mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_4 to capture emerging uptick regime (N=4=regime length, evidence: sustained 4 periods post-P26 low). Backend base_stock~19.75 + 1.645*9.7 ~35 (q=19/20=0.95), covers recent high while limiting hold cost vs prior overstocking in low regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16), early fall; socks demand uptick likely seasonal as weather cools/ back-to-school. No pipeline or on-hand (ending P31=0 after demand=39>ordered=36). Consistent L=0 all 31 periods, no losses. Recent demands P27-P31: 18,13,14,34,39; mean=23.6 (+177% vs prior P16-P26 ~8.5 low regime), std~10.8 (rising vol); sustained 5 periods, stockouts P27/30/31 confirm need higher base_stock. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture uptick (backend: mu_hat=1*23.6, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*10.8), L=default=0. High profit=19 vs hold=1 favors service; parameters boost order qty ~mu + z*sigma (z~0.95 from q=19/20), covering ~36+ while adapting to regime shift.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23), late September, fall transition; women's socks demand showing sustained uptick from summer lows (P16-P26 mean ~8.4), with P27-P32 demands 18,13,14,34,39,53 (mean 28.5, +240% vs prior low, std~16 high vol). Accelerating recently (P30-32:34,39,53 mean~42). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue (all historical LT=0 confirmed). Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture uptick regime (length=6>=3 sustained), L=default (promised/observed=0). This boosts base_stock to cover rising mean+vol, high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding, preventing stockouts like P32.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptick strengthens P27-P32: mean 28.5 (+240% vs P16-P26 ~8.4), std~16 (high vol); sustained 6 periods

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): Late September, seasonal fall uptick for women's socks accelerating into potential winter demand (historical Jan-Feb avg 78). P33 demand=93 (highest since P2=72, stockout of 37), following P30-33 surge (34,39,53,93). Confirmed uptick regime P27-P33: 7 periods, mean=37.7 (+350% vs P16-P26 low ~8.5), std~28.5 (high vol vs prior ~4). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline, consistent L=0 all 33 periods. Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture surge/vol, enabling high base_stock (q=19/20=0.95 high service). L=default (promised/observed 0). Addresses stockouts by boosting mu for (1+0)*37.7~38 demand forecast + safety.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptick accelerates P27-P33: mean 37.7 (+350% vs P16-P26 ~8.5), std~28.5 (high vol vs prior ~4), P33=93 peak since P2; sustained 7 periods

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7): Women's socks in early October, seasonal demand rise as fall begins (cooler weather favors socks). Demand uptick since P27 persists/accelerates: P34 demand=108 new peak (sold=85, stockout). Most recent changepoint at P30 (acceleration: P30-P34 mean=65.4 vs P27-P29~15, +335%; sustained 5 periods, high vol~30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue (all historical LT=0 confirmed). L=default (promised 0, matches all observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_5 (N=5=max(min(regime_length=5,20),3)) to capture accelerating high-demand regime for base_stock ~65 + 1.645*30 ~105, minimizing stockouts (high profit=19 vs holding=1) while capping excess.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration starting P30: P30-P34 mean 65.4 (+335% vs P27-P29 ~15), std~30 (high vol); sustained 5 periods

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14): Continued fall demand surge for women's socks as winter approaches; low on-hand=8, no in-transit, no overdue shipments (all historical lead times confirmed 0). Recent demands P30-P35: 34,39,53,93,108,113 (mean~73.3, high vol std~35), confirming sustained acceleration from P30 (carry-over evidence); prior summer lows ~8 irrelevant. Chgpoint at P30 validated over 6 periods. Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to feed OR recent high mean/vol (L=0 so mu_hat=mean last6 ~73); default L=0 reliable. Balances high profit (q~0.95) vs holding by targeting base_stock ~73 +1.645*35~130, avoiding stockouts while capping overstock; OR backend auto-adjusts.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration persists and peaks P30-P35: mean 73.3 (+12% vs P30-P34 65.4), std~35 (high vol), P35=113 new high since P2; sustained 6 periods

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21): Late October, approaching Halloween (10/31) and winter season start; women's socks demand surges in fall/cooler weather. Recent demand P30-P36 (34,39,53,93,108,113,126): mean ~95 (+30% vs prior P30-P35 ~73), std ~37 (high vol), confirming acceleration regime sustained 7 periods (chngpt P30). On-hand=6 low, no in-transit/overdues (all LT=0 confirmed). Use recent_7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target (1+0)*95 mean, sqrt(1+0)*37 std over review+lead; default L=0. Higher params boost base_stock ~95 + z*37 (z~0.95 for q=19/20), minimizing stockouts (recent freq ending=0 hurts profit) vs low holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration strengthens P30-P36: mean 95.1 (+30% vs P30-P35 73.3), std~37 (high vol), P36=126 new peak since start; sustained 7 periods

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Late October, approaching Halloween (10/31) and winter; socks demand likely sustained high due to seasonal cooling and apparel trends. Confirmed lead time=0 across all 37 periods (every order arrives same period, no in-transit or losses). On-hand=14 low vs recent demand=130 (P37). Demand acceleration persists/strengthens: P30-P37 (8 periods) mean~87 but skewed by early lower values; finer recent changepoint P33-P37 (5 periods: 93,108,113,126,130) mean=114 (+175% vs P16-P26 low regime ~8.5), std~15 (mod-high vol), sustained evidence. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to prioritize high recent mean/vol regime (backend: mu_hat=1*114=114, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*15~15; base_stock~114+1.645*15~130 targets service for ~130 demand while low holding). L=default (0). Addresses balance: high mu/sigma boosts order to cover expected 120+ demand minus 14 on-hand, minimizing stockouts (profit-driven) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sub-regime P33-P37: mean 114 (+50% vs P30-P32 mean~42), std~15 (mod-high vol), P37=130 new record high; sustained 5 periods

Recent high demand regime persists (P33-P38: demands 93,108,113,126,130,101; mean~112, std~14), confirmed by P38=101 (within 1 std of mean). All historical lead times=0 (no in-transit, no losses). On-hand=38 low vs ~112 expected demand, risks stockout. L=default (promised 0, all observed 0). mu_hat=recent_N N=6 (acceleration changepoint P33, regime_length=6 sustained periods matching carry-over sub-regime). sigma_hat=recent_N N=6 (high vol regime).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11), approaching US Thanksgiving (11/28) and Black Friday (11/29), holiday season potential demand lift for socks (gifting/winter wear). Demand uptick regime from P27 persists, accelerating P30-P37 (per carry-over), P38=101, P39=71 (moderation but still >> prior low ~8-10). Last 10 demands P30-P39 mean ~86.8 (backend computes), std ~35 high vol. Confirmed L=0 all 39 periods, no in-transit/lost. On-hand=65 < recent mean, stockout risk post-decision demand. Pipeline=65. Use recent_N N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime length 10 from P30 changepoint sustained per carry-over updates); L default=0. Backend base_stock ~87 + 1.645*35 ~145, order ~80 (post-65), high q=19/20=0.95 service vs low holding; cap prevents excess.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak moderation P37-P39: 130\u2192101\u219271 (mean 101, -22% from P37 peak), high vol persists, elevated vs prior regimes; sustained 3 periods

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2): Early December, pre-Christmas holiday season; women's socks likely elevated demand for gifts/winter wear. On-hand=6 low, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (all historical lead times=0 confirmed). Recent demand regime P33-P42 (10 periods, sustained high per carry-over extensions): mean=104.8 (+34% vs hist 78), high vol consistent with holiday acceleration/post-peak. No changepoint break\u2014P42=127 fits elevated vol. Use recent_10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained holiday surge (regime_length>=10>3 min). L=default (promised=0, all observed=0). Parameters inform OR backend of higher mu_hat~(1+0)*104.8=104.8, sigma_hat~sqrt(1+0)*std_recent~22-25, targeting high base_stock (z~1.64 for q=19/20=0.95) to cover demand spikes, minimize stockouts (profit>>holding), cap prevents excess.

Carry-over insight: Demand elevated holiday regime persists P33-P42: mean 104.8 (+34% vs hist 78), std~22 (high vol); sustained 10 periods

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), pre-Christmas (Dec 25 ~16 days away), women's socks relevant for winter/holiday gifting/shopping; expect sustained elevated demand with high volatility. Recent P33-P43 (11 periods) demand mean ~101 (+29% vs hist ~78), includes BF spike P42=127, drop P43=65 (still >hist), std ~24 (high vol per regime). Confirmed L=0 all 43 periods, no losses/overdues, in-transit=0. On-hand=72 covers ~0.7 recent mean; recent_N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat uses holiday regime (changepoint ~P33, length=11>3, N=11) to set mu_hat~101, sigma_hat~24, base_stock~101+1.645*24~142 (q=19/20=0.95), order~70 balancing high service vs holding amid volatility/calendar peaks ahead. L default=0. No new sustained patterns (P43 drop single period).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), pre-Christmas week (Dec 25 holiday); women's socks likely elevated demand for winter/gifting. Confirmed LT=0 all 44 periods, no losses. Recent demand P33-P44 (12 periods, holiday regime per carry-over): mean~99.8 (+28% vs hist 78), std~23 (high vol sustained). On-hand=54 low vs expected ~100; in-transit=0. Use recent_12 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect (1+0)=1 period elevated mean/vol, yielding base_stock~100+1.645*23~138, order~84 (after -54 pipeline), high service (q=19/20=0.95) for profit max vs holding.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23): Pre-Christmas week (Dec 23 Monday before Christmas Eve/Day), socks likely high demand as gifts/hosiery. Elevated holiday regime persists per carry-over (P33-P42 mean 104.8, std~22, +34% vs hist 78), now extending to P45 with P43-P45 demands 65/84/96 (mean~82, still +5% vs hist, vol high). Full recent holiday P33-P45 (13 periods): mean~99.5 (+27% vs hist), std~24 (high vol, peaks 127-130). On-hand=40 low vs expected ~100 demand, in-transit=0, no overdue (all LT=0 confirmed). Use recent_N=13 (regime_length=13 since P33 changepoint) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target base_stock ~100 + safety for high mean/vol; L=default (promised/actual=0 consistent). Balances high profit($19) service vs low holding($1), avoids stockout in holiday spike.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30), post-Christmas (P46 12/23 demand=72). Socks demand likely moderating after holiday peak. Recent P43-P46:65,84,96,72 (mean79.25, std~11.8), -24% vs P33-P42 holiday mean104.8. Broader P40-P46:87,92,127,65,84,96,72 (mean89, std~20 high vol). On-hand=62 covers expected ~80-90 but vol risk remains. LT consistently 0 (all 46 periods confirmed), no in-transit/overdues. Use default L=0. recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures moderating holiday regime (changelength~7 from P40 post-peak, N=max(min(7,20),3)=7) mean~89 std~20. Sets base_stock~89+1.645*20~123 (q=19/20=0.95), order~61 to reach ~123 inv_pos before demand, high service vs low holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-holiday drop P43-P46: mean 79.25 (-24% vs P33-P42 104.8), std~11.8 (mod-low vol vs prior ~22); sustained 4 periods
