{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 0 periods across all concluded periods (latest P46: arrived=40 units ordered on Period 46, lead_time=0), no lost shipments or drifts.

Demand analysis: Recent P42-P46 demands=69,76,7,36,18 (avg=41.2, high volatility std~29); holiday/winter recovery noted in carry-over (sustained up to P45 avg47) but tapering post-Christmas (P46=18, -50% vs P42-P45; P44=7 also low), aligns with post-holiday slump for apparel on 2019/12/30 despite winter season for leggings. Historical initial winter ~100, summer troughs <<20, current post-peak likely ~20-40. OR recommendation=0 uses full history (diluted by long low regime) and promised L=0, yielding base_stock <=109 (appropriate given low recent mu~40-50, q=0.5 fractile). Strategy: Follow OR=0 to minimize excess holding (profit=holding=1, so extra inventory nets negative if unsold); 109 covers >99th percentile demand (max historical 138 rare, recent max76); monitor P47 demand for sustained post-holiday drop confirmation.",
