{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 0 periods across all concluded periods (latest P46: ordered P46 arrived P46, lead_time=0), matching promised; no lost shipments or delays. Inventory analysis: On-hand=408, in-transit=0; ample to cover multiple periods of recent low demand (P43-P46 avg= (69+85+56+43)/4=63.25, downtrend from P42 holiday spike of 289). Demand analysis: Post-Black Friday/Christmas lull confirmed in carry-over (P43-P45 avg70, extended P43-P46 avg63, -73% vs P42); date 2019/12/30 post-Christmas likely continues low demand for jeans (no strong New Year's spike expected for this SKU, possible clearance but trend declining). OR recommendation: 0 units, aligned with high inventory and low historical mean used by OR (recent lows dominate). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - no order needed, avoids holding costs ($1/unit/period) on already excessive stock; covers (L+1)=1 period easily and beyond at ~60-100 demand outlook. No override as no regime shift or seasonality contradicting low outlook.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - 408 on-hand covers expected low post-Christmas demand (P43-P46 avg 63, continuing 4-period lull after holiday spike).",
