{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed as 0 periods consistently (e.g., P45 conclude: ordered=450 on P45, arrived=450 on P45). No lost shipments; all orders conclude same-period. Inventory position: On-hand=331, in-transit=0, so post-order starting inventory = 331 + order_qty (arrives before demand in P46). Demand analysis: P46=2019/12/23 is Christmas week (eve 12/24, day 12/25), prime holiday peak for women's socks (gifts, cold weather); carry-overs confirm sustained fall/winter surge (P37-P42 avg ~400+, P42=682 Thanksgiving peak), Dec volatility (P43=280 dip post-Txgvg, P44=299, P45=420 rebound +41% signaling pre-Christmas uptick). Recent avg P43-P45=333 volatile but elevated vs summer lows; expect 500-700 demand spike similar to prior peaks, far above early-year ~200s. OR rec=85 absurdly low: diluted by full-history incl. summer troughs (~20-60), ignores seasonality/OR limitations. Strategy: Override upward to target base-stock ~730 (331 OH + 400 order) = expected 550 mean + ~180 safety (high fractile q=19/20=0.95, recent sigma~150); covers L+1=1 period conservatively avoiding stockout (past peaks like P42=682 caused OH=0) while limiting excess hold (low holding=$1).",

  "carry_over_insight": "Pre-Christmas holiday demand rebound confirmed: P44-P45 avg 360 (299,420) vs P43=280 (+28%), with P45 +41% signaling surge into Christmas week (P46=12/23), sustained 2 periods but building on Dec volatility; expect 500+ peak.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed as 0 periods consistently, including latest P46 conclude (ordered P46, arrived P46). No lost shipments; all orders arrive same period. Inventory position: On-hand=351, in-transit=0; total available pre-demand will be 351 + order (arrives before demand in P47). Demand analysis: Recent holiday/winter demand volatile but elevated - P43=280 (post-TG dip), P44=299, P45=420 (pre-Christmas surge), P46=380 (Christmas week), avg 345 over last 4 periods (+/-~65 std dev est.). Calendar context (P47=2019/12/30): Post-Christmas into New Year's Eve; sock demand likely sustained elevated due to winter weather/gift returns/NYE sales, no evidence of sharp decline yet (P46=380 stable). Historical early-year (Feb 2019) was 200-250, but current winter surge regime dominates (per carry-overs P31+). OR rec=72: Underestimates due to historical mean diluted by summer lows (~150-60 troughs); ignores recent 300-400+ regime. Strategy: Target base-stock ~450 for P47 (mean~350 + 1.645*65~107 safety for q=19/20=0.95 fractile). With 351 on-hand, order 100 to reach ~451 total coverage, balancing stockout risk (19$ profit loss) vs low holding (1$/period). Avoids overordering given possible post-holiday taper but prioritizes service in volatile high-demand season.",
