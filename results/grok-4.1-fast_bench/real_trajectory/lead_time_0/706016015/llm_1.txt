No sustained new regime yet (only 2 low periods); forecast this period ~260-300 allowing for VDay uptick.\n(c) Lead time: Period 1, no prior orders/concludes. Promised LT=0; no evidence yet.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Exposed to full stockout risk this period.\n(e) Order logic: LT=0 implies order arrives pre-demand this period.

Forecast P38 ~250-300 based on avg P35-37 252 + volatility buffer. (c) Lead time: Confirmed 0 periods consistently (all orders arrive same period, e.g., P37 order=0 arrived P37); no in-transit or losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 196 (from P37 end), in-transit 0; covers ~65% of forecast demand, risk of partial stockout without order. (e) Order logic: Order 150 for total starting inv=346 vs forecast 280 (covers +23% safety for volatility); expect end inv~66 (low holding $66); balances profit from full sales ($4*280=$1120) vs holding; lead time 0 allows precise adjustment next period.",
