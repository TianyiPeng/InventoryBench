Spring (May 6, 2019) - denim sells year-round but post-winter peak decline typical as warmer weather favors lighter apparel; no major events (Mother's Day May12 post-period). Historical pre-game ramp-up late Jan (~0\u2192277), aligns with post-holiday casual wear. (b) Demand regime: Low sustained per carry-over (P9-P11 avg84 declining; P12=94 slight rebound but single period, no sustained shift - recent P9-P12 avg~86). Prior regimes: early Feb peak~250\u2192decline to~107\u2192very low~84. Forecast P13: ~85-95 (continuation of low spring regime). (c) Lead time: Confirmed 0 periods consistently (all concludes show 'lead_time was 0 periods', e.g., P12 order arrived P12). No in-transit/missing orders. (d) Inventory: On-hand=5 (P12 ending), in-transit=0. Pipeline empty; covers ~0.1 periods at recent demand. No overdue arrivals. (e) Order logic: Target cover 1 period demand (~90) post-on-hand (5), aiming ~0-10 ending inv to minimize holding ($1/period) vs profit ($4/unit). Order 85 balances low regime risk of stockout (recent partial in P8) vs overstock.",
