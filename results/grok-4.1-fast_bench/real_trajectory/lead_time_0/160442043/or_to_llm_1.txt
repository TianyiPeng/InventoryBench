Demand analysis: Recent P30-P33 demands=78,67,62,101 (avg=77, std~17); P33 spike to 101 caused stockout (sold=81/101), but prior downward shift (P27-P30 avg=71.5 per carry-over) suggests volatility rather than new sustained regime (only 1 high period, not 3+). Full history shows regimes (high ~105 mid-year, down to ~70 late summer), but late Sep (9/30/2019) for sneaker socks shows no major calendar drivers (post-back-to-school, pre-Halloween); steady fall sock demand expected ~70-80.
