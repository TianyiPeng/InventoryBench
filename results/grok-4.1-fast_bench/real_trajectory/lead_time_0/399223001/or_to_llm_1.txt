Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Actual lead time consistently 0 periods across all 46 concluded periods (every arrival matches order placed in the same period, e.g., P46: arrived=350 (ordered on Period 46, lead_time was 0)). No lost shipments. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=609, in-transit=0, so inventory position=609, sufficient for 3+ periods at recent avg demand ~250 (last 5 periods P42-P46: avg 253). Demand analysis: Product is ladies denim jeggings; date 2019/12/30 is post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week. Recent history shows holiday volatility (P42=447 Thanksgiving spike, P43=154 post-dip, P44=214, P45=258 pre-Christmas buildup, P46=193 Christmas week softening per carry-over P46 insight). Post-holiday demand likely stable/low ~150-250, not requiring orders given high stock; no major NYE surge expected for casual denim. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised L=0 and full history (empirical mean likely ~220-250, but high pipeline equivalent via on-hand exceeds base-stock). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - no override needed as inventory covers (L+1)=1 period plus ample safety; avoids excess holding while ensuring no stockout risk. Profit=19, holding=1, q=0.95 supports conservative stocking but current position optimal.",
