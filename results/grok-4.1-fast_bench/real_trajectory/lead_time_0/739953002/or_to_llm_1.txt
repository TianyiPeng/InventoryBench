Last 10 periods avg demand=87 (P33-42), but holiday seasonality + recency (P42 outlier) suggests upward regime shift not yet captured in carry-over. OR recommendation=91 uses full history (diluted by early low demands like P1-3 avg~17) and promised LT=0, yielding reasonable baseline ~mu + safety but underestimates holiday surge (ignores calendar events/product seasonality). Strategy: Override OR upwards to 150 units - targets ~70% above recent avg (87) to cover potential 150-250 demand range (P42 scale + safety for Christmas buildup), balancing profit=4 vs holding=1 (critical fractile~80%); avoids overstock as LT=0 allows quick adjustment next period.
