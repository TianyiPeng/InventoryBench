Post-Chinese New Year (Feb 5), early spring fashion transition. Historical demand (weekly, prior 5 periods ending 2019-02-04): 74,158,220,132,107; avg=138, recent trend declining to 107. (b) Demand regime stable at 100-220 (mean ~140), no sustained shifts (variance high but <3 periods evidence). Valentine's proximity may cause ~10-20% uplift (unconfirmed). Forecast: 140-170. (c) Promised LT=0; no concluded periods, cannot infer actual LT or losses yet. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; empty pipeline, covers 0 periods.
