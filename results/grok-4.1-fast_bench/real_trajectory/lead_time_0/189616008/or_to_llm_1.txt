Heavy winter leggings align with cold-season/holiday gifting demand; expect reversal of recent lows toward historical winter highs (60-100). OR rec 13: overly conservative, uses promised L=0 but recent low-demand history + high pipeline suppresses order (likely base_stock ~45-50 minus 74 <0, but small safety/cap).
