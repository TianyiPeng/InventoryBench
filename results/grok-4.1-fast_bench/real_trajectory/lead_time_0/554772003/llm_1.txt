Late fall (Nov 11, 2019) pre-Thanksgiving; short-sleeve item sees sustained low winter demand as seasonal shift to long-sleeve/outerwear; no major spikes expected until potential holiday gifting but unlikely for basics. (b) Demand regime: Fall low confirmed & sustained P36-P39 avg~7.5 (6,9,7,8; consistent with prior decline avg7.3 P36-P38, -48% vs earlier fall); no new regime shift (single periods not sustained). Historical winter higher (Jan-Feb 2019 avg~45) but current year post-summer decline holds low. Forecast P40: ~8 units.

(d) On-hand=2, in-transit=0; post-P39 (end inv=2 after demand=8); pipeline empty, covers 0 periods at current low demand.

Memorial Day P16 had spike (103), but summer context. (b) Demand regime analysis: Fall low regime sustained P36-P41 avg 7.2 (6,9,7,8,6,7); stable variance low (range 6-9); recent P39-P41 avg 7 (8,6,7) confirms no uptick signal despite holidays approaching.
