Inventory analysis: On-hand=110 covers ~1.7 periods at recent avg demand 65 (P37-P40:71,82,53,54), ample buffer post-P40 replenishment. Demand analysis: Recent 4-period avg=65 (down from P34-P36 avg92 per carry-over), volatile but sustained low post-fall peak decline into early winter; mid-Nov (11/18) pre-Thanksgiving (11/28) could see modest uptick for holiday jeans outfits, but no evidence yet (last two periods 53-54 low). Full history shows summer peaks 150-200s, but OR uses equal-weighted historical \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 for L=0 (1-period), yielding base_stock\u2248162 (110 on-hand +52 rec), prudent safety given volatility (q=19/20=0.95 fractile). OR limitations: Doesn't weight recent low regime heavily. Strategy: Follow OR's 52 as balanced replenishment - avoids overstocking (holding $1 low vs profit $19) while covering potential holiday bump/volatility; high on-hand mitigates stockout risk even if demand 80-100.
