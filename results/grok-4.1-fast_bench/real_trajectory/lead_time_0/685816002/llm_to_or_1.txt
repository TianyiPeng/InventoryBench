Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11), early February winter season for basic men's cotton jersey t-shirt (steady underwear demand, no immediate holidays/spikes like Valentine's minor impact). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no prior orders or concludes to infer actual lead time or losses. Historical demand stable (5 samples: mean~66, std~9.4, no changepoints). Use defaults: L=default (promised 0), mu_hat=default ((1+0)*mean all samples ~66), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+0)*std all ~9.4). This sets base stock ~\u03bc + z*\u03c3 with z=\u03a6\u22121(4/(4+1))=0.84, low inventory for quick-turn lead time, minimizing holding while covering demand (profit-driven high service).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18): Men's basic cotton jersey round-neck t-shirt (underwear category). Post-Valentine's Day (Feb 14), which may have driven Period 1 demand spike to 96 (vs historical mean 66.2 from 5 prior weeks: 76,64,73,53,65 ending 2019-02-04). Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1 order of 74 arrived same period). On-hand=0 after stockout (sold=74/96, lost 22 units ~$88 profit). In-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments. Updated demand stats over 6 periods: mean=71.17, sample std=14.58. No sustained changepoint (single high-demand period <3 periods). Use default L=0 (matches confirmed). Explicit mu_hat=71.2 and sigma_hat=14.6 to update backend's fixed historical stats, yielding base_stock \u224871.2 + 0.84*14.6 \u224884 (higher than prior ~74), improving service level for potential continued demand while q=4/(4+1)=0.8 caps overstock risk vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), basic men's cotton jersey t-shirt, late February (post-Valentine's, no major holidays imminent). Recent demands: P1=96, P2=102 (avg 99), vs historical samples avg ~66 (76,64,73,53,65), indicating upward changepoint at P1 (+~50%). Both periods fully stocked out (ending OH=0). Lead times confirmed 0 periods for P1 and P2 orders (no in-transit or losses). Pipeline=0, OH=0; high stockout risk. Set L=default (promised 0, matches observations). mu_hat=recent_N N=2 to capture new high-demand regime mean~99 over (1+0)=1 period. sigma_hat=default for full-history volatility (recent std low at 3, but conservative). Ensures base_stock targets service level q=4/(4+1)=0.8, ordering ~100+ buffer to boost sales vs holding.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, basic men's cotton t-shirt, no major calendar events. Historical Jan demands avg~66 (std~9), but recent Periods 1-3 demands 96,102,119 (avg 105.7, std~11.9), +60% shift, consistent stockouts (ending inv=0 each period), on-hand=0, in-transit=0. LT consistently 0 periods (all orders arrived same period). No overdue shipments. Changepoint: demand regime shift post-Jan. Use recent_N=3 (regime length=3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated mean/volatility; L default (confirmed 0). This raises base_stock to target recent demand, improving service level vs holding cost while backend caps overage.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1: avg increased from 66 to 106 (+60%) sustained over 3 periods

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11), early March, men's basic t-shirt; no major holidays. Historical demand mean ~66 (5 samples to 2019-02-04). Game demands: P1=96, P2=102, P3=119, P4=82 (avg 99.75, +51% vs hist). Carry-over notes shift to ~106 sustained P1-3; P4 drop to 82 (-23% vs P1-3 avg) possibly end of spike but single period. All lead times=0 (4 observations, consistent). On-hand=34 (low), in-transit=0, no overdue/lost. Use recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated recent regime (regime_length=4 since P1 changepoint); L default (promised=0 confirmed). Params target base_stock ~100 + 0.84*13 for high service (q=0.8), order ~100+ to cover demand post-34 on-hand, minimize stockout/holding.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18), early spring; men's basic cotton t-shirt, demand may stabilize post-Feb peak as weather warms but no major events imminent. History: demands P1:96, P2:102, P3:119 (high avg~106, confirming carry-over shift +60% from pre-period avg66), P4:82, P5:65 (recent drop avg73.5, -30% but only 2 periods, not sustained changepoint yet). All LT=0 confirmed (P1-5 arrives same period, no losses, in-transit=0). On-hand=48 sufficient for low recent demand but order needed for safety. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture full post-shift regime (mean~92.8, std~17.5); L=default (promised=0 matches all observed). High q=4/(4+1)=0.8 favors service; params ensure base_stock covers ~93\xb1z*17.5 over 1 period, balancing hold cost vs stockout.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Late March, early spring; basic men's t-shirt demand typically stable/seasonally increasing but recent data shows drop post-P3 peak. Demands: P1-3 high avg106, P4-6 low avg67.7 (82,65,56), regime shift down sustained 3 periods. On-hand=55 (building), in-transit=0; all prior orders arrived LT=0 as promised, no losses. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect lower demand regime, lowering base_stock vs default (all-data avg~87); L=default (confirmed 0). Reduces overstock risk/holding costs on 55 units while covering ~1 period demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg decreased from 106 (P1-3) to 67 (P4-6) (-37%) sustained over 3 periods

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1), early April, basic men's cotton t-shirt. Demand regime low since P4 changepoint (82,65,56,62 avg 66.25, std ~11), sustained 4 periods confirming carry-over insight of drop from P1-3 high (avg106). No evidence of reversal or new shift; P7=62 fits. All historical lead times=0 (7 observations), no losses or drifts, in-transit=0, on-hand=17 sufficient for ~1 period but order to cover (1+0) periods. Use recent_N=4 (regime length=4>=3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to track low demand mean/variance, default L=0. This sets base_stock ~66 + z*11 (q=4/5=0.8, z~0.84), balancing low holding vs stockout on ~66 exp demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early April approaching Easter (4/21). Demand history: P1-3 high avg~106, P4-7 lower avg~66, P8 spike to 128 causing stockout (lost ~52 sales). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; all prior orders arrived same-period (LT=0 confirmed consistently). No overdue shipments. Carry-over low regime P4-6 holds, P8 single spike not sustained (1 period <3). Use default L (promised 0 matches all observed). mu_hat recent_N=5 (P4-8:82,65,56,62,128 avg=78.6 \u2192 (1+0)*78.6 covers recent avg including spike). sigma_hat recent_N=5 (high recent volatility std~29 vs low initial).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15), mid-spring, approaching Easter (4/21/2019) which may boost apparel demand; t-shirt relevant for warmer weather. Recent demands: P7=62 (low), P8=128 (spike), P9=100 (high), signaling potential new high-demand regime shift at P8 after prior low regime P4-7 (avg 66). On-hand=4 low, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals\u2014all historical lead times confirmed 0 periods consistently. Reconciled: all orders arrived same-period as placed. Changelist evidence for demand: post-P7 shift to higher mean (~114 for P8-9 vs 66 prior), regime_length=2 -> N=max(min(2,20),3)=3 for recent_N. Parameters: L default (promised/observed=0); mu_hat recent_N=3 (P7-9 mean~96.7 for 1+L=1 period); sigma_hat recent_N=3 (high recent volatility ~33). Higher mu_hat/sigma_hat elevates base_stock (q=4/5=0.8, z~0.84) to prevent stockouts like P8 while capping overstock via backend policy, balancing profit vs holding.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter (4/21/2019), men's basic cotton t-shirt with potential spring demand uptick. Demand history: high P1-3 (~106 avg), low P4-7 (~66 avg), new high regime P8-10 (128,100,90 avg 106, +61% shift). On-hand=35, no in-transit, all historical orders arrived with LT=0 (no losses/overdues). Use default L=0 (confirmed). mu_hat recent_3 for new high-demand regime (backend:1*mean(P8-10)~106). sigma_hat recent_3 (backend:sqrt(1)*std(P8-10)~20) to capture recent volatility. Balances high service for ~106 demand vs holding, covering post-Easter potential with low pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: avg increased from 66 (P4-7) to 106 (P8-10) (+61%) sustained over 3 periods

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29): Late April, spring season for men's basic cotton t-shirts; recent post-Easter (Apr 21) demand spike in P11 (158). Demand history shows oscillating regimes: P1-3 high (~106 avg), P4-7 low (~66 avg), P8-11 high (128,100,90,158; avg 119, std ~21). Confirmed by carry-over insights up to P8-10 (~106); P11 sustains high regime (length=4 periods since P8 changepoint). All lead times consistently 0 (11 observations, no losses/missing shipments); on-hand=0, in-transit=0 aligns (P11 order arrived same period). No overdue shipments. Use L=default (promised 0). mu_hat=recent_N N=4 (regime length=4, (1+0)*119 covers recent high mean). sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 (higher recent volatility). Parameters boost base_stock to ~119 + 0.84*21 ~137, reducing stockouts (P11 sold 123/158) vs holding (profit 4x holding), while cap limits excess.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime high sustained P8-11: avg 119 (+12% from P8-10 106), confirmed over 4 periods

No major calendar events nearby; demand in sustained high regime since P8 (128,100,90,158,129 for P8-12, avg 121, +12-60% vs prior lows). All 12 observed lead times=0 (consistent with promised). On-hand=16 low, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments. Use default L=0. recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent high mean/volatility (mu~121, sigma~27), ensuring base_stock targets service for ~121 demand while capping overstock vs holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13, mid-May, men's basic cotton t-shirt; summer approaching but no major events like Mother's Day yesterday directly impacting). On-hand=54, in-transit=0; all historical orders arrived with lead_time=0 (no losses/d drifts). Demand regimes per carry-over: high sustained P8-11 avg119 (4 periods), extended by P12=129 (P8-12 avg121). P13=90 dip (-30% from P12), but single period not sustained changepoint. Recent regime P8+ length=6 (P8-13), avg demand=115.8 (128,100,90,158,129,90); high vol std~27. Use recent_N=6 (regime_length=6) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated mean/vol, ensuring base_stock ~116 + 0.84*27 ~130 covers high-demand risk (past stockouts P8/P11 lost 52/35 units @ $4 profit). L=default (confirmed 0). Addresses pipeline=0 by targeting higher base_stock vs all-history avg98.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20), early summer in Sweden (weekly periods from Feb), basic men's cotton jersey t-shirt/underwear; seasonal demand likely elevated with warming weather. On-hand=6 low, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments\u2014all 14 prior orders arrived with confirmed lead_time=0 periods consistently. Recent demands P8-14 (7 periods): 128,100,90,158,129,90,133 avg=118 (high regime vs P4-7 low avg=67), volatile but sustained high (+77%). Changepoint evidence: high regime from P8 extended to P14 (regime_length=7>3 threshold). L=default (promised 0 confirmed). mu_hat=recent_N N=7 (1+L=1 \xd7 recent mean~118 for higher base_stock to cover elevated demand/reduce stockouts like P8/P11). sigma_hat=recent_N N=7 (captures recent volatility ~std=24). q=4/5=0.8 implies z~0.84; params boost service level vs holding (low on-hand endings).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3), early summer; t-shirt demand seasonally rising into June. High demand regime sustained P8-16 (avg 128, +93% vs P4-7 low 67), with recent P12-16 avg 135 (129,90,133,148,175) and P16=175 peak confirming upward trend. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline or losses\u2014all prior orders arrived LT=0.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time consistently 0 across all 17 periods (all orders arrive same period). No in-transit or overdue shipments; on-hand=4 low vs expected demand ~130. Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current high mean/volatility regime (N=10=max(min(10 regime len,20),3)); default L=0. This sets base_stock ~131 + z*28 (z~0.64 for q=4/5), balancing high service for profit vs holding; OR cap ensures not overorder.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/6/17), mid-summer; men's basic cotton T-shirt (underwear category) expects sustained high demand in warm season. Demand history shows high regime since P8-P18 (11 periods): demands [128,100,90,158,129,90,133,148,175,158,117], avg ~129.6 (vs low P4-7 avg67), confirmed sustained over 11 periods (+93% from prior low). No changepoint at P18 (117 within recent vol). All 18 periods have actual lead_time=0 (no in-transit or losses), on-hand=40 low vs recent demand ~130 (risk stockout). Use default L=0. recent_N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high mean/vol regime (std~27), ignoring early low periods; backend base_stock ~130 + 0.84*27~153 targets service q=4/5=0.8, orders ~113 to cover demand post low inventory, balancing profit vs holding.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24), late June summer peak for men's cotton t-shirt (underwear basic), demand sustained high regime since P8 (April 1) over 12 periods (P8-19 avg 128, +93% from P4-7 low 67), confirmed by carry-over; recent P17-19 avg 130 still high vs lows. On-hand 40, in-transit 0, no overdue shipments (all historical lead times=0). Expect demand ~128; use recent_12 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high mean/variance regime (P8-19: mean 128, std ~24, higher volatility). L=default (promised 0, consistently observed). This boosts base_stock to cover summer demand (mu_hat=(1+0)*128=128, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*24~24), balancing q=0.8 service vs holding, preventing stockouts while capping excess.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
PERIOD 21 (2019/7/1), early July summer peak season for men's basic cotton t-shirts; expect continued high demand based on seasonal drivers and recent patterns (P16=175, P17=158, P20=179). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments\u2014all 20 prior orders arrived with LT=0. Demand high regime since changepoint P8 (per carry-over), length=13 periods (P8-P20 avg=132, vs prior low ~66), with high volatility including peaks >175 and dips ~90-117. No new sustained changepoint (P17-P20 avg=142 +8% but dips P18-P19 prevent significance). Set L= default (confirmed LT=0). mu_hat & sigma_hat= recent_N N=13 to target regime mean ~132 & std ~33 (higher than all-data mean~115 std~28), yielding base-stock ~132 + 0.84*33 \u2248160 (cap ~132+1.645*33\u2248166); covers expected 150-180 demand, boosts service vs recent stockouts (P11,15,16,20), balances lost profit ($4/u) vs holding ($1/u/period).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8, summer Monday). Men's basic cotton t-shirt; summer season supports sustained high demand regime since P8 (spring into summer), now 14 periods (P8-P21) with avg demand ~132 (rough: highs 175-90 mixed but consistently >100 post-P8 vs early lows). Confirmed by carry-over insights (high sustained P8-16 avg128 +93% from prior low67). Recent P18-P21:117/114/179/137 avg137. On-hand=21 low, in-transit=0, no pipeline; all historical arrivals same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed every period, no losses/delays). L=default (promised=0 matches all observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_14 (regime_length=14 since P8 changepoint, N=max(min(14,20),3)=14) to capture high mean/volatility (std high due to spikes like175/179), avoiding dilution from pre-P8 lows (avg~80). Ensures OR base_stock=\u03bc\u0302(1+0)+z(0.8)*\u03c3\u0302 high (~140 + buffer) to cover expected demand post-decision, minimizing stockouts (high profit q=4/5=0.8) while capping overage; low holding favors service.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15, mid-summer): Men's basic t-shirt demand in high regime sustained since P8 (2019/4/1, spring onset), avg 132 over P8-22 (15 periods, +95% vs P4-7 low avg67), with volatility (range 90-179). Recent P18-22 avg133 confirms. Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 22 observed (no drifts/losses). On-hand 39 low vs expected ~132 demand, no in-transit/overdues. Use default L=0. recent_N N=15 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on current high-volatile summer regime (backend computes mu_hat=1*132, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*~28), yielding base_stock ~132 + 0.84*28 ~158 (q=4/5=0.8), balancing stockouts vs holding; cap accommodates.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22, late July summer - favorable for men's basic t-shirts). Recent high demand regime sustained P8-23 (16 periods, avg ~130, +95% vs P4-7 low 67), despite single-period dip P23=102 (not sustained shift, as recent 3: P21-23 avg 119). On-hand=54 low vs expected ~130 demand; in-transit=0; all historical arrivals confirmed L=0 (no losses/delays). Use recent_N N=16 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high regime mean/volatility (backend: mu_hat=(1+0)*mean(P8-23)~130; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*std(P8-23)). L=default (promised 0 matches all observed). Parameters target base_stock ~130 + 0.84*sigma for q=4/5=0.8, balancing stockouts vs holding on low inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29), late July summer; men's basic t-shirt demand typically peaks mid-summer. High demand regime confirmed since P8 (2019-04-01) sustained P8-24 (17 periods) avg~127 (+92% vs P4-7 low 67), despite recent P22-24 (118,102,82) avg~101 as minor fluctuation not sustained drop (only 3 periods, P22 still aligns high). No new changepoint. Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 24 periods, no in-transit or losses; on-hand 72 covers ~1 period expected demand. Use recent_N N=17 (regime length min(17,20)) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on high regime mean/volatility (mu~(1+0)*127=127, sigma~sqrt(1)*~30 std recent), overriding early low samples. L default=0. Ensures base_stock ~127 + 0.84*30~153 targets q=4/5=0.8 service for profit vs holding, ordering ~81 (153-pipeline=153-72) to buffer spikes while minimizing excess.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5), early August, potential end-of-summer demand drop for men's basic t-shirts after sustained high summer demand. Confirmed new demand regime shift: P23-25 demands 102,82,56 (avg 80, -39% from P8-22 high avg 132), sustained over 3 periods. All 25 observed lead times exactly 0 periods, no losses/delays, in-transit=0, on-hand=96 covers expected low demand. L=default (promised 0). mu_hat=recent_3 and sigma_hat=recent_3 adapt to new low regime (mean~80, std~19), lowering base stock to cut holding costs (z~0.84 for q=0.8) vs prior high forecasts while ensuring service over 1 period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: avg decreased from 132 (P8-22) to 80 (P23-25) (-39%) sustained over 3 periods

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12, mid-August, late summer for men's cotton t-shirt). Demand in low regime since changepoint P23: P23-26 demands 102,82,56,82 (avg 80.5, sustained 4 periods, -39% from prior high P8-22 avg 132).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019/8/19), late summer; men's basic cotton t-shirt (underwear style), demand typically seasonal with summer peaks but recent shift down. Confirmed lead time=0 consistently across all 27 periods, no losses. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, stockout in P27 (demand=108 >97 available). Demand history shows regime shift at P23: P8-22 high avg~132, P23-27 low/mixed avg=86 (102,82,56,82,108), sustained 5 periods (-35%). Carry-over noted P23-25 avg80; recent data sustains lower regime despite P27 rebound. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target (1+0)*86 mean + safety for std~20; L=default (0). Ensures OR backend orders ~86 + z*20 (q=4/5=0.8, z~0.84) base_stock, preventing stockouts while minimizing hold in lower regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Uptick P26-28 avg~102 but not yet signaling new sustained shift (conservative). Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to base (1+0)*recent mean/vol on low regime (N=regime_length=6), ensuring base_stock ~91 + 0.84*std covers demand post-arrival while minimizing hold cost (q=4/5=0.8).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23), late September fall transition for men's basic cotton jersey round-neck t-shirt (undershirt). Demand in low regime since P23 (10 periods, P23-32 avg 87, -35% from prior high P8-22 avg132), recent P28-32:115/96/94/79/59 avg89 with decreasing trend (P31-32 avg69). No changepoint at P28 sustained (up only P28-30, now dropped). All 32 periods LT=0 confirmed, no in-transit/overdues. On-hand=50 covers expected ~80-90 demand partially. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent low mean/vol (std~10 vs all-time higher), L=default=0. Ensures base_stock ~89 + 0.84*10~97, order~47 (97-50) balancing high service (q=0.8) vs holding, avoiding stockouts in dropping regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): Men's basic cotton t-shirt (underwear category). End of September, post-summer, potential softening demand but recent volatility with stockout in P33 (demand=117 > sold=107). All historical lead times confirmed 0 periods (no drifts or losses; in-transit=0, on-hand=0). Recent demands P28-33 (post-P28 shift noted in carry-over): 115,96,94,79,59,117; avg~93, high variance (std~23). Regime length=6 periods. Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to forecast (1+0)=1 period demand/volatility, targeting base_stock ~93 + 0.84*23 \u2248114 to cover highs and reduce stockouts while minimizing hold cost (q=4/5=0.8). L=default (promised 0, matches all evidence). No overdue shipments.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7, early October, no major holidays or seasonal spikes for basic men's t-shirts; steady year-round demand expected). Lead time consistently 0 across all 34 concluded periods, no in-transit or losses; on-hand=12 low vs recent demand ~100 (P34), stockout risk high. Demand regime shift confirmed at P28 (carry-over), now P28-34 (7 periods): demands [115,96,94,79,59,117,100], avg=94.3 (still +9% vs P23-27 low 86, sustained >3 periods). Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (N=max(min(7,20),3)=7) to target current regime mean/variance over (1+0)=1 period. L=default (promised 0 matches actual). Parameters balance q=0.8 service (z~0.84) vs holding: base_stock ~94 + 0.84*std(~21)=117, covers recent demand + safety, reduces holding on low inventory.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14): Fall season for men's basic cotton jersey t-shirt (underwear category); demand typically steady post-summer peaks, no major holidays imminent (Halloween minor impact). LT consistently 0 across all 35 periods, no losses/overdues, in-transit=0. On-hand=20 low vs recent demand ~90-100, stockout risk high. Demand regime post-P28 shift (carry-over confirmed): P28-35 demands [115,96,94,79,59,117,100,92], avg=94 (sustained 8 periods, +9% vs prior low P23-27 avg86), volatile std~22. Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target current regime mean/variance over full history; L=default (promised 0, matches all observed). Params yield base_stock\u224894 + 0.84\xd722\u2248115, order\u2248115-20=95 (post-adjust), balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding with low inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21), fall season approaching Halloween but basic men's t-shirt underwear demand dropping with cooler weather. Confirmed new demand regime shift at P31: avg 80 (P31-36: 79,59,117,100,92,33) vs prior P28-30 avg 102 (-21%), sustained 6 periods. Lead time consistently 0 across all 36 periods, no losses or in-transit. On-hand 77 sufficient for recent low demand. Use recent_N=6 (regime length 6) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low mean/high vol regime; L default (0). Backend base_stock ~80 + 0.84*std_recent6(~30) ~110, orders ~33 to cover vs holding cost, cap ~100+.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: avg decreased from 102 (P28-30) to 80 (P31-36) (-21%) sustained over 6 periods

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28), late October approaching winter; basic men's t-shirt demand expected low/declining seasonally. Low demand regime sustained P31-37 (7 periods, avg 76, down from prior regimes), evidenced by demands [79,59,117,100,92,33,51]; recent P36-37 very low (33,51) but not yet 3+ sustained for new shift. On-hand 55, in-transit 0, no overdue/losses; lead time consistently 0 across all 37 periods. Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current low mean/vol (~76 \xb130); default L=0. This sets base_stock ~ mu + 0.84*sigma ~100 (q=4/5=0.8), ordering ~45 to cover (1+0) periods demand post-decision, balancing high service vs holding (profit>holding).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

Approaching US Thanksgiving (11/28) and Black Friday (11/29 ~Period 42), but product likely steady demand; recent Oct demands low (P36:33, P37:51, P38:68). Low regime since P31 (per carry-over, avg~80 over P31-36) continues P31-38 avg 74.9 over 8 periods (sum 599), with volatility (std~27.6). No in-transit, on-hand=33 low. All historical lead times=0 (38 confirms). L=default (promised 0). mu_hat=recent_8 (regime N=8 from P31 changepoint), sigma_hat=recent_8. Targets base_stock~98 (74.9 + 0.84*27.6), order~65 to cover volatile low demand over 1 period, ensuring high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs low holding.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11), men's basic cotton t-shirt underwear. Approaching US Thanksgiving (11/28) and Black Friday (11/29), but historical demand shows no clear pre-holiday spike for this steady category; recent demands low (P31-39: 79,59,117,100,92,33,51,68,63 avg 73.6, consistent with low regime from P31-36 avg80 sustained). On-hand 36, no in-transit, all prior orders arrived lead_time=0 (no losses/delays). Recent demand ~60-70 exceeds on-hand, risk stockout. Use L default (promised 0, confirmed consistently). mu_hat and sigma_hat recent_N=9 (regime_length=9 since P31 shift, min(9,20)=9>3) to lower base_stock for low mean/volatility vs all-history, balancing service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding; reduces overstock risk in low regime while covering ~74+sigma.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 41 (2019/11/18): Men's basic cotton jersey t-shirt (underwear style). Approaching Thanksgiving (11/28) and Black Friday (11/29), but no strong seasonal spike expected for this product; recent demands low. Low demand regime from P31-40 (10 periods, avg 71), continuing prior shift (P31-36 avg 80). On-hand 48 covers expected low demand (~50-70); no in-transit or overdue shipments; all historical lead times confirmed 0 periods. Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to sustained low regime (changelength=10>3), yielding mu_hat=71, lower base stock to minimize holding costs (on-hand sufficient for 1+ periods) while z~0.84 ensures ~80% service.

Period 43 (2019-12-02, Cyber Monday), men's basic cotton t-shirt. Consistent lead_time=0 across all 42 periods, no lost shipments, in-transit=0, on-hand=0. Demand history shows alternating high/low regimes (per carry-over), latest low ~58 (P37-41), but P42 exploded to 207 (Black Friday week). Cyber Monday + early Christmas season likely sustains high demand for apparel (previous highs: 207 P42, 179 P20, 175 P16). Overall historical mean ~102, but seasonality demands proactive boost. Set L default (promised 0, matches all observed). mu_hat explicit=170 ((1+0)*forecast, avg top highs ~173 adjusted conservatively). sigma_hat explicit=60 (elevated recent volatility ~50-65, covers spikes). Yields base_stock~170+0.84*60~210, cap~170+1.645*60~268; ensures high service (q=0.8) to capture profits from ~200 demand vs low holding risk.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), pre-Christmas (Dec 25 in ~2 weeks), men's basic t-shirt underwear. Post-Black Friday (P42: 2019/11/25 demand=207 stockout). P43 demand=64 low. On-hand=157 covers ~2-3 weeks at recent avg~80, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments (all historical L=0 confirmed). Carry-over shift at P37 to low regime (P37-40 avg=58), extended P37-43 (7 periods): demands=[51,68,63,48,55,207,64] avg=79 (+37% from prior P31-36 avg80? but fits low+volatility), sustained 7>=3 periods, changepoint evidence aligns with carry-over. Use recent_N=7 (regime_length=7) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current low mean + holiday vol (sd~57 from spike). L=default (promised=0, all observed=0). Backend base_stock~79+0.84*57~127 <157 on-hand \u2192 order~0 avoids overstock/holding costs while sigma buffers potential Dec spike; high service q=0.8 prioritizes sales vs h=1.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), mid-December approaching Christmas (Dec 25), expect retail holiday demand spike for t-shirt/underwear as seen in P42 (11/25 Thanksgiving/BF week: 207). Recent demands P42-44: 207,64,80 avg=117 (+105% from prior low regime P37-41 avg=57), changepoint at P42 sustained 3 periods, confirmed by calendar events. On-hand=77, in-transit=0, all historical LT=0 confirmed (no losses/overdues). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high mean/vol regime (mu~117, sigma~78), L=default (LT=0). Targets base_stock~117+0.84*78~182, order~105 to cover holiday demand, high service (q=0.8) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: avg increased from 57 (P37-41) to 117 (P42-44) (+105%) sustained over 3 periods

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23): Christmas week (Dec 23-29), anticipate demand spike for basic t-shirts due to holiday shopping/gifting, similar to Black Friday P42=207 and summer peaks (P16=175, P20=179). Recent demand regime shift at P42 confirmed high: P42-45 demands [207,64,80,104] avg=114 (+100% from P37-41 avg57), sustained 4 periods (fits carry-over). On-hand=79, in-transit=0, no overdue/lost shipments (all 45 historical LT=0 confirmed). L=default (promised/observed=0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 to capture recent high mean/volatility (mu~(1+0)*114=114, sigma~64); sets base_stock~114+0.84*64~168 (order~89 to hit ~168 pipeline), high service q=0.8 for holiday risk while limiting hold cost vs all-history lower mean.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30), post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week for basic men's cotton t-shirt; demand typically lower post-holidays. Recent demands P43-46: 64,80,104,58 (avg 76.5, std~20.6), post-Black Friday (P42:207 spike) normalization regime (length 5 periods). On-hand 110, in-transit 0; all historical lead times confirmed 0 (47 observations). No overdue shipments. Use default L (promised 0 matches actual). recent_4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures recent post-spike regime (N=4 as stable subset of regime_length=5, excluding outlier P42). mu_hat~(1+0)*76.5=76.5, sigma_hat~20.6; base_stock~76.5+0.84*20.6~93 <110 pipeline \u2192 order~0, avoids excess holding (high inv already covers expected ~77 demand) while balancing service (q=0.8).
