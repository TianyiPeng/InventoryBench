{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All historical arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (e.g., latest P46: no arrival as ordered=0 in P46; prior P44 ordered P44 arrived P44, etc.), matching promised; no lost shipments or delays. Inventory: On-hand=113, in-transit=0; ample to cover 10+ periods of recent demand levels (~6-10/unit). Demand analysis: Recent P44-46 demands=1,9,8 (avg=6, \u03c3\u22484, very low variance); P43-46 avg=6; continues extreme low-demand regime per carry-over (P43-45 avg=5.3, -62% vs prior), persisting post-Christmas (P46=12/23) into New Year's week (P47=12/30) despite winter jacket seasonality\u2014historical winter peaks absent this year. Product: Women's denim jacket (outdoor upper body), summer low confirmed earlier, anomalous winter low sustained 6+ months. OR recommendation: 90 units, but uses full history (early 2019 peaks ~50-270 skew mean high) ignoring recent 20-period decline to ~20 then ~5; uncapped base-stock likely >> recent \u03bc\u0302=6 (L=0). Strategy: Override to 0\u2014113 on-hand covers expected ~6 + safety >> base-stock ~12; lead time=0 allows quick reaction if spike; prioritizes avoiding $1/period holding on excess vs $19 profit risk (low stockout prob with low demand).",
