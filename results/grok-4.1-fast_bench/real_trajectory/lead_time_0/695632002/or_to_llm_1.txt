{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 0 periods across all 45 concluded periods (e.g., Period 45: arrived=200 units ordered on Period 45, lead_time=0), matching promised; no lost shipments or delays observed. Inventory position: On-hand=285, in-transit=0, so total available pre-order=285; order for Period 46 will arrive same period before demand. Demand analysis: Product is long-sleeve blouse, ideal for winter/Christmas gifting; date=2019/12/23 (Christmas Eve week) anticipates surge similar to Thanksgiving P42=862 (avg P41-P43=425 per carry-over). Recent P43-P45: 227/131/157 avg~172, post-peak stabilization but Christmas buildup likely drives 300-500+ demand (historical holiday +160-170% vs summer/fall baselines). OR recommends 0 (overly conservative, diluted by full-history mean including summer lows ~60; ignores seasonality). Strategy: Override to 350 units - covers expected ~350 demand peak (285+350=635 buffer vs safety for \u03c3~100 variance), aligns with prior holiday orders (P43=350), balances profit/holding (q=4/5=0.8 fractile favors stocking); builds ~300 ending inventory for potential P47 post-Christmas demand.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 0 periods across all 46 concluded periods (e.g., Period 46: arrived=350 (ordered on Period 46, lead_time was 0 periods)); no lost shipments, all orders arrive same period. Inventory: On-hand=552 (from Period 46 ending), in-transit=0; covers 4-5+ periods at recent avg demand ~120-150 or even lower post-holiday. Demand analysis: Holiday surge peaked P42=862 (Thanksgiving), then P43=227, P44=131, P45=157, P46=83 (sharp post-Christmas drop on 12/23); current Period 47 (12/30) is end-of-year/post-holiday slump for long-sleeve blouse, with carry-over confirming sustained holiday buildup into early Dec but now declining (P44-P46 avg 124, -45% vs P42 peak). Seasonal context: Late Dec post-Christmas typically sees low demand as returns/gift fatigue set in, despite winter weather favoring long-sleeves; no major events like New Year's driving apparel spikes. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised L=0 and full history (mean likely ~140-150, but high pipeline/on-hand triggers base-stock satisfied). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - no need to order with ample coverage (552 >> expected ~100-150 demand), avoids $1/period holding cost; monitor for Jan winter rebound but current stock buffers any uptick.",
