Feb11 2019: No major events (Valentine's Feb14 unrelated). Anticipate continued moderate demand ~150-200, extending trend. (b) Demand regime: Initial zeros (first 2 periods), then sharp sustained increase (61\u219298\u2192152, +61% then +55%). Recent regime: accelerating growth, avg last 3 periods ~104 but trending up.
