No in-transit or overdue shipments; pipeline clean at 0. Inventory: On-hand 67, sufficient for moderate demand (~70-80) but risks stockout if holiday surge hits 100+. Demand analysis: Recent P39-P41 demands 71/100/86 (avg 85.7, std ~14.5), down from P30-P38 high regime avg ~120, but volatile (P39 dip possibly transitional). Calendar context critical: Period 42 (2019/11/25) is Thanksgiving week (Thu Nov 28), immediately before Black Friday (Nov 29) - major holiday shopping surge for apparel like skinny denim jeans (gift buys, winter wardrobe). Historical early-year peaks (P1-5 avg ~140) and back-to-school highs suggest potential 100-150 demand spike. OR recommendation (55 units): Likely anchored to full-history mean (~95) with recent dip weighting, underestimates seasonal holiday lift (ignores calendar). Strategy: Override upwards to 80 units for base-stock target ~145-150 (on-hand 67 + order 80), providing safety stock z*\u03c3\u0302 \u22480.84*20=17 over expected \u03bc=110-120 (blending recent 86 + 30% holiday uplift). Ensures coverage for 1+L=1 period demand post-decision, minimizing stockout risk (q=4/5=0.8) while capping holding exposure.
