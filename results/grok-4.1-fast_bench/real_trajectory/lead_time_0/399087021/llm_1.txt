Potential mild demand uptick for women's fashion around Valentine's, but denim jeans not primary gift item (more dresses/lingerie); use historical winter demand as anchor.

(c) Lead time: Promised 0; no prior orders/concludes to infer actual LT or losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0, in-transit 0; fully exposed to stockout without order. (e) Order logic: Order 120 to cover expected demand (~110) + safety buffer (10%) for Valentine's uncertainty/high profit ($19 vs $1 hold).
