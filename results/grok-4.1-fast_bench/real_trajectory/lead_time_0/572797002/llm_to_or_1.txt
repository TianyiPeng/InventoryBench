Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), first decision for women's casual lace tank top (summer-ish garment, but Feb winter/Valentine's proximity may mildly boost). Historical demands: [92,68,85,95,64] mean~80.8, recent Feb04=64 (-20% vs Jan avg~85) but single point lacks sustained evidence of regime shift. No prior orders/concludes, on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Use defaults: L=0 (promised), mu_hat=(1+0)*mean_all~81, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*std_all~14. High profit/holding ratio implies q~0.95 service level; parameters ensure base stock covers ~1 period demand to avoid stockout at t=0 while minimizing hold cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18), post-Valentine's Day (Feb 14). Women's casual lace tank top may have seen demand spike in Period 1 (105 vs historical mean 80.8, +30%) due to holiday proximity; Period 2 likely normalizing but uncertain. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Lead time confirmed as 0 periods from Period 1 conclude. Previous order=104 covered 104/105 demand. Use L default (promised 0). mu_hat explicit=105 to match recent demand and ensure high service level (q=19/20=0.95) avoiding stockout given high profit/holding ratio; sigma_hat default for stable volatility (hist std~14). This boosts base_stock ~128 vs prior 104, covering potential continued elevation while capping overstock.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), post-Presidents' Day (2/18, demand=163). OH=0, IT=0, no overdue shipments. Confirmed LT=0 for both prior orders (P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2). Demands shifted higher: P1=105 (+30% vs hist mean~81), P2=163 (+102%), recent avg=134 (hist std~13). Possible spring seasonal uptick for tank top or holiday residual. No changepoint yet sustained (only 2 periods). Explicit mu_hat=170 (1+L)*forecast~170, anticipating continued elevation beyond recent avg given upward trend. Explicit sigma_hat=40 ~recent sample std. Ensures backend computes high base stock ~170+1.645*40\u2248226 vs prior ~100-130, covering demand to max profit*sold (19>>1 holding), reducing lost sales.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4): Early March, women's casual tank top (spring-appropriate). Demand spiked from historical samples (Jan-Feb early: avg~81, std~13) to Periods 1-3: 105/163/162 (avg 143, std~30), +77% shift confirmed over 3 periods\u2014likely seasonal warmup. All prior orders arrived same-period (LT=0 confirmed x3, no in-transit/losses). On-hand=74 covers partial demand; pipeline=74 total. Use L=default (promised/actual 0). mu_hat=recent_3 scales backend mean to recent high regime *(1+0). sigma_hat=recent_3 captures elevated volatility. Ensures base_stock ~143 + 1.645*30 ~200, order~126 after pipeline, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: avg 143 vs historical 81 (+77%), std ~30 vs ~13; sustained 3 periods with 105/163/162 demands.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11, early March, women's casual tank top vest - potential spring demand uptick as weather warms). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; all prior orders (P1-P4) arrived with confirmed LT=0 periods, no losses/overdues. Demand regime shift since P1 sustained 4 periods: demands 105/163/162/207 (mean=159.25 +96% vs hist ~81, std~41.8 vs hist~13). No major calendar events. L=default (actual LT consistently 0). mu_hat=recent_4 (1+L x recent mean for high-demand regime). sigma_hat=recent_4 (elevated volatility). Ensures base_stock targets ~159 + 1.645*42 ~247 (high service q=19/20=0.95 captures profit on high demand, limits excess hold with cap).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime extended to 4 periods: avg 159 (+96% vs hist 81), std 42 vs 13; sustained high demands 105/163/162/207.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): Early spring; women's lace tank top likely seeing seasonal demand lift as weather warms. Demand regime shift sustained 5 periods (P1-P5: 105/163/162/207/105, avg 148.4 vs hist 81 (+83%), std 33 vs 13); no new changepoint as P5 drop to 105 remains above hist max(95) and volatile high pattern holds. Lead times consistently 0 (5 observations: all arrived same period). On-hand 124, in-transit 0 (no pipeline); covers ~1 recent period but vulnerable to high demand spikes (up to 207). L=default (promised 0, matches all data). mu_hat=recent_5 (regime N=5, (1+0)*148.4); sigma_hat=recent_5 (sqrt(1+0)*33). Ensures base_stock ~148 + 1.645*33 ~214 (q=19/20=0.95), ordering ~90 to buffer (L+1)=1 period high demand/vol while minimizing hold cost on excess.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25, late March), women's lace tank top (spring/summer casual wear), demand likely rising with warmer weather. On-hand=31 low vs recent demands ~155 avg, in-transit=0, no missing shipments. All 6 prior periods show actual lead_time=0 (consistent with promised). Sustained high demand regime P1-6: [105,163,162,207,105,190], mean=155 (+92% vs hist 81), std~39 (vs hist~13); P5 dip to 105 but overall shift confirmed, no new changepoint. Backend anchored to old low hist data, so explicit overrides needed. L=default (0, confirmed). mu_hat=explicit 160=(1+0)*160 (recent mean + buffer for volatility/uptrend). sigma_hat=explicit 40~recent std. Yields base_stock~160+1.645*40~226 (q=19/20=0.95), order~195 after pipeline=31, balancing high service vs holding; cap similar. Addresses regime by inflating over hist.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1): Spring season for women's tank top (upper body casual jersey vest), demand sustained high since Period 1 (regime shift confirmed in carry-over, now extended with P6:190, P7:210). Recent 7 demands: 105/163/162/207/105/190/210, mean~163 (+102% vs hist~81), std~44 (vs hist~13). On-hand=16 low, in-transit=0, no pipeline; all prior 7 orders arrived with actual L=0 (consistent). No overdue/lost shipments. Use default L=0 (promised/observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 to capture sustained high mean/volatility regime (N=7=max(min(7,20),3)), backend computes mu_hat=(1+0)*163=163, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*44=44. Sets high base_stock~163 + z*44 (z~0.98 for q=19/20), targets service for elevated demand, minimizes stockouts (recent frequent), controls holding via capped policy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime extended to 7 periods: avg 163 (+102% vs hist 81), std 44 vs 13; sustained high demands 105/163/162/207/105/190/210.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=16 low, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments\u2014all prior 8 orders arrived with confirmed lead_time=0. Demand regime high and sustained: P1-P8 demands [105,163,162,207,105,190,210,220] avg=170 (+110% vs hist ~81), std~45 (vs hist~13). No changepoint break\u2014continue recent regime. L=default (matches consistent actual=0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_8 to capture elevated mean/volatility over full regime (N=8=max(min(8,20),3)).

Recent P9 demand=188 fits regime, no new changepoint. Lead time consistently 0 across all 9 concluded periods (no in-transit, all arrived same-period). On-hand=57 low vs expected ~170-200 demand, pipeline=0. Use default L=0 (promised/observed). recent_N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/variance regime, ensuring base_stock targets high service (q=19/20=0.95) while scaling for LT=0; OR will order ~base_stock -57 to cover current demand + safety.

Period 11 (2019/4/22): Late spring; women's lace tank top likely seeing seasonal demand peak. Sustained high demand regime since P1 (10 periods): demands [105,163,162,207,105,190,210,220,188,208], avg 176 (+117% vs hist 81), std 42 vs hist 13. On-hand 35 low, in-transit 0; no overdue shipments. Lead times consistently 0 across 10 periods. Use recent_10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture elevated mean/vol; L default (promised 0 confirmed). Ensures base_stock ~176 + 1.645*42 \u2248245 to cover high demand + safety, minimizing stockouts vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime extended to 10 periods: avg 176 (+117% vs hist 81), std 42 vs 13; sustained high demands 105/163/162/207/105/190/210/220/188/208.

On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments\u2014all prior 11 orders arrived same-period (L=0 confirmed). Demand history P1-11: sustained high regime (avg~190 vs hist~81), with P11=337 spike (stockout: sold=245/337). Regime extended but spike not sustained (1 period). Use recent_N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture full high-demand regime (ignores initial low samples), L=default (promised 0, matches all observed).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6, early May, spring/summer season for women's tank top; Mother's Day May 12 nearby). Sustained high demand regime since Period 1 (12 periods, avg 191, std ~60 vs historical winter avg 81 std 13). P11 spike 337 likely Easter (Apr 21) one-off, but overall high. All 12 observed lead times =0 (no in-transit, no losses/ overdues). On-hand 97 low vs recent demands ~190-200 (P12=197). Use L default (promised 0 matches all data). mu_hat recent_12 scales (1+0)*191=191 for base stock. sigma_hat recent_12 ~60 for safety stock ~1.645*60=99, total base ~290; order =290-97=193 (capped similarly), covers expected demand, minimizes holding on 97 + order excess while high service (q=19/20=0.95).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime extended to 12 periods: avg 191 (+136% vs hist 81), std 60 vs 13; sustained high demands with P11 Easter spike 337 confirmed as volatility increase.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13): Mid-May, post-Easter (Apr 21) and Mother's Day (May 12); tank top (summer garment) demand likely rebounding after P13 dip to 67 (possible post-holiday anomaly). Sustained high demand regime P1-P12: avg 191 (+136% vs hist 81), std 60; P13=67 single low not sustained changepoint (needs 3+ periods). LT consistently 0 across 13 periods, no in-transit/overdues. On-hand 223 covers expected ~190 demand. Use recent_12 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on confirmed high regime (backend: mu_hat=1*191, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*60), yielding base_stock ~ mu + z*sigma with z~ profit/(p+h)=19/20=0.95 (high service). L default=0 ensures OR uses promised LT matching reality. Balances stockout risk vs holding on ample OH.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20): Women's casual tank top. Recent demands P13=67 (5/6), P14=61 (5/13) show sharp drop (-68% from P1-P12 avg 191), post-Easter (P11=337 spike on 4/22 near Easter 4/21) and post-Mother's Day (5/12). Potential new low-demand regime (aligns historical prior avg~81), length=2 periods. On-hand=235 high vs recent ~64 avg (covers 3+ periods), in-transit=0, no overdue orders. All lead times confirmed 0 periods (14 observations). Use recent_N N=3 (P12-P14: demands 197/67/61, mean~108, std~77) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to adapt to drop, lowering base_stock~(108 + 1.645*77)~235 vs longer-history ~190+1.6*60~296, avoiding excess orders/holding ($1/unit) while maintaining high service q=19/20=0.95.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, Memorial Day), women's summer tank top; expect demand rebound/spike into summer season post-Easter (P11:337), similar to prior highs. Recent P13-15:67/61/162 (avg~97, post-Easter dip not sustained as P15 up); full recent regime P1-P15 avg~176 aligns with carry-over sustained high demand (avg191 over P1-12). On-hand=73 low vs expected ~180+ demand, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (all L=0 confirmed). Use recent_N N=12 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture 12-period high regime (avg~179, std~85, +136% mean/+360% std vs hist), scaled by (1+0)=1; default L=0 as consistently observed. Ensures base_stock covers Memorial Day demand/volatility, balancing q=19/20=0.95 service vs holding.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3): Early summer, women's tank top demand expected sustained high due to seasonal warmth. Confirmed high demand regime (carry-over avg 191 over 12 periods, updated last 12 demands P5-P16 avg ~197). Recent: P13-14 lows (67/61, possible post-Mother's Day May12) not sustained (2 periods <3+ threshold), P15-16 rebound 162/209. LT consistently 0 across 16 periods, no losses/in-transit. On-hand 94 low vs ~200 demand. L=default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat=recent_12 (regime length, mean~197 for high service). sigma_hat=recent_12 (vol~60 captures Easter 337/P11, recent variance). Ensures higher base_stock ~197 +1.645*60\u2248295 to cover demand, order ~295-94=201 post-pipeline, balancing high profit/low holding.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10): Early summer, ideal for women's tank top (seasonal casual wear); expect sustained high demand ~180-200 based on carry-over regime (avg 191 over 12 periods) and recent P15-17: 162/209/180 (avg 184, post P13-14 dip anomaly possibly weather/off-season blip). P11 Easter volatility (337) confirmed higher std. Lead time consistently 0 across all 17 periods, no losses/in-transit. On-hand 124 vs expected ~190 demand risks stockout, but L=0 order arrives pre-demand. Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat (post-dip regime length=3, mean~184 x1=184) to target high summer mean; recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat (std~60 capturing volatility incl. dip/Easter); default L=0. Balances high service (q~19/20=0.95) vs holding by focusing backend on recent high regime, avoiding overstock from full-history low mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-P14 dip: P15-17 avg 184 (+127% vs hist 81), std 24; sustained high resuming summer pattern.

Recent post-dip regime P15-18 demands 162/209/180/157 (avg 177.75 +119% vs hist 81, std 20 vs hist 13), changepoint after P14 low dip, regime length 4 periods confirmed sustained high summer pattern (carry-over P18 note). On-hand 139 no pipeline; expect ~178 demand, risk stockout. L default (promised/observed 0). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=4 captures current stable high mean/low vol regime. Backend base_stock ~178 + 1.645*20 \u2248211 (q=19/20=0.95), order ~72 to cover demand post-139 on-hand, minimizing stockout (high profit) vs holding.

On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no pipeline; P19 demand=230 exceeded starting inventory, stockout risk. Lead times consistently 0 across all 19 periods (e.g., P19 order arrived P19). Sustained high demand regime (carry-over confirmed avg ~190, P15-19: 162/209/180/157/230 avg=188, std~31, +132% vs hist 81). No new changepoints or LT drifts. Set L=default (promised 0, matches all observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 to focus on recent summer high/volatility regime (backend: mu_hat=(1+0)*188=188, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*31~31), targets base_stock ~188 + 1.645*31 ~243 to balance q=19/20=0.95 service vs holding, avoiding overstock given cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime extended summer high P15-19: avg 188 (+132% vs hist 81), std 31 vs 13; sustained 5 periods post-dip.

Lead time consistently 0 across all 20 periods. Sustained summer high demand regime P15-20: demands [162,209,180,157,230,366], avg=217 (+168% vs hist ~81), std~80 (vs hist~13). Changepoint post-P14 dip (regime_length=6).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime extended summer high P15-20: avg 217 (+168% vs hist 81), std 80 vs 13; sustained 6 periods post-dip with P20 spike 366 confirming volatility increase.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8): Early July summer peak for women's tank top; sustained high demand regime P15-21 (162/209/180/157/230/366/174) avg~211 (+161% vs hist~81), std~80 confirming volatility from spikes (P20:366).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15), mid-summer; tank top demand sustained high in summer regime post-P14 dip (P13-14:67/61 low). Recent P15-22 demands:162/209/180/157/230/366/174/121, avg~200 (+147% vs hist 81), std~74 (regime length 8, N=max(min(8,20),3)=8). All 22 observed lead times=0 (consistent with promised). On-hand=211 covers ~1-2 periods demand; in-transit=0, no losses/overdues.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime extended summer high P15-22: avg 200 (+147% vs hist 81), std 74 vs 13; sustained 8 periods post-dip with volatility from spikes (366).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22), late summer for women's tank top (peak seasonal demand). Sustained high demand regime P15-23 (9 periods): demands [162,209,180,157,230,366,174,121,132], avg=192 (+137% vs hist 81), std~74 confirms high vol from spikes (366). Recent P22-23 dip (121/132) within vol, not new regime shift. On-hand=191 covers ~1 period expected demand; no in-transit/overdues, LT=0 all 23 periods. Use recent_9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture summer high mean/vol ((1+0)*192 mu, sqrt(1)*74 sigma), L=default=0. Balances high service for profit vs low holding by targeting base_stock ~ mu + z*sigma with q=19/20=0.95.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29): Late summer, ideal for women's tank top (cotton jersey casual vest). Sustained high demand regime since P15 post-dip (P13-14 lows 67/61), recent P15-24 demands avg 198.5 (10 periods: 162/209/180/157/230/366/174/121/132/254), std ~74 confirming volatility from spikes (366,254). On-hand 60 low vs ~200 avg demand, in-transit 0, no overdue (all historical lead times 0). L=default (promised/actual 0 confirmed across 24 periods). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=10 captures current summer high mean/volatility regime (N=10 as regime_length~10, min(10,20)). Ensures base_stock ~198 + z*74 (z~0.95 for q=19/20) covers demand post-decision, minimizing stockouts (high profit) while capping overage (low holding), no explicit needed.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5): Peak summer for women's tank top (essential lace vest top), demand expected high/volatile per seasonal calendar and product category. Confirmed L=0 all 25 periods, no in-transit/overdues. High demand regime sustained P15-25 (11 periods): demands [162,209,180,157,230,366,174,121,132,254,99], avg~190 (+135% vs hist 81), std~75 (vs hist 13). On-hand 218 covers ~1 period avg demand; parameters use recent_11 to set mu_hat~(1+0)*190=190, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+0)*75~75, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding amid volatility/spikes (e.g., P20:366,P24:254).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12): Mid-August summer peak for women's casual tank top (jersey vest with lace); expect sustained high demand regime per carry-over (P15+ summer highs avg~200 initially, now P15-26 avg~180 vs hist 81), but recent P23-26 volatile (132/254/99/79, avg~141) with P25-26 dip possibly signaling late-summer taper\u2014yet only 2 low periods, not sustained shift. Lead time confirmed 0 across all 26 periods (every order arrives same period, no in-transit/losses). On-hand 234 covers ~1-2 periods at recent avg, but high volatility (spikes like P24:254, prior 366) warrants base-stock buffer. Use default L=0 (confirmed). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=12 (P15-26 regime length>12, N=min(20,12+)=12) for summer-specific mean/vol vs all-data default; backend base-stock \u03bc\u0302+z\u03c3\u0302 targets q=19/(19+1)=0.95 service, with cap ensuring no overorder.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019/8/19), late summer for women's tank top (peak summer wear). Lead time consistently 0 across all 27 periods, no in-transit or losses. On-hand 256 covers recent low demands (P27:53). Sustained summer high demand regime (~200 avg P15-22 per carry-over), but new late-summer dip P25-27: avg 77 (99/79/53, -61% vs 200), after P24 spike 254; volatility persists from prior spikes (366,337). Use recent_N=12 (P16-27 regime length post-resume, avg~171, captures high/volatility with dip trend) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to forecast ~171 mean/ elevated std over 1+L=1 period. High q=19/20=0.95 drives high base_stock for spikes, balancing stockouts vs low holding; ample on-hand buffers current low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift late-summer dip P25-27: avg 77 (-61% vs summer high 200), std ~20 vs prior 74; sustained 3 periods low demands 99/79/53 post-P24 spike.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/8/26): Late summer (end Aug), women's tank top demand in sustained low regime post-summer highs, as back-to-school/fall transition reduces warm-weather apparel needs. Recent P25-28 demands: 99/79/53/59 (avg 72.75, -64% vs prior summer avg ~200), std ~18 (low vol). Confirmed changepoint at P25 dip, sustained 4 periods. All historical lead times=0 (28 observations), no in-transit/overdues. On-hand=254 covers ~3.5 recent demand periods (low risk stockout). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to downweight summer highs, set low base stock \u03bc\u0302=(1+0)*72.75\u224873, \u03c3\u0302=\u221a1*18\u224818, balancing high profit ($19) service vs low holding ($1) with excess inventory. L=default (promised 0 matches all data).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime late-summer low extended P25-28: avg 73 (-64% vs summer high 200), std 18 vs prior 74; sustained 4 periods low demands 99/79/53/59.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2, early Sep post-Labor Day). Tank top demand in sustained late-summer low regime P25-29: demands 99/79/53/59/83, avg 75 (+/-7% vs hist early-year 81), std ~19 (low vol); -63% vs prior summer high avg 200. On-hand 171 covers ~2+ periods low demand (171/75>2), in-transit 0, no pipeline. Lead time consistently 0 across all 29 periods observed. Use default L=0 (promised/observed). recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current low-demand regime, lowering base stock/target to reduce holding costs on excess inv (171 high for low demand) while covering (L+1)=1 period + safety. OR backend will compute low mu_hat~(1+0)*75=75, low sigma_hat~sqrt(1)*19=19, yielding conservative order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime late-summer low extended P25-29: avg 75 (-63% vs summer high 200), std 19 vs prior 74; sustained 5 periods low demands 99/79/53/59/83.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9, early September): Women's summer tank top demand in sustained late-summer/early fall low regime P25-30 (demands 99/79/53/59/83/75, avg 75, std ~17 vs prior summer high 200/std74). On-hand 96 covers ~1.3 periods of recent demand; no in-transit or overdue shipments. Lead time consistently 0 across all 30 periods (every order arrived same period). No calendar events imminent; expect continued low demand into fall. Use recent_N=6 (regime length=6, sustained 6+ periods low) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low mean/volatility, L=default (promised 0 confirmed). This sets low base_stock to minimize holding on declining seasonal demand while covering (1+0) periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16), mid-September, women's summer tank top; demand in sustained late-summer low regime P25-31 (7 periods): demands 99/79/53/59/83/75/74, avg~75 (-63% vs prior summer high ~200), std~15 (low vol). On-hand=29 (low vs ~75 demand), in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (all historical lead times=0 confirmed). L=default (promised=0, all observed=0). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=7 to anchor low mean/vol for (1+0)=1 period ahead, balancing high profit/holding q~0.95 service with minimal overstock in declining seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime late-summer low extended P25-31: avg 75 (-63% vs summer high 200), std 18 vs prior 74; sustained 7 periods low demands 99/79/53/59/83/75/74.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): End-September, fall transition for summer women's casual tank top (lace trim jersey vest); demand in sustained late-summer low regime P25-P33 (dates 2019/7/29 to 9/23): demands 99/79/53/59/83/75/74/70/99, avg=76.8 (-62% vs prior summer high ~200), std\u224819.2 (low vol vs prior 74); on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue/missing shipments (all historical lead times=0 confirmed in concludes). No pipeline covers current demand, so parameters target low mu_hat=76.8 for (1+L=1) period. L='default' (promised=0, matches all observed). mu_hat/sigma_hat='recent_N' N=9 (regime_length=9>=3, cap20) to capture sustained low mean/vol, avoiding overstock from all-history high mean~150+. Backend base_stock\u224877 + 1.64*19\u2248114 (q=19/20=0.95), balances high service vs low holding on low demand; cap irrelevant at low levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime late-summer low extended P25-33: avg 77 (-62% vs summer high 200), std 19 vs prior 74; sustained 9 periods low demands 99/79/53/59/83/75/74/70/99.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7): Early October, fall transition; tank top demand expected low post-summer. Low demand regime sustained P25-34 (10 periods): demands 99/79/53/59/83/75/74/70/99/35, avg=72.6 (-62% vs prior summer high ~200), std~22 (low vol). On-hand=68 covers ~1 period low demand; in-transit=0, no overdue (all historical arrivals confirmed L=0). Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current low regime (N=regime_length=10); default L=0 (promised/observed). Lowers base_stock/mu to ~73, reduces overstock risk/holding costs while covering low demand over 1 period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime late-summer/fall low extended P25-34: avg 72.6 (-64% vs summer high 200), std 22 vs prior 74; sustained 10 periods low demands incl. P34=35.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25), Black Friday week (11/28 Thursday) for women's casual lace tank top/vest\u2014major retail holiday likely drives demand spike akin to Easter P11 (337) or summer P20 (366), overriding winter low regime. Recent P34-41 demands: 35/64/59/62/53/26/50/40 avg=48.6 std\u224813.7 (low vol), on-hand=34 low vs recent ~40-50, no in-transit, all historical LT=0 confirmed (no losses/delays). L=default (promised/actual=0). mu_hat=explicit 200 to forecast BF-boosted demand (base_stock\u2248200+1.645*40\u2248266, order\u2248232 post-34 pipeline, high service q=0.95 covers spike while limiting hold cost). sigma_hat=explicit 40 (recent low vol base + spike buffer >13.7). Addresses no missing shipments (all arrive LT=0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime winter low extended P34-41: avg 49 (-36% vs summer high 200), std 14 vs prior fall 22; sustained 8 periods consistent low demands 35-64 (further drop P39-41 avg 39 vs P34-38 55).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2), early December pre-Christmas; lightweight women's summer tanktop expects low winter demand, but P42 (11/25 near Thanksgiving/BF Nov29) spiked to 125 (+212% vs winter avg49 P34-41). Winter low regime P34-41 avg49 std14 per carry-over, extended tentatively with P42; full recent P34-42 (9 periods) avg~57 std~28. On-hand=141 IT=0 covers multiple low periods or repeat spike; consistent LT=0 all 42 periods, no losses/overdues. Use recent_N=9 (regime_length=9 since P34 changepoint) for mu_hat/sigma_hat: backend mu_hat~(1+0)*57=57, sigma_hat~sqrt(1)*28=28, base_stock~57+1.645*28~103 <141 so order~0, draws down OH minimizing holding ($1/unit) while high q=19/20=0.95 safety covers ~125 demand/volatility; avoids overordering if demand reverts low.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), winter low season for tank top (women's casual jersey vest). Winter low demand regime sustained (carry-over P34-41 avg 49, std 14), P42=125 likely Black Friday/Thanksgiving spike (2019/11/25), P43=31 back to low confirming no sustained shift. Recent P34-43 demands (10 periods): avg 54.5 (+11% vs prior winter avg 49), std ~38 (volatility up due to P42 spike). On-hand 110 covers ~2-3 periods low demand (~40-50), in-transit 0, all historical lead times=0 confirmed. Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect extended winter low with recent holiday volatility; L default (promised 0 consistent). High service q=19/20=0.95 prioritizes covering spikes over holding, parameters raise base_stock ~54 + 1.645*38 ~108 to buffer volatility while low mean limits overstock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16): Mid-winter pre-Christmas week; tanktop (women's casual jersey vest with lace) sees sustained low demand in winter regime per carry-over (P34+ avg~49-53, std~14-27), recent P42=125 holiday spike (Thanksgiving) not sustained as P43=31/P44=38 low. Demands P34-44: avg 53, std~27. No in-transit/overdues; all historical LT=0 confirmed. On-hand=72 covers ~1.4x recent demand (~38). L='default' (promised 0, consistent). mu_hat/sigma_hat='recent_N' N=11 (regime length P34-44=11 periods, changepoint P34 per carry-over); backend computes mu_hat=1*53=53, sigma_hat=sqrt(1)*27~27. Base stock~53 + 1.645*27~97 (q=19/20=0.95), order~25 to target low-demand coverage, balance high service vs low holding.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23): Christmas week (Dec 25 holiday); women's summer tank top in winter expects low demand ~40 (P43-45 avg37) but holiday spike risk per pattern (Easter P11:337, summer P20:366, Black Friday P42:125 ~3x base). On-hand=56, in-transit=0; no overdue/missing shipments (all historical arrivals L=0 confirmed). Winter low regime changepoint P34 sustained 12 periods (P34-45) avg52 (+6% vs prior P34-41 avg49), std~26 (+86% vs14) capturing BF volatility. Set L=default (promised/actual=0 always). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=12 for (1+0)\xd7winter mean/volatility, base_stock~52+1.645*26\u224895 (order~39), balances low holding vs high service (q=0.95) with holiday buffer vs recent low.

Carry-over insight: Holiday spike pattern confirmed: Easter P11 337 (+590% vs hist81), summer P20 366 (+352%), Black Friday P42 125 (+157% vs winter49); 3 sustained instances signal ~120+ risk for Christmas P46 and future holidays.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30), post-Christmas, winter low demand regime for tank top (women's casual jersey vest); carry-over confirms winter low P34+ avg~49-51 vs summer highs. Recent P43-46 demands 31/38/42/38 avg37 std~4.6 (low vol continuation, incl prior lows like P39=26); P46 Christmas no spike (38) despite holiday risk pattern. On-hand=57, in-transit=0, no losses/overdues (all historical L=0 confirmed). Winter regime changepoint P34 (Period 39 insight), length=13 periods (P34-46 avg51 std~25).
