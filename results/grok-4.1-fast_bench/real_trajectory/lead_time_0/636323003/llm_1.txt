Year-round fashion staple, but early Feb 2019 (period date 2019-02-11) nears Valentine's Day (Feb 14), potentially boosting women's apparel demand. Winter-to-spring transition may sustain rising trend in casual denim. (b) Demand regime: Historical weekly demand rising sharply\u2014Jan7:19, Jan14:46 (+142%), Jan21:48 (+4%), Jan28:62 (+29%), Feb4:85 (+37%). Recent avg (last 3): ~65; overall avg:52. Accelerating upward trend suggests 85+ for Feb11 week, possibly 100+ with Valentine's proximity. No prior regimes to shift from. (c) Lead time: Promised 0 periods; no concluded periods yet (Period 1), so cannot infer actual LT or losses. Assume 0 for now; order covers current period post-arrival. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0, in-transit 0. No pipeline coverage. (e) Final order logic: Order 100 to cover projected demand (~90-110, trend + Valentine's), prioritizing sales (profit $19 >> holding $1). Excess held 1 period costs little (~$1/unit); stockout loses $19 + future. Conservative start with upside buffer; adjust next period on results.",
