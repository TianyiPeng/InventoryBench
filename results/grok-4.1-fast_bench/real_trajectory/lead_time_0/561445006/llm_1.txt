Nov 11, 2019 (Period 40): mid-November, late fall Northern Hemisphere; demand for short-sleeved tees low due to cooling weather, shift to warmer clothing. No major events boosting category (Veterans Day minor; Thanksgiving Nov28 unlikely for summer tees). Historical early-year demand ~59 avg, but seasonal decline aligns with recent lows.\n(b) Demand regime: Sustained very low ~15-20 (P36-39: 10,22,20,15 avg 16.75, low variance; continues P31-39 downtrend from prior highs). No rebound signal.\n(c) Lead time: Confirmed 0 periods consistently (incl. P39 order arrived same period). No in-transit/missing orders.\n(d) Inventory: On-hand 15, in-transit 0. Post-P39 ending 15 covers ~1 period demand; no pipeline coverage.\n(e) Order logic: Forecast P40 demand ~17 (recent avg + trend). Order 15 for total avail 30 (covers up to ~30, buffer vs max22, targets ending ~13). Balances low stockout risk (profit $4) vs holding $1; conservative for endgame (8 periods left).",
