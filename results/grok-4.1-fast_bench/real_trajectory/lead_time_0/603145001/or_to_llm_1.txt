Current date 2019-12-02 (post-Cyber Monday, pre-Christmas ~3 weeks out): underwear basics may see modest holiday gift/shopping uptick, but no strong evidence yet vs sustained recent low ~16-20; world knowledge suggests steady winter demand for cotton hipster briefs, not peak seasonal like apparel gifts.
