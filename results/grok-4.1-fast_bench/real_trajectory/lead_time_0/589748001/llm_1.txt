Matches Period 24 carry-over high regime. Forecast P26 ~65-75. (c) Lead time confirmed 0 periods consistently (all concludes show 'lead_time was 0 periods', e.g., P25 order arrived P25). No in-transit or lost orders. (d) Inventory: On-hand=35, in-transit=0. No pipeline; covers <1 period demand. (e) Order 70: Covers expected ~70 demand (35+70=105 available), targets ~30-35 ending inv (low holding ~$30-35 cost, profit ~$280 if full sell). Balances stockout risk (past summer spikes caused shortages P21/P22) vs holding; quick lead time allows adjustment next period.",
