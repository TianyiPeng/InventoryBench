{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent arrivals show LT variability (1-3 periods), but extensive loss pattern confirmed (in-transit 1356u fully lost per carry-over, no new arrivals in P46 conclude; losses persist on recent orders). Effective pipeline=0 despite reported in-transit. Promised LT=2, but unreliable delivery. Inventory status: On-hand=26 (from P46 ending, after demand=13); covers 3+ periods at current low regime avg~8 (P40-P46 demands:13,6,9,4,7,5,13 fluct low). Demand analysis: Strap top (summer apparel) in deep winter low regime sustained P40-P46 avg~8 (-40% vs fall P32-P39 ~13.5), no Christmas/New Year's uptick (P46=13 fluctuation within range, post-2019/12/23). Historical early-year high (46-76) irrelevant now. OR rec=0 uses promised LT=2 and all-history (ignores regime/season/losses), appropriately low given i.i.d. assumption overfits to early highs but recent data pulls mean down. Strategy: Follow OR 0 - no order needed; 26 on-hand buffers low demand over LT+1=3 periods (~24 expected), avoids holding cost/risk of further losses. Profit=holding=1, so minimal stocking optimal.",
