Recent (2019-02-04):102. No evidence of regime shift; forecast ~100/period, potential +10-20% Valentine's uplift next period. (c) Period 1: no prior orders or conclude messages. Promised LT=2; no data to infer actual LT or losses yet. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; empty pipeline. Period 1 demand will stock out fully. First order (LT=2) arrives during Period 3 (visible Period 4). (e) Order conservatively for 1-2 periods' demand post-arrival to build base stock, balancing stockout risk vs. holding cost (Profit=1, Holding=1).

Historical Jan demand ~80-100 aligns with cold-weather accessories, but game shows lower/volatile summer pattern with holiday spikes (Mother's/Memorial/July4).\n(b) Demand regime analysis: P17-21: 28/17/33/28/76 (avg 36.4, volatile); P18-21 recent avg 38.5. Post-holiday drop likely after P21 spike (similar to post-Memorial P17 drop from 93 to 28), but no sustained new regime (only 1 high period vs prior post-holiday low ~26 avg P17-20). Forecast P22+ ~30-50, conservative 40 mean with holiday volatility.\n(c) Lead-time vs missing orders: Promised LT=2; recent observed LT=1-2 (e.g., P19 arr P18 LT1, P17 arr P15 LT2/P16 LT1). Persistent losses (P13/14/17 confirmed lost per carry-over; no arrivals P20-21 despite prior orders). No new orders P20-21, so no fresh overdues; supply unreliability sustained, expect low realization from 625 in-transit (mostly ghosts).\n(d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=28 (~0.7 periods at 40 demand); covers P22 partially (risk stockout if >28). In-transit=625 bloated w/ lost shipments (historical pattern), no expected P22 arrivals (P20/21 orders=0). Pipeline unreliable, treat as ~0 reliable incoming.\n(e) Final order logic: Target service for (LT+1)=3 periods demand (~120 at 40 avg) minus on-hand 28 = ~90 need; order 80 conservative (balances stockout risk vs holding cost=profit; assumes partial LT=2 arrival P24, buffers losses/volatility; avoids overorder given unreliable supply & high recent inv holdings e.g. P20-21).",
