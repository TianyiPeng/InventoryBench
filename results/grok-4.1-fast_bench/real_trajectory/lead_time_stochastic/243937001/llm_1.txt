(b) Demand regime: Holiday high sustained (P40-42 avg102, P43-45:65/84/96 avg82 stable high vs fall avg~100; P43 dip anomalous, no new shift; aligns carry-over pre-Christmas escalation). Forecast P46:120-150+ peak, P47+ possible post-holiday drop. (c) Lead time: Variable 1-3 (recent P42 LT3/P43 LT2 arr P45); lost pattern sustained (older backlog), but recent reliable; no new arrivals info yet (P44 ord200 exp P46 LT2, P45=200 exp P47). (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 355 (~3pd@100dmnd), in-transit 1120 (covers ~11pd, ample despite lost risk; recent arrivals P45=360 confirm pipeline flow). Post-P46 dmnd~130: ~225 end-oh; +exp arr~200 P47: ample. (e) Order: 200 to sustain pipeline coverage for peak+LT variability/post-holiday, matching recent (P43-45=200) vs holding risk; prioritizes sales>stockouts in holiday.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) Women's fine-knit cotton blend socks: winter staple for cold weather, gifting during Christmas/New Year's holidays. Date 2019/12/30 (New Year's Eve week) post-Christmas; expect sustained high winter demand ~80 (recent avg) with possible slight post-holiday dip but no sharp drop vs summer lows; aligns with initial Jan 2019 hist (70-91 avg). (b) Demand regime stable high winter: P43-P46 (Dec) avg 79 (65/84/96/72), down from holiday peak P40-P42 avg 102 (-22%) but sustained vs Oct-Nov ~95 avg over 10w; no new sharp shift, holiday tapering but winter baseline holds. (c) LT variable 1-3 confirmed historically; recent P46 arrived=0 signals delays (P44 200 >LT2 now attempting LT3 in P47; P45 200 >LT1 expect P47 LT2; P46 200 >LT0 expect soon); lost pattern sustained (older like P34 120, P38 160 overdue 10+w, backlog ~400+), but recent orders mostly arrive delayed not fully lost. (d) On-hand 283 covers ~3.5w at 80/wk; pipeline 1320 massive (~16w), expected near-term arrivals P47: P44 LT3=200, P45 LT2=200, P46 LT1=200 (+older), even 50% delivery floods inventory; total coverage 20+w despite losses. (e) Order conservatively 120 to buffer LT/loss risk & Jan winter demand (hist 70-90), matching avg demand*1.5 for safety (profit 19>>holding1), but low vs recent 200s to curb excess holding as pipeline/on-hand ample; avoids stockout while depleting surplus.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-holiday winter demand stabilization: P43-P46 avg 79 vs P40-P42 holiday peak avg 102 (-22%), 4 periods evidence; lost shipment pattern sustained: recent delays P44(200)>2pd, P45(200)>1pd adding to backlog ~400u over 43+ periods.",
