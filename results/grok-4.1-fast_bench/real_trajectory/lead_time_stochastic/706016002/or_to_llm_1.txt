Use effective LT=2.5 for planning. Inventory analysis: On-hand=835 (covers ~2-3 periods at ~300 recent avg demand, but vulnerable to surge); in-transit=5493 includes ~4000+ historical lost (carry-over sum 3343 + confirmed P32:500, P34:650, etc.), effective pipeline ~1500-2000 from recent P44:700 (exp P46-47), P45:800 (exp P47-48), plus any unconfirmed older.

OR rec=0 reflects high nominal inventory position vs historical mean but ignores seasonality, lost pipeline, LT variability. Strategy: Override OR's 0 with 800 to target base stock ~ (3 periods LT+1) * 500 expected + safety for 1000+ spike (q=0.8 fractile implies aggressive stocking pre-holiday); matches recent order ramp (P44:700, P45:800), replenishes effective pipeline losses, positions for P46-49 coverage.",
