Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, massive in-transit=997 provides extensive future coverage even at LT=3+ (e.g., covers 10+ periods at 80 demand); no immediate stockout risk. Demand analysis: Sustained winter taper low P40-46 avg ~71 (46+49+107+84+ excl prior outlier), post-Christmas P47 (12/30) likely ~50-70 continued decline for t-shirts (cold season, no holiday boost post-Xmas/New Year's); aligns with early-year historical ramp-up later but irrelevant now. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and full history (ignores losses/delays, seasonality); reasonable baseline given low recent mean ~71, high variance, but uncapped base-stock low due to pipeline.
