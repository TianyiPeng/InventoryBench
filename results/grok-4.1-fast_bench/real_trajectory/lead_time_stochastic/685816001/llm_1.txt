Date 2019-12-02: Early December holiday season start (Cyber Monday Dec 2, Christmas Dec 25 ~3 weeks away); expect apparel demand uptick for gifting/basics/layering vs. historical Jan-Feb ~42 low. (b) Demand regime: Recent P38-42: 75/64/30/38/150 (avg 71, volatile); P42 spike 150 (+300% vs P38-41 avg57) signals potential holiday upshift breaking fall/winter low ~60 regime (P27-41), but single-period evidence; forecast P43 ~120-160 blending trend + seasonal lift. Historical early-year low ~42, but long-term shifts to higher means. (c) Lead-time/missing orders: Promised LT2; recent sparse arrivals (P40-42:0); confirmed LT1/3 instances prior (e.g., P38 LT1, P39 LT3); losses common (e.g., P34 lost per carry-over P40); no new LT evidence in P42 (arr=0); P24/P26 lost prior; prolonged no-arrivals P40-42 suggest possible delays/losses in pipeline. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 93 (P42 end after 150 demand, no arr); in-transit 2005 (massive ~15-20x weekly demand, likely large prior orders offsetting losses/delays, timing uncertain due to variable LT/losses). Covers multiple future periods if arrives, but risk if delayed/lost. (e) Final order logic: 93 on-hand risks partial stockout on ~140 forecast (lost ~$19*50=$950); huge pipeline mitigates long-term but LT variability/losses justify buffer order for (LT+1)=3 periods coverage; low holding $1 vs profit $19 favors overstock; order 200 for immediate P43 + safety + pipeline hedge, tapering if arrivals resume.",
