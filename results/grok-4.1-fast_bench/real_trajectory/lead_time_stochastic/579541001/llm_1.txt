(d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 113 (low, risks stockout if demand>113 + any arrival); in-transit 3470 massive (covers ~25 periods at 140 avg but delayed, accruing risk); P42 ending 113 after demand=120. (e) Order logic: Order 250 targets expected P45-46 holiday peaks (LT~2-3 coverage post-P43/44), ensures buffer vs delays/stockouts (19 profit/unit >>1 hold); conservative vs recent 220-280 orders given pipeline but prioritizes service amid surge.",

No lost confirmations but pattern suggests unreliable pipeline. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 604 (high, covers 4-5 periods at 125-150/wk); in-transit 3160 massive but delayed/unreliable, holding cost pressure $1/unit but stockout loss $19/unit higher priority.

(c) Lead time vs missing: Chronic delays persist (carry-over: multiple shipments 10+ overdue, e.g., P3/P4/P10 etc.); recent LT varies (P43: LT3/2; P44: arrived=0); P42 order (220) expected P44 LT2 but no arrival, overdue pattern holds\u2014no new LT shift confirmed.
