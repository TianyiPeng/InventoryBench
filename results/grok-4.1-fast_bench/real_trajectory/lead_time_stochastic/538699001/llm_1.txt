(b) Demand regime analysis: Upward trend early Jan, acceleration to 190 possibly CNY-driven; forecast Period 1-3 ~140-160 pending post-holiday confirmation. (c) Lead-time vs. missing orders: Promised LT=2; no 'conclude' messages yet (Period 1 start); no in-transit to track. (d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 1-2 demands uncovered (lost sales expected ~150 total). Pipeline empty. (e) Final order logic: Order 150 for Period 3 arrival (matches recent demand avg, covers forecast with minor safety vs variance); establishes steady-state base (order weekly forecast, target zero end-inv given profit=hold=1).

(b) Demand regime: Winter low bottom sustained P42-46 avg 3 (5 periods:4,4,4,2,1 consistent 1-4); matches carry-over stabilization at 2-4, no new shift vs prior avg~3.5. Forecast P47: ~1-3. (c) Lead time/missing orders: Promised 2; massive delayed backlog persists thru P46 conclude (arrived=0, IT=1790 stable exact sum of old orders P1+, oldest P1 LT>=46); no recent arrivals or LT observations; treat backlog as indefinitely delayed/non-arriving. No losses evident (IT exact). (d) Inventory/pipeline: OH=259 (covers 80+ periods at ~3 demand); IT=1790 phantom (no arrivals imminent); no stockouts recent, excess OH incurs holding. (e) Order logic: Order 0\u2014no demand need, avoids adding to non-arriving IT/backlog/holding; maintain minimal safety (OH>>forecast); profit=holding=1 favors low inventory.",
