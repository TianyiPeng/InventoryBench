{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, actual variable (1-3 periods observed recently: P45 arrivals LT=3 for P42 order, LT=2 for P43 order; persistent lost shipments with ghosts >>1556u per carry-over, in-transit 1706u likely inflated by non-arriving ghosts). Inventory position: On-hand=660 (P45 ending), covers ~3 periods at recent holiday avg 240u (P42-45:420/166/211/163); in-transit=1706u will add more during P46-P48 despite losses. Demand analysis: Christmas week (2019/12/23 P46), peak holiday demand for sweatshirt (warm gift item), recent sustained ramp-up P42-45 avg 240u (+50% vs pre-BF 177u per carry-over), expect 200-400u this week/Cyber Monday aftermath into Christmas Eve. OR recommendation=0 based on promised LT=2, full history mean (diluted by summer lows), high pipeline - aligns well as base_stock exceeded. Strategy: Follow OR at 0; current position covers (L+1=3) periods demand (660+expected arrivals >>900u needed), ordering adds holding risk post-Christmas drop; no override needed despite seasonal peak given buffer.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows variable LT (1-3 periods) and persistent lost shipments (total ghosts >>1556u, with recent confirms like P42 order lost); in-transit 1706u likely mostly ghosts, so unreliable pipeline - no new arrivals in P46 conclude. Inventory position: On-hand=573 (covers ~5-7 periods at recent 80-100u demand), in-transit unreliable. Demand analysis: Holiday peak sustained through mid-Dec (P42-45: 420/166/211/163, avg~240u influenced by BF/Christmas outliers; P43-46 avg~157u), but P46=87 signals post-Christmas/New Year's dip (-52% vs P43-45 avg 180u), consistent with seasonal post-holiday normalization for winter apparel into Jan; expect 70-100u for P47 (late Dec/early Jan winter demand, below peak but above summer lows). OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and full history (ignores losses/seasonality), but aligns with reality given high on-hand and demand slowdown. Strategy: Follow OR at 0 - no order needed as 573 on-hand buffers (L+1=3 periods) demand even conservatively (3*100u=300u <573), avoids adding to holding costs ($1/u/period) or ghost risk; monitor P47 demand for sustained post-holiday dip confirmation.",
