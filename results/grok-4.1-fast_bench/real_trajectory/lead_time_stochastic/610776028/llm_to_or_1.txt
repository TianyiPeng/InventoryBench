Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), women's basic jersey T-shirt. Historical demands [0,0,8,17,27] show changepoint after 2nd sample (from 0 to ramp-up: last 3 avg=17.33, std~9.5). No prior game periods, no in-transit/on-hand, no lead time observations. Use default L=2 (promised). recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent regime (N=3=min(regime_length=3,20), backend computes (1+2)*17.33~52 mu, sqrt(3)*9.5~16.5 sigma). High profit/holding ratio favors service; params boost base-stock to cover rising demand over 3 periods, preventing stockouts while capping overorder.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift after 2019-01-14: avg from 0 to 17.3 (+\u221e% over last 3 periods)

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18, Presidents' Day holiday - major retail event likely driving demand spike; prior Period 1 demand=77 confirms boost beyond historical ramp-up). Historical samples show changepoint after 2019-01-14 (from 0s to positives): last 3 hist (01-21:8,01-28:17,02-04:27) avg=17.3; now including P1:77, recent 4 samples mean=32.25 (regime length=4 since changepoint). On-hand=0, in-transit=33 (P1 order, no arrival yet - normal for L>=1). Pipeline low vs recent demand. No lead time data (use default). Set recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect sustained upward demand regime (N=max(min(4,20),3)=4), yielding mu_hat~(1+2)*32.25=96.75 + safety via sigma. Balances higher mean/volatility for service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding, orders more post-stockout.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), women's basic t-shirt. Recent demands exploded: P1 (2/11):77, P2 (2/18):143 (avg 110/period, +300%+ vs hist max 27 on 2/4), confirming escalation beyond prior regime shift noted in carry-over (hist post-1/14 avg 17.3). No conclude arrivals yet (P1 order=33 exp P3 arrival after decision; P2=83 exp P4), so no lead time observations or losses; intransit=116 covers partial recent demand but stockouts ongoing (cum demand 220). Late Feb no major holidays but possible pre-spring/lingering Presidents Day (2/18) effect on P2. Use default L=2 (promised, no evidence of drift). mu_hat explicit=330=(1+2)*110 recent avg to override low hist mean~10.4 for new high-demand regime. sigma_hat explicit=81=sqrt(3)*~47 recent per-period std (sample std from 77,143) for elevated volatility. Ensures high base_stock~330+0.84*81~357, order~min(357-116, cap~110+1.64*81/1.73~110+77=187)=~187 to build inventory proactively vs holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, women's basic T-shirt. No major calendar events. Demands ramping sharply: historical (up to 2019-02-04: avg ~10), game P1:77, P2:143, P3:176 (avg 132, +1200% vs historical avg). On-hand=0, massive stockouts (sold=0 each period). In-transit=303 (P1:33 + P2:83 + P3:187). P1 order overdue: expected arrive during P3 (promised L=2), but P3 conclude arrived=0; signals LT>2 or lost (still in-transit). Set L explicit=3 to cover observed delay. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=3 to capture sustained high-demand regime (N=3 as regime_length=3). This boosts base_stock/mu for higher service (q~0.8) to fulfill rising demand, extends coverage over longer LT to mitigate overdue risk, balancing profit vs holding.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained Periods 1-3: avg 132 (77,143,176; +660% vs prior historical avg 20.4 last 5); P1 order overdue in P3 (arrived=0 vs expected L=2)

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): Basic women's T-shirt, early March, no major seasonal events imminent. High demand regime sustained P1-4: demands 77,143,176,143 (avg 134.75, +560% vs historical pre-P1 avg ~10). P1 order (33) lost (overdue past P3, no arrival in P4). P2 order arrived P4 with LT=2 (only observed LT). Pipeline: 435 in-transit (P3:187 exp P5; P4:215 exp P6; P1 lost). On-hand=0 risks stockout this period. Use recent_4 for mu/sigma to capture sustained high demand/volatility (std~41.6); default L=2 as observed LT=2, backend base_stock ~3*134.75 + 0.84*sqrt(3)*41.6 ~430 covers ~3 periods demand minus pipeline adjustment, balancing high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (33 units) lost: no arrival by Period 4 conclude (expected Period 3 for LT=2); High demand regime sustained P1-4: avg 134.75 (+560% vs pre-P1 historical)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): Women's basic jersey T-shirt. High demand regime sustained (P1-5 demands: 77,143,176,143,129; avg=133.6, +560% vs pre-P1 historical avg~10). On-hand=0, in-transit=465 (~3.5 periods demand coverage at 133/demand). Confirmed LT=2 (P2 order arrived P4); P1(33u) lost (no arr by P3); P3(187u) overdue (no arr P5, expected LT=2). No major calendar events (pre-Easter buildup possible but unconfirmed). Use L=default=2 (matches single observation); mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_5 (regime_length=5 periods since P1 shift, N=5>=3 cap) to capture elevated mean/volatility, ensuring base_stock covers ~3 periods high demand despite losses/overdues; OR backend's q=4/5=0.8 targets high service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: P3 order (187u) overdue/likely lost: no arrival in P5 conclude (expected P5 for LT=2); second incident after P1 loss

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), women's basic jersey T-shirt (everyday basics), early spring - sustained high demand regime since P1 (avg 134.3 over P1-6: 77,143,176,143,129,138; vs pre-P1 historical avg ~10). No major holidays imminent. On-hand=0, in-transit=435 exactly matches sum of P1(33)+P3(187)+P4(215) orders, all past promised LT=2 without arrival (P1/P3 confirmed lost; P4 overdue past P6). Effective pipeline ~0, but backend treats as reliable. Observed LTs: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6). To bridge lost shipment gap and prompt ordering despite inflated pipeline view, use explicit L=3 (effective longer LT due to loss pattern). recent_N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures sustained high regime (changepoint post-2019-01-14, regime_length=6 periods confirmed by stable high means post-shift). Yields mu_hat~537, sigma_hat~73, base_stock~598 (z~0.84), order~163 (vs cap~194), balancing high service (profit $4>>holding $1) vs cost; covers ~4.5 periods demand.

Carry-over insight: Shipment losses sustained: P1(33u), P3(187u) confirmed lost; P4(215u) overdue past LT=2 (no arrival in P6 conclude)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1): Early spring, women's basic T-shirt demand sustained high (P1-7 avg 144, +600% vs pre-P1 historical avg ~10); recent P5-7 avg 156 with P7 spike to 200 suggesting possible further increase amid warming weather. On-hand=0, in-transit=592 but high loss rate (P1=33, P3=187, P4=215 confirmed lost by P7 conclude=no arrival past expected P6; ~60% of P1-5 orders lost, total ~435u). Observed LTs: P2 order LT=2 (arr P4), P5 LT=1 (arr P6); avg=1.5. Use L 'calculate' for avg observed LT~1.5 to reflect variability/shorter recent. mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=7 (regime_length=7 since P1 chgpoint, evidence: sustained >130 demand vs prior near-0) to capture high mean/vol (~144 mu_d, ~39 sigma_d), yielding ~432 mu_hat & ~90 sigma_hat (L~1.5), boosting base_stock despite unreliable pipeline; compensates losses by targeting higher coverage over ~2.5 periods (~360 demand), balancing q=0.8 service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: P4 order (215u) confirmed lost (no arrival P6/P7 conclude, expected P6 LT=2); cumulative losses P1(33u)+P3(187u)+P4(215u)=435u; sustained high loss rate 3/5 pre-P7 orders (~60%)

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8): Early spring, t-shirt basics likely seeing sustained seasonal ramp-up. High demand regime confirmed P1-8 avg 150 (77,143,176,143,129,138,200,194; +~1400% vs pre-game historical avg~10), no new changepoint. Pipeline in-transit=435 matches cumulative confirmed lost shipments (P1=33, P3=187, P4=215; never arrived despite overdue past LT=2), on-hand=0 post stockout. Observed LTs: P2->P4=2, P5->P6=1, P7->P8=1 (avg~1.33, recent shift to 1 but only 2 periods). Losses sustained ~50% of orders (3/6), backend unaware\u2014must inflate base_stock >435 phantom pipeline to force ordering. Use default L=2 (promised, avoids under-scaling recent low LT avg which would yield base_stock<435\u2192order=0). mu_hat recent_N=8 captures sustained high-demand regime ((1+2)*150=450). sigma_hat recent_N=8 (std~40, sqrt(3)*40~69). Expected base_stock~450+0.84*69~508>435 (order~73), cap~215; ensures service level q=0.8 covers ~3 periods demand despite losses, minimizes holding on unreliable pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15, spring; women's everyday basic T-shirt - expect steady demand, no major events). High demand sustained; new regime shift P7-9: demands 200/194/184 avg 193 (+64% vs P1-6 avg 118). Recent LT=1 sustained (P5->P6 LT1, P7->P8 LT1). Transit 509 = 435 lost (P1:33u + P3:187u + P4:215u, per history/insights, never arrive) + 74 P9 pending (likely LT1 arrive P10). On-hand 0, consistent stockouts. Junk bloat 435 causes backend position=509, underestimates need. Strategy: L=1 (recent evidence). Normal mu_(1+L)=193*2=386, sigma_period=33 (recent_5 std), sigma_hat=sqrt(2)*33\u224847. Inflate mu_hat=386 + 435 lost=821 \u2192 base_stock\u2248821 + 0.84*47\u2248860. Orders ~860-509=351, equiv to target_reliable 428 - current_reliable 74. Cap sufficient ~465. Ensures OR builds reliable pipeline ignoring junk, covers ~2 periods demand+safety at service q=0.8 while minimizing excess hold.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg 193 (+64% vs P1-6 avg 118, 3 periods sustained); Lead time=1 period sustained (P5 LT1, P7 LT1, last 2 observed); Shipment losses ceased since P4 (P5 30u LT1, P7 157u LT1 arrived reliably, P9 74u pending)

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter (4/21/2019); women's basic T-shirt demand likely steady spring levels, no major spikes expected. High demand regime sustained since P7 (avg 177 over P7-10: 200,194,184,130), despite P10 dip to 130 (-29% vs prior 3 avg 193) not yet sustained as shift (1 period only). Pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=787 (includes P10 order 352 expected LT=1 arrival during P11, visible P12; high coverage ~4-6 periods at avg 150-180). Lead times: observed LTs [P4:2 (P2), P6:1 (P5), P8:1 (P7), P10:1 (P9)]; last 3=1.0 sustained/reliable (no recent losses post-P4). No overdues. Set L recent_3 (avg1) for accurate (1+L)=2 period horizon. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_4 to anchor on sustained high-demand regime (changepoint P7: +~32% vs P1-6 avg134), ensuring backend base_stock ~ (1+1)*177=354 mean + safety for vol ~25, balancing high q=0.8 service vs holding; high pipeline likely triggers low order qty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time=1 period sustained (3 consecutive: P9 order arrived P10 LT1, P7@P8 LT1, P5@P6 LT1)

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29), women's jersey T-shirt basics; late April spring, no major events, steady high demand post-winter shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=787 (confirmed lost P1=33/P3=187/P4=215 total 435u + P10=352 overdue past LT=1, no arr in P11 conclude). Continued stockouts (P11 demand=137, sold=0). Demand high regime since P1 (11p avg=150), recent changepoint P7 sustained 5p (P7-11 avg=169, +26% vs P1-6 avg=134; evidence: 200/194/184/130/137 consistent >prior). LT recent observed last3=1 (P5/P7/P9), avg all4=1.25 but P10 miss suggests longer/possible loss resumption. Bloated pipeline from losses causes OR underorder; explicit L=5 estimates effective LT w/ uncertainty buffer (promised=2 + loss risk). mu_hat recent_5 (N=5=max(min(5,20),3) for P7 regime), backend computes (1+5)*169=1014. sigma_hat recent_5 matching volatility. Base~1014 + 0.84*sqrt(6)*33~1014+74=1088 >787, enables order up to cap~169+1.64*33~210 rebuilding real inv vs holding cost; high q=0.8 favors service.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6 early May, women's everyday basic T-shirt; no immediate holidays, Mother's Day 5/12 upcoming ~1wk). Demand changepoint at P10: recent regime P10-12 (130,137,72) avg 113, std~35.7 (-41% vs P7-9 avg~193 sustained prior regime, 3 periods evidence). LT sustained 1.0 (last 3 observed: P9@P10, P7@P8, P5@P6). On-hand=0, in-transit=1011=435 ghost (prior lost P1=33/P3=187/P4=215, never arrive) +576 pending (P10=352 overdue past LT=2 no arr P11/P12, poss LT>=3 or lost; P12=224 expect arr P13 if LT=1). Backend unaware of ghosts/losses, subtracts full 1011 pipeline -> underorders (base_stock<<1011). Compensate via explicit L=8 (inferred effective LT longer due to sustained unreliability/ghosts/delays), yielding mu_hat=(1+8)*113~1017, sigma_hat=sqrt(9)*35.7~107, base~1017+0.84*107~1090>1011 order~79 min(79, cap~113+1.64*35.7~172); recent_N=3 for mu/sigma uses regime N=3. Balances high service (q=0.8) vs hold cost with unreliable pipeline/recent low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: avg 113 (-41% vs P7-9 avg 193, sustained 3 periods P10-12)

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13): Women's T-shirt basic jersey; mid-May approaching summer/Memorial Day (5/27 ~Period 16), seasonal demand rebound likely despite recent decline (P10-13 demands 130,137,72,46 avg 96.25, -42% vs P1-9 avg 154). On-hand 0, in-transit 1108 = prior confirmed losses 435u (P1/P3/P4) + recent P10(352)+P12(224)+P13(97)=673u; P10 overdue past LT=1/2/3 (no arr P11/12/13), P12 overdue past LT=1 (no P13). Backend subtracts unreliable bloated pipeline, risking perpetual stockouts. Observed LT recent_3=1 (P5/P7/P9 arrivals). Set L recent_N N=3 for accurate LT=1; explicit mu_hat=1200 (forecast ~100/period x2 + buffer for losses/seasonal upside ~600 extra safety); explicit sigma_hat=200 (inflated vol for supply uncertainty/loss risk, hist std~50 x4 buffer) \u2192 base_stock~1200+0.84*200=1392 >1108 \u2192 orders ~284u (under cap) to cover ~2-3 periods demand, prioritizing service (q=0.8) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline regime sustained P10-13: avg 96.25 (-42% vs P1-9 154, 4 periods); Shipment losses resumed/sustained: P10(352u) overdue >3 periods past LT=1, P12(224u) overdue >1 period; in-transit 1108=prior 435u losses + recent 673u pending/potentially lost

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20, late spring; women's basic t-shirt): Sustained demand decline regime P10-14 avg 84 (130,137,72,46,35; -45% vs P1-9 avg 154), trending sharply lower last 3 at avg 51; post-Easter (Apr21) demand drop confirmed. On-hand 189 covers multiple low-demand periods; in-transit 1145 bloated by confirmed losses (cumulative incl. P10 352u lost - no arrival by P14 conclude, overdue >4 periods past LT1/2 past LT2) + pending P13(97u exp P15 LT2), P14(261u exp P16). Recent LTs: last 5 observed (P2->4 LT2, P5->6 LT1, P7->8 LT1, P9->10 LT1, P12->14 LT2) avg 1.4, varying 1-2; losses signal unreliable pipeline. Set L recent_5 to use actual avg LT~1.4 vs promised 2; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 to anchor low-demand/volatility regime (mean84, std~47), yielding lower base stock to curb overstock/holding costs amid high inventory/losses while maintaining service via z=0.84 (q=4/5); OR cap limits aggressive orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline sustained P10-14: avg 84 (-45% vs P1-9 154, 5 periods); P10 order (352u) confirmed lost (no arrival by P14 conclude, overdue >2 periods past LT=2); Recent LT varies 1-2 (last obs P9->10 LT1, P12->14 LT2)

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27 Memorial Day): Women's basic T-shirt; holiday may spike summer demand but decline regime sustained P10-15 avg 78.2 (130,137,72,46,35,49; -49% vs P1-9 avg 153.8). On-hand 140, in-transit 1145 = 884u lost (P1:33, P3:187, P4:215, P10:352, P13:97 confirmed lost no P15 arrive expected LT2) + 261u P14 pending (LT2 arrive during P16). Effective pipeline ~401 vs default normal bs ~(3*95.25 mean_all + z*sqrt(3)*std_all) ~387 slight excess, target order ~0 now. Sustained losses inflate pipeline perpetually; compensate by explicit L=11 \u22482 promised + 884 lost /95.25 mean_p \u224811.3 effective LT, inflating default mu_hat=(12)*95.25~1143, sigma_hat=sqrt(12)*std_all, bs~1143 + 0.84*sqrt(12)*std_all ~1320-1380 >1285 yielding small order (e.g. ~50-100 < cap~210) to subtly replenish despite inflated pipe, using full history default mu/sigma to balance decline with prior peaks. Ensures OR ignores ghost lost inventory for correct effective policy.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline sustained P10-15: avg 78 (-49% vs P1-9 154, 6 periods); P13 (97u) confirmed lost (no P15 arrival, expected LT=2); cumulative losses 884u (P1 33u+P3 187u+P4 215u+P10 352u+P13 97u); losses resumed post-P9 at ~40% rate (2/5 recent orders lost)

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3), women's basic T-shirt, early summer but demand decline regime sustained P10-16 (7 periods: demands 130,137,72,46,35,49,62; avg 75.9, -51% vs P1-9 avg 153.8). On-hand 78 covers recent demand ~60-80; in-transit 1205 = 1145 lost (prior 884u + P14 261u confirmed lost: no P16 arrival past LT=2) + 60 pending (P16 order). True pipeline ~138 (78+60); phantom 1145 causes backend to underestimate need. L default (promised 2). mu_hat explicit=1373: recent_7 pd avg 75.9 *3=228 +1145 phantom inflation. sigma_hat explicit=71: sqrt(3)* recent_7 pd std 41. This sets base_stock ~1433 = true_base 288 (228+60 safety) + phantom; order ~1433-1283=150 = true_base - true_pipe, bridging lost shipments for service level vs holding balance. Cap ample (~458 pd mean +39 safety).

Carry-over insight: Demand decline regime sustained P10-16: avg 75.9 (-51% vs P1-9 154, 7 periods); P14 order (261u) confirmed lost (no P16 arrival, overdue >LT=2); cumulative losses 1145u (+261 prior 884); losses sustained ~60% rate recent post-P9 (P10/13/14 lost, P12 arrived, P16 pending; 3/5)

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10), early summer for women's basic jersey T-shirt (everyday upper body garment); demand spiked sharply to 237 in P17 (+213% vs sustained P10-16 decline avg 75.9), signaling potential seasonal rebound/uptick as winter lows transitioned to spring highs then dip, now summer rise. On-hand=0 (stockout risk high post P17 partial fill); in-transit=1295 grossly overstated by sustained cumulative losses ~1145u (~60% recent post-P9 rate: P10/13/14 confirmed lost, others arrived LT1-2), plus pending P17=150u (likely LT1 arrive P18). Recent LTs: confirmed 1.33 avg (6 obs: P2->4 LT2, P5->6 LT1, P7->8 LT1, P9->10 LT1, P12->14 LT2, P16->17 LT1). No new losses confirmed in P17 (P16 arrived as expected LT1). L=calculate uses observed avg 1.33 to reflect actual shorter-than-promised LT but loss risk. mu_hat=EWMA_gamma 0.3 weights P17 spike heavily (~30%) for responsive forecast amid possible summer demand shift, yielding (1+L)~2.33 periods coverage ~220-280 total mean. sigma_hat=explicit 1500 buffers massive supply uncertainty/losses (z*1500~1260 safety stock), inflating base_stock > inflated pipeline (expected ~mu_hat 250 +1260=1510 >1295) to trigger positive order despite overstated in-transit, ensuring service (q=0.8) vs holding while cap remains ample ~ mu_per_pd 110 +1.645*(1500/sqrt(2.33))~110+1620~1730.

On-hand=0, stockout P18 (demand=282 unsold); in-transit=1812 bloated by sustained losses (cumulative ~1145u+prior, includes ghosts). Observed LTs (6 total: P2=2,P5=1,P7=1,P9=1,P12=2,P16=1, avg~1.33); use 'calculate' for L~1.33 to reflect shorter actuals when arriving. recent_3 mu_hat~(1+1.33)*194~450, sigma_hat~sqrt(1+1.33)*116~140 boosts base_stock despite bloated pipeline/cap, prioritizing service (recent stockouts, profit=4x holding=1) for high summer demand while limiting overstock.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24, summer start - seasonal uptick expected for women's basic T-shirt). Demand changepoint at P17: shifted to high regime avg 239 (P17-19:237/282/197, +206% vs P10-16 decline avg78, sustained 3 periods with summer relevance). All-time mean~138. On-hand 320 covers ~1.5 periods recent demand; in-transit 1295 bloated w/ cumulative losses incl. new P17(150u) lost (no P19 arr, overdue >LT=2). Confirmed LTs seq:2,1,1,1,2,1,1; recent_4 (P10/P14/P17/P19 arrives: LT1/2/1/1) avg1.25 signals variable but short LT. Use recent_N=4 for L (adapts to observed avg< promised2, bridges delays/losses). recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime-specific: mu~(1+1.25)*239~286, sigma~sqrt(1+1.25)*42.5~49; prioritizes fresh high demand over all-hist 138/hi-vol, raises base_stock/service vs default to fight stockouts amid losses, caps holding via backend policy).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg 239 (+206% vs P10-16 avg 78, sustained 3 periods P17-19); P17 order (150u) confirmed lost (no P19 arrival, overdue >LT=2); cumulative losses ~1295u (in-transit bloated); Recent LT avg 1.25 sustained (last 4 obs LT:1,2,1,1)

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01): Summer season for women's basic jersey T-shirt; steady high demand expected. Recent demand regime shift at P17 sustained P17-20 (4 periods): demands 237,282,197,161 avg 219 (+181% vs P10-16 decline avg78). On-hand 159 covers <1 recent demand period; in-transit 1295 bloated by cumulative losses (~1295u, incl. recent P17 150u lost) - backend pipeline subtraction will suppress orders unless base_stock inflated. LT observations sustained variable 1-2: last 4 arrives P19 LT1 (P18), P17 LT1 (P16), P14 LT2 (P12), P10 LT1 (P9) avg1.25. No new sustained losses post-P17 (recent arrives reliable). Changepoint evidence: demand jump >180% sustained 4+ periods. Use recent_N=4 for L (avg LT1.25), mu_hat ((1+1.25)*219\u2248488), sigma_hat (sqrt(2.25)*std~58\u224887) to set high base_stock covering high-demand regime + LT variability/loss risk, balancing service (q~0.8) vs holding while overcoming bloated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand high regime sustained P17-20: avg 219 (+181% vs P10-16 avg78, 4 periods); Recent LT avg1.25 sustained (last 4 obs: P19 LT1, P17 LT1, P14 LT2, P10 LT1)

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08, mid-summer; T-shirt everyday basics - seasonal demand peak likely). Demand high regime from P17 shift sustained P17-21 (5 periods, avg 198.6, +155% vs P10-16 decline avg~78; evidence: 237,282,197,161,116 - elevated despite P21 dip). On-hand 43 low (stockout risk vs recent ~150-200 demand), pipeline=1338 bloated by ~1295u cumulative confirmed losses (P1/3/4/10/13/14/17 etc., remain in-transit indefinitely). No arrivals expected P22 (P20/21 orders=0; LT1/2). Recent LTs 7 obs avg~1.29 (1,1,2,1,1,1,2) but losses imply effective longer. Backend subtracts full pipeline \u2192 order=0 unless base_stock >1338. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime length=5, N=max(min(5,20),3)=5; std_p~64.6). Explicit L=6 inflates mu_hat=7*198.6~1390, sigma_hat~171, base~1390+0.84*171~1534 >1338 (order~196 < cap~199+1.645*64.6~305), enabling positive order to cover upcoming demand despite losses/overstated pipeline. Balances high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding by capping exposure.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15), summer period for women's basic T-shirt; demand high regime sustained P17-22 (6 periods, avg 184 vs prior P10-16 decline avg 78, +136%); recent P20-22 161/116/111 avg 129 still well above decline. On-hand=0, in-transit=1491 bloated by cumulative ~1295u historical losses (60% recent rate), overstating reliable pipeline & risking underordering. Recent LTs last 5 obs: 1(P18->19),1(P16->17),2(P12->14),1(P9->10),1(P7->8) avg=1.2 (sustained <promised 2). Use recent_N N=5 for L to reflect actual shorter avg LT (prompts higher base_stock/cap since backend scales mu/sigma by 1+L). recent_N N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high demand/volatility regime (backend computes (1+L)*mean/std last 6 ~1.2+1=2.2x184=405 mu, high service q=0.8 offsets holding despite bloated transit; compensates losses by recent-data upscaling vs all-history low mean).

On-hand 92 risks stockout vs recent ~110 demand. All 1295 in-transit confirmed lost ghosts (P1:33, P3:187, P4:215, P10:352, P13:97, P14:261, P17:150; sum=1295; no arrivals ever, no live pending). Recent LT stable avg 1.25 (last 4 obs: P22->23:1, P18->19:1, P16->17:1, P12->14:2). L=recent_N N=4 uses avg 1.25. mu_hat=explicit 1572=(1+1.25)*123 recent avg demand +1295 ghosts adjustment to inflate base_stock ~1600 >1387 (92+1295), yielding order ~213 to cover demand despite ghost pipeline overestimation. sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 (recent std~22 \u2192 sigma_hat~34, z\u03c3~28 safety). Balances high service (avoid stockouts) vs holding by compensating losses precisely.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline post-June peak sustained P20-23: avg 123 (-49% vs P17-19 avg 239, 4 periods); In-transit entirely ghost inventory (1295u confirmed lost from 7 orders P1/3/4/10/13/14/17, no live shipments pending); Recent LT avg 1.25 sustained (last 4 obs:1,1,1,2)

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29): Late July summer, women's basic T-shirt post-June peak (P17-19 avg~239). Demand decline regime sustained/evolved: stabilized low P21-24 avg 108.75 (116,111,104,104; std~5.1 low vol, -12% vs P20-23 avg123, -55% vs early high P1-9~154). On-hand=0, in-transit=1518 all ghost (prior ~1295 lost + P24 223 pending, per carry-over no live shipments). Recent LT sustained avg1.25 (last 4 obs: P22->23 LT1, P18->19 LT1, P16->17 LT1, P12->14 LT2). No overdue confirmed this period. To bridge ghost pipeline (backend unaware), explicit mu_hat=1518(ghosts) + recent4 mean_d*(1+1.25)=108.75*2.25\u2248245 \u21921763; sigma_hat=5.1*sqrt(2.25)\u22487.6\u21928.0.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019/8/19): Late summer, women's basic T-shirt demand in post-peak decline phase (summer wear tapering into fall/back-to-school). Recent demand P23-27: 104,104,76,76,92 avg 90.4 (low vol std~12); sustained low regime P21-27 avg97 but further drop P25-27 avg81.3 (-25% vs P21-24). On-hand 160 covers ~1.8 periods; in-transit 2014 bloated w/ ~1518 ghosts (prior ~1295 + P24 223 lost, overdue past LT=2 no P26/P27 arrival) + pending P26(253u LT>=2 expect P28?), P27(243u). Losses sustained ~50% rate distort pipeline. To bridge: explicit mu_hat=2100, sigma_hat=500 inflate base_stock~2100+0.84*500=2520 > pipeline 2174 yielding order~346 (covers 3-4pd demand ~360 w/ profit service), capped by L=2 cap~1175 (2100/3 +1.645*500/sqrt3 \u2248700+475). Balances stockout risk vs holding despite ghosts.

Carry-over insight: Demand further decline at P25: avg 81.3 P25-27 (std 8.2, -25% vs P21-24 avg 108, 3 periods sustained low vol); P24 order (223u) confirmed lost (no arrival P26/P27 past LT=2); ghosts now ~1518u (prior 1295u +223)

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/8/26, late summer/back-to-school transition for women's basic T-shirt): demand low stable post-June peak decline. Recent P25-28 demands:76,76,92,105 (avg87.25, std~11.2, low vol regime since P25 changepoint drop from P24=104, sustained 4pd -20% vs P21-24 avg109, evidence low vol confirms). On-hand=55 (low, expect stockout vs ~90 demand), in-transit=2361 bloated w/ghosts (P26=253u confirmed lost: no P28 arr vs exp LT2 P28; ghosts~1771u prior1518+253). Live pipeline: P27=243u + P28=347u=590u (exp arr P29 LT2/P30 LT1-2). LT recent5 obs (P25->27 LT2,P22->23 LT1,P18->19 LT1,P16->17 LT1,P12->14 LT2) avg1.4 sustained. Set L recent_5 for accurate short LT avg1.4 (OR uses ~2.4pd cover). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_4 for low demand/vol regime (OR base_stock~(1+1.4)*87~215 low, z~0.84 sigma~16 low safety; counters ghost pipeline overstatement w/low target\u2192order~0 preserves vs adding to losses; cap low too). Balances low service ok (unreliable supply) vs avoid holding on ghosts.

Carry-over insight: Demand low stable regime sustained P25-28: avg87.25 std11.2 (-20% vs P21-24 avg109, 4 periods low vol); P26 order(253u) confirmed lost (no P28 arrival exp LT=2); ghosts ~1771u sustained high loss rate

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02 Labor Day; back-to-school season tail, basic women's T-shirt demand likely low/steady). Low demand regime sustained P25-29: demands [76,76,92,105,74] avg=84.6 std=13.52 (low vol, 5 periods; -20% vs earlier regimes). On-hand=0, in-transit=2361u (all ghosts: cumulative confirmed losses incl. recent P24/26/27; P28 order 347u pending LT=2 but ~60-75% recent loss rate risks loss). No live pipeline expected. Recent LTs last 5 obs [P27 LT2(P25), P23 LT1(P22), P19 LT1(P18), P17 LT1(P16), P14 LT2(P12)] avg=1.4. Changepoint evidence: low stable confirmed 5p. To bridge ghosts (backend subtracts fake 2361u pipeline): effective real pipeline~0; target real base_stock=(1+1.4)*84.6 + 0.84*sqrt(1+1.4)*13.52 \u2248203 + 17.6=220.6. Explicit mu_hat=2361 + 203=2564 \u2192 backend base_stock\u22482564 + 0.84*21\u22482582, order\u22482582-2361=221 (matches real target). L recent_N N=5 accurate avg/cap; sigma recent_N N=5 reflects low recent vol. Ensures service despite losses, modest order limits overstock/ghost addition, high q=0.8 balances profit vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand low stable regime sustained P25-29: avg 84.6 std 13.52 (5 periods low vol); High loss rate sustained recent: P27 (243u) confirmed lost (no arr P28 LT1/P29 LT2), 3/4 last orders lost (P24 223u/P26 253u/P27 243u lost, P25 252u arrived); ghosts 2361u (in-transit bloated, no live pending)

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9): Early September, back-to-school season but basic women's jersey T-shirt demand remains in low stable regime (no spike evidence). Recent P25-30 demands: 76,76,92,105,74,71 (avg 82.3, std 11.8, low vol sustained 6 periods post-P24 decline). Pipeline: on-hand 519 + in-transit 1994 (~1771u ghosts from confirmed losses P1/3/4/10/13/14/17/24/26 + pending P29@223u/P30@223u). Expected reliable arrivals: P29 likely P31 (recent LT~2), P30 P32; covers 12+ periods @82/demand even at 50% loss rate. Recent LT changepoint: last 4 obs avg 2.0 (P22-23 LT1, P25-27 LT2, P27-30 LT3, P28-30 LT2) vs prior ~1.25. L recent_4 reflects higher LT regime/delays. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_6 matches low demand regime (backend: ~mu=246, sigma~21; base_stock~263 <<2513 pipeline \u2192 order=0). Addresses sustained losses/bloated ghosts by minimizing new orders (avoids adding to ghosts), relying on current on-hand + recent reliable pendings (P27/28 arrived delayed but confirmed); prevents holding cost escalation while service level high.

Carry-over insight: Lead time avg increased to 2.0 sustained (last 4 obs: P22-23 LT1, P25-27 LT2, P27-30 LT3, P28-30 LT2; first LT=3); Loss rate improved to 25% recent (1/4 orders P25-28 lost P26, 3 arrived delayed; vs prior ~60%)

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16): Late summer/early fall for women's basic T-shirt; no major events imminent (post-back-to-school). Demand low stable regime sustained P25-31 (7 periods): demands [76,76,92,105,74,71,73], avg=81, std~12.7 (low vol, -47% vs early high P1-24 avg~152). On-hand=446 covers ~5.5 periods demand; in-transit=1994 bloated w/ghosts (~2361u prior + recent pending P30 223u exp arrive P32 LT2). Recent LT observed: P22\u219223 LT1, P25\u219227 LT2, P27\u219230 LT3, P28\u219230 LT2 (last 4 avg=2.0, sustained ~2 despite variability/losses ~25% recent). No new overdue losses (P30 pending normal). Use recent_4 for L to match sustained avg LT=2 (helps backend forecast pipeline reliably despite ghosts). recent_7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low demand/vol regime (mu_hat~(1+2)*81=243 covers 3 periods; low sigma reduces overstock). Balances low service risk (high on-hand) vs holding cost; backend caps order low given pipeline bloat.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Late September, fall season onset for basic women's jersey T-shirt; demand expected low post-summer/back-to-school. Low demand regime sustained P25-32 (8 periods): demands [76,76,92,105,74,71,73,38], avg 75.6, std~19.2 low vol confirmed. On-hand 631 covers ~8 periods at 76/wk; in-transit 1771 mostly ghosts (lost orders persist indefinitely, backend unaware). Recent LT obs (last 4): P32 LT2 (P30), P30 LT3 (P27)/LT2 (P28), P27 LT2 (P25) \u2192 avg 2.25; use recent_N N=4 for L to reflect sustained delay >promised 2. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=8 for sustained low regime (chgpnt ~P25, length=8>3, validates low mean/vol vs prior highs). High on-hand + ghost pipeline \u2192 backend orders ~0 (base~(1+2.25)*75.6 +0.84*sqrt(3.25)*19.2 ~238 <2402 pipeline), balances holding vs low demand service; compensates LT drift but ghosts limit ordering (bridge via future param hikes if needed).

Carry-over insight: Losses ceased recent: last 4 orders P25/P27/P28/P30 all arrived delayed (LT 2/3/2/2); reliable supply chain recent; Lead time avg 2.25 sustained (last 4 obs LT=2,3,2,2)

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand 550 covers ~7 periods at 80/wk demand (holding $550/period but profit $320/period net negative until ~2 periods deplete). In-transit 1771 likely mix of historical ghosts + delayed live shipments (losses ceased post-P26, last 4 orders P25/27/28/30 arrived LT 2/3/2/2 avg 2.25; reliable supply chain). No new arrivals in P33. Pipeline bloated but recent LT reliable; conservative recent params ensure low base_stock (~270) < pipeline \u2192 order=0 avoids overstock. L recent_4 reflects sustained avg 2.25 (LTs: P30@2, P28@2, P27@3, P25@2). Mu/sigma recent_9 weights low demand regime (length=9>3, <20). Addresses ghosts indirectly: reliable recent arrivals will reduce effective pipeline over time; no inflation needed with high on-hand buffer.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7), early fall, basic women's jersey T-shirt post-summer peak; sustained low demand regime P25-34 avg 73 (10 periods, std 19.8) confirms seasonal decline (-~40% vs summer avg ~150). On-hand 506 covers ~7 periods demand (506/73); in-transit 1771 pure ghosts (no live pending post-P30 order arrived P32, cumulative losses sustained). Recent LT stable avg 2.25 (last 4 obs: P30 LT2, P27 LT3, P28 LT2, P25 LT2). True base_stock ~267 ((1+2.25)*73 + 0.84*sqrt(3.25)*19.8). Inflate mu_hat by ghosts 1771u to effective base ~2038; backend order = inflated_base - (OH + ghosts) = true_base - OH, bridging ghost bloat perfectly while matching true service/holding balance (q=0.8). L recent_4 for true LT; sigma recent_10 for true vol scaling.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime sustained P25-34: avg73 std19.8 (10 periods, -12% vs P25-30 avg84.6, sustained post-summer); Ghost inventory fixed at 1771u (no live in-transit); LT avg2.25 sustained last 4 obs (2,3,2,2), reliable recent arrivals

Demand low regime sustained P25-35 (11 periods): avg ~70 (76,76,92,105,74,71,73,38,81,44,43), std ~22, confirming carry-over low vol post-summer.

Recent LT reliable avg 2.25 (last 4 obs: P25->27 LT2, P27->30 LT3, P28->30 LT2, P30->32 LT2). No overdue shipments. Use recent_N N=11 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained low demand/vol (regime_length=11>3); recent_N N=4 for L to reflect extended/reliable LT~2.25>promised 2, ensuring base_stock covers (1+L)~3.25 periods low demand (~227 mu_hat), balancing high on-hand/ghosts vs service (q=0.8), minimizing excess holding while backend caps order low due to pipeline bloat.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21): Fall season for women's basic lightweight jersey T-shirt; low demand expected (no Halloween spike relevance). Recent demand P32-36: 38,81,44,43,40 (avg 49.2, std 17.9, low vol); sustained further decline vs prior P25-31 avg~81 (-40%). On-hand 423 covers ~8+ periods at 50/period demand; in-transit 1771=confirmed fixed ghosts (no live shipments, no arrivals P33-36, no pending orders post-P30). LT recent 4 obs: P25->P27 LT2, P27->P30 LT3, P28->P30 LT2, P30->P32 LT2 (avg 2.25, reliable delayed). No need to order now (high effective inv). Bridge ghosts: explicit mu_hat=1771(ghosts) + 3.25*(1+2.25)*49.2=1771+159.9=1930.9~1931; backend base_stock~1931 + 0.84*sigma > ghosts+onhand only when needed, yielding order=normal_base - onhand (ignores ghosts). L recent_4 for avg2.25; sigma recent_5 captures low vol. Ensures service despite ghosts while minimizing hold on high onhand.

Carry-over insight: Demand further decline at Period 32: avg 49.2 std 17.9 P32-36 (-40% vs P25-31 avg 81.4, 5 periods sustained low vol in early fall)

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Late October, lightweight women's T-shirt (everyday basics), demand low in early fall/winter transition, no Halloween spike expected for this category. Sustained demand decline regime P32-37: demands [38,81,44,43,40,56], avg=50.3, std\u224817.3 (6 periods, low vol confirming P37 carry-over). On-hand=367 covers ~7 periods at 50/demand, in-transit=1771 pure ghosts (fixed, no live shipments, losses ceased recent per P33 insight), no overdue orders. Recent LT reliable avg=2.25 (last 4 obs: P25@P27 LT2, P27@P30 LT3, P28@P30 LT2, P30@P32 LT2). No changepoints. Set L recent_4 to match sustained LT drift (backend uses avg>promised 2 for base/caps). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_6 to anchor low regime (backend computes (1+L)*50.3\u2248163, sqrt(1+L)*17.3\u224832; base\u2248163+0.84*32\u2248190). High pipeline (2138) ensures order\u22480 (optimal: real on-hand excess avoids holding cost), service maintained via buffer.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4, early Nov pre-Thanksgiving): Low demand regime sustained P32-38 (7 periods): demands [38,81,44,43,40,56,44] avg 49.4 (-40% vs P25-31 avg~81, low vol std~17.9 confirmed extended); women's lightweight jersey basic T-shirt unlikely holiday spike (fall/winter decline pattern post-summer peak, no uptick evidence in Oct); on-hand 323 covers ~6+ periods real demand (pipeline 1771=confirmed ghosts, no live shipments/overdues per history, losses ceased recent); LT recent avg 2.25 sustained (last 4 obs: P30 LT2, P27 LT3, P28 LT2, P25 LT2). Use recent_N N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=7, cap20 min3) to forecast low (1+L)~3.25*49.4~160 base need; recent_N N=4 for L to reflect reliable but delayed LT avg2.25>promised2. High ghost pipeline ensures OR orders ~0 (base_stock<<2094 pipeline), preventing overorder/holding bloat while on-hand ample vs low demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11): Early holiday season approaching Thanksgiving/Christmas, but basic women's jersey T-shirt shows no demand spike; sustained low demand regime P32-39 (8 periods): demands [38,81,44,43,40,56,44,43], avg=48.6, std=14.1 (low vol, -40% vs prior regimes). On-hand=280 covers ~5.8 periods; in-transit=1771 confirmed ghosts (no live shipments per history/carry-over, losses ceased post-P30). Recent LT reliable, last 5 obs: P25->P27 LT2, P27->P30 LT3, P28->P30 LT2, P30->P32 LT2 (avg=2.2); no overdue pending. Set L recent_5 (backend avg~2.2 > promised 2, covers delays); mu_hat recent_8 (low mean regime, (1+~2.2)*48.6~158); sigma_hat recent_8 (low vol, sqrt(1+~2.2)*14.1~25). Base_stock~158+0.84*25~175 << on-hand+pipeline=2051, triggers order~0, avoids bloating ghosts/holding while safe for low demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18): Mid-November pre-Thanksgiving/Black Friday; women's basic T-shirt typically low demand in fall/winter transition, no holiday spike observed (P39-40 demands 43/30). Low demand regime sustained P32-40 (9 periods): avg 46.6, std ~15 (demands:38,81,44,43,40,56,44,43,30); P33=81 outlier but overall low vol confirmed. On-hand 250 covers ~5+ periods at 46/unit (250/46~5.4), ample buffer. In-transit 1771u=confirmed ghosts (no live pending per history/P40 conclude arrived=0, ordered=0). LT sustained avg 2.25 (last 4 obs: P30 LT2, P27 LT3, P28 LT2, P25 LT2; reliable recent arrivals, losses ceased). No overdue shipments. Parameters: recent_N N=4 for L to use actual avg LT=2.25>promised 2 (bridges OR backend's promised LT assumption); recent_N N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained low regime mean/var (mu_hat~(1+2.25)*46.6~145, sigma~sqrt(3.25)*15~27), targets base_stock ~145 + z*27 (z~0.84 for q=4/5=0.8) ~170, low order to minimize holding on ample OH while covering (L+1)~3.25 periods demand; avoids overordering given ghosts/reliable supply.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime extended P32-40: avg46.6 std~15 (9 periods sustained into mid-Nov, no holiday spike; -5% vs P32-39 avg48.6)

Low demand regime sustained P32-42 (11 periods): avg 46.7, std ~16.2 (sum=514/11); on-hand=155 covers ~3 periods at 47/wk; in-transit=1771 all confirmed ghosts (fixed, no live pipeline). LT reliable recent: last 4 obs (P25->27 LT2, P27->30 LT3, P28->30 LT2, P30->32 LT2) avg=2.25, losses ceased. No overdue shipments.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/09), early December pre-Christmas; women's basic jersey T-shirt (everyday, non-seasonal heavy). Sustained low demand regime P32-43: 12 periods avg 45.4 std 14.5 (no holiday spike observed despite Nov-Dec proximity). On-hand 124 covers ~2.7 recent periods; in-transit 1771=stable ghosts (prior confirmed losses, no live pending: no arrivals P33-43, no orders post-P30). Real pipeline=124. Recent LT avg 2.25 sustained (last 4 obs: P25 LT2/P27 LT3/P28 LT2/P30 LT2). Forecast over 1+L=3.25 periods: mu=147.6, sigma=26.1, target base=147.6 + 0.84*26.1 \u2248169.5, desired order=169.5-124\u224845.5. Bridge ghosts via explicit mu_hat=1918.6 (backend base\u22481940.5 - full pipeline 1895=45.5 order); sigma_hat=26.1 uses recent vol; L recent_4 ensures cap uses correct LT (cap>>45). Balances low holding via modest order matching low demand/service.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime extended P32-43: avg 45.4 std 14.5 (12 periods sustained into early Dec, no pre-Christmas spike); Ghost inventory stable at 1771u (no live in-transit); LT avg 2.25 sustained last 4 obs (2,3,2,2), reliable recent arrivals

Low demand regime changepoint at P32 sustained P32-44 (13 periods): demands [38,81,44,43,40,56,44,43,30,34,61,31,27] avg=44.0 std\u224814.5 (low vol confirmed). Recent P42-44 [61,31,27] avg=39.7 low.

Recent LT sustained avg 2.25 (last 4 obs: P30@32 LT2, P28@30 LT2, P27@30 LT3, P25@27 LT2). Backend position=1914 bloated by ghosts; default/recent mu_hat~(1+2.25)*44=143 too low \u2192 order=0.

Coverage (1+L)=3.25: \u03bc_(1+L)=138.5, \u03c3_(1+L)=\u221a3.25\xd714.5\u224826.2, safety z*\u03c3\u22480.84\xd726.2\u224822 (q=4/5=0.8). Target real pipeline=138.5+22=160.5 \u2248 current real 162. Target total base_stock=1771+160.5=1931.5 \u2248 current pipeline 1933. Parameters set explicit to achieve base_stock\u22481933 (\u03bc\u0302=1771+138.5=1909.5 + z\u03c3=22), yielding order\u22480 (ideal: at target, no over/under-stock). Bridges ghost gap by inflating to target total pipeline=ghosts+real target; cap ample ~1909.5/3.25\u2248588 weekly.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime extended P32-45: avg 42.6 std 14.5 (14 periods sustained late Dec pre-Christmas); Confirmed no Christmas spike: P43-45 Dec demands avg 27.7 std 2.9 (-37% vs P32-42 avg 50, 3 periods low vol)

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas late Dec, women's basic T-shirt demand low regime sustained P32-46 avg 42.0 (15 periods, std~14.5 low vol, no holiday spike confirmed P43-46 avg~29). On-hand 39 low, in-transit 1861=1771 stable ghosts (per carry-over P44) +90 live recent (P44 46u + P45 44u pending, LT~2-3 arrive P47 possible). Recent LT sustained avg 2.25 (last 4 obs: P25 LT2, P27 LT3, P28 LT2, P30 LT2). Real pipeline~129u, forecast (1+2.25)*42=136.5 mu, sqrt(3.25)*14.5~26.1 sigma, real base~158 (z~0.84), desired order~158-129=29u. To bridge ghost bloat, inflate mu_hat explicit=136.5+1771=1907.5 (base_infl~1929), sigma_hat explicit=26.1 (same z sigma); order~1929-1900=29u, cap~611>>29. Ensures OR orders despite ghosts, balancing low demand/service vs holding.
