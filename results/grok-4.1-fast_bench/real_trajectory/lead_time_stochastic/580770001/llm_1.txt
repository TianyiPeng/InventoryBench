  "rationale": "(a) Product: Kai jumper (women's rib-knit cotton blend sweater/knitwear, everyday upper body garment). Winter-appropriate for cold weather; Dec 30 2019 (post-Christmas Monday, pre-NY Eve) in northern hemisphere winter suggests potential mild demand for cozy knits amid cold, but retail post-holiday slump dominates (returns/sales, low traffic). No major spikes expected vs. sustained trough. Historical Jan highs (106-203) contrast current lows, indicating seasonal cycle but suppressed now.\n(b) Demand regime: Confirmed pre/post-Christmas trough persists/deepens (P39-46 demands:17,14,12,3,5,4,2,1; avg 7.3, -21% vs prior P39-44 avg9.2 per insight; sustained 8 periods, low variance <5). Forecast P47 ~3-8 (continuing ~1-5 recent, no calendar reversal evidence; NY not sweater driver).\n(c) Lead time: Recent confirmed 2-3 periods (e.g., P40 arr P43 LT3, P41 arr P43 LT2; no new concludes in P46). Losses pattern continues (820 in-transit = confirmed lost historical: P1:320, P3:120, P4:80, P17:120, P29:50, P34:130; overdue 3-46+ periods past LT2-3 expects, no arrives); treat as ghosts\u2014never arrive.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 388 (post-P46: drew down 1); effective pipeline = 388 only (820 in-transit lost/non-arriving). Covers 50+ periods at forecast 5-8/wk or 100+ at recent 1-4 avg. Massive overstock vs. low demand.\n(e) Order logic: Order 0 to avoid adding to high holding-cost inventory (profit=holding=$1, net zero on unsold; prioritize drawdown). 388 covers foreseeable low-demand horizon (post-holiday, no surge signals); replenish only on depletion.",
