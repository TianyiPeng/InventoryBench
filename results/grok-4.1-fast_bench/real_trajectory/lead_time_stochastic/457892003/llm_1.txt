Mid-Dec 2019/12/16: peak Christmas holiday shopping ramp-up (Dec 25 ~9 days away), winter demand driver for tights/leggings as cold weather + gifting boosts sales; historical Jan 2019 winter highs (avg~84) align. (b) Demand regime: Christmas peak volatility sustained P40-P44 avg72.4 (59-118 range), P44=68 up from P43=47 dip confirms mid-Dec build-up ramp (+ seasonal evidence); forecast P45 ~90-110 to capture peak escalation vs fall avg~70s. (c) Lead-time/missing: Chronic variable LT=1-3 + losses confirmed (no P44 arr despite pending e.g. P42 ord110 exp~P44); backlog in-transit=955 unreliable/sporadic (P43=210u burst but P44=0); assume LT~3 for planning, expect delayed arrivals post-decision. (d) Inv/pipeline: On-hand=95 covers ~1pd at forecast 90-110 (risk mild stockout if spike); massive in-transit=955 but loss-prone provides risky future buffer amid delays. (e) Order logic: Order 110 matching recent peaks/forecast + safety stock for LT=3 coverage (cover P45-47 gaps), balance stockout loss vs hold cost (Profit=Hold=1, prioritize service in peak); ramp from P44 ord110 anticipates Christmas surge w/ unreliable supply.",

(b) Demand regime: Christmas peak volatile high sustained P42-P45 avg75.3 (118/47/68/67), extending fall/winter high (P37-P41 avg~72); expect P46 continuation/spike. (c) Lead time: Variable 1-3 periods (recent P45: P42 ord LT3, P43 LT2); chronic delays/losses persist (in-transit 855 swelled despite sporadic arrivals e.g. P45=210u total); no new LT shift; P44 ord110 expected P46 LT2 at risk no-show.
