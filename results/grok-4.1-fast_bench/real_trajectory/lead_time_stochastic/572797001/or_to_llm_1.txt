{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LTs are 2-3 periods (e.g., P42->P45 LT3, P43->P45 LT2, P41->P43 LT2); losses persist historically (e.g., P17/19/23/10/13 lost), bloating in-transit to 1722 (unreliable, includes ghosts). No new arrivals in P46 conclude (P44 order 300 overdue past LT2-3). Inventory analysis: On-hand 232 covers 2-3 periods at recent avg demand ~105 (P43-46: 89/105/119/105); pipeline unreliable but recent streak had some deliveries. Demand analysis: Date 2019/12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's, winter low season for summer tank top (historical Jan ~106 avg); holiday taper confirmed P43-45 avg104 (-45% from peak), recent P44-46 stable ~110, no upshift - expect 80-110. OR recommendation: 0 units (uses promised LT2, full history mean, ignores losses/seasonality). Strategy: Follow OR 0 - excess on-hand 232 incurs holding cost but avoids overordering into unreliable supplier amid low winter demand; covers (LT+1)=3-4 periods forecast need ~300-400. No override needed.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - on-hand 232 covers 2-3 low-demand winter periods (~100 avg) post-holiday taper; unreliable in-transit due to persistent losses makes adding more risky with holding costs.",
