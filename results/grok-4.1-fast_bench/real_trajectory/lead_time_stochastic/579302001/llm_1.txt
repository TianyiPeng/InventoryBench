Gift-relevant for holidays; Christmas peak confirmed in carry-over (P42-46 avg~145, +268% vs prior low ~36). Date 2019/12/30: post-Christmas/New Year's Eve. Demand drivers: post-holiday gift rush ends, expect sharp drop (historical analog: Jan avg~120 to Feb 58, -62%; similar post-peak decline). No major uplift for NYE lingerie.\n(b) Demand regime: Holiday sustained (P42-46:68/98/232/176/151, avg145); stockouts P45-46 (176/151 lost). P47 first post-peak; forecast decline to ~80-120 (Jan-like) or lower (~50-70 pre-holiday), not yet sustained for new regime.\n(c) Lead-time/missing: Promised 2; observed 1-3 periods, lost pattern persists (carry-over: recent P23/P24/P26/P27/P29/P32 lost). Recent: P44:300 (exp P46 LT2, arrived=0 P46, possible LT3 P47 or lost); P45:350 (exp P47 LT2); P46:400 (exp P48 LT2). No new overdue confirmations in P46 conclude (arrived=0).\n(d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0 (risk P47 stockout); in-transit=3000 (likely P44:300+P45:350+P46:400=1050 + prior unarrived/accumulated; expect 650-1050 arrive P47-P48 if not lost). Covers 20+ periods at ~150 or 40+ at ~80; high risk of excess post-drop.\n(e) Order logic: Massive pipeline covers extended horizon despite loss risk; post-holiday drop minimizes stockout pain vs high holding ($1/unit/period) on incoming flood. Order 0; monitor P47 conclude for arrivals/losses.",
