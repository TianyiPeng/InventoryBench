Demand analysis: Recent P43-45 avg 48 (48,47,49) sustained low post-BF (-58% vs P42=114); historical winter highs (Jan-Feb 70-149) and BF surge suggest potential Christmas spike (12/23 pre-Christmas last-minute shopping for women's jeans), forecast ~80-120 for P46-48.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but sustained lost shipment pattern (all 1319 in-transit presumed lost per history/insights: e.g., P38 order overdue, P40 overdue, etc., no recent arrivals in P46/P45 beyond old confirmed). Recent arrivals sporadic (P45: P42 lt3/P43 lt2; P46:0), confirming unreliable supplier. Inventory: On-hand=440 (high, covers 440/45~10 periods at recent demand avg), in-transit=1319 effectively 0 (lost). Demand analysis: Post-BF/CM low sustained P43-46:48,47,49,41 (avg46, -60% vs P42=114 surge), consistent with holiday fade into late Dec/post-Christmas (12/30 date); women's everyday skinny jeans see low demand post-holidays (no NYE surge expected for this SKU). OR rec=0 uses promised LT=2/historical demand, aligns perfectly with high on-hand/low demand/no reliable pipeline\u2014high holding risk ($1/unit) if overstock.
