{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but chronic lost/delayed pattern reinforced with no-arrival streak extended to 17 periods (P28-P44 arrived=0), sporadic past arrivals (e.g., LT=1-3 observed earlier), in-transit 948u largely unreliable/overdue (e.g., prior lost P1/3/4/10/13/14/17). Inventory analysis: On-hand=219 ample for current low demand (covers 20-40+ periods at ~5-10/unit); pipeline adds uncertainty but no expected near-term arrivals given streak. Demand analysis: Date 2019/12/16 (mid-Dec, pre-Christmas), but lightweight airy viscose summer trousers irrelevant for winter/holidays - no uptick expected; recent P40-P44 avg 6 (10/3/17/2/5), stable winter trough (-70%+ vs summer peaks ~180, +vs hist early-year ~22 but irrelevant); sustained decline confirmed in carry-overs. OR rec=0 aligns with low \u03bc\u0302 from full history skewed by summer peak, but recent regime dominates.
