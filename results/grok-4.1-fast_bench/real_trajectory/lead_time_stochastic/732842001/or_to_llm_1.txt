  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Variable 1-3 periods confirmed historically (e.g., recent P42 order LT3 to P45, P41 LT2 to P43); many lost shipments (cumulative ~910 ghost units identified in carry-over: P1:350, P4:150, P13:100, P19:40, P24:50, P29:80, P34:80, P38:60), explaining high in-transit 1140 with effective pipeline ~230 recent legit orders (e.g., P44:50 possibly emerging lost/overdue1, P45:80 LT2 expected P47, P46:100 LT1/2 expected P47/P48). Inventory & demand analysis: Starting OH=4 critically low (risk stockout ~40+ units this period if no arrivals); recent demand holiday peak sustained P44-46: 33/51/45 avg43 (sd~9, stable ~40-50 vs Nov avg~40, confirming Dec uptick for ladies skinny jeans per P46 carry-over); seasonal context 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas Monday, end-of-year/NYE week) likely maintains moderate-high demand ~40-50 via sales/gifts/party wear, not sharp drop. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock exceeded by full-history pipeline assuming promised LT=2, historical mean/sd; ignores ghosts, recent holiday shift, variable LT). Strategy: Override to 60 units - target base-stock ~130 for (L+1)~3 periods coverage (43*3) accounting for unreliable pipeline/low effective inventory; conservative vs uncapped ~100 given cap/loss risk, balances 50% fractile (profit=holding=1) avoiding stockouts while minimizing hold on ghosts.",
