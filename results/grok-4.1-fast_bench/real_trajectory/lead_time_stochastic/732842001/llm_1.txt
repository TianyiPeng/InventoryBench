Current date 2019/12/2 (early Dec, pre-Christmas ~3 weeks out; Black Friday just passed 11/29 influencing P42). Expect gradual holiday demand ramp (apparel sales +20-50% typical Dec vs Nov), but no immediate spike confirmed.

(e) Order logic: Order conservatively 70 to cover P43-45 demand (~50-60/period \xd73 for LT max3 + safety for holiday ramp/stockout risk) while minimizing holding on ghosts/unreliable supply (Profit=holding=1, prioritize sales vs excess).
