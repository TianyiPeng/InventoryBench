Demand analysis: Christmas week (2019/12/23) for long-sleeve blouse aligns with peak holiday gifting/winter wear; recent P43-P45 avg=195 (177/216/193), but sustained high regime P30-P45 avg~235 (+46% vs hist 161) post-BF including volatility (P42=722); anticipate 250-350 spike risk. OR rec=0 relies on promised LT=2, full historical demand (~161 underest), apparent high pipeline - ignores seasonality, losses, regime shift. Strategy: Override to 300 units for safety stock (q=0.8 implies high z*~0.84); covers LT=3 review+lead (4 periods x~250=1000 total need), projecting post-P46 OH~264 (514-250), minimal arr P47, builds to ~564 pre-P48 arr to avoid stockouts in holiday tail.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 300 units - in-transit 1578 bloated by lost shipments (effective pipeline ~0); Christmas peak demand ~250-350 expected for long-sleeve blouse sustaining high regime (P30-P45 avg 235 vs hist 161).",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LTs variable 2-3 periods (e.g., P43->P45 LT=2, P40->P43 LT=3, P39->P41 LT=2); no new concludes in P46 (arrived=0), but prior patterns show occasional losses though recent deliveries reliable. Pipeline: In-transit 1878 units likely from recent orders (e.g., P46:300, P43:400 arrived P45 but others pending like P44:0, P45:0, P46:300 + backlog); assume most arrive within 3 periods covering 6-9 periods of demand at ~200 avg. Inventory: On-hand 387 sufficient for 2-3 periods even at holiday highs. Demand analysis: Sustained holiday surge P30-P45 avg 235 (+46% vs hist 161) through Christmas (P46 12/23), but P46 demand=127 (-46% vs surge avg) signals post-Christmas/New Year's dip for long-sleeve blouse (clearance/returns typical late Dec); historical early-year avg 161 but post-holiday likely lower initially. OR rec: 0 units (base-stock covered by high pipeline/on-hand using promised LT=2 and full history). Strategy: Follow OR at 0 - excessive coverage (387+1878 >10 periods demand); avoid adding to holding costs amid demand dip; monitor P47 demand for regime shift confirmation.",
