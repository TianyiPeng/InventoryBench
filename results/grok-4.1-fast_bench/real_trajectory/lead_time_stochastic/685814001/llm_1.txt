(b) Demand regime: Fall/winter volatile high sustained P30-43 avg~230 (12+ periods evidence, peaks 690/374/259, recent P41-43:213/690/156 volatile but >150 confirming holiday extension per carry-over P42/43); no new regime shift (P43=156 drop post-spike within volatility, lacks 3+ sustained evidence for separate holiday tier). Forecast next 3p: 250-400 volatile avg~300/period holiday-driven. (c) Lead time/missing orders: Recent reliable\u2014P40(300) LT=3 arrived P43, P41(300) LT=2 P43; no new losses confirmed (P34 loss prior); overall ~60% loss rate sustained but recent arrivals good; pending P42(400 expected LT2=P44/visible P45), P43(800 LT2=P45), others contribute to in-transit. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=444 covers ~1.5-2p at 250avg (post-P43 ending); in-transit=3550 massive (~1420 expected @40% arrival rate) covers 4-5+ periods even w/losses\u2014pipeline overbuilt for LT=2-3 but prudent vs losses/volatility/spikes; no imminent stockout risk. (e) Final order logic: High pipeline + on-hand buffers holiday volatility/stocks multiple periods; order moderate 500 to replenish ~60% loss risk/maintain pipeline coverage for P45-47 endgame (total 47p) without excess holding ($1 low vs $19 profit), targeting service level >95% vs overstock.",
