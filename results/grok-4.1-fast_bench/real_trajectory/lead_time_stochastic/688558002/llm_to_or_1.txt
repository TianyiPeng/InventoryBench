Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), winter season for long-sleeved jersey basic top; historical demand shows clear changepoint after 2019-01-14 (demand 6,11 low), shifting to high regime 48,72,90 (mean 70, +700% increase, sustained 3 periods). No game history, on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no shipments to track. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture elevated demand regime (backend: (1+L)*mean_recent3 ~210, sqrt(1+L)*std_recent3 ~ low variance ~17*sqrt3~30), L=default=2 (promised, no observations). Ensures base stock covers ~3 periods of higher demand, boosting service/profit vs holding amid rising trend toward Valentine's (Feb14 minor).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: avg from 8.5 (first 2 wks) to 70 (last 3 wks, +725%)

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18), winter season for long-sleeved jersey top; high demand regime confirmed since 2019-01-21 (carry-over: avg 70, Period 1 demand=67 fits). Available demands: historical 5 + Period 1=6 total. Changepoint at sample 3 (01-21); recent regime length=4 (48,72,90,67; mean~69). No concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 arrived=0 expected); in-transit=105 from P1 order, no overdue (promised L=2, expect arrival during P3). On-hand=0 after unmet P1 demand=67. Use default L=2 (no observed lead times). recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high mean/variance over (1+2)=3 periods (~207 mu, higher volatility), raising base_stock > pipeline=105 for service level q=0.8 (profit-driven), preventing stockouts while capping overorder vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25): Winter long-sleeved jersey top; high demand regime confirmed from carry-over (shift at 2019-01-21, avg ~70 last 3 hist wks) continuing with P1:67, P2:128 (avg recent 5: 48,72,90,67,128 =81, +850% vs early). No on-hand, sales=0 due to stockouts; in-transit=203 (P1:105 exp P3 arr, P2:98 exp P4 arr, no overdue/losses yet as first arrivals pending in P3 conclude). No LT observations (none concluded); use default L=2. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high-demand regime (changepoint evidence: post-01-21 samples all >45, avg81, length>=5); backend computes mu_hat=3*81=243, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*std(~37)=~64, balancing high service (q=4/(4+1)=0.8) vs holding amid pipeline cover for 2 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04): Early March, basic long-sleeved jersey top (winter/early spring apparel). Demand regime remains high post-shift noted in carry-over (late Jan onward), with recent Period 1-3 demands: 67,128,123 (avg 106, up from early hist avg 8.5). Full stockouts each period (ending OH=0). In-transit=288 (P1:105 overdue - expected P3 arrive but P3 conclude arrived=0; P2:98 expected P4 after decision; P3:85 expected P5). No confirmed arrivals or LT observations yet (all concludes arrived=0), so no evidence of LT drift or losses beyond overdue P1 - conservative default L=2. Use recent_3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to focus on sustained high-demand regime (N=3 as min regime evidence in-game, changepoint at late Jan sustained 6+ wks total), yielding mu_hat~(1+2)*106=318 (covers pipeline gaps/overdues), sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*28~48 (recent std~28). This boosts base_stock for higher service amid stockouts/uncertain pipeline, balancing profit vs holding (q~0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $277.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): Early March, long-sleeved jersey top likely seeing post-winter demand softening (p4 demand=75 vs p2=128/p3=123 peaks). Demand regime remains high post Jan21 shift (carry-over), recent game demands avg 98.25 (67,128,123,75), std~31.7. On-hand=23 low; in-transit=270 includes P1 order=105 (overdue past promised P3 arrival, no conclude by P4 - likely lost), P3=85 expected P5 if LT=2, P4=80 later; effective future supply overstated by ~105 lost. One LT observation=2 (P2->P4). Use default L=2 (matches observed/promised). recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures recent regime (changeloint sustained high since Jan21, regime>7 but recent 4 reflects current levels/volatility); mu_hat~3*98=294, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*32~55 boosts base_stock to ~294 + 0.84*55~340 vs pipeline~293, ordering ~47 to cover while accounting for loss risk/overstatement; prioritizes service (q=0.8) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 1 order (105 units) overdue past expected Period 3 (promised LT=2), no arrival or conclude by Period 4 conclude.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): Early spring; long-sleeved jersey top demand likely declining post-winter peak as warmer weather approaches. Demands: P1:67, P2:128, P3:123 (peak), P4:75, P5:74 (drop ~30% from P1-3 avg 106). High-demand regime (from carry-over Jan21+) sustained across 5 periods, no new changepoint (recent drop only 2 periods, not 3+ sustained). LT: 1 observation (P2 order: LT=2). P1 order (105u) lost; P3 order (85u) overdue (expected P5 arrival/conclude, arrived=0); P4 (80u) expected P6. In-transit 318 inflated by lost/delayed (~190 actual reliable pipeline est.). On-hand=0, stockout risk P6 unless arrivals. Parameters: L 'calculate' (avg observed LT=2); mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_5' (mean~93.4, std~29.6; scales to ~280/51 for L=2, base_stock~323 slightly >318 pipeline \u2192 small order to buffer losses/vol; high q=0.8 favors service over holding given recent stockouts.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): Late March, spring transition for long-sleeved jersey top; no immediate holidays (Easter April 21). Demand post-shift high and sustained ~91 avg last 6 periods (67-128 range, recent 75-82 stabilizing lower but still elevated vs hist). On-hand=0, persistent stockouts. In-transit=276 includes lost P1(105 overdue past P3), P3(85 overdue past P5/P6), pending P4(80 overdue past P6 LT2), P6(6). Pipeline overstated ~190 by losses. No new arrivals expected immediately. Chgpoint post P3 peak drop confirmed but not sustained shift down (last 3 avg77, var low). Use recent_N=6 (regime length=6 post-shift, min(6,20)=6>3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set high mu_hat~(1+2)*91.5=274.5, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*26.8~46, base~274+0.84*46~313>276 pipeline (order~37<cap~135), replenishing lost units while high q=0.8 prioritizes service over holding. L default=2 (promised, observed avg1.5 but delays suggest conservative).

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 3 order (85 units) overdue past expected Period 5 (LT=2) and Period 6 (LT=3), no arrival or conclude by Period 6; emerging pattern with P1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1, early spring). Long-sleeved jersey top; demand stable post-winter peak, no major calendar events immediate (Easter 4/21 possible future uptick). Recent demand P4-P7: 75,74,82,75 (avg 76.25, std ~3.4); earlier P1-P3 avg 106 (downshift -28%). Confirmed losses: P1(105),P3(85); P4(80) overdue past P6 (no arrive P6/P7 conclude), total ghost pipeline ~270/314, actual reliable pipeline ~44 (P6:6, P7:38). On-hand 0, stockouts recent. Default params yield base_stock ~300-310 <314 pipeline \u2192 order 0, fails to rebuild. Set L explicit=3 (compensates delays/losses, extends coverage to 4 periods vs promised 3). mu_hat recent_N=4 (stable regime length=4, (1+3)*76.25=305). sigma_hat default (full history std~25 * sqrt(4)~50, z\u03c3~42 safety). Base~305+42=347 >314 \u2192 order~33 (~0.5 period demand, within cap~117), starts replenishment aggressively despite ghost pipeline; higher L/mu bridges OR's unawareness of losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand downshift after Period 3: avg P1-3=106 to P4-7=76.25 (-28%), sustained 4 periods; Lost shipment confirmed: Period 4 order (80 units) overdue past expected Period 6 (LT=2), no arrival by Period 7 conclude

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8, early spring, approaching Easter ~4/21). Recent demand stable in downshift regime P4-P8: mean 79.6, std~7.6 (sustained 5 periods). Pipeline=324 includes 270 confirmed lost shipments (P1:105, P3:85, P4:80 stuck indefinitely); effective pipeline~54 (P8:54 pending). Recent LTs: last 4 arrives confirm avg 1.5 (P2->P4:2, P5->P6:1, P6->P8:2, P7->P8:1). No arrivals expected this period (next possible P8 order in P10 if LT=2). To bridge lost gap for OR backend (subtracts full 324 pipeline), inflate base_stock by ~270 via explicit mu_hat=480 (targets reported base~490 = true_base~220 [2.5*85 mean_d + z*~12 sigma] +270 lost adjustment; covers ~3 periods demand conservatively). L recent_4 uses observed avg 1.5; sigma recent_5 captures low recent vol. Ensures orders despite bloated pipeline, balancing service (avoid stockouts) vs holding (low vol limits overstock).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): Spring season for long-sleeved jersey top suggests potential demand decline (P9=39 lowest on record, -58% vs P4-8 avg~80); Easter 4/21 upcoming but basic top unlikely to spike significantly. On-hand=0, in-transit=492 but 270 units known lost (P1=105, P3=85, P4=80 per carry-over), effective pipeline~222 (P8=54 expected P10 LT=2; P9=168 pending). Frequent stockouts persist. Observed LTs (P2->4:2, P5->6:1, P6->8:2, P7->8:1) avg=1.5/most recent N=4 same, but sustained losses (3 confirmed, emerging pattern) inflate effective LT. No new demand changepoint (P9 low volatile, not sustained 3+ periods vs prior downshift). Set L explicit=6 to reflect effective longer LT/loss risk, inflating base_stock~648 (default mu_hat=7*83.9\u2248587 + z*sigma_hat\u224861)>492 pipeline, yielding order~129=cap (83.9 + 1.645*27.6\u2248129). Default mu_hat/sigma_hat use full 9-sample history (mean=83.9, sd=27.6) for robust higher cap matching high-q=0.8 service. Forces backend to order aggressively now despite phantom inventory, rebuilding real stock to cover ~1.6 periods demand and reduce future lost sales.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter Monday in spring; long-sleeved jersey top likely seeing seasonal demand decline as weather warms (evidence: sharp drop P9=39, P10=31 vs prior avg ~80). Confirmed changepoint downshift at P9 (regime length=2, but using N=3 per guideline max(min(2,20),3)=3 for recent P8-10 demands 92/39/31 avg=54). All 6 observed LTs (P2->4:2, P5->6:1, P6->8:2, P7->8:1, P8->10:2, P9->10:1) avg=1.5, no new losses (recent orders arrive reliably alternating 1-2). High pipeline (191 on-hand +348 in-transit=539) vs recent ~50/wk demand; lost early shipments (P1/3/4 per carry-over) already flagged. Set L recent_N=6 (shorter LT lowers (1+L)); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=3 reflects low mean/volatility regime, yielding low base_stock ~54*(1+1.5) + z*33*sqrt(2.5) ~135 + ~50=185 << pipeline, triggers order~0 minimizing holding costs.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29): Late spring, long-sleeved jersey top demand in confirmed downshift regime (P9-11 avg 39.3 vs P1-8 avg 89.5, -56%; sustained 3 periods). On-hand 143 + in-transit 348 (270 ghost units from confirmed lost P1:105/P3:85/P4:80 + 78 pending from P10, expected LT=2 arrive during P12). Pipeline bloat causes backend to underorder (base < 491 \u2192 order=0); compensate by explicit L=10 (accounts for loss risk/delays beyond promised 2), mu_hat=520 (11 periods \xd7 ~47 weekly forecast: recent low + buffer), sigma_hat=40 (~sqrt(11)\xd712 weekly vol buffer). Yields base_stock \u2248520 + 0.84\xd740 \u2248554 >491 (enables positive order), cap \u2248520/11 + 1.645\xd740/\u221a11 \u224847 + 20 \u224867 (matches low regime newsvendor level). Observed LT alternating (recent_N=6 avg=1.5, but explicit overrides for loss adjustment). Prevents stockouts post-real pipeline depletion while controlling overstock.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime shift P9+: avg 39.3 vs P1-8 89.5 (-56%), sustained 3 periods; Lead time alternating: LT=2 even periods/LT=1 odd periods (confirmed P2e=2, P5o=1, P6e=2, P7o=1, P8e=2, P9o=1, sustained 6 periods); Pipeline bloat sustained: ~270 lost units (P1 105, P3 85, P4 80)

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6, early May spring): Long-sleeved jersey top demand in low regime since P9 (39,31,48,43; avg 40.25, std ~7.2), sustained 4 periods (-56% vs early avg), consistent with seasonal decline in spring for LS apparel, no major events. On-hand 100 covers 2-3 periods demand. In-transit 411 = confirmed lost 348 (P1:105, P3:85, P4:80, P10:78 overdue past P12 LT=2 even) + effective 63 (P12 order). LT alternating pattern sustained (even place LT=2, odd LT=1; 6 confirms: P2:2,P5:1,P6:2,P7:1,P8:2,P9:1 avg1.5), losses separate from LT. Set L recent_6 (avg1.5), mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_4 (regime length=4, N=4) for low demand scaling: base ~2.5*40 +0.84*sqrt(2.5)*7.2 ~100+10=110 <511 pipe \u2192 order=0, avoids risking more losses/additional ghosts while sufficient coverage (100+63 effective), balances service vs holding amid unreliable supply.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 10 order (78 units) overdue past expected Period 12 (LT=2 even placement), no arrival by Period 12 conclude; total lost now 348 units (P1:105, P3:85, P4:80, P10:78), pipeline bloat sustained at 411 with effective ~63.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13), late spring; long-sleeved jersey top demand declining into sustained low regime since P9 (changepoint evidence: P9+ avg 37.8 vs prior 89.5, now P13=28 lowest but single period). On-hand 72 covers ~2 recent demands (~30-40); in-transit 411 bloated w/ confirmed lost ~348 (P1:105o, P3:85o, P4:80e, P10:78e) + pattern unreliable. LT pattern sustained: even placement (P14) LT=2 (evidenced P2e->P4:2, P6e->P8:2, P8e->P10:2). Reconcile: no new arrives P13, P12 order(63e) arrives during P14 (visible P15). Set L default=2 (matches even pattern, backend promised). mu_hat recent_5 (N=5=max(min(regime_len=5,20),3); (1+2)*37.8~113 lowers base_stock vs all-sample high). sigma_hat recent_5 (low vol ~8.3, sqrt(3)*8.3~14). Lowers ordering to counter pipeline bloat/losses/demand drop, minimizes holding on excess while service via on-hand buffer.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20), late spring; long-sleeved jersey top demand in sustained low regime since P9 (2019/4/8), avg 36.8 over P9-14 (39,31,48,43,28,32; -56% vs P1-8 avg 89), likely seasonal decline into summer. On-hand 103 covers ~3 periods at 37/period; in-transit 348 all lost (P1:105, P3:85, P4:80, P10:78 confirmed overdue, no arrives), true pipeline ~0, effective position 103. Alternating LT pattern sustained (odd placement LT=1, even LT=2; recent confirms incl. P12 even LT=2 at P14). Bloat causes permanent position inflation (>=348), risking stockout post-depletion as backend won't order if base_stock < position. Compensate by inflating effective L to 11 (explicit: accounts for ~50% historical loss rate extending avg LT beyond observed ~1.6); use recent_6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (changelong P9 sustained 6 periods, N=6) yielding mu_hat~(1+11)*36.8=441, sigma_hat~sqrt(12)*8.5~29, base~441+0.84*29~468 >451 position (orders small now), cap~37 aligns low demand; ensures ongoing orders despite ghosts while matching service/holding via z*=0.8.

On-hand=77 covers ~2 periods; in-transit=362 bloated by ~348 confirmed lost shipments (P1:105, P3:85, P4:80, P10:78), effective in-transit~14 (P15 order), effective pipeline~91. Normal params (L=2 default): mu_hat=3*35.3=106, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*8.2=14.2, base_stock~106+0.84*14=118 (order 118-91=27 if correct pipeline). To address bloat/missing shipments, set mu_hat explicit=454 (=106+348 lost) so backend base~454+0.84*14=466 - reported 439=27 order (matches effective); sigma_hat explicit recent regime volatility; L default=2 (promised/even-period pattern).

Period 17 (2019/6/3), early summer; long-sleeved jersey top expects continued low demand (no holidays, seasonal decline). Recent demand P13-16: 28,32,26,25 avg=27.75 std_pd\u22483.1, downshift -31% from P9-12 avg40.25 sustained 4p. Effective position: on-hand52 + true intrans\u224827 (P16 ord27) =79.

Lost=362 sustained (prior348 + P15:14 overdue LT1 past P16); inflate mu_hat by 362 to compensate phantom intrans (base inflated by ~362, order=true_order always as position=true_pos+362). Set L=1 (odd pattern), mu_hat explicit=418 (55.5+362), sigma_hat=10 (conservative >4.4 low vol); base\u2248418+8.4=426.4<441\u2192order=0 now, but future sales reduce position triggering true replenishment.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10, early summer): LS jersey top demand low sustained (P13-17: 28,32,26,25,30 avg=28.2, std~2.9; downshift -31% vs P9-12 confirmed 5+ periods, aligns with summer seasonality reducing LS top need). On-hand=63 (~2 periods buffer), in-transit=348 all confirmed lost (P1:105, P3:85, P4:80, P10:78 per history/carry-over, sum=348), effective pipeline=0, no pending arrivals. Recent LT mixed/broken pattern (P15 odd LT=2 vs prior 1; P16 even LT=1 vs prior 2). IP=411 bloated by lost \u2192 backend underorders unless base_stock >411. Set explicit L=15 to scale recent_5 mu_hat=(16)*28.2~423 + z*sigma~432 >411 (order~21, capped at ~33 single-period 95%=28+1.645*2.9). recent_5 mu/sigma reflect low regime/vol; small order matches reliable recent small shipments (P12/15/16 arrived), avoids large-loss risk, balances service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern update: no new losses since P10, all post-P10 orders arrived reliably (P12:63 LT2, P15:14 LT2, P16:27 LT1); effective pipeline=0 with 348 static lost bloat; LT alternating pattern broken/reversed: P15 odd LT=2 (vs prior 1), P16 even LT=1 (vs prior 2), sustained evidence 2 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/6/17 summer): LS jersey top expects continued low demand (seasonal warmth reduces long-sleeve sales). Demand regime P13-18: [28,32,26,25,30,24] mean=27.5 std=3.08 (sample), -31% vs P9-12 avg40.25, sustained 6 periods (changelist evidence). Pipeline reconciliation: in-transit 381 = 348 static lost (P1:105/P3:85/P4:80/P10:78, never concluded/arrived) + 33 (P18 order, reliable recent LT). Effective intransit=33, position=39+33=72. Covers ~2.6 periods demand. Backend sees inflated position=420, risks zero orders. Compensate by explicit L=2 (promised/conservative, recent avg~1.6 but covers variability/mix 1-2), mu_hat=3*27.5 +348=430.5 (inflates base by lost bloat for effective base~86.6 -72\u2192order~14 matching desired), sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*3.08\u22485.34 (recent vol scaled low). Ensures backend orders to fill effective gap despite bloat, balances service vs holding (low recent vol tightens).

Carry-over insight: Reliable shipments post-P10 confirmed: all placed orders (P12:63 LT2, P15:14 LT2, P16:27 LT1) arrived on schedule, no losses in 8 periods (P11-18), sustained pattern replacing early losses.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24, late June summer onset): LS jersey top demand low regime sustained P13-19 avg 25.7 (N=7, changepoint P13 downshift -31% from P9-12 confirmed), P19=15 suggests possible further drop (-38% from P13-18 avg~27) but single period not sustained; seasonal summer suppression likely for long-sleeve top. On-hand=57, in-transit=363 (348 static lost bloat P1,3,4,10 +15 P19 order), effective IP~72 covers ~3 periods demand@25 but low buffer. Recent LTs avg=1.5 (10 obs: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,1), reliable post-P10 (no losses 10 periods). To counter bloat (backend sees IP=420, targets low base~200s\u2192order=0), inflate mu_hat explicit to 425=(1+1.5)*25.7~64 true +348 lost +13 margin, yielding base_stock~425 + z*8~432>420\u2192order~12 to maintain effective IP~75 (3*25). L=calculate (avg1.5 all obs) reflects true LT<2; sigma_hat=recent_7 (regime N=7) low vol~5.1\u2192sqrt(2.5)*5.1~8.1 tight service on true demand; balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding amid bloat/seasonal low.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01, early summer): long-sleeved jersey top demand low as expected seasonally (winter product). Recent demands P13-20 avg 24 (28,32,26,25,30,24,15,12), changepoint at P13 downshift from P9-12 avg 40.25 (-40%), sustained 8 periods, further softening P19-20 avg 13.5 but not yet sustained 3+ periods. On-hand 45 covers 2+ periods low demand. In-transit 377 includes static ~348 lost (P1:105,P3:85,P4:80,P10:78), effective pipeline ~29 (P19:15 expect LT2 arrive P21; P20:14 expect LT1 arrive P21), no new overdues. Reliable arrivals post-P10 sustained. Observed LTs avg ~1.5 (10 samples: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,1). Set L=calculate for avg LT; recent_N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target low mean/vol over 1+L~2.5 periods (mu~60, sigma~sqrt(2.5)*~7=11), lowers base_stock~70 (z~0.84 for q=4/5=0.8) vs default high early data, balances service vs holding amid bloat/low demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08): Mid-summer, long-sleeved jersey top demand seasonally low (LS unsuitable for summer heat), recent demands P14-21 avg 22.6 (32,26,25,30,24,15,12,17), sustained low regime from P9+ with further downshift P18+ to avg17 (-40% vs P13-17 avg28). On-hand 28 covers 1-2 periods demand; in-transit 377 mostly static lost ~348-362 (early P1,3,4,10,15?), effective pipeline low (~14 from P20 + any unconfirmed). Recent shipments reliable post-P10 (P12 LT2, P15 LT2, P16 LT1, P18 LT1 arrive as expected); P20 order (14u) not in P21= LT>=2 likely LT2 arriving during P22. All observed LTs (10 total: five 1s, five 2s) avg 1.5; use 'calculate' for L to match actual avg vs promised 2, avoiding overstock. Use recent_N=8 (regime length ~9 P13+, capped) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to focus on low demand regime, lowering base_stock vs default (early high-demand skew). Ensures OR orders modestly to cover 1+L~2.5 periods low demand (~55-60), balancing profit vs holding on bloated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand further downshift P18+: avg17 (P18-21:24,15,12,17) vs P13-17 avg28 (-40%), sustained 4 periods; P20 order LT=2 confirmed (even period placement, not arrived by P21 conclude)

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15, mid-summer): long-sleeved jersey top in low-demand season. Recent demand low regime P18+ sustained (P18-22: 24,15,12,17,32; mean=20, despite P22 spike to 32). On-hand=10 low; in-transit=363 bloated by static lost shipments (~363 total, including new confirmed P19 order=15 overdue past LT=2 expected P21, no arrival P20-22; breaks prior reliable post-P10 pattern but single incident). Effective position ~10 (no expected P23 arrivals: P21/22 orders=0). No sustained new changepoints (P22 spike/volatility not yet 3+ periods). Reconcile overdue: P19 lost 15. Params: L explicit=2 (promised, max recent observed LT=covers variability/missing). mu_hat explicit=423 (=bloat 363 + (1+2)*20 recent mean; inflates base_stock ~423 + 0.84*14 \u2248435 > position 373, triggers order ~62 to build effective base ~72 covering 3pd*20 + safety vs spikes like 32). sigma_hat recent_5 (low recent std~8.03 \u2192 sqrt(3)*8.03\u224814 for calibrated safety). Cap ~423/3 + 1.645*14/sqrt(3) \u2248141+13=154 >62. Addresses bloat/losses by offsetting phantom pipeline in base_stock calc, ensures service on low demand while minimizing excess effective holding.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Pipeline=425 includes static lost bloat ~363u (prior 348 + new P19:15 overdue past P21 LT2, no arrive by P23 conclude), effective pipeline=62u (P23 order) covers ~3 periods@20 demand; on-hand=0 but minor stockout P23 (10/20 sold). Recent LTs successful avg~1.6 (last 5: P20=2,P18=1,P15=2,P16=1,P12=2). Use recent_N N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (low recent mean/vol \u2192 low base_stock~72 <<425 \u2192 order~0 avoids overstock/holding); recent_N N=5 for L uses avg observed LTs bridging variability/losses (backend ignores lost). Balances high phantom pipeline by low targets, prioritizing no overorder given coverage.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 19 order (15 units) overdue past expected Period 21 (LT=2), no arrival by Period 23 conclude; total lost now 363 units (+15 to prior 348), pipeline bloat sustained ~363 static lost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29): Late summer, long-sleeved jersey top expects continued low demand (seasonal mismatch). Recent demand P18-24 low regime sustained 7 periods: avg 19.57, std 6.65 (changelpoint P18, N=7). On-hand=0, intransit=425=363 static lost bloat (carry-over P1,P3,P4,P10,P19) +62 effective (P23 order, expected LT=2 arrive during P25). P24 stockout (demand=17, sold=0). To bridge lost bloat unawareness: inflate mu_hat by 363 to make effective base_stock = normal ~68 - effective pipeline 62. Normal: L=2, mu_hat=3*19.57=58.7, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*6.65\u224811.5, z\u22480.84, base\u224868. Inflated mu_hat=422 yields base\u2248422+9.7=431.7 >425, order\u22487 to cover. L default (promised=2, recent avg~1.55 but cap/service uses promised). Sigma recent_7 for low vol regime. Compensates losses: backend orders as-if pipeline=62, base=68.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05, early August summer): long-sleeved jersey top demand remains low in sustained downshift regime (P18-25: demands 24,15,12,17,32,20,17,11; mean=18.1, std=6.9), consistent with seasonal low for LS apparel (no major events). On-hand=0, stockouts P23-25 (48 units lost sales). In-transit=432 bloated by sustained lost shipments (~425 total: prior 363 static + P19:15 + P23:62 overdue past LT=2 expected P25 arrival, confirmed no show in P25 conclude); effective pipeline ~7 (P25 order). Recent LTs mixed 1-2, no new conclusive arrives. Changepoint: low demand regime P18+ sustained 8 periods (avg18.1 vs prior P13-17 avg28 -36%). Set mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=8 to capture low regime/volatility. To address bloat/missing shipments, explicit L=23 inflates base_stock \u2248(24)*18.1 + 0.84*sqrt(24)*6.9 \u2248435 + 29 \u2248464 >432; order \u2248 min(464-432, cap\u224818+1.645*6.9\u224829) =29 units, balancing low demand coverage vs holding (orders cap=recent mean+safety).

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 23 order (62 units) overdue past expected Period 25 (LT=2), no arrival by Period 25 conclude; total lost now 425 units (+62), pipeline bloat sustained ~425 static lost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12, mid-summer): Long-sleeved jersey top demand remains in low regime (P18-26: 24,15,12,17,32,20,17,11,27; mean=19.44, std~7.0), sustained 9 periods post downshift (-40% vs P13-17 avg28), aligns with seasonal summer decline; no major calendar events. Pipeline: intrans=400 (~363 static lost per history/P23 adjustment +37 pending P25:7+P26:30); on-hand=35 covers ~2 periods. P23 order arrived P26 LT=3 (delayed not lost, reduces prior 425 lost estimate to 363). Effective position~72; bloated total position=435 causes backend underorder. Set L=default (promised 2, recent LT avg~1.8-2 matches); mu_hat/sigma_hat explicit inflated to yield base_stock\u2248420 + 0.84*15\u2248433 matching current position for equilibrium (lost 363 + reliable coverage (1+2)*20 + safety~10=70 total~433), forces minimal orders ~demand replacement despite bloat, maintains service (recent stockouts P23-25) vs holding; cap~157 sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern update: P23 order (62 units) arrived P26 LT=3 (delayed not lost), static lost bloat now ~363 units sustained (prior estimates adjusted); recent LT occasionally extends to 3 periods (P23 confirmed).

Pipeline: intransit 393=~363 static lost (per carry-over) + ~30 (P26 order), effective IP~30 (on-hand 0). No new overdue (P26 LT expected 2-3, arrives P28-29).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/8/26): Late August, back-to-school season likely boosting demand for basic jersey tops; recent upshift P26-28 demand avg 45 (27,56,52) vs P18-25 avg 18.5 (+143%), sustained 3 periods after prior downshift. On-hand 0, intrans 468 (~363 static lost per carry-over + recent P26:30 LT>2 overdue? + P28:75). Recent stockouts (P28 d=52 sold=0, P27 partial, P25/24/23 stockouts). To counter phantom bloat blocking orders (backend subtracts full intrans), inflate mu_hat explicitly by lost bloat + recent forecast: 3*45=135 +363=498~500 for (1+default L=2) periods demand. L default (promised 2 aligns recent observed avg~1.8, e.g. last 7 LTs:2,3,2,1,1,2,2). Sigma default for full-history vol/safety (sd~38, sqrt3~66, z~55 buffer). Yields base~500+55=555>468, order~87 (under cap~42+62=104), covers recent ~50/period demand post-bloat, balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand upshift P26+: avg 45 (P26-28:27,56,52) vs P18-25 avg 18.5 (+143%), sustained 3 periods

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02): Early September, back-to-school season onset boosts demand for long-sleeved jersey top (fall transition from summer). Confirmed upshift P26-29 (27,56,52,32; avg 41.75 vs P18-25 avg 18.5, +126%; sustained 4 periods). On-hand 0, in-transit 547 w/ ~363 static lost bloat (effective pipeline low ~184). Recent stockouts (P28:52 sold0, P29:32 sold0). Pipeline reconciliation: P26 order 30 overdue past LT3 (no P29 arr), P28 order75 overdue LT1 (no P29 arr), P29 order79 fresh; emerging delays but not yet sustained loss pattern. LT recent: mixed 1-3, last 5 observations (P25 LT2, P23 LT3, P20 LT2, P18 LT1, P16/P15 LT1/2) avg ~2. Use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture upshift regime (length=4, N=max(min(4,20),3)=4, high recent mean/volatility). recent_N N=5 for L to avg recent LT~2 (covers occasional LT3). Params yield mu_hat~(1+2)*41.75=125.25, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*std_recent~high; boosts base_stock >> effective pipeline for re-stocking despite bloat, high service level (q=4/5=0.8) prioritizes profit via sales over holding amid losses/delays.

Carry-over insight: P26 order (30 units) overdue past LT=3 (no arrival by P29 conclude); P28 order (75 units) overdue past LT=1; emerging delay pattern post reliable period, sustained evidence pending 2 periods

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9): Early fall, long-sleeved jersey top likely seeing demand uptick with cooling weather/back-to-school (P30 demand=80 stockout after 75 arrival). On-hand=0, in-transit=472 bloated by ~425 static lost shipments (per history) + P26:30 overdue/likely lost + P29:79 pending; effective pipeline low (~50). Demand changepoint P26+ sustained 5 periods: avg=49.4 (27,56,52,32,80) vs P18-25 avg=18.5 (+167%), volatile high (P30=80). Recent LTs avg~1.8-2 (last 7 arrived:2,2,3,2,1,1,2), occasional 3 but mostly 2; use default L=2 promised for stability. recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture upshift regime (N=5=regime length), yielding mu_hat=3*49.4~148, high sigma~20*sqrt(3)~35; boosts base_stock to counteract lost bloat/underordering despite nominal high pipeline, targets coverage for rising demand while capping overstock (profit=4/h=1, q=0.8).

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 26 order (30 units) overdue past expected Period 30 (LT=4), no arrival by Period 30 conclude; total static lost bloat now ~393 units (+30 to prior 363); Demand upshift P26+ sustained 5 periods: avg 49.4 (P26-30:27,56,52,32,80) vs P18-25 18.5 (+167%)

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16), early fall/back-to-school season boosting demand for long-sleeved jersey top. Demand upshift P26+ sustained (P26-31: 27,56,52,32,80,152 avg 66.5, +260% vs P18-25 avg18.5), confirmed by peaks P30=80/P31=152. On-hand=0, stockout 152. In-transit=472 bloated by ~393 static lost shipments; effective pipeline ~79 (P29 order=79, overdue LT=2 no P31 arrival, possible LT=3 arriving P32 or lost).

L explicit 3 (evidenced by LT=3 P23, delays/losses effective longer than avg~1.8). mu_hat explicit 600 (4-period forecast avg150/period, anchored on P31=152 peak + seasonal uptrend). sigma_hat recent_N N=6 (P26-31 regime length=6, std~50, sigma_hat~100). Base_stock~600+0.84*100=684>472 bloat, order~212 (within cap~232), overcomes bloat for high service level while limiting excess via cap.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Early fall; long-sleeved jersey top demand spiking seasonally as cooler weather approaches (back-to-school/Fall transition), confirmed by P30-32: 80,152,153 (avg 128, +204% vs P26-29 avg 42), sustained 3 periods, changepoint at P30. On-hand 0 (stockouts P31-32 lost ~305 sales); intransit 678 bloated by ~393 static lost (carry-over P31) + P26:30 lost = ~423, plus pending P29:79 (overdue) + P32:206 future = effective near-term ~285. Recent LTs stable avg 2 (last 5 observed: 2,2,3,2,1). Inflate mu_hat explicit=784 [=3*128 recent demand + ~400 bloat compensation] for L~2; base_stock ~784 + 0.84*~72 (recent_3 sigma) \u2248845 >678 pipeline \u2192 order ~167 (covers future needs despite phantom bloat), capped <~330. L recent_5 (avg2); sigma recent_3 (high vol from spike). Addresses losses by forcing order-up despite bloated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 29 order (79 units) overdue past expected Period 32 (LT=3), no arrival by Period 32 conclude; total static lost bloat now ~472 (+79); Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg increased from 42 (P26-29) to 128 (P30-32, +204%) sustained 3 periods

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): Late September, start of fall season; long-sleeved jersey top demand surges with seasonal relevance (cooler weather). Confirmed changepoint P30: demand avg 227 (P30-33: 80,152,153,522) vs prior P26-29 avg 42 (+440%), sustained 4 periods, evidenced by consecutive high demands/stockouts. On-hand=0, in-transit=846 includes ~472 static lost bloat (latest P29:79); recent orders P32:206 (exp arrive P34 LT=2), P33:168 (exp P35); effective pipeline ~374 to cover high demand. Recent LTs stable avg~2 (last 5 obs: P28 LT2, P25 LT2, P23 LT3, P20 LT2, P18 LT1). Set L recent_5 (N=5) for accurate avg LT~2; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_4 (N=4, regime len=4) to reflect explosive demand/volatility over 1+L~3 periods (mu_hat~680, high sigma), boosting base_stock >> bloated pipeline for aggressive reordering to prevent further massive stockouts (P31-33 lost 152+153+522=827 sales); q=0.8 targets high service amid profit=4/h=1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30 sustained: avg 227 (P30-33:80,152,153,522) vs P26-29 42 (+440%), sustained 4 periods; Static lost bloat sustained ~472 units (P29:79 confirmed lost)

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7), early October fall season onset boosts demand for long-sleeved jersey top (seasonal relevance: cooler weather). Recent demand regime shift P30+ sustained 5 periods (P30-34: 80,152,153,522,192; avg 219.8, +440% vs P26-29 avg42). On-hand=0, stockouts during peaks (P33:522 sold=0, P34:192 sold=0). In-transit=972 includes ~472 static lost bloat (per carry-over), effective ~500 + recent P32:206 (overdue past LT=2, poss LT=3 arriving P35?), P33:168 (exp P35), P34:126 (exp P36). Recent LT observations (last 5: P30/LT2, P27/2, P26/3, P22/2, P19/1; avg=2.0). Use recent_N=5 for L (matches avg promised/drift), mu_hat (3*219.8~659 covers high regime over 1+L), sigma_hat (captures vol ~170 from 522 outlier) to inflate base_stock vs bloated pipeline, enabling orders despite ghosts for high service/profit during stockouts; cap limits overorder risk.

Carry-over insight: P32 order (206 units) overdue past LT=2 (no arrival P34 conclude), potential additional lost or LT=3; evidence pending 1 period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14, Canadian Thanksgiving Monday), fitted long-sleeved jersey top (fall seasonal relevance, potential holiday demand driver aligning with P33 peak 522, P34 192, P35 130). Demand regime shift at P30 sustained 6 periods (P30-35: 80,152,153,522,192,130; avg 205, +440% vs P26-29 avg42). On-hand 76 low vs ~200 demand (will stockout post-decision without arrivals); total pipeline 842 bloated by static lost ~472 (carry-over), effective ~370. Reconcile: expected P36 arrivals possibly P34 LT2 (126u), P33 LT3 (168u, overdue past LT2 like prior P32/P23 cases). No new losses confirmed. L explicit 3 (confirmed recent LT3 P32 arr P35/P23 arr P26; avg recent LT~2 but boosts coverage to 4 periods amid variability/losses, countering bloat by inflating base_stock~(4*205 + 0.84*sqrt4*153)~1076>842 for positive order). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=6 (regime length=6 since P30 changepoint, mean~205/vol high~153 captures sustained high/volatile demand; backend computes (1+3)*mean/std accordingly). Ensures high service level (profit$4 vs hold$1, q=0.8) by targeting coverage beyond bloat, proactive for post-holiday demand uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: P33 order (168u) overdue past LT=2 (no P35 arr), consistent with LT=3 pattern (prior P23/P32 confirmed); static lost bloat sustained ~472u.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21): Late October fall season boosts demand for long-sleeved jersey top (cooler weather, seasonal relevance). High demand regime from P30 sustained 7 periods (P30-36 avg 190.6, +354% vs P26-29 avg 42; evidence: carry-over P30-P34 shifts + spikes like P33=522, P34=192, continued P35=130/P36=105). Pipeline bloated: on-hand 139 + in-transit 845 = 984, but ~472 static lost bloat (carry-over P34), effective position ~512 + pending reliable (P34:126 LT3 expected P37, P36:247). Recent LT=3 confirmed (P32 arr P35 LT3, P33 arr P36 LT3, consistent w/ P23 LT3). Set L=explicit 3 for actual LT. mu_hat=explicit 1234 = 4*190.6 (high regime forecast) +472 lost adjustment, ensuring backend base_stock ~1234 + 0.84*(\u221a4 * std7\u2248150.5\u2248301)\u22481234+253=1487; order\u22481487-984=503 (counters bloat, targets effective base ~1015=4*190.6+~253 safety, cap~1234/4 +1.645*301/2\u2248308+248=556>503). sigma_hat=recent_N N=7 captures regime vol. Balances high service (profit 4x holding) vs costs amid losses/seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: LT=3 pattern strengthened: confirmed P32 LT3 (arr P35), P33 LT3 (arr P36), plus prior P23 LT3 (3 instances recent sustained); P34 order 126 overdue LT2 consistent w/ LT=3 pending confirmation.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Late October, fall/winter ramp-up for long-sleeved jersey top; demand regime shift P30+ sustained 8 periods (P30-37 demands:80,152,153,522,192,130,105,123; mean=182, +440% vs prior); recent demands 100-123 continuing elevated post-peak 522. LT=3 pattern sustained (recent confirms: P33 LT3 arr P36, P32 LT3 arr P35, P23 LT3 arr P26); P34 order 126 overdue past LT=3 (no arr P37 conclude), potential LT=4/lost pending 1p evidence. Pipeline 1349u incl ~472 static lost bloat + overdue P34:126 + P36:247 (exp LT3 P39) + P37:504 (LT3 P40); effective pipeline lower due to bloat, on-hand 16 low vs demand~150. Use recent_N N=3 for L (last arrivals LTs:3,3,2 avg~2.67 bridges to recent LT=3 trend); recent_N N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures sustained high-demand/high-vol regime ((1+L)~4 *182~728 mean, high std from 522 outlier), boosting base_stock to cover (L+1)~4p demand ~728 while z* high service (profit4/hold1=0.8); addresses delays/losses by inflating L/mu vs default, limits overstock via cap.

Carry-over insight: P34 order (126 units) overdue past LT=3 (no arrival P37 conclude), emerging LT>=4 or lost pattern (1 instance pending sustainment); LT=3 pattern sustained 3+ recent instances (P32,33,23 confirmed)

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4): Early November, pre-Thanksgiving/Christmas; LS jersey top demand likely sustained high for winter/holidays. Recent demand P30-38: avg 179 (high regime shift P30+ sustained 9 periods vs pre-P30 lows), but downshift post-P33 522 spike to P34-38 avg 141 (-38%). On-hand 364 covers ~2 periods recent demand; in-transit 845 bloated by static lost ~598 (prior ~472 + P34 126 confirmed lost overdue LT=3 no arr by P38). Effective pipeline lower; recent LTs mixed (P37 LT1 arr P38, prior P32/33 LT3); use recent_N N=6 LTs avg~2.3 to inform longer coverage despite backend unawareness of losses. mu/sigma recent_N=9 for high recent regime/vol (std high ~140) to balance service vs holding with high OH/pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 34 order (126 units) overdue past expected Period 37 (LT=3), no arrival by Period 38 conclude; total static lost bloat now ~598 units (+126); Demand downshift post-P33 spike: avg P34-38=141 vs P30-33=227 (-38%) sustained 5 periods; LT varying 1-3 with recent LT=1 (P37 arr P38) alongside LT=3 instances.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11): Approaching US Thanksgiving (Nov 28, ~P42) and holiday shopping season; long-sleeved jersey top seasonally relevant for cooler weather/holidays, but recent evidence shows sustained demand downshift post-P33 spike (P34-39: 192,130,105,123,156,79; avg 131, std~40; -38% vs P30-33 avg227, sustained 6 periods vs prior 5). High on-hand 532 covers ~4 periods at recent mean (532/131), in-transit 598 reflects static lost bloat (~598u, no recent arrivals expected from lost orders like P34:126); effective pipeline low. Recent LTs varying 1-3 (confirmed: P36 ord LT3 arr P39, P37 LT1 arr P38, P33 LT3 arr P36, P32 LT3 arr P35, P28 LT2 arr P30; last 5 avg 2.4); use recent_5 for L to capture sustained LT=3 bias w/ recent LT=1. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_6 for downshift regime (N=6=max(min(6,20),3), changepoint post-P33 spike evidenced by 6 consistent lower periods); lowers base_stock ~ (1+2.4)*131=444 to minimize ordering/holding on high inventory while covering holiday risk via sigma vol. OR backend q=4/5=0.8 targets high service; params balance by using data-driven recent low mean/vol to curb overstock vs static pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18): Pre-Thanksgiving (11/28), Black Friday (11/29), Christmas ramp-up for long-sleeved winter top; anticipate demand uptick but recent P34-40 avg=126 (192,130,105,123,156,79,96), post-P33 spike downshift sustained (carry-over P34-38=141). On-hand=436 covers ~3-4 periods; in-transit=598 static lost bloat (carry-over ~598, no new losses/arrivals P40), effective pipeline~436. LT pattern sustained LT=3 recent (P36 LT3 arrP39, P33 LT3 arrP36, P32 LT3 arrP35; avg last 4 observed LT=2.5 but frequent LT=3). Set L=explicit 3 for safety (covers varying 1-3). Normal mu_hat=(1+3)*126=504; inflate by lost bloat 598 to 1102 so base_stock ~1102 + 0.84*sigma ~1162, order~1162-1034=128 to target effective base~564 (504 + ~60 safety), balancing service vs holding. Sigma recent_7 for post-changepoint volatility (N=7=max(min(regime len7,20),3)). No calendar-driven changepoint yet (upshift pending evidence).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Pre-Thanksgiving (11/28) and Black Friday (11/29) week; winter long-sleeve top likely sees holiday shopping spike, but recent demand evidence shows sustained downshift post-P33 (P34-41 avg 119, 8 periods). Use recent_N N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to match regime (N=max(min(8,20),3)=8), yielding mu_hat~(1+2.4)*119~290, conservative vs spike risk given high position. LT recent 5 confirms: LT3(P36 arr P39),1(P37 arr P38),3(P33 arr P36),3(P32 arr P35),2(P28 arr P30) avg~2.4; use recent_N N=5 for L. Pipeline: on-hand 362 + intrans 731 (static lost bloat ~598 per carry-over, effective ~133 from P41 order) = ~495 covers 3-5 periods at ~100/wk demand. High service q=0.8 but ample buffer minimizes holding; low order expected as base_stock << pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand downshift at Period 39: avg 141 (P34-38) to 83 (P39-41, -41%) sustained 3 periods

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 date 2019/12/2 early December post-Thanksgiving/Black Friday, Christmas ~3 weeks away; long-sleeved winter top likely sees holiday/winter demand uptick. Recent demands P39-42:79,96,74,310 (avg 139.75, volatile w/ P42 spike +274% vs P39-41 avg83). On-hand 52 low vs potential high demand; in-transit 731 bloated w/ static lost ~598 (carry-over), effective pipeline ~133 (likely P41 order 133 pending LT2-3 arrival during/after P43). No new overdues: P41 order not past LT=3 yet. LT recent confirmed: P39 LT3,P38 LT1,P36 LT3,P35 LT3,P30 LT2 (last5 avg2.4, sustains LT=3 pattern). Demand regime volatile high since P30 changepoint (13 periods, avg~167); use recent_N N=5 L to adjust for recent LT variance/delays; recent_N N=10 mu_hat/sigma_hat (P33-42 avg178.7 high vol) boosts base_stock=(1+L)~4*178.7~715 despite pipeline bloat to cover losses/stockouts & holiday surge, balancing q=0.8 service vs holding; cap prevents excess.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09), pre-Christmas holiday season for long-sleeved winter jersey top; expect potential demand uptick towards Dec 25 gifting/shopping similar to P42 Black Friday spike (310 on 2019-11-25). Recent demands P39-43: 79,96,74,310,49 (avg 122, high vol); P34-43 avg 131. On-hand 136 covers immediate but low vs spikes; in-transit 598 static lost bloat (per carry-over ~598) inflates pipeline, suppressing OR orders. Recent LTs (last 5 observed: P43 LT2 P41, P39 LT3 P36, P38 LT1 P37, P36 LT3 P33, P35 LT3 P32; avg 2.4) indicate sustained variability around 2-3 vs promised 2. Set L recent_5 to use avg~2.4, extending coverage to ~3.4 periods. mu_hat recent_10 (P34-43 avg131 *(1+2.4)~446) captures recent higher regime/vol vs all-history lower mean, boosting base_stock to counter bloat/service high demand. sigma_hat recent_10 uses high recent std~88 for safety margin on spikes. Balances overstock risk (high on-hand) vs stockout on holiday surge/lost pipeline illusion.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16): Pre-Christmas week (Dec 25 approaching), winter LS jersey top likely to see demand spike akin to Black Friday P42:310 and prior peaks (P33:522, P34:192); recent P39-44 demands avg~102 (79,96,74,310,49,58), volatile post-spike drop but holiday ramp-up expected using world knowledge (retail holiday surge for basics). On-hand 78 low, in-transit 598=static lost bloat (per carry-over ~598, recent reliable arrivals P41 LT2 at P43, no new orders P42-44 so effective pipeline~0, position effective 78). LT pattern LT=3 sustained recent (P23/32/33/36 confirmed LT3 instances) + varying 1-2. No overdue new shipments. Parameters: L explicit=3 (true LT vs promised 2); mu_hat explicit=1200 (~150pd holiday-adjusted forecast *4 +598 bloat inflation to offset backend subtraction of lost pipeline, targeting base_stock~1300+ for order~500+ =4pd demand 600 + safety despite bloat); sigma_hat explicit=200 (~sqrt(4)*75 recent std inflated for higher z-safety & cap~300+1.645*200/2~465 allowing needed order vol).

On-hand=23 low, in-transit=1063 bloated w/ ~598 static lost (per P39 insight), effective pipeline ~465 (recent P45 order=465). Recent LTs (last 5 observed: P43 LT2, P39 LT3, P38 LT1, P36 LT3, P35 LT3; avg=2.4) varying 1-3, longer than promised 2; use recent_5 for L to inform backend of drift. Demand recent regime mixed low~55 (P43-45) w/ holiday spikes; recent_10 (P36-45 avg=110.5) captures volatility/spikes best for (1+L)~3.4 period forecast ~375 mean; recent_10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat balances recent downshift (P39+) w/ holiday evidence. High q=0.8 favors service; params boost base_stock to preempt stockout/spike while cap limits overorder. No overdue flags beyond known static lost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas/New Year's Eve, low demand regime sustained P43-46 avg 49 (49,58,55,35) vs P39-42 avg 140 (-65%), confirmed downshift after holiday spike (P42:310 outlier). Winter top (LS jersey) but post-holiday retail slump evident, no immediate Jan uptick visible yet (historical Jan ramp-up starts early Jan). On-hand=0, in-transit=1063 (covers ~22 periods at 49/unit; includes P45:465 expected LT2 arrive during P47 + ~598 static lost bloat per carry-over). Recent LTs (last 10 confirms: P41 LT2, P36 LT3, P37 LT1, P33 LT3, P32 LT3, P28 LT2, P25 LT2, P23 LT3, P20 LT2, P18 LT1; avg 2.2). No new overdues (P45 pending confirmation P48). Parameters: recent_10 L for avg~2.2 bridging variability/LT=3 instances; recent_4 mu_hat/sigma_hat for low regime (mean49, std~10); yields low base_stock ~160-180 << pipeline, triggers order~0 minimizing holding on bloat while covering current low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand downshift at Period 43: avg 49 (P43-46:49,58,55,35) vs 140 (P39-42:79,96,74,310) (-65%) sustained 4 periods
