No concluded arrivals yet, so cannot confirm actual LT; assume promised LT=2. No evidence of lost shipments (too early). In-transit 85 = 37+48, as expected. Step 2: Inventory & pipeline - On-hand=0 entering Period 3 decision. Post-decision: expect +37 arrival (P1 order), then satisfy P3 demand (recent avg ~60). Pipeline total 85 covers expected P3(37)+P4(48) arrivals. Ending inventory from prior periods=0 due to stockouts. Step 3: Demand analysis - Historical (pre-P1): avg ~19 (36,21,10,12,16). Recent: P1=46 (+140% vs hist), P2=73 (+280%). Emerging surge, possibly spring ramp-up for T-shirts (Feb 25, 2019 - late winter/early spring transition; basic jersey V-neck suitable for warming weather). No major holidays (Valentine's passed). Weighted recent demand dominates: avg ~30-60 range plausible. All-history avg ~31 ((95 hist +46+73)/7). Step 4: OR review - Recommends 41, based on historical mean ~19, LT=2 (mu_hat~57 + safety), capped. Underestimates recent surge (ignores P1/P2 demands). Pipeline=85, implies OR base_stock~126 (3*42 avg?). Step 5: Strategy - Override OR upward to 60: targets recent demand mean ~60 for P5 coverage (P3 order arrives P5). Ensures pipeline builds to ~145 post-order (85+60), covering 3 periods ~180 demand at 60 avg. Conservative vs pure recent (73), but accounts for possible mean reversion.
