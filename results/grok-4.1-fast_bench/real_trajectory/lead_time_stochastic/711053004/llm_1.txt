Late Sep 2019 (9/30), post-summer decline into fall; T-shirts face seasonal drop in cooler weather transitioning to layers/hoodies; no major events (Halloween Oct 31 not strong T-shirt driver); aligns with carry-over early fall decline (P27+ avg ~68-74). (b) Demand regime: Fall stabilization ~74 avg P28-P32 sustained, recent P30-P33 (62,107,76,81) avg 81.5 shows volatility (107 spike) but no confirmed sustained shift upward (holds ~70-80 range, consistent with seasonal softening post-summer peak). (c) Lead time: Observed 1-3 periods (recent LT3 e.g. P27 arr P30, P23 arr P26); no new losses confirmed (in-transit down to 1700 via late arrivals, per P33 insight); promised LT2 but plan for LT3 buffer; no overdue flags beyond known patterns. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 922 + in-transit 1700 = 2622 units; recent demand ~80/period covers >30 periods (far exceeds remaining ~13 periods to 47); no stockouts recent, high holding risk ($1/unit/period). (e) Final order logic: Order 0 to draw down excess inventory, minimize holding costs while pipeline covers forecast (70-80/period \xd7 LT3+1=4 periods = ~320 needed, vs 2622 available); replenish only if demand surges confirmed.",

  "rationale": "(a) Product: Long T-shirt (short sleeves, cotton jersey basics). Date 2019/12/23 (pre-Christmas week). World/calendar: Late December winter in northern hemisphere; short-sleeve T-shirts face suppressed demand due to cold weather/holiday gifting (not basics-focused). Matches historical winter lows (P40-P45 avg~19). No seasonal spike expected (unlike summer highs).\n(b) Demand regime: Winter lows sustained P40-P45 (15,32,27,12,12,20; avg 19.7, -45% vs prior fall). Stable low post-spring/summer peaks; no evidence of holiday uptick in T-shirt category.\n(c) Lead-time/missing: Severe stall confirmed - no arrivals P33-P45 (13 periods), 1700u static (carry-over). Delivered orders historically LT1-3; current pipeline fully stalled/lost, new orders face same risk.\n(d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 567 (covers 28+ periods at avg20 demand). In-transit 1700u stalled (high holding cost exposure). No expected near-term arrivals.\n(e) Order logic: Order 0 to minimize holding costs on excess inventory amid low demand/stall risk. Replenish only if arrivals resume + demand rises.",
  "carry_over_insight": "In-transit stall extended to 13 periods no arrivals (P33-P45), 1700u static confirming persistent severe delay/loss over 13+ recent periods; Winter demand lows further confirmed P42-P45 avg 18 (-15% vs P40-P43 21.5), sustained over 4 periods into late Dec.",
