(b) Demand regime: Early stable at ~125 (first 4 wks), Feb4 jump to 161 (+42% vs prior avg); forecast Period1 (Feb11) ~140-160, assuming continuation. No sustained shift yet (only 1 high data pt). (c) Lead time: No history; promised 2 periods. No orders to infer actual LT or losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0, in-transit 0. Period1 demand unmet (sales=0). No arrivals expected in P1/P2; P1 order arrives P3 (if LT=2), visible P4. (e) Order logic: Initial order to cover (LT+1)=3 periods demand + safety for var/spike: 140*3=420 +80 safety=500. Low holding ($1) vs high profit ($19), favors stocking ahead for 47 periods; conservative start avoids early overstock.",

Peak holiday shopping season: 2019-11-25 (Mon) is week of Thanksgiving (Thu 11/28) & Black Friday (Fri 11/29), Cyber Monday (12/2 P43). Massive apparel demand surge expected (Black Friday #1 retail day, clothing hot category). (b) Demand regime: Pre-Thanksgiving ramp confirmed P37-P40 avg184 (spikes 233/234), P41 dip103 (-44% but single-period noise); recent P37-P41 avg168 (+volatility), forecast P42 200-250+ (BF spike resumption >230 likely, sustained holiday high). (c) Lead-time/missing: LT variability 1-3 sustained (recent ex: P39 LT2 P41, P36 LT3 P39); lost pattern ~50% (P34 250 overdue/lost, recent 6/12); in-transit2650 incl phantoms/lost (prior780+). P40 order200 exp LT2 arrive P42 (probable), P38 200 overdue LT4? P42 poss, P41 250 LT2 P43. (d) Inv&pipeline: On-hand147 (risk stockout P42 if demand>147, covers ~1p at base100); in-transit2650 massive but ~50% lost risk =effective ~1300+ arrivals pending LT1-3 (covers 6-10p demand). (e) Final order logic: BF/Thanksgiving spike priority (lost sales hurt $19P/unit); order 250 (recent successful size, ~1.5p forecast + LT buffer -onhand +25% loss safety) to bolster pipeline despite high in-transit, minimize end-game overhold.",
