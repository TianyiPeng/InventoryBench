No new arrivals or concludes for P32 yet; promised LT=2, but actual varies and losses common - treat pipeline skeptically. Step 2: Inventory & pipeline - On-hand=30 (covers ~2-3 periods at recent ~12 demand); in-transit=1780 is anomalously high (possibly inflated by unconfirmed old orders or sim artifact, but even partially reliable it's excessive vs low demand). Recent ending inventories low, no stockouts recently due to low demand. Step 3: Demand analysis - Deep downshift sustained: P27-P31 demands [38,20,13,11,13] avg=19 (consistent with carry-over P26-P30 avg21, -36% vs prior; further -40-50% vs peak P7-P12 ~318). Product is basic women's T-shirt; date 2019/9/16 (mid-Sept, post-summer, back-to-school but basics not spiking); no seasonal uplift expected. Historical pre-game avg~100 irrelevant now.

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised L=2; recent confirmed LT=3 for P33@P36 and P23@P26; no new concludes in P46 showing arrivals, consistent with sparse ordering. No new losses confirmed in P46 (P44/P45 orders were 0). Pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=1780 units (massive buffer, enough for ~1000+ periods at current ~1-2 demand rate; past losses noted but current pipeline appears intact). Demand analysis: Sustained suppression P37-P46: demands 5,5,4,3,2,4,0,3,1,1 (avg ~2.5, down from P30-P36 avg ~6); zero at P43, near-zero recent despite Christmas (P45 2019/12/16, P46 12/23). Post-Christmas P47 (2019/12/30) for basic women's T-shirt: no rebound expected, possible further New Year lull in everyday basics. OR rec=0 uses historical mean (low now) and promised L=2. Strategy: Follow OR at 0 - no need to order with 1780 in-transit covering decades of demand; avoids adding to potential losses/holding. Covers (L+1)=3 periods demand (~3-6 units) easily from pipeline.",
