{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2 confirmed recently (e.g., P41 order arr P43 LT=2; P43 order arr P45 LT=2), but losses persist (P44 order 120 expected P46 LT=2 but P46 conclude arrived=0, confirming lost after 1+ period overdue). No new LT shifts; in-transit 1405 includes accumulated losses (prior ~625 + recent like P44=120, P33/P36 LT=3 arrived but pattern mixed). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 post-P46 stockout (demand=155 > ending 56); effective pipeline low despite 1405 nominal (high loss rate ~ recent 4/7 orders lost per history), no arrivals expected imminently in P47 (P45 ordered=0; P44 lost; P46 order expected P48). Demand analysis: Winter leggings relevant (cold Dec weather, everyday basics); holiday spikes sustained P42 Black Friday=208 (+200% vs prior ~60), P45 pre-Christmas=181 (+170%), P46 Christmas Eve=155 (+150%), now 3 events late Nov-Dec; P47 Dec30 post-Christmas/New Year's Eve likely elevated ~120-150 (winter sustained, potential NYE bump) vs historical ~103 or summer lows ~60. OR recommends 0 (base-stock capped by high nominal pipeline 1405 >> \u03bc\u0302~309 for L=2, ignores losses/demand spikes/seasonality). Strategy: Override to 150 covering ~1-1.5 periods elevated demand + safety buffer given LT=2 unreliability/losses; avoids stockout (recent pattern) while minimizing holding risk if rare arrivals occur.",
