{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2 confirmed recently (P43 order arrived P45 LT=2); variability persists (prior LT=1/3 observed), but pipeline heavily inflated at 852 units with historical stagnation (no arrivals P37-44, confirming stuck/lost bulk); recent P45 arrival (120u from P43) shows some deliveries possible, but can't rely on in-transit for forecasting due to prolonged non-arrivals.

Demand analysis: Winter low sustained P36-45 avg=35 declining to recent P40-45 avg=22 (-37% vs fall), aligns with cold weather reducing sneaker socks usage; P46 (12/23 Christmas week) shows no spike (prior P44=18, P45=20 low vs expected holiday lift), as sneaker socks are casual/hidden not gift items. OR recommendation: 0 units, appropriate given all-history mean but recent lows pull base-stock low, high on-hand, and promised LT assumptions; OR overlooks stagnation/losses but result aligns. Strategy: Follow OR 0 - no order needed; 100 on-hand buffers low demand + potential near-term arrivals (e.g., P44=100 LT=2 arrive P46 after decision); minimize holding while avoiding stockouts; monitor post-Christmas P47 for any rebound.",
