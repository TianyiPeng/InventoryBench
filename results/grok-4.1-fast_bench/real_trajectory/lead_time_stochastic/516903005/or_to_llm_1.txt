{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but historical variability 1-3 confirmed (e.g., P45: P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2; P46: arrived=0, no new arrivals). Chronic losses persist with in-transit 1128u probable lost (unchanged from prior, matching patterns of non-arrivals despite overdue orders; partial delivery ~52% historically). Inventory analysis: On-hand 1275u (post P46: started 1420, demand=145, ended 1275), ample for 8-10+ periods even at peak 150 demand (1275/150\u22488.5), or 20+ periods if post-holiday drop to slump levels (~40 avg). Pipeline unreliable due to losses - do not count 1128u meaningfully. Demand analysis: Knitwear sweater in late Dec (P47 2019/12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's week) - holiday peak confirmed P45-P46 avg 150.5 (156+145, +307% vs P41-P44 slump avg37), but post-Christmas expect sharp drop (historical post-BF dip, end-of-holiday returns/shopping fatigue; winter demand stabilizes lower). OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and full history (ignores regime shifts/losses), but aligns perfectly with massive on-hand buffer vs. expected post-peak decline.
