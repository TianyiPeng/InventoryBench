Versatile fashion item; Dec 16 2019 is pre-Christmas (Dec 25), peak holiday shopping with potential demand spike for apparel/gifts, but recent demands low (no confirmed spike yet). Historical pre-game Jan-Feb avg~65; game start high but long downshift to ~40. (b) Demand regime: Recent P41-44: 33/60/40/32 (avg41), stable continuation of P38-40 downshift avg36 (-42% prior); P42:60 possible holiday signal but not sustained (subsequent 40/32 revert low) - no new regime shift. Forecast: Low base ~40-50, possible Christmas uptick to 80-120 next 2 periods (P45-47), then end. (c) Lead time: Confirmed variable (1-3 periods), recent P41 order arrived P43 (LT=2); sustained loss pattern (e.g., P34 overdue 5p, others); in-transit 2150 bloated w/ghosts - treat as unreliable, expect sporadic arrivals. No new losses confirmed overdue beyond carry-over. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 553 (high, covers 10+ periods at ~50 demand); in-transit 2150 unreliable ghosts; no recent arrivals P44; ending inv P44=553 incurs holding. Near end (P45/47), prioritize avoiding excess holding over pipeline fill. (e) Order logic: High on-hand covers forecast even w/holiday spike (553 > 3*120); unreliable pipeline + loss risk + endgame = order 0 to minimize holding costs ($1/u/p) vs profit $19; monitor P46 for actual holiday demand.",
