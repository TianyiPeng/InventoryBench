Inventory reconciliation: On-hand 1003 (built from recent arrivals of 800u in P45, post-233 demand); total visible pipeline + on-hand ~2950u covers 10+ periods even at peak 250/demand, despite ghosts reducing effective arrivals. Demand analysis: P46 date 2019/12/23 is Christmas week peak for hoodies (winter garment, holiday gifting/cold weather); recent P45=233 (+159% vs P44=90), P42=148, aligns with pre-Christmas surge extension from carry-over P40-P42 avg116; expect P46 demand ~250-350 but volatile post-peak crash likely P47+. OR recommendation: 0 units, appropriately reflects high inventory vs its historical mean (ignores seasonality/shifts); no override needed as coverage ample (1003 on-hand alone ~4 periods), holding cost $1 low but post-holiday excess risky. Final strategy: Follow OR 0 to avoid overstock ahead of expected demand drop.",

{
  "rationale": "Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas period for winter hoodie \u2013 expect demand decline after holiday peak (P45=233, P46=214 highs aligning with pre-Christmas surge noted in carry-over P43 insight). Current inventory: OH=789 (enough for ~4 periods at 200 demand), in-transit=1947 (massive ghost pipeline per carry-over, e.g., P38 order overdue, total ghosts ~2000u historically). Recent LT variable (2-3 periods observed in P45: P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2; P46 arrived=0, no new arrivals or LT confirms). Promised LT=2, but losses persist (no P46 arrivals for recent orders). Historical demand post-winter peaks drops (early 2019 P1-P6 avg~80). OR recommends 0 (base-stock met by pipeline despite using promised LT/historical data only, ignores ghosts but correctly signals overstock). Strategy: Follow OR 0 \u2013 no order needed, excess covers 10+ periods even at peak 200+ demand; prioritize avoiding holding costs ($1/u/period on 789+arrivals). No regime shift yet (post-holiday decline not sustained 3+ periods).",
