Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11), first period for womens fine-knit trainer socks. No prior conclude messages, on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demands: 28,38,34,44,41 (mean~37, steady winter sock demand, no seasonal spikes evident near Valentine's). No lead time observations yet. Use defaults: L=promised 2 (covers 3 periods demand), mu_hat=(1+2)*37=111, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*~6.2~10.8. Ensures base stock covers expected demand with safety stock for q=19/(19+1)=0.95 service level, minimizing holding while avoiding stockouts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18): Women's socks, mid-February post-Valentine's (minor potential uplift, but demand stable). Period 1 demand=43 aligns with recent historical (34,44,41,43; avg~40.5). No concluded arrivals yet (normal for L=2; P1 order=48 in-transit, expected during P3). On-hand=0, so order to cover ~3 periods demand (current + L=2). No changepoints or lead time observations; defaults use full historical mean~37 (mu_hat=3*37=111), std~6.2 (sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*6.2~10.7), yielding high service level q=19/20=0.95 for profit max vs holding.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), late February, winter season for socks with potentially steady demand but recent game demands show increase: P1 (2/11):43, P2 (2/18):66 vs historical avg 37. Including last historical (2/4):41, recent 3 demands:41,43,66 (avg=50, +35% vs prior; std~13.9 vs hist~6). Chgpoint evidence: sustained higher mean/vol over last 3 periods. No arrivals observed yet (expected: P1 order during P3, visible P4 conclude; P2 during P4). In-transit=97 covers ~2 periods at recent avg. L=default (no observed LTs). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_3 to adjust OR for higher recent demand/vol over 1+L~3 periods (mu~150), balancing service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding; base_stock ~ mu +1.645 sigma covers spikes, order=min(base-pipeline=97,cap) builds safety stock proactively.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift recent 3 periods: avg 50 vs historical 37 (+35%), higher volatility std~14 vs ~6

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, women's fine-knit trainer socks. No major calendar events imminent; winter-seasonal demand possible but recent history drives forecast. Demands: P1=43, P2=66, P3=57 (avg 55 vs historical ~37, +48%; std ~9.5 vs ~6), confirming carry-over regime shift to higher mean/volatility (sustained 3 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=170 (P1:48 + P2:49 + P3:73). No arrivals yet; P1 order overdue (promised LT=2 \u2192 arrive P3, but P3 arrived=0). No confirmed lead times observed. Use default L=2 (promised, conservative absent confirmed shifts). recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on new regime (N=3=max regime length, 3+ samples). Raises \u03bc\u0302~(1+2)*55=165, \u03c3\u0302~sqrt(3)*9.5~16.5; base_stock ~165 + 1.645*16.5 ~192 (q=19/20=0.95). With pipeline=170, modest order to cover (L+1)=3 periods demand, prioritizing service recovery from stockouts while minimizing excess holding on 170 pipeline.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): Early March, no major holidays; socks demand steady but recent regime shift sustained (P1-P4 demands: 43,66,57,44; avg 52.5 vs hist ~37; std ~11 vs ~6). Pipeline=156 covers ~3 periods demand; on-hand=5 low but incoming expected (P3:73 in P5 LT=2). Observed LTs: only P2->P4 (2 periods). P1 order (48) overdue (expected P3, absent P3/P4); possible LT drift/lost, but not confirmed (no conclude). Use 'calculate' L=avg observed LT=2. 'recent_N' N=4 (regime length=4 periods, all >hist mean) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to elevate base_stock ~52.5*(1+2)=157.5 mean + higher safety for vol/service amid low on-hand/overdue risk; balances profit vs holding given high pipeline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): Women's fine-knit trainer socks. Late winter/early spring, no immediate holidays (Easter ~4/21); steady demand expected. On-hand=0, in-transit=184 includes likely lost P1 order=48 (expected arrive P3, no show through P5) and P3=73 (expected P5, absent), total ~121 lost; effective pipeline ~63 (P4=30 arriving P6, P5=33 for P7). Recent demand P1-P5: avg=50.6 (vs historical 37), std=10.5 (higher vol). L=default (sole observed LT=2 from P2\u2192P4). mu_hat=explicit 152=(1+2)*50.6 recent mean, reflects regime shift. sigma_hat=explicit 24\u2248\u221a3*14 (carry-over vol). Base_stock\u2248152+1.645*24\u2248191>184 pipe \u2192 orders ~7 (capped ~73), counters phantom in-transit from losses to resume stocking and avoid lost sales (high profit=19 vs h=1), balances service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments pattern: P1 order=48 overdue 3 periods past promised LT=2 (no arrival in P3-P5 concludes); P3 order=73 overdue 1 period past (no P5 arrival); total 121 units inflating in-transit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Late March, early spring; women's fine-knit trainer socks - steady demand category, no immediate holidays (Easter 4/21), but recent demands elevated (last 6: 43,66,57,44,43,73; mean 54.3 vs hist 37 +46%; std 13.8 vs hist 6.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=159 inflated by lost/delayed: P1=48 (due P3, overdue 4+), P3=73 (due P5, overdue 2+), P4=30 (due P6, overdue 1+), total ~151 lost + P6=8=159; effective reliable pipeline near 0. Demand regime shift sustained (high mean/vol from P2+). Set L explicit=3 to buffer delays/losses (effective coverage >promised 2); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=6 to capture ongoing high-demand/high-vol regime. Boosts base_stock target [(1+3)*54.3 \u2248217 + z*sqrt(4)*13.8 \u2248217 + 0.84*27.6\u2248240] >> inflated pipeline=159, prompting ~80 unit order to rebuild vs holding cost/service risk; cap also scales up safely.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments pattern sustained & expanded: P4 order=30 overdue past P6 conclude (promised LT=2 arrival); total stuck in-transit ~151 units (P1=48, P3=73, P4=30) inflating pipeline by 95%

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1, early April approaching Easter 4/21 which may boost spring apparel/socks demand). Demands P5-P7:43/73/98 avg71.3 (vs game avg60.6 +18%, vs initial37 +93%), std=27.5 (vs initial~6, confirms carryover high vol). On-hand=0; pipeline=235 inflated ~65% by sustained lost shipments (carryover: P1=48, P3=73, P4=30 total151 stuck indefinitely); effective pipeline~84 (P6=8 expected P8, P7=76 expected P9). Observed LTs:2 (P2\u2192P4),1 (P5\u2192P6) avg1.5. To force OR order=cap despite inflated pipeline (base >> pipeline+cap), explicit L=3 (up from avg1.5 to buffer LT variability/losses, extends horizon); recent_N N=3 mu_hat/sigma_hat (recent regime changepoint P6+ high mean/vol sustained 3 periods P5-P7 evidence: post-dip spike 73/98 >> prior).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8, early April pre-Easter). High demand regime sustained P6-P8: 73/98/72 avg=81 (+60% vs P1-P5 avg=51), volatility sample std=(sqrt(((-8)^2+(17)^2+(-9)^2)/2))~14.7 vs historical ~6. On-hand=12 low (likely stockout on ~80 demand), in-transit=268 inflated by 151 lost units (P1:48 overdue 6+ per, P3:73 overdue 4+, P4:30 overdue 3+ past LT=2; confirmed no arrivals in due concludes), real pipeline ~117 (P8 order). Sustained losses indicate unreliable supply, effective LT longer than observed avg~1.5; set L=explicit 3 to boost base_stock against fake pipeline inflation. mu_hat recent_3: high demand (1+3)*81=324. sigma_hat recent_3: high vol sqrt(4)*14.7~29. Orders ~100 (base~324+1.65*29~350 -268=82, near cap~100), replenishes real pipeline, balances high service vs holding.

On-hand 0, in-transit 361 inflated by confirmed lost shipments 151 (P1=48 overdue 7+pd, P3=73 overdue 5+pd, P4=30 overdue 4+pd); real pipeline ~210 (P8=117 exp P10 LT2, P9=93 exp P11). Observed LTs: 4 cases avg 1.5 (2,1,2,1) but use default L=2 conservative for coverage. Normal base ~234 mu +38 safety=272 <361 would order 0 (stockout risk).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22, post-Easter Apr21), womens socks/tights - steady spring demand possible but data shows sustained high regime since changepoint P6 (carry-over confirmed avg81 P6-P8 vs prior51 +59%, std~15vs6; P9-P10 69/78 continue avg78 last5 P6-10). On-hand 132 covers ~1.5 periods recent demand~78; IP=351 (132+219it) but lost shipments sustained 151 units (P1:48, P3:73, P4:30 - no concludes past due dates, inflating IP 43%). Effective IP~200 (reliable it=68 from P10). Target actual position 3*78=234 + z\u03c3 buffer~33=267 for LT=2 coverage. Explicit mu_hat=385=(3*78 +151 lost) yields backend base_stock~385 +1.645*sqrt(3)*11.6(recent sd)~385+33=418 >351, orders ~67 to target reported 418 (actual~267). L default=2 (promised, conservative vs recent LTs avg1.5/6 obs); sigma recent_N N=5 (regime length=5 since P6 changepoint, N=max(min(5,20),3)=5). Addresses lost by inflating mu_hat to offset permanent IP overstatement.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29, late April spring post-Easter Apr21), basic women's trainer socks; no major upcoming events but demand in sustained high regime since P6 changepoint (P6-P11 avg 84.3 vs P1-P5 50.6 +67%, evidence 6 consistent high periods 69-116). On-hand 16 vs recent demand 116 likely stockout. Pipeline 287 = 151 permanent lost (P1=48, P3=73, P4=30 never concluded, overdue >5 periods past promised LT2) + P10=68 (no P11 arr, likely LT2 due P12) + P11=68; lost inflate pipeline 53%, backend unaware chronically underorders. L explicit=4 adds ~2 period buffer equiv to lost, yielding (1+4)*84.3~422 mu_hat + z~1.65*sqrt5*18.7~69 sigma contrib = base~490; pipeline~303 \u2192 order min(490-303=187, cap~115)=115 to rebuild. Mu/sigma recent_N N=6 uses regime (P6-P11 demands:73,98,72,69,78,116 avg84.3 std18.7), overrides low historical mean~40-50.

Carry-over insight: Demand high regime sustained P6-P11 avg84.3 vs P1-P5 50.6 (+67%), std18.7 vs early~10; Recent successful LT avg1.5 over last 6 (sequence:2,1,2,1,2,1 alternating)

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6, early May - no major sock demand seasonality expected). Demand high regime sustained since P6 changepoint (P6-P12: 7 periods, avg=86.9 vs P1-P5 avg=50.6 +72%; std~17 vs early~10). On-hand=0, in-transit=403 inflated by lost shipments (confirmed prolonged: P1=48, P3=73, P4=30=151; recent overdue pattern suggests P10=68, P11=68 also lost=287 total lost est., reliable ~P12=116 only). Recent LT successful avg=1.5 (last 6 obs: 2,1,2,1,2,1 - alternating, no longer LT evidence). Normal mu_hat=(1+1.5)*86.9=217. To bridge inflated pipeline gap (backend subtracts fake 287), explicit mu_hat=217+287=504 (offsets lost, targets effective position ~217 + z*sigma safety ~262 covering ~3 periods). L recent_6 preserves avg LT pattern for backend scaling/caps. Sigma recent_7 captures sustained high vol regime (N=max(min(7,20),3)=7). Ensures higher base_stock>403 despite losses, aggressive order to prevent stockouts (recent P7/9/12), balances service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13, mid-May spring; socks demand steady post-winter, no major events like Mother's Day spike evident). On-hand low at 7; in-transit 489 massively inflated by sustained lost shipments (confirmed P1=48, P3=73, P4=30, P10=68 overdue past P12 no-arrival; total stuck >219 units, ~45%+ pipeline inflation). Recent demand regime P6-P13 sustained high avg 83.6 (669/8, +65% vs P1-P5 avg50.6), std~20 despite P13=61 dip (not sustained changepoint). Recent successful LTs avg1.5 (last 6: 2,2,1,2,1,1 from P13/P10/P8/P6 arrives). Reconciled: expected P14 arrival P12=116 (if LT2), but lost pattern risks non-arrival; low on-hand risks stockout vs ~80-100 demand. Parameters use recent_N to reflect high-demand/high-vol regime and shorter avg LT: lowers L~1.5 for accurate base_stock timing, raises mu_hat~(1+1.5)*83.6~209 & sigma_hat~sqrt(2.5)*20~32 vs default (1+2)*37~111 low; boosts base > inflated pipeline/cap to drive orders, balancing high q=19/20 service vs hold cost amid losses.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments expanded: P10 order=68 overdue 2+ periods past promised LT=2 (no P12/P13 arrival); total stuck >219 units (prior 151 +68), inflating pipeline >45%

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20): Late spring, fine-knit trainer socks; no major calendar events imminent (Memorial Day 5/27 unlikely driver for socks). On-hand 49 low vs recent demand ~80-100; pipeline 373 + on-hand 49 =422 overstated by sustained lost shipments 219 units (P1=48, P3=73, P4=30, P10=68 overdue >> promised LT=2), real pipeline ~203. Recent demand P10-P14: mean 86.2 (high regime P6+ sustained avg~83), std 22.3. Recent 6 LTs (P6:2, P7:1, P8:2, P9:1, P11:2, P12:2) avg 1.67.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, Memorial Day - potential retail bump but socks demand steady high). On-hand=0, in-transit=466 inflated by ~373 lost units (P1:48 overdue>>2, P3:73 overdue>>2, P4:30 overdue>>2, P10:68 overdue 4p past P12, P13:154 overdue 1p past P15); real pipeline~93 (P15 ord93). High demand regime sustained P6-P15 avg=81.9 (vs early~37), std~20 high vol. Recent LTs (8 obs): 2,2,1,2,2,1,2,1 avg=1.625 sustained alternating. Compensate fake pipeline: normal mu_hat~(1+1.625)*81.9\u2248215, boost by 373 lost\u2192explicit 588. Base~588 + z*~32\u2248640>466\u2192order~174 (equiv to normal 215+52-93=174). Sigma recent_10 captures vol. L recent_8 for accurate LT. Ensures coverage despite losses, high service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments total confirmed 373 units (P1=48, P3=73, P4=30, P10=68 overdue 4p, P13=154 overdue 1p); inflating in-transit 466 by 80% vs real pipeline 93.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03, early summer): socks demand high regime sustained P6-P16 (11 periods, mean=83.7, std~18 vs early ~50/10); no seasonal drop evident despite summer (P13 dip=61 rebounded to 102). On-hand=0, stockout P16 demand=102. In-transit=638 inflated by confirmed lost=373 (P1=48,P3=73,P4=30,P10=68,P13=154), real pipeline=265 (P15=93+P16=172). Observed LT sequence:2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2 (8 vals, avg=1.625); recent last 3=2,2,2 conservative L=2 explicit for coverage amid losses. mu_hat explicit=624=(1+2)*83.7 recent mean +373 lost adjustment, so base_stock ~624 + z*32 ~675 targets normal coverage over real pipeline (normal ~302-265~37 order). sigma_hat recent_11 for high vol regime (chgpnt P6, length=11, N=11). Addresses losses by inflating target to offset ghost pipeline, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Recent LT shift to 2 periods sustained: last 3 observed LT=2 (P11@P13,P12@P14); P15 order LT>=2 confirmed (no P16 arrival).

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand P6-P18 (13 periods post-changepoint at P6, avg~82 vs early ~50, +64%; evidence: carry-over P9/P12 confirmations, std~18 vs early~10). On-hand 123 sufficient short-term; in-transit 483 inflated ~75-80% by confirmed lost shipments ~373 units (P1=48, P3=73, P4=30, P10=68, P13=154 overdue >3p past LT=2, no P15-P18 arrivals; carry-over P16). Real pipeline ~110. Expect P17 order=37 arrive P19 (LT=2). Lost inflate pipeline \u2192 backend under-orders; counter with high mu_hat/sigma_hat from recent regime (higher base_stock despite fake pipeline) + recent LT avg~1.75 (last 4 obs: P11/P12/P15 LT=2, P16 LT=1). Ensures coverage for (1+L)~2.75 periods demand ~225 while capping overstock risk.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments sustained: P13=154 confirmed lost (no arrival P15-P18, overdue 3+ periods past promised LT=2); total lost ~373 units inflating in-transit 483 by ~77% vs real pipeline ~110.

Period 20 (2019/6/24, late June summer Monday; fine-knit trainer socks - demand sustained high in warmer months). On-hand=110, in-transit=410 (entirely ghosts from lost shipments totaling 410: P1=48, P3=73, P4=30, P10=68, P13=154, P17=37), real pipeline=0, real IP=110 (~1.3 periods at 82/unit demand - stockout risk). No real arrivals expected P20 (recent orders accounted for or lost). Demand regime shift P6 sustained P6-P19 (14p): avg82.1 (+64% vs P1-P5 50.6), sample std~16.2 (high vol). Recent LT successful last 6 obs avg1.5. Ghost IP inflates observed IP=520 >> real110; backend under-orders unless base_stock S_obs >>520. Target real S_real~(1+2)*82.1 +1.645*sqrt(3)*16.2 \u2248246+47=293 (high service q=0.95). Compensate: S_obs=293+410=703; with sigma_hat_real~28.6 (z\u03c3=47), set explicit mu_hat=656. L=default (promised=2) for scaling sigma/cap; sigma recent_14 (high vol regime N=14=max(min(14,20),3)); cap~656/3 +47/sqrt3 \u2248219+27=246 > planned order~183. Ensures backend orders ~183 to target real IP=110+183=293 covering ~3.5p demand + safety, balancing profit/holding despite ghosts.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments expanded: P17=37 confirmed lost (no P18 arrival for LT=1, no P19 for LT=2, overdue 2p past promised); total 410 units (+37 to prior 373), inflating in-transit 410 by 100% vs real pipeline 0.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1, early summer Monday; Canada Day minor impact, socks demand potentially softening seasonally but no sustained drop evidence: P18-20 demands 66/86/69 avg~74 vs P6-P17 high regime avg~82 (-9% but volatile, not significant changepoint). On-hand=41 low vs exp ~75 risk stockout. In-transit=593 massively inflated by sustained lost shipments (~410 units confirmed prior: P1/3/4/10/13/17; real pipeline low ~183 from P20 pending). P20 conclude arrived=0 as expected (no LT=2 from P18 since arrived early P19 LT=1; P19 order=0). Recent LT successful arrivals alternating 1-2 avg~1.5 (last 6:1,2,2,2,1,1). To bridge OR backend gap (subtracts full inflated pipeline), elevate base_stock >>593 via explicit mu_hat=850 (~3pd demand equiv 283/wk: recent 80/wk forecast + ~670/wk adjustment for ~593 lost drag on IP), explicit sigma_hat=80 (~equiv recent sqrt(3)*~46 std inflated for safety ~131, z@q=0.95).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=941 inflated ~410 by sustained lost shipments (real pipeline~531 from recent P20=183 LT>=2 pending P22 arrival + P21=348); real position 531 > base_real~(1+2)*82 +1.645*sqrt(3)*20~246+57=303, so target order=0 to avoid excess holding. Recent LTs stable mixed avg1.6 (last 5 observed: P11=2,P12=2,P15=2,P16=1,P18=1). No new overdue losses (P20 not past LT=2). Set L recent_5 for avg~1.6; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_16 to capture sustained high mean/volatility regime (N=16=min(regime len 16,20)); base_reported~(1+1.6)*82 +1.645*sqrt(2.6)*20~213+53~266<<941 ensures order=0 balancing high service vs low holding.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15 summer; women's fine-knit trainer socks - steady demand expected, no immediate holidays). Demands sustained high regime since P6 changepoint (17 periods P6-P22 avg 80.8 vs P1-P5 50.6 +60%; std higher ~18-20 vs early ~10). Position 863 (on-hand 105 + in-transit 758), but inflated ~410 lost shipments (P1=48,P3=73,P4=30,P10=68,P13=154,P17=37; ~410/758=54% ghost), real ~453 (348 from P21 pending LT=2 expected this period). Real position covers ~5+ periods at 80/demand, but P21 loss risk (recent P17 lost; pattern sporadic ~30% orders) threatens stockouts in 2-3 periods if lost. Backend unaware of losses sees overstock, orders 0. Counter by L explicit=12 (losses imply effective longer LT/risk; 1+L=13 periods coverage). mu_hat recent_17 captures sustained high regime (N=17=min(regime 17,20)). sigma_hat recent_17 for high vol. Yields base_stock ~(13*80.8=1050) + z*(sqrt13*~19)~1050+120=1170 >863, orders cap~110 (mean_d~81 + z*19~81+31=112) to build total position ~970 (real ~560 buffer vs needed ~300), permanently maintaining real position at ~1170-410=760 despite ghost (balances high service q=0.95 vs low holding; slow build ok).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22, summer - socks demand stable, no major events). High on-hand 380 + transit 516 (real pipeline ~106 from P23 ord=106; lost sustained at 410 confirmed, inflating transit 79%, no new losses/overdues). Demand high regime sustained P6-P23 (18p): avg 80.4 vs early P1-P5 50.6 (+60%), use N=18. Observed LT avg 1.615 (13 arrivals, sum LT=21). Compensate lost via effective L=1.615 + 410/80.4 \u22486.71 explicit (treats lost as equiv ~5.1 demand periods delay). recent_N N=18 for mu_hat/sigma_hat: backend sets mu_hat=(1+6.71)*80.4\u2248539 (inflates BS by ~410), sigma_hat=sqrt(7.71)*std_regime (adds modest safety); cap unbiased ~80.4 + 1.645*std_regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29, late July summer - socks demand typically steady/low seasonal, no major events). Recent demand regime shift down confirmed: P17-P24 avg74.4 (8p) vs P6-P16 ~83.7 (-12%), low vol std~7.8 vs prior ~17. On-hand 311 high (holding risk), in-transit 516 inflated ~410 lost (sustained pattern, real pipeline ~106 from P23 order LT2 expected P25), real position ~417 >> 3p demand ~225. Recent LTs mixed 1-2, avg1.67 last 6 obs (P21@23 LT2, P20@22 LT2, P18@19 LT1, P16@17 LT1, P15@17 LT2, P12@14 LT2). Use recent_N=8 for mu/sigma to capture current low mean/vol regime (mu_hat~(1+1.67)*74~198, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.67)*7.8~12.7); recent_N=6 for L~1.67. Yields base_stock~198+1.645*12.7~223 << inflated position 827, orders 0 to avoid adding to excess inv, cuts holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift at Period 17: avg74 P17-P24 (8 periods) vs P6-P16 avg84 (-12%), std~8 vs prior~17; LT avg1.7 sustained last 6 obs (2,2,1,1,2,2)

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5, early August summer): Women's trainer socks demand in sustained downshift regime since P17 (June 3), P17-P25 avg 73.1 (658/9), std ~9.2 (low vol vs prior ~17), fits seasonal summer dip (historical Jan-Feb avg~37 low; no major events). On-hand 248 covers ~3.4 periods at recent demand; in-transit 516 inflated ~410+ by confirmed lost (P1/3/4/10/13/17 etc.), real pipeline near 0 + possible P23=106 (overdue P25 LT2 arrive, LT>=3 or lost - single, not sustained). Recent LT sustained avg1.67 over last 6 obs (P23 LT2 P21, P22 LT2 P20, P19 LT1 P18, P17 LT2 P15 & LT1 P16, P14 LT2 P12). Set L recent_6 for accurate avg<2; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_9 for downshift regime (N=9=max(min(9,20),3), evidence P25=63 continues low mean/vol). Base_stock ~(1+1.67)*73=239 +1.645*sqrt(2.67)*9.2~239+15=254 << position 764, yielding order~0 to minimize holding on excess while recent params prevent under-forecast if real pipeline low; backend ignores lost/inflation via our regime-adjusted stats.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12, late summer Monday; basic women's trainer socks - seasonal low demand expected, no major holidays/back-to-school spike evident yet). Recent demand downshift sustained & deepened: P24-P26 avg61 (69,63,51) vs P17-P23 avg75 (-19%), low std~9.7 (vs prior~11). OH=303 high (~5x recent demand), IT=410=100% lost shipments (confirmed pattern: total 410 stuck, real IT=0, real pipeline=303). No new orders pending arrival. True forecast: mu_per~67 (blend recent10 avg71 & latest drop), L~1.83 (last6 obs:3,2,2,1,2,1), 1+L~2.83, true_mu_hat~190, true_sigma_hat~sqrt(2.83)*9.7~16 (low vol regime P17+ len10), true_base~190+1.65*16~236. Inflate mu_hat by lost=410 \u2192 explicit 610 (base~610+27~637 -713~-76\u21920, matches true 236-303<0). L recent6 for avg LT; mu_hat explicit inflated compensates phantom IT; sigma_hat recent10 captures low vol/down regime. Ensures backend ignores lost IT, orders correctly vs real pipeline, minimizes holding on excess OH.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019/8/19, late summer - seasonal low demand plausible for trainer socks). On-hand 239 covers ~4 recent demands (~62); in-transit 410 all confirmed lost (no new arrivals, prior total 410 sustained, real pipeline=0, no pending orders P24-27=0). Recent demand regime shift sustained P24-27 (4p): avg 61.75 (vs P17-P23 ~72, -14%), low vol std_d=7.63 (vs prior ~11). No new LT changepoint (recent successful LTs: 3,2,2,1 avg~2.0). Set L=default (promised 2, matches recent avg). Real mu_hat=3*61.75=185.25, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*7.63=13.22, z~1.645, real base~207. Inflate mu_hat by lost 410 to 595.25 so backend base_stock~617=real 207 +410, counteracts inflated pipeline (order = 617 - (239+410) <0 now \u21920, but as on-hand depletes, orders restore real IP to 207). Ensures high service (q=0.95) vs holding, prevents chronic under-ordering.

Period 29 (2019/8/26): Late summer (end-Aug), fine-knit trainer socks; seasonal low demand expected post-spring peak. Recent demand P24-P28: 69,63,51,64,53 avg=60 (-18% vs P17-P23 avg~73), std~7.7 low vol sustained downshift (regime length=5>3). OH=186 covers ~3 periods@60; IT=410 all lost (per insights, inflating 100%, real pipeline=0). No overdue new shipments (recent orders P24-P28=0). No LT concludes in P28/P27. Observed LT avg~1.73 all-time (15 obs), recent~1.8 incl. LT=3 (P23->P26). L=default (promised=2, aligns recent avg). mu_hat=explicit 590=3*60(recent mean)+(410 lost adjustment) to inflate base_stock~612+z*13>596 pipeline, triggers order~(612-596)=16 despite fake IT. sigma_hat=recent_5 (regime N=5, low vol). Addresses lost by inflating target pipeline equiv, balances high service (q=0.95) vs holding on high OH/low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand low regime extended P24-P28 avg60 std7.7 (5 periods, -18% vs P17-P23~73, low vol sustained); LT avg~1.8 last 6 obs incl. new LT=3 (P23->P26)

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2, Labor Day - minor potential uptick for back-to-school socks, but recent demands stable low). On-hand 117 covers ~2 periods at recent avg61 demand; in-transit 426 inflated by ~410 confirmed lost shipments (carry-over), real pipeline ~16 (P29 order=16). Recent demand regime low sustained P24-P29 avg61.5 std~7.1 (6p), no new changepoint. LT observed avg~1.71 all 14 successes, recent_6 avg1.83 (incl LT=3). No arrivals P29 expected (recent orders 0). To counter inflated pipeline (backend sees 543 total pipeline >> real133), set explicit mu_hat=650 (>3*71 all-mean*3~214) targeting base_stock~650 + ~50 safety >543 for order~150+ to rebuild real inventory vs stockouts; L calculate (avg observed 1.71< promised2, conservative); sigma recent_6 low vol matches regime, modest safety as holding low.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09): Early September, back-to-school season possible for socks but no demand uptick evidence; low demand regime sustained P24-P30 (7 periods): demands [69,63,51,64,53,69,56] avg=60.7 std=7.4 (-18% vs prior regimes, low vol confirmed). On-hand=61 low vs demand~60; in-transit=556 inflated by ~410 lost shipments (real pipeline=P29:16 + P30:130=146; real IP~207 vs reported 617, overstated 410). No new overdue (P29 LT=2 expected P31 arrival).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16), early fall/back-to-school season for women's trainer socks; demand potentially steady or slight uptick but sustained low regime confirmed P24-P31 (8 periods): demands [69,63,51,64,53,69,56,62] avg=61, std~7.3 (low vol). No new changepoint vs prior avg60 P24-P28. Reconcile pipeline: in-transit=556 heavily inflated by historical lost shipments (~410+ per carry-over, sustained pattern); real pipeline low ~146 (P29=16 overdue LT=2 expected P31 no-show + P30=130 pending LT~2 expected P32 arrival). On-hand=0 but expect P30 arrival during P32 to cover demand~60. Recent LT obs (last 6 arrivals chronologically: P26 LT=3/P23, P23 LT=2/P21, P22 LT=2/P20, P19 LT=1/P18, P17 LT=2/P15, P17 LT=1/P16) avg~1.83. Set L recent_N=6 to use observed avg LT~1.83 bridging promised=2 vs actual variability/lost. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=8 for low regime (N=regime_length=8). Yields ~1+L=2.83, mu_hat~173, sigma_hat~12, base_stock~173+1.645*12~195 << pipeline=556 \u2192 order=0 (capped policy safe). Addresses inflated pipeline by conservative params preventing overorder on fake pipeline while expected real arrival covers service; high profit/low holding favors service but avoids excess holding on lost-inflated subtract.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Late September, fall onset; women's trainer socks demand stable low regime P24-P32 (9 periods: demands 69,63,51,64,53,69,56,62,53; mean=60, std~7). No seasonal uptick evidence despite cooling weather potential. On-hand=77, in-transit=426 (mostly historical lost shipments ~410 per carry-over, real pipeline ~16 from P29 order overdue LT>=4 likely lost); real position ~93 covers ~1.5 periods. Expected P33 arrivals: none reliable (P31 LT2=0 ordered, P32 LT1 unlikely). Inflate mu_hat explicitly to 610 to yield base_stock~630 (>503 total pipeline), targeting order~110-130 to build real position to ~200-220 (3-period base stock at mu_d=60, sigma_d=7, L=2: 180+20). L recent_5 avg=2.0 (LTs: P32:2, P26:3, P23:2, P22:2, P19:1). Sigma recent_9 captures low vol for conservative overstock. Balances high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding amid ghosts.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): Late September, women's fine-knit trainer socks; possible fall demand uptick as P33 demand=90 (+42% vs P24-P32 avg~58), but single observation not sustained. On-hand=0, high stockout risk. In-transit=553 inflated by sustained lost shipments total~426 (prior~410 + P29=16 overdue 5+ periods past LT=2, no P31-P33 arrival); real pipeline~127 (P33 order=127, expected ~P35 LT=2). Recent demand P29-P33: avg66, std~14.8; forecast weekly demand=66 (recent_5), real_L=2, real_mu_hat=3*66=198, real_sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*14.8\u224825.6. Compensate lost bloat by inflating mu_hat=198+426=624 (keeps sigma real); provided base_stock~624+1.645*26\u2248667 = real_base~229 + lost 426, yielding order~667-553=114 (real order raises real position 127\u2192241 to cover ~3 periods). L=recent_10 LTs avg1.8 (LTs:2,3,2,2,1,1,2,2,2,1) sustained recent regime per carry-over. Cap~624/2.8 +1.645*26/sqrt(2.8)\u2248223+26\u2248249 >114, no binding. Balances high service (q=0.95) vs holding by matching real policy post-lost adjustment.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments expanded: P29=16 confirmed lost (overdue 5 periods past promised LT=2, no arrival P31-P34 expected); total lost ~426 units (+16 to prior 410), inflating in-transit 553 by 77% vs real pipeline 127.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7, early Oct, fine-knit trainer socks): steady fall demand, no major events. On-hand=0, stockout on P34 demand=69. In-transit=667 inflated by sustained lost shipments (~426 units per carry-over, real pipeline low ~241 from recent P33=127+P34=114). Recent demand regime low since P24 changepoint (11 periods P24-P34: avg=63.5, std~11, -12% vs P17-P23 avg~73, low vol sustained vs mid-year std~17). No new LT observed in P34; recent LT avg~1.8 (last 7 obs: 2,3,2,2,1,2,1). To bridge lost shipments inflating pipeline (OR backend unaware, under-orders), set L explicit=10 (>>observed avg/promised 2) so base_stock ~(1+10)*63.5 + z*sqrt(11)*11 ~825 +65=890 >667, yielding order=min(890-667=223, cap~64+18=82)=82 matching recent demand/service needs. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=11 (regime_length=11) for accurate low regime forecast, balancing high service (q=0.95) vs holding by targeting appropriate level despite fake pipeline.

Stockouts P33-P35 (demands 90/69/53=avg71, sales 77/0/0). On-hand 0, in-transit 749 inflated by confirmed lost ~426 (P1=48,P3=73,P4=30,P10=68,P13=154,P17=37,P29=16) + pending P33=127 (overdue past P35 LT=2, poss LT=3 this period), P34=114 (due P36), P35=82 (due P37); real pipeline likely ~100-200 given lost pattern/no arrivals P33-P35. Permanent pipe inflation requires inflating mu_hat by ~550-600 to offset lost (normal base ~220 inflated to ~850 matches pipe cancelation: effective base - real_pipe \u2248 normal base - real_pipe). Chgpoint P24 confirmed 12p length N=12. L default=2 (promised/recent avg~1.9 sustained). mu_hat explicit=850 (3*62.7\u2248188 normal +662 inflate/safety for spikes/stockouts/recovery). sigma_hat recent_12 low vol.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21, late October, approaching winter; basic women's socks demand typically steady/non-seasonal spike). Recent demand low regime sustained P24-P36 (13 periods) avg~62, std~13 (low vol confirmed, includes P33=90 outlier but overall down from mid-year peaks ~80-100). On-hand 157 + estimated real pipeline ~247 (P34=114 overdue LT=2 but possible LT=3, P36=133 pending) = ~404 total real position (~6.5 periods @62/dmd). In-transit 673 inflated by sustained lost shipments ~426 (per carry-over P34). Recent LT avg 2.17 (last 6 obs: 1,3,2,3,2,2). To compensate permanent pipeline bias, use explicit mu_hat = 62*(1+2.17) + 426 \u2248622; backend base_stock \u2248622 + z*~22 \u2248652. Effective order = 652 - 830 \u2248 -178 \u21920 (correct now). Future: when real_pos low=0, position=426+0, order=652-426=226 \u22483.7 periods (fast recovery, clipped by inflated cap~207 ok given low holding). Sigma recent_N=12 captures low vol.

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): Approaching Thanksgiving (~P42 Nov28) and Christmas (~P46 Dec25); women's fine-knit trainer socks may spike for winter/holiday gifting (seasonal driver). Recent demand P35-P38: avg51.5 std1.1 (ultra-stable low); extended low regime P24-P38 avg~58 std~12 (15p, -25% vs peak P6-P16~84).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18), approaching Black Friday (Nov 29 ~P42) and holidays; socks/tights may see winter/holiday uptick, but demands collapsed P39-40 to 22-23 (avg 22.5, -56% vs P35-P38 avg 51.5 std1.1), extending low regime (P24-P38 avg58 std12 per carry-over) with new potential downshift (not yet sustained 3p). On-hand 144 covers 6+ recent low-demand periods; in-transit 789 heavily inflated by sustained lost shipments (~673+ per P39 insight, ~85% fake vs real pipeline ~116).

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Approaching Thanksgiving (11/28), Black Friday (11/29), Cyber Monday (12/2), Christmas (12/25); women's cotton trainer socks may see holiday gifting/stockpiling spike, but no evidence yet\u2014recent P39-P41 demands 22/23/25 confirm further downshift to ultra-low regime avg23 std~1.5 (-55% vs P35-P38 avg51.5 std1.1).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2): Early December, start of Christmas holiday shopping season; women's trainer socks could see gifting/winter demand uptick, but no sustained evidence yet (P42 demand=45 single uptick vs P39-P41 avg23 ultra-low regime). Recent demand P38-P42: avg33.2 (51,22,23,25,45), std~13.7 low vol sustained post downshift. On-hand=323 covers 10+ periods at recent rate or 3-6 periods even if moderate holiday spike to 50-100. In-transit=540 fully lost (673 total per insights), real pipeline~0; backend sees inflated pipeline=863, will order 0 under low targets. Only 4 periods left (/47), prioritize avoiding excess holding ($1/unit) vs risk stockout.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), pre-Christmas holiday season; socks may see gifting/winter demand spike, but recent evidence contradicts: P39-P43 demands 22,23,25,45,28 avg28.6 (low regime sustained per carry-over P42 ultra-low shift), P42=45 possible early uptick but P43=28 reverts (not sustained 3+ periods). High on-hand=295 covers ~10 periods at 30/demand; in-transit=540 inflated 100% by ~673 confirmed lost units (carry-over P42). Reconcile: real pipeline near 0, no expected arrivals P44 (recent orders P39-P43=249/0/0/0/0, prior arrived). Use L recent_6 (avg~2.33 from carry-over sequence 2,3,3,1,2,3 reflecting LT drift); mu_hat recent_5 avg28.6 so (1+2.33)*28.6~95 low target counters inflated pipeline for minimal ordering/holding; sigma_hat recent_5 std~9.45 provides buffer for potential holiday vol without overstocking. OR backend (q=19/20=0.95) sets high service but low mu limits base_stock below pipeline.

Recent LTs last 6 obs (P41=2,P39=3,P36=3&P36=1,P32=2,P26=3) avg2.33 sustained. Use recent_N N=6 across params: reflects low demand regime (changelpoint P39 sustained 6p), low vol, recent LT dist.

LLM Rationale:

Demand evidence: P45=81 spike (+178% vs P39-P44 avg29), confirming holiday uptick start after ultra-low regime; prior peaks ~100 (P11=116,P12=102). On-hand=181 covers ~2 periods at 90/period; in-transit=540 all confirmed lost (real pipeline=0 per P45 insight), ghosts permanently inflate pipeline by 540 (76%+). No expected arrivals P46 (last orders=0). Reconcile: real coverage low for holiday spike. LT recent successful avg2.33 (last 6 obs:2,3,3,1,2,3). Parameters: L recent_6 for actual avg~2.33; explicit mu_hat=873=540(ghosts)+3.33*100(real holiday m=100/period based on peaks+spike); explicit sigma_hat=50 (buffer > recent std21*sqrt3.33~38 for holiday vol).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30) post-Christmas/New Year's; socks demand likely dropping after holiday spike P45=81/P46=67 (avg74, +152% vs P39-P44 ultra-low avg29), but recent_6 avg46.5 std22.8 confirms higher vol. On-hand=114, in-transit=775 (fake~540 lost per pattern, real~235 P46 order), fake IP=889 vs real~349 (covers 5+pd at ~60pd). Reconcile: no overdue recent except historical lost; P46 order pending LT~2.3 arrives ~P48-49. L=recent_N N=6 (last obs LTs 2,3,3,1,2,3 avg2.33 sustained recent regime). sigma_hat=recent_N N=6 (sqrt(3.33)*22.8~42, z\u03c3~68). mu_hat explicit=871 inflated by ~fake 540 + real forecast 3.3*46.5~154 + buffer (~717 base real equiv, total base939>889 IP \u2192 order~50 buffer). Ensures OR orders small safety despite ghosts (high q=0.95 favors service), avoids overstock post-spike.
