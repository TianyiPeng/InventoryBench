Inventory: On-hand 141 sufficient for 4-5 periods at recent ~30 demand; post-P44 ending 141 after demand=33. Demand analysis: Sustained drop P39-P44 demands (22,23,25,45,28,33) avg=29.3 (-50% vs P24-P38 ~55), low variance over 6 periods; early history highs (40-100 Feb-May), but Nov-Dec low (28-45) despite holidays (Thanksgiving P42=45 no surge, early Christmas P43=28/P44=33 no spike yet). Calendar/product: 2019/12/16 socks/tights (everyday cotton trainer socks) pre-Christmas (Dec25), potential winter/gift uptick possible but unconfirmed by recent data (no surge observed); prioritize sustained low pattern over speculative spike. OR rec: 0 units (appropriate given high position vs historical mean, ignores LT/losses but aligns). Strategy: Order 0 to avoid adding to high holding exposure (141 on-hand + unreliable 768 transit) with only 3 periods left (45-47); covers expected low-moderate demand ~30-50, minimizes ending inv cost ($1/unit/period); monitor for holiday confirmation next periods.",

No new arrivals expected in P46 (next would be P44 in P47?). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 140 sufficient for 1 period (~80 demand) but risky for 2-3 periods given unreliable pipeline (treat effective pipeline ~120u arriving later); holding cost low ($1 vs $19 profit).

Current P46 date 2019/12/23 (Christmas Eve week) - women's cotton trainer socks prime for holiday gifting/stockings, anticipate sustained spike 80-100+ for P46-P47 based on calendar seasonality and P45 signal (early Christmas shopping). OR recommendation 0 units: Follows base-stock with promised LT=2 and full historical demand (ignores losses, recent drop/spike, no seasonality); overestimates pipeline coverage. Strategy: Override to order 100u - covers (L+1)=3 periods at ~80 demand (240u total need) minus on-hand 140 + expected late P44 120u; conservative buffer for spike/stockout risk, avoids overorder given moderation risk post-holiday.",
