(c) Lead time: Variable 1-3 periods confirmed (recent: P42 LT3, P43 LT2 to P45; P36 LT3 to P39, P37 LT1 to P38); chronic delays on old orders (e.g., P29+ overdue 15+ periods) but recent arrivals resuming (P45:200u); no new losses, in-transit persists. (d) Inv&pipeline: On-hand 82 covers ~0.6 periods @130 demand; total position 82+1244=1326 (~10 periods @130 or 19 @70); likely P46 arrivals ~100-200 (e.g., P44 order 100 LT2, others trickling); high holding risk $1244/period on pipeline. (e) Order logic: Massive pipeline covers 10+ periods even at holiday peak; order 0 to minimize added holding ($1/u/p) vs profit $19/u; on-hand+expected arrivals buffer P46 demand; resume ordering post-holiday if pipeline depletes.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand spike confirmed late Dec: P43-45 51/65/118 avg78 (+15% vs winter P36-42 avg68), accelerating 3 periods into Christmas week (+73% at P45).",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "(a) Product: Basic sweatpants (jersey fabric, elastic waist, pockets, soft brushed inside) - casual winter lower body wear, highly relevant for cold Dec/Jan weather; demand boosted by holidays/post-holiday comfort buying. Calendar: 2019/12/30 (New Year's Eve week, post-Christmas); expect sustained high winter/holiday tail demand per historical Jan (121,57,75) and recent spike. (b) Demand regime: Holiday spike sustained/accelerating P43-46 (51/65/118/153, avg97 +42% vs winter P36-42 avg68); P46=153 confirms peak extension into late Dec, forecast P47 ~130-150 (New Year's + winter), tapering to ~100 Jan. (c) Lead time: Variable 1-3 periods confirmed (recent: P42 LT3 P45, P43 LT2 P45); chronic delays (P46 arrived=0, P44:100 overdue LT2); old orders (e.g. P29:200 >17 periods past) persist in-transit without loss confirmation. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (P46 ending=0 after selling 82/153); massive in-transit=1244 (covers 10-15 periods at ~100 demand, but sporadic arrivals risk short-term stockouts). (e) Order logic: Huge delayed pipeline risks future flood/holding, but stockouts lose $19 profit >> $1 holding; order conservative 100 to buffer P49-50 demand (~100-130) amid delays, matching recent winter/holiday avg without overbuild.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand acceleration confirmed P46=153 (+30% vs P45=118), sustaining spike over 4 periods P43-46 avg97 (+42% vs winter P36-42 avg68); no new regime shift beyond prior.",
