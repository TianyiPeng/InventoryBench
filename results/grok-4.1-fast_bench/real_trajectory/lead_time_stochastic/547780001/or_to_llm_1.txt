Recent stockouts (P14-P16) but low volume lost sales. OR rec=0 (base-stock capped, high pipeline vs low mu_hat); aligns with reality. Strategy: Order 0 - no need to add inventory with high pipeline (even if partial lost, pending covers multiple low-demand periods), prioritize avoiding holding costs ($1/unit/period) over low-profit risk ($19/unit); cover expected ~30 demand from potential P15 arrival or accept minor stockout loss.",

Frequent losses persist (in-transit 634 bloated with ghosts like P29/P26/etc., per carry-over; recent deliveries only from recent orders).
