Casual women's lower body garment, somewhat seasonal with potential higher winter/cooler weather demand but year-round use. Date 2019-02-11 (Mon, week incl. Valentine's Day Feb 14), possible minor demand lift for women's apparel near holiday, but not a primary driver for denim jeggings. Historical demand: early Jan avg ~23 (28,20,21), late Jan/early Feb 11 (11,11), suggesting post-holiday decline.\n(b) Demand regime: Recent 2 weeks at 11 (low variance), prior 3 weeks avg 23; decline evident but <3 sustained low periods, so forecast cautiously at 12-18/period, nearer recent lows with possible Valentine's nudge to ~15 avg.\n(c) No game history; assume promised lead time=2 periods. No in-transit or prior orders to assess drift/loss.\n(d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; full stockout expected periods 1-2.

Date 2019/12/23 (Mon before Christmas Wed 12/25) - peak pre-Christmas retail rush, last-minute shopping spike expected (calendar event: Christmas week, similar to BF P42=338 demand). (b) Demand: Holiday high volatile regime sustained P42-45 avg179 std~96, but recent P43-45 stabilized ~126 (122/130/126) low vol std=4.3 (moderation post-BF outlier). Forecast P46: 200-250 (calendar-driven spike upside from recent stable base, volatility risk). Post-holiday P47/P48 drop to winter low ~30-50 (early 2019 Jan pattern 11-28 avg~18). (c) Lead-time: Promised 2, actual variable 1-3 confirmed historically; recent P45 arrival P43 order LT=2. Sustained lost pattern (14x, ~900+ ghost units); in-transit 1245 bloated (~1000 ghosts + legit ~245 from P44/P45 300ea). No new lost (P44 300 expected P46 LT=2, pending confirmation). (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 174 covers ~1-2 periods recent demand. Expected P46 arrivals: P44 300 (LT=2 probable, recent success), poss. overdue; potential start 474+ (covers >>forecast). Pipeline excess even partial arrival (P45 300 P47). (e) Order logic: Modest 200 balances replenishing loss-prone pipeline for post-holiday low regime (3 periods x ~50=150 + safety 50) vs. holding risk/excess ghosts. Avoids 300 continuation (high demand matched recent peaks, now stable+decline risk); prioritizes service (low stockout prob ~10-20% even no P44 arrival) while minimizing post-peak overstock ($1 hold vs $4 profit).",
