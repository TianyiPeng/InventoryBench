Year-round staple, but Feb 2019 (Northern Hemisphere winter end) suggests modest demand uptick toward spring/summer wardrobes.

Clear ramp-up from week 3 (avg early: ~0; recent 3wks avg:22, but last=38 trending sharply higher ~+100% WoW). Forecast Period 1 (2019/2/11): 40-50 continuation of acceleration. (c) Lead time: Promised 2 periods; no 'conclude' messages yet to infer actual or losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no prior orders/arrivals. Period 1 demand fully lost (post-decision). No expected arrivals in Period 1.

Lean sizing balances lost sales risk (early periods) vs. high holding ($1/unit/period = profit). Builds pipeline for Periods 3+ without excess; monitor actual lead/demand next periods.",
