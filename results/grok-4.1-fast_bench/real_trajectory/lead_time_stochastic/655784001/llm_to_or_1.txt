Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1, date 2019-02-11 (early February, post-holidays). Women's skinny trousers; historical demand declining sharply from Jan avg ~248 (first 2 weeks) to recent avg ~102 (last 3 weeks: 112,112,81), suggesting post-January regime shift to lower demand. No inventory or in-transit; no lead time observations yet. Use default L=promised 2. mu_hat and sigma_hat recent_3 to reflect sustained lower mean/variance regime (N=3 as regime_length=3, min 3). This lowers base_stock vs default (all-sample mean 160.4), reducing overstock risk/holding costs while covering ~3 periods demand at recent levels, balancing high profit q~0.95 service.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-2019-01-14: avg dropped from ~248 (first 2 periods) to ~102 (last 3: 112,112,81; -59%)

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18): Low demand regime confirmed sustained with Period 1 demand=82 aligning with carry-over insight (post-2019-01-14 avg ~102 from 112,112,81). No major calendar events (Presidents' Day on 2019-02-18 unlikely to spike trousers demand significantly). No concluded arrivals yet, so no lead time inference; Period 1 order=132 in-transit as expected, no losses signalled. On-hand=0, pipeline=132 covers ~1.5 periods at ~85 avg demand. Use default L=2 (promised). recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures low regime (last 3 hist samples mean~102, low std~15); scales to mu_hat~(1+2)*102=306 for base_stock targeting service with q=19/20=0.95, reducing overstock risk vs all-data mean~160.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), late February, women's skinny trousers - end of winter, no major events. Demand remains in low regime post-2019-01-14 shift (carry-over), confirmed by recent 5 periods: 112,112,81 (hist),82(P1),102(P2); avg=97.8 (-~40% from early 248). On-hand=0, in-transit=253 (P1:132 + P2:121), no arrivals observed yet (expected P1 order during P3 arrival phase, visible P4 conclude if L=2). Pipeline covers ~2.6 periods at recent mean. No lead-time observations (no concluded arrivals), use default L=2. mu_hat recent_5 captures low mean regime (backend: 3*97.8\u2248293). sigma_hat recent_5 for low recent volatility (sd\u224815.4 vs all higher). Balances high profit q=19/20=0.95 service vs holding; avoids overstock in declining regime.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, women's skinny trousers (stretch twill, high waist). No major calendar events imminent; post-winter fashion demand likely stable low per carry-over shift post-2019-01-14. Demands: hist last3 (112,112,81 avg102), game p1-3 (82,102,89 avg91) \u2192 low regime sustained, last6 avg96.3. On-hand=0, pipeline=338 (p1:132+p2:121+p3:85), sales=0 every period. No arrivals; p1 order overdue (placed p1, expected arrive p3 if LT=2, but p3 conclude arrived=0). No confirmed LT observations yet (no 'lead_time was W' messages). Use explicit L=3 to conservatively extend coverage for delay/missing shipment, bridging OR backend's promised LT=2 assumption. mu_hat recent_6 (low demand regime length=6 since 2019-01-21 changepoint, backend computes (1+3)*96.3\u2248386). sigma_hat recent_6 (low recent volatility vs. full hist high-std early periods). Ensures base_stock ~386 + 1.6*low_sigma covers ~4 periods demand (~384), minus pipeline=338 \u2192 small order, balancing high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding while awaiting delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime sustained and extended: last 6 periods (2019-01-21 to p3) avg 96.3 (112,112,81,82,102,89; consistent -60% vs early 248); Period 1 order (132u) overdue by 1 period (expected p3 arrival for LT=2, p3 conclude arrived=0)

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): Women's skinny trousers in stretch twill, early March no major seasonal events (Easter late April), low demand regime sustained per carry-over. Demands P1-4: 82,102,89,66 (avg 84.75, std ~15, -47% vs early hist 248). Inventory: on-hand 55, in-transit 312 (P1:132 overdue/likely lost, P3:85 due P5 LT=2, P4:95 due P6). Confirmed LT=2 (P2 order arrived P4). P1 no arrival in P3/P4 conclude (past LT=2+1). L=default (promised/observed=2). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 captures sustained low mean/vol regime (changepoint post-2019-01-14, game confirms 4 periods avg84.75 low vol), lowers base_stock vs default high-hist, balances high pipeline (367 total, ample even if P1 lost) vs holding, prevents overorder.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (132u) likely lost: overdue by 2 periods past promised LT=2 (no arrival in P3 or P4 conclude); low demand regime update: game P1-4 avg 84.75 (-47% vs early hist)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18), early spring - low demand for women's skinny trousers expected post-winter. On-hand=3 (low), in-transit=312 (P1:132u lost/overdue 3+ periods, P3:85u overdue 1 past LT=2 expected P5, P4:95u due during P6). Demand history confirms sustained low regime since post-2019-01-14 (initial hist avg~248 to recent game P1-5:82,102,89,66,52 avg=78.2, -68%; dropping trend last 3:89/66/52 avg=69). No calendar spikes imminent. L=default (promised=2, confirmed by P2 order LT=2; losses/delays handled via low mu_hat to limit new orders). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 (regime_length=5 game periods, evidence: consistent low post-changepoint, validates vs early hist). Parameters yield low base_stock ~ (3)*78=234 mean over L+1=3, z* high (profit19/20=0.95 q-> high service), but cap limits overorder; balances low demand forecast vs holding cost with bloated/unreliable pipeline (effective coverage despite losses).

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended to game P1-5: avg 78.2 (82,102,89,66,52; sustained -68% vs early hist ~248); P3 order (85u) overdue by 1 period (expected P5 for LT=2, P5 conclude arrived=0)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25, late March/spring transition): women's skinny trousers demand in sustained low regime (entire game P1-6 avg 71.8), further dropping P4-6 avg 55 (-30% vs P1-3 avg 91). On-hand=0, pipeline=312 high but unreliable: P1(132u) lost (exp arrive P3, no thru P6 conclude), P3(85u) lost (exp P5, no P6), P4(95u) overdue (exp P6, no P6 conclude). Risk stockouts if losses. Only 1 confirmed LT=2 (P2 order). Set L=explicit 3 to hedge delays/losses, extending coverage. mu_hat recent_6 (N=6, regime length=6 periods low demand post-hist shift) for (1+3)*71.8\u2248287. sigma_hat recent_6 (low recent std\u224844, sqrt(4)*44\u224888). Raises base_stock\u2248287 + 1.6*88\u2248427 >312 pipeline, triggers cautious re-order to hedge losses/service lost sales (profit$19>>holding$1), limits overstock via cap/low mu.

Carry-over insight: Further demand drop confirmed P4-6: avg 55 (-30% vs P1-3 avg 91); Lost shipment pattern: P1(132u) and P3(85u) lost (overdue 3+ periods past exp LT=2 arrival); P4(95u) overdue 1 period (exp P6 arrival, absent P6 conclude)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/04/01): Spring start, women's skinny trousers - no major seasonal spike expected yet. On-hand=0, in-transit=364 (P1:132 likely lost overdue ~6p, P3:85 lost overdue ~4p, P4:95 lost overdue 2p past LT=2 absent P6/P7 conclude, P7:52 recent). Only observed LT=2 (P2\u2192P4). Recent demand volatile: P4-6 avg~55, P7=83 (+50% spike, stockout). Game avg~75 vs hist mean 160 (-53%). Lost pattern inflates pipeline; OR unaware. Default params use high hist mean 160.4 (mu_hat~481 for L=2), high sigma~82 (sigma_hat~142), z*~234, base_stock~715 >>364 pipeline \u2192 orders ~351 (pre-cap) to cover effective low pipeline ~52u, balancing stockouts vs holding. High service q=0.95 prioritized amid unreliable supply.

Carry-over insight: P4 order (95u) likely lost: overdue 2 periods past promised LT=2 (expected P6 arrival absent in P6 conclude, LT=3 absent P7 conclude); suspected lost total 312u (P1 132u, P3 85u, P4 95u)

On-hand:0, in-transit:473 but P1(132u overdue 7+), P3(85u overdue 5+), P4(95u overdue 4+) likely lost (~312u total per carry-over), effective pipeline ~161u (P8 order). Observed LTs: P2-P4:2, P7-P8:1 (variable). Lost pattern persists, overstating pipeline - bridge by explicit L=3 (effective LT longer due to losses), default mu_hat/sigma_hat scale to (1+3)*mean_all(~108.8)~435, sqrt4*sd_all(~70)~140, z~230, base~665 >473 yielding order~192 (matches ~4*80=320 demand -161 true pipe~159).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15, mid-spring near Easter 4/21 which may boost apparel but no demand evidence yet). Sustained low demand regime since P3 (7 periods: P3-9 demands 89,66,52,48,83,90,60 avg 69.7, -~45% vs hist early ~248 and game start ~91). Recent P7-9 avg 77.7 slight uptick but volatile (P9=60 down), not sustained changepoint. On-hand=0, in-transit=650 = confirmed lost ~312u (P1=132 overdue ~8pd, P3=85 ~7pd, P4=95 ~6pd past LT=2) + expected recent P8=161 (exp arrive P10 LT=2 or P9 LT=1), P9=177 (exp P11). Observed LTs: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P7->P8); avg=1.5. Use L 'calculate' for avg observed LT. mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=7 matching low regime length (min(7,20)=7 >=3), conservative forecast ~ (2.5)*69.7=174 mean_demand_(1+L), low vol std~17.6. Yields low base_stock ~174 + 1.645*sqrt(2.5)*17.6 ~174+46=220 <<650 pipeline \u2192 order~0, minimizes holding on inflated pipeline while awaiting P10 conclude to confirm recent arrivals vs losses; high q=0.95 still buffers service.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), immediately post-Easter (4/21/2019); women's skinny trousers in spring likely see low demand as seasonal shift from winter. Recent demands P6-P10 (48,83,90,60,29) avg 62, sustaining low regime per carry-over (-60%+ vs early hist ~250, game avg ~70). On-hand 309 from P10 arrivals (P8 LT2:161u, P9 LT1:177u minus 29 dem); in-transit 312 matches suspected lost total (P1:132, P3:85, P4:95 overdue 7+/5+/4+ periods past promised LT2, no conclude ever). No expected usable arrivals soon; effective pipeline ~309 covers 5+ periods demand. High holding risk ($1/u/period). Observed LTs: P2->P4:2, P7->P8:1, P8->P10:2, P9->P10:1 (recent variable avg1.5). No changepoint for new LT regime (variability sustained). Low demand regime sustained (last 5 stable ~62). L=recent_4 (N=4, avg1.5) reflects recent LT reality <promised2, adjusts coverage to ~2.5 periods. mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_5 (N=5, mean62, std~23) lowers base_stock vs default (ignores high hist/game-early), e.g. ~155 + 1.6*23*sqrt(2.5)~155+58=213 <<621 pipeline \u2192 order~0, prioritizes avoiding overstock/holding while service ok for low dem.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29): Late spring, women's skinny trousers demand seasonally low/dropping (P10-11:29,28 avg28.5, -60% vs game P1-9 avg~72; P9-11 avg39). High on-hand 281 (P10 arrivals covered recent low demand), in-transit 312= lost shipments (P1 132 overdue 9+pd past LT2 exp P3; P3 85 overdue 8+; P4 95 overdue 6+ past P6, no conclude ever). Effective pipeline~281 covers 9+ pd at 30/d. Observed LTs (4 arrives): P2->P4 LT2, P7->P8 LT1, P8->P10 LT2, P9->P10 LT1; recent_4 avg1.5 vs promised2. Chgpoint: sharp demand drop P10+ (60->29->28). Set L recent_4 (variable recent LTs), mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_3 (low regime N=3=max(min(3,20),3) for P9-11); lowers base_stock <<593 pipeline, triggers order~0 minimizing holding on excess inv while low demand met.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6): Early May, women's skinny trousers likely in low-demand spring regime (less trouser sales in warming weather). Recent demand P10-12: 29/28/36 avg 31 (-65% vs P1-9 avg 74.7), sustained 3+ periods confirming drop. On-hand 245 covers ~8 periods at 30/demand; in-transit 312u permanent lost (P1=132, P3=85, P4=95 stuck since early periods, no arrivals post-P10). Observed LTs (arrived only): P2->P4 LT2, P7->P8 LT1, P8->P10 LT2, P9->P10 LT1 (recent_4 avg 1.5). No overdue recent orders. Params: L recent_N=4 for accurate avg 1.5; mu_hat default blends all samples mean~92 (historical high + game low); sigma_hat explicit=270 (~default~78 + 312/z~190) inflates base_stock target +312 to negate lost pipeline illusion, ensuring backend orders ~ (inflated base -557) despite fake IP. High sigma boosts buffer for supply uncertainty/low demand vol, high-q=0.95 favors service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift P10: spring low avg 31 (29,28,36; -65% vs P1-9 avg 74.7, sustained 3 periods); Permanent lost shipments confirmed 312u stuck in-transit (P1 132u/P3 85u/P4 95u, unchanged P11-P12 concludes); Recent LT avg 1.5 sustained (last 4 observed: 2,1,2,1)

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13): Mid-spring, women's skinny trousers likely seeing sustained low demand as summer apparel season approaches (off-season for trousers). Recent demand P10-13: 29,28,36,23 (avg 29, std~5.0; -65% vs early game avg~74). Low regime sustained 4+ periods, no new changepoint. On-hand 222 covers ~7 periods at 29/period; in-transit 476 = 312 permanent lost (P1:132,P3:85,P4:95 unchanged) + P13:164 pending (exp arrive P15-16). No new arrivals/overdues in P13 conclude. LT: last 4 observed sustained avg1.5 (P2 LT2, P7 LT1, P8 LT2, P9 LT1). Set L recent_N=4 (1.5) to reflect actual shorter LT drift, avoiding overstock from promised=2 assumption. mu_hat recent_N=4: (1+1.5)*29=72.5 targets low demand over review+lead. sigma_hat recent_N=4: sqrt(2.5)*5~8 low vol. Low params yield low base_stock (~72 + z*8, z~0.95 for q=19/20), order~0 given pipeline 698>>base, minimizes holding on excess while covering low demand/service.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20, late spring): Women's skinny trousers in low demand regime sustained P10-14 (demands 29,28,36,23,28; avg 28.8, std~4.2; -60% vs P1-9 avg~72). On-hand 194 + in-transit 476 (stuck 312u from P1/P3/P4 + P13's 164u) ample for ~30/period demand (covers 20+ periods). Recent LTs stable avg1.5 (last 4 observed: P2->P4 LT2, P7->P8 LT1, P8->P10 LT2, P9->P10 LT1; regime length 4). No new arrives P11-14; P13 order (164u) likely LT>=2 (absent P14 conclude). Changepoint P10 confirmed sustained 5 periods (N=5>=3). Set L recent_4 to reflect avg1.5 (helps backend use true LT for base stock/pipeline). mu_hat recent_5 scales (1+L)~2.5*28.8~72 demand over review+LT. sigma_hat recent_5 ~sqrt(2.5)*4.2~6.6 low vol. Low params ensure low base stock, minimal new orders despite stuck pipeline, balance high service (q~19/20=0.95) vs holding amid excess inv.

Carry-over insight: Spring low demand regime extended P10-14: avg 28.8 (29,28,36,23,28; sustained 5 periods, -60% vs P1-9 avg 71.7)

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27): Late spring/early summer for women's skinny trousers; sustained spring low demand regime P10-15 (29,28,36,23,28,30; avg=29, std~4.2; -60% vs pre-P10 avg~71). On-hand=164 covers ~5+ periods at 29/unit (low stockout risk). In-transit=476 includes confirmed lost 312u (P1=132,P3=85,P4=95) + P13 order=164 (overdue 1 period past promised LT=2, absent P15 conclude; potential additional loss). Observed LTs sustained recent pattern: last 4 (P2=2,P7=1,P8=2,P9=1; avg=1.5). Use recent_4 for L to reflect variable short LT; recent_6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low regime (backend computes (1+L)*29 ~51 for mu if L=1.5; low sigma~7 ensures conservative base_stock given losses/high pipeline; balances high service via pipeline despite losses vs holding cost on 164+476). No calendar spikes expected (post-spring, pre-summer peak for trousers).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3, early summer): Women's skinny trousers in low seasonal demand regime sustained P10-16 (demands:29,28,36,23,28,30,19; avg 27.6, std~5.1; -63% vs P1-9 avg 74.7). No demand uptick despite summer transition; prioritize low mu/sigma to minimize overstock orders given high pipeline (on-hand 145 + in-transit 476, latter stuck/lost including confirmed P13 164u overdue 3+ periods past LT=2). LT pattern stable at recent avg 1.5 (last 4 observed: P2->P4 LT2, P7->P8 LT1, P8->P10 LT2, P9->P10 LT1). Use recent_N N=7 for mu/sigma (regime length 7>=3, captures low vol/mean); recent_N N=4 for L (sustained recent LTs). This sets low base_stock ~ (1+1.5)*27.6 +1.64*sqrt(1+1.5)*5.1 ~57, far below pipeline 621, yielding order~0 to avoid adding to holdings while covering ~28/wk demand from on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P10-16: avg 27.6 (sustained 7 periods, -63% vs P1-9 74.7); Lost shipment pattern extended: P13 (164u) lost (overdue 3+ past LT=2, absent P15-16 concludes); total stuck in-transit 476u confirmed unchanged

LLM Rationale:

No seasonal spike expected for trousers in June. On-hand 119 covers ~4 periods; in-transit 476 stuck/lost (P1=132, P3=85, P4=95, P13=164 overdue 4+ past LT=2). Recent LTs stable avg 1.5 (last 4 obs: P2->4 LT2, P7->8 LT1, P8->10 LT2, P9->10 LT1). Use recent_4 for L to reflect shorter actual LT; recent_8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to match sustained low regime (backend computes (1+L)*27.4~55-82 mean demand over review+LT, low sigma~8-10; balances high service via z*~0.98 (19/20 crit ratio) vs holding, while low mu avoids overstock atop 476 stuck pipeline).

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P10-17: avg 27.4 (sustained 8 periods, -63% vs P1-9 avg 74.7); Lost shipment pattern extended: total stuck 476u confirmed unchanged (incl. P13 164u overdue 4+ periods)

No calendar spikes expected (summer less trouser demand). OH=92 covers ~3 periods demand; in-transit=476 stuck lost (P1=132u LT>3 overdue, P3=85u, P4=95u, P13=164u confirmed absent multiple concludes post-exp arrival). No new arrivals P18 conclude. Observed LTs unchanged (last 4 arrived: P2 LT2, P7 LT1, P8 LT2, P9 LT1; avg1.5). Set L=recent_4 to use avg1.5 (shorter recent LT despite losses); mu_hat=recent_9 (regime length=9) scales low mean over 1+L; sigma_hat=recent_9 for low recent volatility. Helps OR backend target low base_stock ~ (1+1.5)*27.3 +1.645*(sqrt(2.5)*4.4) ~55, avoiding overorder amid losses/holding while covering service (q=19/20=0.95).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24, late June summer): Women's skinny trousers in low demand regime sustained P10-19 (demands:29,28,36,23,28,30,19,26,27,31; avg=27.7, std~4.6; -63% vs P1-9 avg~74). No demand shift (P19=31 within 1 std). On-hand=61 covers ~2 periods at 28/demand. In-transit=476 stuck lost (P1:132u, P3:85u, P4:95u, P13:164u; unchanged, no arrivals P14-19). LT observed: sustained recent avg=1.5 (last 4: P2->P4:2, P7->P8:1, P8->P10:2, P9->P10:1). Parameters use recent regime for low demand/vol (N=10=max(min(10,20),3)) and recent LT (N=4) to set lower mu_hat/sigma_hat/base_stock reflecting current low forecast over shorter L, balancing service vs holding (OR backend sees high pipeline but cap/low mu limits overorder; addresses losses by low mu not relying on stuck pipeline).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01): Summer season for women's skinny trousers; low demand expected (hot weather favors lighter apparel). Low demand regime P10-20 sustained 11 periods avg 25.9 (285 sold/11), vol sd=7.35; P20=8 sharp drop (-69% vs regime avg) likely seasonal but 1 period. IP=53 oh +476 stuck int=529; stuck unchanged (476u permanent lost: P1=132/P3=85/P4=95/P13=164, no P20 arrival). No recent LT observations (last arr P10). To counter phantom IP & start replenishment (IP depletes only via sales from oh; post-oh=0 stockout risk), explicit inflate mu_hat=550 & sigma_hat=15 (base_stock~550+1.645*15~575>529, initial Q~46). High L=17 yields cap~550/18 +1.645*15/sqrt(18)~30.6+21.4/4.24~30.6+5=35.6 matching recent demand~26 (50% loss-adjusted supply). Ensures service despite losses/delays, low holding risk (oh stabilizes ~L*mu_p~75*1$=75/period << profit 26*19~494).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8, early summer): trousers demand low in summer heat. Low demand regime sustained P10-21 (12 periods, avg 24.8, -67% vs P1-9 avg 74.7), recent P20-21 avg 10.5 signals possible further drop but only 2 periods (monitor). Permanent lost shipments 476u stuck in-transit (P1:132, P3:85, P4:95, P13:164 overdue 7+ periods, absent P15-21 concludes); total in-transit 513u incl. recent P21:37 (exp P23 LT2). On-hand 40 covers ~3 periods at recent demand ~13. Observed LTs stable last 4 arrivals (P2->P4:2, P7->P8:1, P8->P10:2, P9->P10:1 avg1.5). Parameters: L recent_4 (1.5 avg); mu_hat recent_12 ((1+1.5)*24.8~37); sigma_hat recent_12 (std~8, sqrt(2.5)*8~12.6). Base_stock~37 + 1.64*12.6~58 << pipeline 553 \u2192 order=0, minimizes holding on excess pipeline while matching low demand, compensates losses by suppressing new orders.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15 mid-summer): Women's skinny trousers face seasonal ultra-low demand in July heat; recent P20-22 demands 8,13,17 avg 12.7 (-54% vs P10-19 spring low avg 27.7, changepoint at P20 sustained 3 periods). Pipeline 513u permanent stuck lost (unchanged P11-P22 no arrivals, total P1:132/P3:85/P4:95/P13:164/P21:37); P21 37u LT>=2 (LT=1 ruled out by P22 arrived=0), possible P23 arrival pending. On-hand 23 covers expected ~13 demand (end ~10). L recent_4 (last observed LTs P2:2/P7:1/P8:2/P9:1 avg 1.5). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_3 new summer regime (low mean/vol). Yields low base_stock ~(1+1.5)*12.7 + z*low_sigma ~32 + ~10 =42 <<536 pipeline -> order=0 conservative (avoids adding to stuck risk/holding given low demand/possible P21 arrival); high q=0.95 service but low mu/sigma minimizes unnecessary base_stock to cut holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: summer ultra-low avg 12.7 (P20-22: 8,13,17; -54% vs P10-19 avg 27.7, sustained 3 periods July summer dates); Lost shipment pattern extended: total stuck in-transit 513u confirmed unchanged multiple periods (incl. new P21 37u, P22 conclude arrived=0)

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22, mid-summer July): Women's skinny trousers face sustained ultra-low summer demand regime shift from P20 (avg 13.25 over P20-23: 8,13,17,15; -54% vs spring P10-19 avg 27.7), consistent with seasonal drop in warm weather for trousers. On-hand=45 covers ~3 periods at recent avg 13/demand; in-transit=476u confirmed stuck/lost (unchanged, including prior lost P1/3/4/13 etc., ignore for planning as no arrivals expected). No new overdue shipments (P21 arrived P23 LT=2; recent orders P22/23=0). Lead times recent stable avg~1.6 (last 5 observed: P2-P4 LT2, P7-P8 LT1, P8-P10 LT2, P9-P10 LT1, P21-P23 LT2). Use recent_N N=5 for L to reflect actual avg< promised 2, bridging OR backend's promised LT assumption. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=4 for current summer ultra-low mean/vol (std~3.3), ensuring base_stock targets low demand over (1+L)~2.6 periods (~34u mean), high service q=19/20=0.95 balances profit vs holding on excess OH.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 extended: summer ultra-low avg 13.25 (P20-23:8,13,17,15; -54% vs P10-19 avg 27.7, sustained 4 periods July summer); Lost shipment pattern extended: total stuck in-transit 476u confirmed unchanged (P23 conclude shows only P21 arrival, no others)

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25, 2019/7/29 late July summer; women's skinny trousers - off-peak summer low demand for tailoring. Summer ultra-low regime P20-24: demands 8,13,17,15,10 avg 12.6 (-54% vs P10-19 ~27.7), sustained 5 periods with low variance ~3.65. On-hand 35 covers ~3 periods at 12-13/demand; in-transit 476u permanent lost (unchanged, P24 conclude arrived=0 no new). Observed LTs: 2(P2->4),1(P7->8),2(P8->10),1(P9->10),2(P21->23); recent 5 avg 1.6 < promised 2, sustained. Use recent_N N=5 for L (avg1.6 bridges LT variability/losses), mu_hat/sigma_hat (low recent demand/volatility ensures conservative base_stock ~ (1+1.6)*12.6=35, low sigma for tight control; high q=19/20=0.95 service vs holding, avoids overstock on ultra-low demand while covering LT+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 extended: summer ultra-low avg 12.6 (P20-24:8,13,17,15,10; -54% vs P10-19 avg 27.7, sustained 5 periods late July); Lost shipment pattern extended: total stuck in-transit 476u confirmed unchanged (P24 conclude arrived=0); Recent LT avg 1.6 sustained (last 5 observed:2,1,2,1,2)

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5 early August summer): women's skinny trousers demand remains in ultra-low summer regime P20-25 (2019/6/24-7/29): demands 8,13,17,15,10,17 avg=13.33 std=3.72 (sample), sustained 6 periods -53% vs prior spring low P10-19 avg~27.7; calendar confirms low summer demand for trousers (warm weather favors lighter apparel, no imminent spikes). OH=18 covers ~1 recent demand; in-transit=476 stuck lost shipments unchanged (P25 conclude arrived=0, total junk P1=132/P3=85/P4=95/P13=164 confirmed absent multiple periods past LT=2). No expected arrivals P26 (recent orders P22-25=0). Recent LTs last 5 observed: 2,2,1,1,2 avg=1.6. To bridge backend's unawareness of 476 junk (falsely inflates IP=494), inflate mu_hat by junk+avg_d=476+13.33=489.33 atop normal forecast (L=1.6, 1+L=2.6, normal_mu=2.6*13.33=34.67, normal_sigma=sqrt(2.6)*3.72=6.00, z~1.645 safety~9.87, normal_BS~44.5); explicit mu_hat=34.67+489.33=524, sigma_hat=6.0 yields BS~534>494 triggers initial order~40 then backend chases prior demand Q_t=d_{t-1} automatically (IP stabilizes at BS-avg_d~521, real_pos=521-476~45=normal_BS maintaining high service vs holding). Cap ample ~524/2.6 +1.645*6/sqrt(2.6)~202+6~208>>order needs. L recent_5 uses evidenced avg LT drift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 extended: summer ultra-low avg 13.3 (P20-25:8,13,17,15,10,17; sustained 6 periods -53% vs P10-19 avg 27.7, late July-early Aug summer confirmed); Lost shipment pattern unchanged: total stuck in-transit 476u confirmed (P25 conclude arrived=0)

On-hand=0 after P26 stockout (demand=22>18); in-transit=516u (476u stuck lost + P26 40u); no new arrivals P26 conclude (P24 order exp absent).

Set L recent_5 for accurate avg LT~1.6; mu_hat recent_7 /(1+L) low mean~14.6 covers summer low over review+LT; sigma_hat recent_7 low vol~4.3 reduces buffer.

On-hand=0, stockouts P27-P28 lost ~$4.5k profit; in-transit=516u includes ~476u permanent lost + P26 40u overdue 2+ periods (absent P27-P28 concludes, exp LT=2 arrival P28). Pipeline overstated by lost shipments suppresses backend orders. Compensate with explicit high mu_hat=650 (equiv ~217/week over 1+L=3, aligns early-year highs 250+ and recent spike 167+) to target base_stock~860 >516 despite unreliable pipeline; default L=2 (promised, recent LT~1.6 but no new evidence); recent_3 sigma_hat captures high vol (std~74/period) for safety stock amid surge uncertainty. Enables positive order ~344 (pre-cap) to cover spikes, balancing high profit service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: late summer surge avg 86 (P26-28:22,69,167; +560% vs P20-26 summer ultra-low avg~14, accelerating trend sustained 3 periods); Lost shipment pattern extended: P26 (40u) lost (overdue 2+ past LT=2), total stuck in-transit 516u confirmed unchanged

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2 early Sept): Women's skinny trousers entering fall/back-to-school season with sustained late summer surge P26-29 demands (22,69,167,189 avg 111.75, +710% vs prior summer ultra-low ~13, regime_length=4 sustained/accelerating). On-hand=0, massive in-transit=855u (likely ~516u historical stuck losses + P29 339u + others; covers ~7-8 periods at recent demand). No new arrivals P29 conclude (P26 40u overdue 3+ periods, lost confirmed). Observed LTs unchanged (last 5: 2,1,2,1,2 avg1.6). Use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture new high mean/vol regime (avoids diluting with prior lows); recent_N N=5 for L (short/variable actual LT). Params boost base_stock for surge service level while cap limits overorder; bridges OR backend to actual LT/shortages/losses, balancing profit from sales vs holding on pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 extended P26-29: late summer/early fall surge avg 111.75 (22,69,167,189; +710% vs P20-25 summer ultra-low ~13, sustained 4 periods into Sept back-to-school); Lost shipment pattern extended: P26 (40u) overdue 3+ periods, total stuck ~516u + recent contributing to 855u in-transit unchanged arrivals

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9, early September, back-to-school season for women's skinny trousers). Surge regime from changepoint P27 extended to P30: demands P26-30 [22,69,167,189,176] avg 124.6 (+710% vs P20-25 summer ultra-low ~13, sustained 5 periods with accelerating high demands fitting fall apparel shopping). On-hand=0, recent high demand unsold due to stockouts; in-transit=855u includes ~500u+ permanent lost (P1/3/4/13/26 etc., no arrivals since P23) + P29 339u pending (exp arrival P31 if LT=2). Observed LTs only for arrived: last 5 [2,1,2,1,2] avg 1.6. Use recent_N=5 for L (captures recent variability avg~1.6), mu_hat (backend: ~2.6*124.6~323), sigma_hat (backend: sqrt(2.6)*~72.5~117) to target high base_stock ~323 + 1.64*117~500+ despite inflated/unreliable pipeline (lost shipments), balancing high service for surge (q~0.95) vs holding; cap also scales up. Addresses losses by volatility buffer + recent mean ignoring distant history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 extended P26-30: late summer/early fall surge avg 124.6 (22,69,167,189,176; +710% vs P20-25 summer ultra-low ~13, sustained 5 periods into early Sept back-to-school); Lost shipment pattern extended: no arrivals P24-30 concludes, total stuck in-transit 855u confirmed unchanged (permanent losses + P29 pending)

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16 mid-Sept): back-to-school season sustaining high demand for women's skinny trousers (tailoring/fall fashion). Recent P27-31 demands: 69,167,189,176,141 (avg 148.4, +710% vs summer ultra-low ~13); P26=22 transition low. Changelpoint at P27 confirmed sustained 5 periods (regime_length=5, N=5). Massive stockouts P26-31 (all ending OH=0, lost sales ~764u). In-transit 855u = permanent losses (no arrivals P24-31 concludes; e.g., P29 339u overdue past LT=2 expected P31 arrival, absent P31 conclude; total stuck unchanged). Observed LTs last 5: 2(P2->4),1(P7->8),2(P8->10),1(P9->10),2(P21->23) avg 1.6. Parameters: recent_N N=5 for L (short recent avg counters delays), mu_hat/sigma_hat (high recent mean/vol for (1+L)\xd7148.4 base & sqrt(1+L)\xd7high-std buffer). High mu/sigma inflate base_stock >> overstated pipeline (855 lost), triggering orders despite backend subtraction; balances service (avoid stockouts) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 extended P27-31: avg 148.4 (+710% vs P20-26 summer ~13, sustained 5 periods mid-Sept back-to-school); Lost shipment pattern extended: P29 (339u) confirmed lost (overdue past LT=2, absent P31 conclude), total stuck in-transit 855u unchanged

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23 late Sept, back-to-school season for women's skinny trousers). Surge regime from P27 changepoint sustained 6 periods P27-32 demands [69,167,189,176,141,163] avg 150.8 (+710% vs P20-26 summer ultra-low ~13), high volatility std~43. On-hand=0, stockout 163 sales lost P32. In-transit=855u permanent stuck losses confirmed unchanged (no arrivals P24-32 concludes, pattern per carry-over). Recent LTs sustained avg 1.6 (last 5 observed: P21:2, P9:1, P8:2, P7:1, P2:2). No expected arrivals this period. L=recent_5 to use actual avg 1.6 (backend L~1.6). mu_hat explicit=150.8*(1+1.6)+855~392+855=1247 to boost base_stock by stuck amount, effectively ignoring permanent pipeline losses so orders normal coverage (~392+z*sigma ~500u, ~3x recent demand). sigma_hat=recent_6 (std~43 * sqrt(2.6)~69.5 backend-computed) uses changepoint regime N=6=max(min(6,20),3). Ensures high service (q=19/20=0.95) during surge despite losses, orders rebuild inventory, limits holding via backend cap~480+70=550.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30 late Sep): Back-to-school/fall trouser demand surge regime since P27 (2019/8/12) extended to P27-33 avg 162.7 (69,167,189,176,141,163,234; sustained 7 periods, +1015% vs P20-26 summer ultra-low avg 14.6). On-hand=0 (stockouts P26-P33), in-transit=1342u bloated by permanent lost shipments (no arrivals P24-P33 10 concludes; prior stuck ~855u + P26 40u/P29 339u lost + P33 487u pending? but pattern suggests lost). Recent LT observations unchanged (last 5: 2,1,2,1,2 avg 1.6). To counter deadweight stuck pipeline (backend subtracts full 1342u) and enable positive orders/cover high demand/service, use L recent_5 (1.6 sustained); explicit mu_hat=2200 (~850 per-period equiv, inflated ~5x regime mean to build base_stock >> stuck); explicit sigma_hat=400 (inflated ~4.5x recent_7 sd~87 for vol/safety). Yields base~2200+1.64*400~2858 (>1342), implied cap~846+253~1100 allowing order~1100 now, incrementally rebuilding position w/o overholding on-hand (no intransit holding cost), high q=0.95 prioritizes sales recovery.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 extended P27-33: avg 162.7 (+1015% vs P20-26 avg 14.6, sustained 7 periods late summer-early fall back-to-school); Lost shipment pattern extended: no arrivals P24-33 (10 periods), in-transit 1342u confirmed stuck unchanged

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7, early Oct post-back-to-school). Demand surge regime P27-34 sustained 8 periods: avg 157 (69,167,189,176,141,163,234,117), +900% vs prior summer low ~14. On-hand=0, in-transit=2456 (~15.6 weeks equiv at 157/wk) bloated from lost shipments (no arrivals P24-34 concludes, 11 periods; prior stuck ~1342u + recent orders like P33=487 likely lost). No new LT observed (last P23 LT=2). To counter permanent stuck pipeline preventing orders (base < pipeline), set L explicit=20 (effective LT inflated for losses/delays, targets ~21-wk coverage: mu_hat=26*157=4082, sigma_hat~sqrt(26)*49.4~253, base~4082+1.645*253~4428 >2456). mu_hat recent_8 (regime length=8, changepoint P27 surge evidenced by +710% jump sustained), sigma_hat recent_8 (high vol ~49 std matches surge).

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14 mid-Oct post-back-to-school fall). Women's skinny trousers demand in sustained surge regime since P27 (9 periods P27-35: demands 69,167,189,176,141,163,234,117,76; avg 148, +900% vs prior summer lows ~14). Recent P34-35 taper to avg 96.5 (-41% vs P27-33 avg 163) but only 2 periods, not sustained shift (still >> prior 28). No arrivals in P24-35 concludes (12 periods), confirming permanent lost shipments pattern; in-transit 2695u effectively dead (backend unaware). On-hand 0 risks lost sales. Reconcile: stuck pipeline ignored by inflating explicit mu_hat ~2922 = 2695 stuck + (1+1.6)*142 recent mean ~3064 total base_stock target. L recent_5 observed LTs (2,1,2,1,2 avg1.6).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21 late Oct, fall post-back-to-school for women's skinny trousers): demand surge regime from P27 extended to P36 (10 periods, avg 139 vs summer ultra-low ~14, +900%), but tapering post-peak P33-36 avg 122 (-23% vs P27-32 avg 151). On-hand 664 covers ~10x recent demand (~62), total pipeline 3013 but unreliable (chronic delays/losses, e.g. P34 1114u overdue past LT=2 absent P36; historical stuck ~thousands). Recent LTs: last 6 observed (P35 LT1, P33 LT3, P21 LT2, P8 LT2, P9 LT1, P7 LT1) avg~1.7; use default L=2 (promised). Changepoint P27 sustained high demand/volatility confirmed 10 periods, recent_N N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures elevated mean/vol (~139, high std from peaks like 234), yielding higher base_stock = mu + 1.645*sigma for q=19/20=0.95 service; compensates unreliable pipeline/delays by boosting target coverage over (L+1) periods vs holding cost, avoiding stockouts while capping overorder.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering post-surge peak P33-36: avg 122.25 (234,117,76,62; -23% vs P27-32 avg 150.8), sustained 4 periods late Oct; LT=3 delay confirmed (P33 487u arrived P36); Deliveries resumed after 11-period gap (726u P36 incl. delayed P33/P35 LT1)

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28 late Oct, women's skinny trousers post-back-to-school, pre-Halloween/Thanksgiving, demand tapering sustained). Recent demands P33-37: 234,117,76,62,76 avg 113 (-25% vs P27-32 surge avg~151). On-hand 588 covers ~5-8 periods at recent demand; in-transit 2349 huge, likely incl. permanent losses (P34 1114u lost: placed P34 expected P36 LT2/P37 LT3 absent; prior stuck ~1342u unchanged). Expected P38 arrival: P36 380u if LT=2 (see P39). Observed LTs chronological: 2,1,2,1,2,3,1 (avg~1.7); recent 5: 2(P8),1(P9),2(P21),3(P33),1(P35) avg1.8. Use recent_N N=5 for L/mu/sigma to capture tapering demand regime (length=5) & LT variability: mu_hat~(1+1.8)*113~286 low vs prior surges, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.8)*71~119; base_stock~286 + 1.645*119~380 << 588+2349 pipeline, triggers order~0 minimizing holding costs on excess inv while service maintained.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering post-surge peak extended P33-37: avg 113 (234,117,76,62,76; -25% vs P27-32 avg 150.8), sustained 5 periods late Oct; P34 order (1114u) confirmed lost (overdue past LT=3, absent P36-P37 concludes); Recent LT avg 1.8 sustained (last 5 observed: 2,1,2,3,1)

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04 early Nov, approaching Thanksgiving/Black Friday holidays for women's skinny trousers - potential moderate apparel demand lift post-back-to-school). Demand tapering regime post-surge sustained P33-38 avg 111 (234,117,76,62,76,102; -25% vs P27-32 peak avg151, changepoint evidence: consistent drop sustained 6 periods late Oct-early Nov, no holiday spike yet). On-hand 486 covers ~4+ periods recent avg; in-transit 2349 mostly permanent lost/stuck (sustained pattern, e.g., P34 1114u lost overdue 4+; P36 380u overdue past LT=2 absent P38 conclude). Recent LTs last 5 observed (P21:2, P33:3, P35:1, P9:1, P8:2) avg1.8 sustained. Set L recent_N=5 for accurate pipeline timing despite losses; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=6 for tapering regime (N=regime_length=6>3), backend computes ~2.8x111=311 mu_hat with recent std~62 sqrt-scaled, targets high service (q~19/20=0.95) base stock ~320-350 covering demand+delay while capping orders low given high on-hand/pipeline to minimize holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering post-surge extended P33-38: avg 111 (-25% vs P27-32 avg 150.8, sustained 6 periods late Oct-early Nov); Lost shipment pattern extended: P36 (380u) overdue past LT=2 (absent P38 conclude); Recent LT avg 1.8 sustained (last 5 observed:2,3,1,1,2)

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11 mid-Nov, pre-Black Friday/Thanksgiving; women's skinny trousers - potential holiday uptick but evidence shows continued post-surge tapering). Recent demands P33-39 avg 101 (234,117,76,62,76,102,43), sustained 7 periods late Oct-early Nov; further drop P39=43 (-58% vs P38) but single period, not new regime. High pipeline (on-hand 823 + in-transit 1969=2792, incl. stuck losses ~2456u + pending); recent deliveries reliable LT1-3 (P39 conclude: P36 LT3). No new overdues (P37-39 orders=0). Reconcile: stuck losses unchanged, deliveries resumed post-gap. Params: L recent_5 (last arrived orders P36 LT3,P35 LT1,P33 LT3,P21 LT2,P9 LT1 avg=2.0, matches promised); mu_hat recent_6 (P34-39:117,76,62,76,102,43 avg79.3 for tapering regime excl. peak P33, (1+L)~3*79=237 base demand); sigma_hat recent_6 (captures recent vol ~60 from tapering/volatility). Ensures conservative base_stock ~237 +1.64*sigma vs high pipeline (likely order=0), balances low holding vs service for potential holiday demand while discounting stuck pipeline via recent demand focus.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering post-surge extended P33-39: avg 101 (-25% vs P27-32 surge avg151, sustained 7 periods late Oct-mid Nov); Recent LT avg 2.0 sustained (last 5 observed:3,1,3,2,1)

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18): late Nov pre-Thanksgiving/Black Friday; women's skinny trousers may see holiday clothing uptick, but demand tapering post-back-to-school surge sustained P33-40 (8 periods, avg 94 vs prior surge ~151, evidence: demands 234,117,76,62,76,102,43,42; recent P39-40 43/42 low confirms continuation, no new low regime yet <3 periods). On-hand 781 + in-transit 1969 (much stuck/lost per history, e.g., P34 1114u lost, total stuck pattern extended, no recent arrivals expected as P37-40 ordered=0). Massive pipeline ~2750 covers 20+ periods at 100/d or 60+ at 40/d. Recent LT stable avg~2 (last 5 observed: 3,1,3,2,1 per prior). Set L recent_5 (avg~2) to reflect actual; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_8 for tapering regime (length=8, max(8,3)<20). Yields conservative mu_hat~(3)*94=282, low base_stock ~282 +1.645*sigma; pipeline >> base_stock ensures order~0, balances high holding risk vs service amid losses/holiday uncertainty.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Late November, Black Friday (Nov 29) this week in P42, potential holiday demand spike for women's skinny trousers apparel ahead of Thanksgiving/shopping season. Recent demands P39-41:43,42,59 avg~48 (low), but P33-41 tapering post-back-to-school surge sustained 9 periods avg90.1 (-~40% vs P27-32 surge~151). High OH=722 (covers 8+ periods at avg90), in-transit=1969 (large stuck lost pattern confirmed prior, recent deliveries sparse P39 only). No recent orders (P37-41=0), so minimal expected arrivals soon; lost pattern means pipeline unreliable/overstated. No new overdue flags. Tapering regime changepoint at P33 (length=9 periods>3 sustained). Set L recent_5 (last 5 observed LTs:3,1,3,2,1 avg2.0, handles variability vs promised 2). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_9 (regime length=9, N=9) for (1+L)~3 * recent mean~90 mu_hat~270, recent std~62 (high early in regime), lowers base_stock vs default/all-history (early high demands inflate), counters stuck pipeline overstatement, balances high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding on excess inv, limits overordering via recent low mean while sigma buffers holiday volatility/spike risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering post-surge extended P33-41: avg 90 (-40% vs P27-32 avg151, sustained 9 periods late Oct-late Nov pre-holiday)

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): Cyber Monday, start of Christmas holiday retail peak for women's skinny trousers (apparel demand surges in Dec). P42 demand=182 (+100% vs P33-41 tapering avg~90), signals new holiday surge regime anchored by calendar (Black Friday P42~182, Cyber Monday today expect 200+/wk). On-hand=540 covers ~2-3wks at 200/wk; in-transit=1969u mostly permanent losses (no arrivals P40-42, pattern extended 20+ periods, older orders like P34 1114u overdue 8+ past LT=2-3). Backend pipeline=2509 overstates actual (~540 only), under-orders. Compensate with explicit high mu_hat=3000 (~1000/wk *3 for L~2 holiday forecast, matching/inflating surge peaks ~170 avg + buffer), sigma_hat=200 (elevated vol ~sqrt3*115 std/pd for holiday swings) to yield base_stock~3000+1.645*200~3330 >2509, enabling order~300-800 (capped ~3000/3 +1.645*200/1.73 ~1000+190=1190).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 date 2019/12/9 (early Christmas shopping season, expect elevated demand for women's trousers amid holiday parties/outfits). Recent demands P39-43:43,42,59,182(Black Friday spike),98 avg84.8 (P42-43 avg140 +55% vs P33-41 taper avg90, potential holiday shift but 2 periods). On-hand 442 + reliable intransit 820 (P43 order, not overdue) =1262 (> desired ~600 for L=2, mu_wk=140 holiday forecast; covers 9+ weeks remaining 4 periods). Stuck lost ~1969 bloating total intransit 2789 (no new losses confirmed, pattern extended but already noted). Recent LT last 5 observed (P39 LT3 P36order; P36 LT3 P33order, LT1 P35order; P23 LT2 P21order; P10 LT2 P8order): 3,3,1,2,2 avg2.2. No sustained changepoint (holiday <3 periods). Use recent_N N=5 across params (recent regime ~tapering+surge length>5, cap@5<20): adapts L~2.2, mu_hat~(1+2.2)*84.8~256, sigma_hat~sqrt(3.2)*~53~95 (std P39-43~53); base~256+1.64*95~411 <<3231 pipeline ensures order~0, balances high service (q=19/20) vs holding on excess while ignoring lost bloat.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16): Mid-December pre-Christmas holiday peak for women's skinny trousers; expect demand surge as shoppers buy holiday outfits. Recent demands P42-44 (182,98,154) confirm changepoint shift to holiday surge regime (avg 145, +60% vs P33-41 taper avg~90), sustained 3 periods. On-hand 288 covers ~2 periods at 145/d; massive in-transit 2789u mostly stuck lost shipments (no arrivals P40-44, pattern per history), overstates true pipeline--but backend sees high pipeline so low order anyway. Reconcile: P43 (820u) pending exp LT=2 arrival during P45 (visible P46). Observed LTs recent 6: 3,3,1,2,2,1 avg exactly 2.0. Use recent_N N=6 for L (avg LT=2); recent_N N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime length=3, mu_hat=3*145=435 covers surge; balances high service for profit=19 vs holding=1 amid stuck inv illusion). Endgame (45/47) favors measured base_stock to avoid excess orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: holiday pre-Christmas surge avg 144.7 (P42-44:182,98,154; +60% vs P33-41 taper avg~90), sustained 3 periods early-mid Dec; Recent LT avg 2.0 confirmed (last 6 obs:3,3,1,2,2,1)

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas (after P46 date 12/23), women's skinny trousers demand in holiday surge regime P42-46 avg 128.4 (182,98,154,133,75), but P46=75 shows -44% drop from P45=133 signaling potential post-holiday lull (similar to early 2019 Jan drop after high). High pipeline: OH=900 + IT=1969=2869 covers 20+ periods even at 128/wk demand, holding cost pressure high ($1/u/p). Recent LT stable avg~2.0 (last 6 obs per carry-over). No new overdue/lost shipments (recent arrivals P45 LT2, P39 LT3 on time-ish). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture holiday regime length (P42 changepoint sustained 5p) with recent drop influencing mean/vol; recent_N=6 for L per sustained avg 2.0. Keeps OR base_stock holiday-calibrated ~ (1+2)*128=384 + z*sigma but pipeline >> base_stock so order~0, prioritizes depleting excess inv to cut holding costs while prepared if surge lingers into New Year's.
