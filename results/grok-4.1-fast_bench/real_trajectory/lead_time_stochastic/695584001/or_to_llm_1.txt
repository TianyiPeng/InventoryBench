{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent concluded arrivals show variable LT 1-3 periods (e.g., P45: P42 LT3, P43 LT2; P43: P40 LT3, P41 LT2), with intermittent losses (e.g., P38 confirmed lost overdue 3+ past P40). In-transit 1010 matches sum of known stuck shipments per insights (effective reliable pipeline ~0). Inventory analysis: On-hand 607 is very high; recent demand P43-P46: 17,10,32,17 (avg 19, volatile but low vs Oct-Nov ~55, -65%). Covers 30+ periods at current rate, even assuming LT=3 + current period (expected demand ~76). Post-Christmas (P46 Dec23, now P47 Dec30) lull expected for women's fashion belt accessory\u2014no New Year's spike anticipated; demand likely stable-low into winter. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and full history (mean inflated by summer peaks but base-stock exceeded by high inventory/pipeline).
