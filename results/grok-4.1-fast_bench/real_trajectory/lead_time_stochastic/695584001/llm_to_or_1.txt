Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), near Valentine's Day (Feb 14), women's hip belt accessory may see demand uplift. No prior orders or conclude messages; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand: 0,0,37,61,109 (mean=41.4); changepoint after Jan-14 (regime length=3: 37,61,109 mean=69, std~27.6). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat=(1+2)*69=207 and sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*27.6~48 to capture rising trend proactively. L='default' (promised=2, no observations yet). Higher mu/sigma raises base_stock (q=19/20=0.95, z~1.645) for service level vs holding, covering ~3 periods demand post-decision.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-2019-01-14: avg from ~0 to 69 (+\u221e%), sustained 3 periods

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18), post-Valentine's Day (Feb 14). Women's belt accessory; demand likely influenced by early-year fashion/accessory ramp-up, with possible stabilization post-holiday. Carry-over regime shift post-2019-01-14 confirmed and extended to 4 periods (37,61,109,63; avg 67.5, all >> early 0s). No lead-time observations yet (P1 order=130 in-transit, no arrivals concluded; expected arrival during P3 if L=2, visible P3 conclude). On-hand=0 risks missing demand again. Use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to weight high-demand regime ((1+L)*67.5 ~202 mu, sigma ~sqrt(3)*26~45), default L=2. Raises base_stock ~202 + 1.645*45~276, order ~276-130=146 to cover 3-period demand at high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding, bridging unobserved arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), women's belt accessory. Late Feb, no major holidays imminent; demand in high regime post-01-14 changepoint (carry-over), confirmed sustained with P1:63, P2:90 (both >> early 0s). Full demands: hist 0,0,37,61,109 + game 63,90; recent 5 (37,61,109,63,90) avg~72 vs all~51, higher mean appropriate. On-hand=0, in-transit=247 (P1:130+P2:117), no arrivals observed yet (P1 order expected during P3 arrival phase, visible P4). No concluded lead times, so L=default (promised 2). recent_N=5 (regime_length=5>=3) for mu_hat/sigma_hat raises base_stock for elevated demand over (1+2)=3 periods, ensuring coverage despite stockouts (high profit=19 justifies q~0.95 service vs holding=1).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, no major holidays or seasonal spikes for women's belt accessory; demand stable in recent regime post-01-14 shift (carry-over), last 3 periods avg 71 (P1:63, P2:90, P3:60). No arrivals in P1-P3 concludes despite promised LT=2 (P1 order overdue as expected in P3); in-transit=296 (P1:130+P2:117+P3:49) provides buffer if arrives but delay suggests longer LT\u2014use default L=2 (no observed LTs yet for calculate/recent). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to focus on sustained regime (N=3=max regime evidence, stable variance); mu_hat~(1+2)*71=213 covers 3 periods demand; sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*16.5~28.6 for volatility. High profit/holding ratio favors higher base_stock to avoid stockouts despite pipeline, bridging delay via recent demand focus.

Carry-over insight: P1 order overdue: expected arrive P3 (LT=2) but P3 conclude arrived=0; monitor for pattern

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11), early March, women's belt accessory; no major calendar events impacting demand (post-Valentine's stabilization). Recent demands stable post carry-over shift: P1:63, P2:90, P3:60, P4:57 (avg 67.5, regime length 4 periods, no new changepoint). Pipeline reconciliation: in-transit 179 = P1:130 (overdue, expected P3 arrival for LT=2 but P3/P4 arrived=0/not it; possible LT>=4 or lost, monitor as per carry-over) + P3:49 (expected P5). On-hand 60 covers ~1 period demand. Use default L=2 (one confirmed LT=2 from P2->P4, OR uses promised unaware of issues). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_4 for stable recent regime, yielding ~202 mu over 3 periods (high service q=19/20=0.95 covers variance); bridges potential P1 loss by basing on observed demand, avoids overstocking given holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18), mid-March, women's grained leather hip belt accessory; no major holidays, demand steady post-early Jan shift (carry-over). Recent P1-5 demands: 63,90,60,57,48 (mean=63.6, std=15.8); stable regime, no new changepoint. On-hand=12 (low), in-transit=186 includes P1(130 likely lost: expected P3 arrive per LT=2, but P3-P5 concludes arrived=0, no later arrival), P3(49 overdue: expected P5, P5=0), P5(7 pending). Only confirmed LT=2 (P2->P4). Lost shipments inflate perceived pipeline, causing OR under-ordering. Set L explicit=3 to extend coverage to 4 periods, compensating delays/losses (effective LT longer/unreliable). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5: m\xfb=4*63.6=254.4, \u03c3\u0302=\u221a4*15.8=31.6; base_stock\u2248254+1.645*32\u2248306, order\u2248min(306-198, cap\u224864+26=90)\u224890 units to replenish losses proactively. High q=19/20=0.95 prioritizes service over low holding cost.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (130 units) confirmed lost: no arrival in P3-P5 concludes despite expected P3 (LT=2); shipment loss pattern emerging, inflating in-transit by ~70%

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Accessory belt in steady high-demand regime (~63 avg last 6 periods: 63,90,60,57,48,59; no major calendar events, pre-Easter ~4wks out). On-hand 0, in-transit 269 inflated by lost P1(130)+likely P3(49)=179 (~67%). Successful LTs: P2 order LT=2, P5 LT=1 (avg 1.5), but 50% loss rate (P1,P3) signals unreliable supply. Set L explicit=3 to buffer delays/losses (raises 1+L to 4 periods coverage). mu_hat recent_N N=6 captures sustained regime mean 62.8*(4)=251. sigma_hat recent_N N=6 std~14.2*sqrt(4)=28. OR backend targets base_stock~251+1.645*28~298 >269 pipeline (orders ~29, <cap~86), enabling stock build for service (q=0.95) while limiting holding amid unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern sustained: P3(49 units) confirmed lost (expected P5 for LT=2, no arrival P5-P6); cumulative lost P1(130)+P3(49)=179 units (67% of 269 in-transit). Successful LT avg=1.5 periods (P2:2, P5:1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1, early spring): Women's belt accessory; steady non-seasonal demand ~64 avg (P1-P7: 63,90,60,57,48,59,74; std~12.7), no imminent spikes (Easter ~4/21). On-hand=0, in-transit=299 overstated by 179 lost (P1:130, P3:49 confirmed via no arrivals past expected); effective pipeline~120 (P6:90 + P7:30). P7 conclude arrived=0 (expected none). Observed LTs: P2->P4 (2), P5->P6 (1), avg=1.5; losses inflate pipeline/reduce reliability. Set L explicit=4 (>promised 2, buffers losses/delays by extending review+lead coverage); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 (N=7=regime length post-early shift, stable evidence) yields mu_hat=5*64.4~322, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*12.7~28.4, base_stock~322+1.645*28.4~368 >299 \u2192 order~69 (covers ~1 period effective shortage); cap accommodates. Inflated L targets higher base_stock to overcome ghost pipeline, ensuring orders despite overstatement while high z (q=19/20=0.95) prioritizes service over holding.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early spring, Easter on 4/21 (P11), potential modest demand uptick for women's belts/accessories but no evidence yet; recent demands stable avg~65 (P1-8: 64.9, P4-8: 61.2), low vol std~13. Cumulative lost shipments 179 (P1:130, P3:49) inflate in-transit 253 (effective pipeline~126=52 on-hand +74 P8 pending); total pipeline 305 overstated. Recent LTs (P2:2, P5:1, P6:2, P7:1) avg 1.5 confirmed sustained. To counter ghost inventory and trigger orders (base_stock >305), use explicit L=3 (promised 2 +1 equiv for loss risk/unreliability); mu_hat=450 (~4pd*112 inflated from 65 by ~73% to offset ~28% loss rate + buffer, covers ~7pd demand equiv); sigma_hat=80 (inflated from ~sqrt(4)*13~26 for high safety ~131 z-sigma). Yields base~581 (>305), order~276 but capped ~177 (inflated mean_per 112 + safety~65), builds buffer vs stockouts (52 on-hand vs ~65 demand). Addresses losses by inflating targets to overcome overstated pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15), mid-spring near Easter (4/21), but no demand spike evidence (recent: P9=51, P8=68, P7=74 avg~64; all-time avg~63). Stable demand regime post-early shift. Pipeline=432 includes confirmed lost P1(130)+P3(49)=179 (42%), pending P8(74 expected LT2 in P10 arrival), P9(179). On-hand=1 critically low, but bloated pipeline suppresses orders naturally. L=calculate uses observed LTs (P2:2, P5:1, P6:2, P7:1 avg=1.5), better reflects variable actual LT vs promised 2. mu_hat/sigma_hat=default leverages full stable history scaled by computed L~1.5 (mu~(1+1.5)*63~158, sigma~sqrt(2.5)*16~25), balancing service (q=19/20=0.95) vs holding; compensates losses indirectly via pipeline deduction.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22, post-Easter Monday). Accessory belt demand stable ~62 avg over 10 periods (sd=13.1), recent P8-P10:68/51/47 slight dip possibly Easter-related but avg~55 not sustained shift (only 3 periods, avg last4=60). On-hand 207 (~3.4 periods coverage), in-transit 179=confirmed lost P1(130)+P3(49), phantom inflating pos=386. No pending real arrivals. To prevent chronic stockouts from phantom (backend delays orders until onhand < base-phantom), inflate base_stock by lost=179: normal (L=1.5 recent avg, 1+L=2.5, mu_d=61.7, sigma_d=13.1 \u2192 mu_hat=154.25, sigma_hat=20.7, z\u03c3\u224834, base\u2248188); set explicit mu_hat=154+179=333 (inflated mean), sigma_hat=21. Base~333+34=367 <386 (order 0 now ok), maintains effective real pos~188 as pos depletes ~60/period, triggering timely replenishment despite phantom. Addresses losses by offsetting phantom in target. Cap ample. No demand changepoint (stable post-initial ramp).

Carry-over insight: Shipment loss pattern resolved: no losses since P3, 6 consecutive successful deliveries P2(LT2),P5(1),P6(2),P7(1),P8(2),P9(1); fixed early phantom 179 units inflating in-transit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29, late April post-Easter). Women's belt accessory; no major seasonal spikes expected. Demand stable ~60/period (P7-P11 avg 59, all P1-P11 avg 61); no new changepoint. On-hand 151 (~2.5 periods demand), in-transit 179 (phantom lost P1+P3, pattern resolved per carry-over). Recent LTs sustained pattern: last 6 obs (P2:2, P5:1, P6:2, P7:1, P8:2, P9:1) avg 1.5.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6): Early May, spring season for women's belt accessory; steady non-seasonal demand ~50-60 units/period, no major events imminent. Recent demands P8-P12: 68,51,47,56,49 (avg 54.2, std ~7.9), stable regime no new changepoint. On-hand 102 covers ~2 periods; in-transit 179 phantom from resolved early losses (P1,P3), no recent orders so no arrivals expected. Confirmed LT pattern: recent 6 successful (P2:2,P5:1,P6:2,P7:1,P8:2,P9:1; avg 1.5). Use recent_6 for L (1.5 expected LT bridges to backend); recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (54.2 mean, ~8 std; for L~1.5, mu_hat~(2.5*54)=135 covers pipeline gap; high q=19/20=0.95 targets near-perfect service vs holding; sigma recent low vol ensures conservative base-stock).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13), mid-May post-Mother's Day (May 12, 2019), possible post-holiday demand dip in P13 (27 vs recent avg ~50), no major upcoming events like Memorial Day (5/27) yet impacting belts/accessories. Demands P8-P13 (68,51,47,56,49,27) avg 49.67, std~13.4; stable recent regime length 6 (slight decline from earlier ~60 but sustained 6 periods, P13 dip single outlier not changepoint). Inventory: on-hand 75, in-transit 179=permanent phantom from confirmed lost P1(130)+P3(49), no real transit (no orders P10-P13, all recent deliveries concluded). Actual position 75 low for 2.5 periods demand (~125). L recent_6 reflects sustained avg LT=1.5 (last 6: 2,1,2,1,2,1). sigma_hat recent_6=sqrt(2.5)*13.4~21 for recent vol. mu_hat explicit=2.5*49.67 +179 phantom~303 inflates base by exactly 179: base_set~(303 +1.645*21)~338 = true_base~(125+35)=160 +179; order~338-254=84 =160-75, perfectly compensates phantom for true service level q=0.95 while minimizing excess hold on real inv.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20): Late spring; women's hip belt demand dropping recently (P11:56, P12:49, P13:27, P14:22; changepoint ~P13 with avg ~38.5 last 4 vs prior ~55 overall mean), possible seasonal slowdown post-winter/early spring peak (historical samples also show ramp-up Jan-Feb). On-hand 53 covers ~2-3 periods at recent demand; in-transit 267 high but losses resolved (per carry-over, 6 successful LTs since). LT pattern sustained alternating 1-2 (last 6: P2:2,P5:1,P6:2,P7:1,P8:2,P9:1; avg 1.5). Use recent_6 for L to reflect avg 1.5 < promised 2, reducing over-ordering. Mu/sigma recent_5 (P10-14 demands 47,56,49,27,22: mean~40.2, low var) for (1+L)~2.5-3 period forecast, balancing high q=19/20=0.95 service vs holding amid dropping regime; OR backend caps prevent excess orders given high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg dropped from ~55 (P1-12) to ~33 (+/-40% lower P12-14:49/27/22); sustained 3 periods

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, Memorial Day - potential minor retail bump for accessories, but recent demand sharply dropping: P13-15: 27/22/14 avg=21 (-65% from prior ~60 avg P1-12), regime shift sustained 3+ periods per carry-over. High inventory (on-hand 39 + in-transit 267 = 306) covers ~15 periods at 21/demand rate; no recent stockouts. P14 order (88) pending arrival (expected P15-16 given avg LT 1.5 pattern, P15 arrived=0 consistent). Losses resolved, 6 consecutive successes avg LT=1.5. Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low-demand/low-var regime (mean~21, std~6.6); recent_N N=6 for L to use sustained avg 1.5 LT pattern (observed: P2:2,P5:1,P6:2,P7:1,P8:2,P9:1). Lower mu_hat~52.5, sigma~16.6, L=1.5 informs OR backend for conservative base-stock ~mu + z*sigma (high q=19/20=0.95 implies z~1.6), reducing overorder vs default higher stats, minimizing holding costs on excess inv.

Carry-over insight: Demand drop sustained into Period 15: P13-15 avg 21 (-65% vs P1-12 ~60), now 3 periods; monitor if Memorial Day reverses.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3, early summer post-Memorial Day 5/27). Demand in sustained low regime since P13 changepoint: P13-16 demands 27/22/14/8 avg 17.75 (-70% vs P1-12 avg ~60.2), confirmed no Memorial Day reversal (P16=8 low); possible seasonal drop for women's hip belt accessory. On-hand 31 (covers ~2 periods at recent rate), in-transit 267 = confirmed permanent ghosts P1(130)+P3(49)=179 + pending P14(88 overdue: no P16 arrival despite expected LT=2 from even-period pattern, monitor for LT=3/loss). LT from 6 successful concludes: 2,1,2,1,2,1 avg 1.5. High reported pipeline due to ghosts causes backend under-ordering. Bridge by explicit mu_hat = (1+1.5)*17.75 + 179 ghosts \u224844.4 +179=223.4, yielding base_stock ~223 +1.645*~11.5 ~242; order=242-298=0 now (appropriate), later post-arrivals: 242-(179+real_pipe) \u224863-real_pipe (correct un-inflated). L recent_N=6 for accurate 1.5 (alternating pattern); mu_hat explicit inflated; sigma_hat recent_N=4 for low-vol regime (std~7.3). Lowers service slightly but cuts holding on overstock.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime P13-16 avg 17.75 (-70% vs P1-12 ~60), sustained 4 periods; Memorial Day P16=8 confirms no reversal. P14(88) 1-period overdue (no P16 arrival, expected LT=2); monitor.

On-hand=19 covers ~1 period dem; in-transit=267 inflated by phantom losses P1(130)+P3(49)=179 + P14(88 overdue 2p past expected P16 LT2, no arr P16/17 conclude - potential new loss, monitor). Successful LTs stable avg1.5 (6 obs: P2:2,P5:1,P6:2,P7:1,P8:2,P9:1). Use recent_6 L to match recent avg1.5 (vs promised2), preventing overorder amid phantoms. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 for low regime (N=5=max(min(5,20),3)), scaling (1+L)~2.5x low mean/vol ~41mu low to cover review+LT dem w/ z* high service (profit19>>hold1). Reduces base_stock vs default high-hist, curbs excess holding on pipeline.

In-transit 267=100% phantom from confirmed lost shipments P1(130 LT overdue since P3), P3(49 overdue since P5), P14(88 overdue 3 periods past expected P16 LT2, no arr P16-18 concludes); effective pipeline=0, on-hand=11 low vs ~15 demand risk stockout. Reported IP=278 inflated. L=calculate (6 obs: 2,1,2,1,2,1 avg1.5). To compensate phantom, explicit mu_hat=240 (~2.5*96 per-per high-season blend), sigma_hat=50 (~per-per std 32 hist vol); yields base_stock~240+1.645*50=322 >278, order~44 to reach real target ~2.5*15+1.645*sqrt(2.5)*7.5~57 (Q=57-11), high service q=0.95 vs low holding. Cap~100+47~147>44 safe. Addresses losses by inflating targets to force ordering despite phantom IP.

Carry-over insight: P14(88 units) confirmed lost: no arrival P16-P18 despite expected P16 (LT=2), overdue 3 periods; renewed loss pattern, total phantom 130(P1)+49(P3)+88=267 (100% of in-transit). Low demand regime P13-18 avg 15.2 (-75% vs P1-12 60.2), sustained 6 periods.

LT stable alternating 1/2, avg=1.5 from 6 successful (P2@4 LT2, P5@6 LT1, P6@8 LT2, P7@8 LT1, P8@10 LT2, P9@10 LT1). L=recent_N N=6 for avg1.5. Real forecast: mu=2.5*15.6=39, sigma=sqrt(2.5)*7.2=11.3. Inflate mu_hat explicit=306 (=real 39 +267 phantom) so base_stock~306+1.645*11.3~325 >312 pipeline, orders ~13 (capped irrelevant), effective real position~45+13=58 covers ~3.5 low-demand periods (high service q=0.95 good for profit=19>>holding=1). Sigma explicit recent low vol avoids excess safety.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8, early summer post-July 4th holiday). Hip belt (women's summer accessory) demand spiked P20:53/P21:77 (+300% vs P13-19 low regime avg16), returning to early-year high ~60-70, likely seasonal recovery after Memorial Day dip (P16 5/27:8 low).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15, mid-summer). Demand changepoint at P20: spiked from low regime P13-19 avg~17 to P20-22 avg79.7 (+370%), sustained 3 periods; likely seasonal summer uptick for women's belt accessory. Recent stockouts (ending OH=0 P19-22), high demand P22=109. In-transit=522 inflated by confirmed losses ~267 (P1=130,P3=49,P14=88); real pipeline lower ~255. P19 order=45 overdue (exp P21 LT=2, no arr P21-22 concludes). LT observed 7 times: 3x1 +4x2, avg1.57. Use L 'calculate' for avg observed LT~1.57<2. mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=3 for new high-demand regime (mean79.7, std~28). Parameters boost base_stock/mu_hat ~206 to cover ~2.57p demand despite inflated pipeline, increase service level vs holding; higher sigma z* for stockout protection; lower L reduces overstock risk given actual shorter LT.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: avg increased from 17.4 (P13-19) to 79.7 (P20-22, +370%); sustained 3 periods

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22, late July summer; women's grained leather hip belt accessory). Demand high regime since P20 changepoint (P20-23: 53/77/109/173, mean=103 +500% vs P13-19 low ~17), sustained 4 periods with escalation (P23=173 record high). On-hand=37 low vs recent ~100+ demand (P23 sold=173 from 210 start). In-transit=312 inflated ~133 ghosts: P14(88)+P19(45) lost (P19 ordered P19 expected P21 LT=2, no arr P21-P23 overdue 3 periods). Real pipeline ~179, total real ~216 (needs ~300+ for 3pd coverage). 9 observed LTs avg~1.56 (seq 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,1 recent stable 1-2). L=calculate uses avg observed LT~1.56. mu_hat explicit=460: 3pd forecast 3*110=330 (up from recent 103 for trend) +133 ghosts offset. sigma_hat explicit=95: ~sqrt(3)*52 recent per-pd std.

Carry-over insight: P19(45 units) confirmed lost: no arrival P21-P23 despite expected P21 (LT=2), overdue 3 periods; renewed loss pattern post-P11: P14(88)+P19(45)=133 ghost units inflating in-transit

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5): Early August, back-to-school season ramping for women's belt accessories; demand sustained high post-P20 regime shift (P20-25 demands:53,77,109,173,106,68; avg~97.7, +470% vs P13-19 low~17). On-hand=0, in-transit=556 inflated by confirmed ghosts P14(88)+P19(45)=133 (possibly more from early). Recent LTs consistent avg~1.56 (9 obs: mostly 1-2 alternating, last: P20:2,P21:2,P22:1). No new arrivals overdue (P24:244 expected P26 LT2, post-decision). Use 'calculate' for L to leverage empirical avg LT<2, shortening (1+L); 'recent_N' N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor high-demand regime (regime_length=6>=3), boosting base_stock for service amid losses/stockouts (P25 sold=0); default cap accommodates. Balances high q=19/20 service vs low holding by focusing forecast on recent high mu/vol, empirical L reduces overstock risk from ghosts/inflation.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime P20-25 avg 97.7 (+470% vs P13-19 17.4), sustained 6 periods including post-peak P25=68; no reversal.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12, mid-August, late summer/back-to-school season emerging; hip belt accessories may see steady/tourism demand, no major spikes imminent). High demand regime since P20 changepoint (avg P20-26=96.1, +450% vs P13-19 low 17.4), sustained 7 periods (N=7>3). Cumulative confirmed lost shipments=312 units (P1:130, P3:49, P14:88, P19:45), inflating in-transit 556 (ghosts 312 + P24:244 overdue by 1 period past expected P26 LT=2; real pipeline ~244 or 0). On-hand=0, recent stockouts P25-26 (68+87 lost sales). Reconcile: backend sees overstated pipeline, underorders; compensate by explicit mu_hat=600 = recent_7 (1+2)*96.1\u2248288 + phantom 312 adjustment, yielding base\u2248600 + 1.645*68\u2248712; order\u2248712-556=156 (covers ~1-2 weeks demand, true position\u2248400=(288+112 real base)).

LLM Rationale:

Recent high demand regime P20-27 (53,77,109,173,106,68,87,91) avg 95.5 (+450% vs P13-19 avg17), sustained 8 periods post-changepoint P20, std~36.4 (vs early ~13); on-hand=0, stockouts P24-27. In-transit=713 inflated ~53% by confirmed ghosts: P14(88)+P19(45)+P24(244 lost, overdue past P27/LT=3)=377. Observed LTs (9): avg~1.56 (sequence 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,1), stable no changepoint. Use 'calculate' for L=avg LT~1.56 (shorter than promised 2). 'recent_N' N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to boost base_stock~(1+1.56)*95.5 + z*36.4*sqrt(2.56) >> inflated pipeline, ensuring orders despite ghosts for high demand coverage; high sigma aids safety stock vs vol/stockouts.

Carry-over insight: P24(244 units) confirmed lost: no arrival P26-P27 despite expected P26 (LT=2), overdue past LT=3; renewed loss pattern P14/P19/P24, total ghosts 377 (~53% of 713 in-transit).

P28 demand=88 sustains high regime P20-28 (9 periods, changepoint P20: avg94.7 +450% vs P13-19 17.4, std~34.2 +160% vs P1-12 ~13). No P28 arrival expected (P26=0 for LT=2). Successful LTs (9 obs): avg1.56 (mix 1-2). To bridge OR unawareness of ghosts: L default=2 (matches promised/avg); mu_hat explicit=840= normal (3*94.7=284) +556 ghost adjustment, yielding base_stock~840 +1.645*sqrt(3)*34.2~840+97=937; order~937-713=224 (cap~840/3 +1.645*34.2~280+56=336 allows), so real pipeline post-order 157+224~381=normal base, covering ~3 periods high demand at high service (q=19/20=0.95) vs low holding. Sigma recent_N=9 captures vol surge.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost shipments updated: 556 units (P1:130, P3:49, P14:88, P19:45, P24:244; overdue 26+/24+/13+/8+/3 periods), 78% of 713 in-transit; real pipeline=157 (P27 only).

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2 Labor Day): High demand regime sustained P20-29 (10 periods, avg 94.1, std 32.3, +450% vs P13-19 avg17.4), P29=89 fits, no reversal despite Labor Day/end-summer; volatility elevated vs P1-12 std~13.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16): Mid-September, back-to-school season may support steady accessory belt demand. On-hand 28 low vs recent demand ~60-90 (risk stockout P32 absent arrivals). In-transit 885 inflated by confirmed ghosts 556 (P1/3/14/19/24); real pipeline P29(225)+P30(104)=329, real coverage 357 (~4-5 periods at 80/wk). High demand regime P20-31 sustained 12 periods (changepoint P20, avg 89.2 std~30.2 vs prior lows; recent P29-31 89/71/58 avg73 softening -20% but not confirmed new regime <3 strong evidence). Recent LT: P27=3 (1 obs), prior 1-2, avg all observed~1.7. P29 overdue past LT2 (no P31 arr), but like P27 may LT3 arrive P32; monitor loss not confirmed. To counter ghosts inflating pipeline (OR sees 913, orders 0 on defaults/recent), set L explicit=12 (longer effective LT proxy for losses/delays: ghosts=~63% pipeline equivalent to supply risk). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=12 (regime N=min(12,20)=12): backend (1+12)*89.2~1157 mu, sqrt13*30.2~109 sigma, base~1157+1.645*109~1335 >>913 (order~min(422, cap~89+1.645*30~147)=147 sensible qty balancing profit19 vs hold1).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23): Late September, post-Labor Day/back-to-school, women's leather hip belt demand likely steady fall transition. Recent demand P30-32:71/58/55 avg61.3, drop -35% from P20-29 avg94.1 (sum941/10), changepoint at P30 sustained 3 periods. High vol regime prior (std~35 P23-32). Ghosts dominate in-transit 922 (prior confirmed lost~556 + P24:244 + P29:225 overdue2=1025? but reported922; real pipeline low ~141(P32 pending)). On-hand77 covers ~1 period. L recent_5= avg2.0 (LTs: P20:2,P21:2,P22:1,P27:3,P30:2) matches promised/variable. mu recent_3 reflects drop to prevent overstock. sigma recent_10 (P23-32 std~35) maintains high safety stock (z~1.645 q=19/20=0.95) to counter ghosts/underordering, boost base_stock - inflated pipeline for more orders, balance service/holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg dropped from 94.1 (P20-29) to 61.3 (P30-32, -35%); sustained 3 periods; P29(225 units) 2-periods overdue past expected P31 (LT=2), no arr P31-P32; monitor for renewed loss pattern

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30): Late September, women's hip belt demand steady post-summer peak, no major holidays imminent (Halloween end-Oct minor for accessories). Low on-hand=6 vs recent demand~64 risks immediate stockout. Demand drop regime from high P20-29 avg94 to P30-33 avg63.75 (-32%), sustained 4 periods confirmed. Confirmed lost shipments: P29(225) no arr P31-33 (overdue 3+ past LT2 expected P31), total ghosts~781 (prior 556 +225), ~85% of 922 in-transit; real pipeline~141 (P32:141 expected P34 LT2). Recent successful LTs: last 2 = LT3 (P27->P30), LT2 (P30->P32) avg2.5; use recent_N N=2 for L to extend coverage for variable LT. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=4 for P30-33 drop (mean63.75 std~8.45), backend computes (1+~2.5)*63.75~200 base, high q=19/20 service covers low real pipeline + variability while minimizing hold on ghosts.

Carry-over insight: P29(225 units) confirmed lost: no arrival P31-P33 despite expected P31 (LT=2), overdue 3 periods; total confirmed lost 781 units (prior 556 +225), 85% of 922 in-transit, real pipeline=141 (P32). Demand drop regime P30-33 avg63.75 (-32% vs P20-29 94.1), sustained 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07), women's grained leather hip belt accessory; Q4 start, ~3 weeks to Halloween but recent demands steady no spike. Demand drop regime from P20-29 high ~94 to P30-34 avg 64.8 (-32%) sustained 5 periods, low vol std~7.7. Confirmed lost 781 units (P1/3/14/19/24/29), inflate in-transit 922 (real pipeline ~141 P32 order, 1p overdue past expected P34 LT=2). On-hand 0, stockout risk. Reconcile: ghosts phantom, real coverage critically low for ~2 periods demand. L recent_5 (last 5 LTs:2,3,1,2,2 avg2.0) for accurate LT. mu_hat recent_5 (P30-34 mean64.8 *(1+2)=194.4) for current regime. sigma_hat explicit 900 inflates base_stock~194+1.645*900~1679 >922 (order~757 < cap~65+855~920), forces backend to order ~757 despite bloated pipeline, covering ~11p demand + safety; high sigma bridges lost shipment uncertainty, prioritizes service (low holding $1 vs profit$19).

Carry-over insight: Demand drop regime P30-34 avg64.8 (-32% vs P20-29 94.1), sustained 5 periods; Volatility drop P30-34 std7.7 (-78% vs P20-29 34), sustained 5 periods

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14): Women's hip belt accessory, mid-October approaching Halloween/Thanksgiving holiday ramp-up potential for fashion items; monitor for demand increase but no evidence yet (P35=60 fits sustained drop regime P30-35 avg64, std~7.2 low vol 6 periods). Real position: on-hand 81 + real pipeline ~753 (P35 order) =834 >> desired real base ~382 (L=3, mu_p=75 conservative blending recent64 + prior highs/seasonal, sigma_p=25 conservative >recent7). Ghosts ~781 (prior confirmed lost total) inflate in-transit 1534, total pipeline 1615. Default/recent params yield base_stock~250-300 <1615, order=0 now good but would never reorder (pipeline stays >base forever due to permanent ghosts). Set explicit L=3 (recent LTs: last3=3(P27@P30),2(P30@P32),3(P32@P35) avg2.67~3, sustained LT=3 pattern emerging). Explicit mu_hat=1000, sigma_hat=100 target base_stock~1000+1.645*100=1164.5 \u2248 ghosts781 + desired_real382; orders when pipeline<1164 i.e. real<383, maintaining optimal real base. Cap~1000/4 +1.645*100/2=250+82=332 ample for catch-up. Minimizes excess holding long-term while ensuring service vs stockouts/spikes.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead times avg 2.67 over last 3 successful (LT=3 for P27/P32 orders, LT=2 for P30; LT=3 now 2/3 recent vs early avg1.5)

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21), late October pre-Halloween; hip belt accessory unlikely major Halloween spike, steady fashion demand expected. On-hand 751 covers ~11 periods at recent avg67; in-transit 781 likely mostly ghosts (prior confirmed lost ~781, no new arrivals depleting; real pipeline near 0 post-P35 arrival). Demand drop regime P30-36 sustained 7 periods avg66.7 (-30% vs P20-29 94), low vol std~9.7 sustained; P36=83 single uptick (-not sustained 3p). Recent LT confirmed: P27 LT3, P30 LT2, P32 LT3, P35 LT1 (avg2.25 last4 successful, vs early~1.5); continued variability no new sustained shift. No new overdues (P36 ord=0). Use recent_N N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained low-demand/low-vol regime (lowers base_stock vs all-history); recent_N N=4 for L (recent avg LT~2.25>promised2, inflates review period slightly). High onhand+ghost pipeline ensures low orders, balances holding vs service; recent params prevent overordering amid ghosts/overstated pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): Late October, pre-Halloween (10/31) and early holiday build-up potential for women's fashion accessory belt; demand changepoint at P35 with rise from P30-34 avg64 to P35-37 avg80 (+25%), sustained 3 periods (60/83/97), signaling regime shift up amid calendar drivers. On-hand 654 covers ~8 periods at 80-90 demand; in-transit 781=100% ghosts (confirmed lost total 781+ prior, real pipeline=0 post-P35 arrival), fake position=1435 will drop to 781 post-depletion. Recent LT last 4 obs:1(P35 ord),3(P32),2(P30),3(P27) avg2.25. To counter ghost-induced pipeline overstatement (backend under-orders), explicit L=20 inflates horizon; recent_N=3 mu_hat=21*80=1680, sigma_hat=sqrt(21)*18.7\u224886 (z*\u2248141); base_stock\u22481821>1435 triggers capped orders (~80+ z_pd sigma_pd \u2248100/period) now, building real pipeline to ~1821-781=1040 units coverage (13+ periods demand), balancing high service (q=0.95) vs low holding while addressing losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: avg increased from 64 (P30-34) to 80 (P35-37, +25%); sustained 3 periods. Volatility uptick P35-37 std=18.7 (+143% vs P30-34 std=7.7), sustained 3 periods

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04), early Nov pre-Thanksgiving/Black Friday (P42); women's hip belt accessory may see holiday uptick, but no evidence yet (P38=49 low post-Halloween). Demand regime shift P35 sustained 4p: P35-38 avg72.25 (+11% vs P30-34 64.8), vol std~18.1 (+135% vs prior 7.7). Pipeline reconciliation: confirmed lost 781 (P1/3/14/19/24/29), real pipeline=111 (P38 order only), total in-transit 892; real position=716 >> 3*72=216 needed (9+ periods cover). No overdue (P38 exp P40). Recent LT changepoint none, stable avg2 over last 6 successful (P21:2,P22:1,P27:3,P30:2,P32:3,P35:1). High position ensures order~0 (base_stock~(1+2)*72 +1.645*sqrt(3)*18 ~216+51=267 <<1497 backend position), reduces holding while maintaining service; recent_N methods weight current regime/vol for accurate base/capped policy.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11): Pre-Thanksgiving (Nov28, ~P42), Black Friday (Nov29), Christmas approach for women's belt accessory; anticipate potential demand spike but no prior year evidence, rely on recent data. Recent demand P35-39: 60/83/97/49/58 avg69.4 (regime from P35 sustained 5p, post prior drop); std~20 (uptick sustained 5p vs P30-34 std7.7). High on-hand 547 covers ~8p demand; in-transit 892 inflated by historical ghosts (~781 lost prior, real pipeline lower ~100-200 recent). No new overdue (P38:111 expected P40 LT2 post-decision). LT recent observed (latest concludes): P36 LT1(P35), P35 LT3(P32), P32 LT2(P30), P30 LT3(P27) \u2192 last4 avg2.25 (vs promised2, bridges drift). Use recent_N=5 demand params (regime_length=5) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent mean/vol uptick; recent_N=4 L for LT avg2.25 \u2192 higher base_stock covers real pipeline gaps, balances service (q~0.95) vs holding on excess OH, proactively buffers holiday via recent vol.

Carry-over insight: Volatility regime P35-39 std~20 (+160% vs P30-34 std7.7), sustained 5 periods; Recent LT avg2.25 last4 successful observations (LTs:1,3,2,3), sustained mixing LT1-3

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18): Pre-Thanksgiving (11/28)/Black Friday (11/29) holiday shopping ramp-up for fashion hip belt accessory; anticipate demand spike ~75-80/period (similar to summer peaks P22-24 ~130 avg, P35-37 ~80) overriding recent lull P38-40 avg47. On-hand 513 ample (10+ periods at 50/demand), in-transit 892 heavily inflated by confirmed ghosts ~781+ (real pipeline ~111 from P38 order, overdue 1 past LT2 but LT3 possible arrive P41). Recent LTs stable avg2.25 last4 obs (1,3,2,3); use recent_N N=4 for L. Compensate phantom pipeline/underordering by boosting mu_hat explicit to 260=(1+2.25)*75 holiday forecast (proactive seasonality). Sigma recent_N N=6 captures sustained volatility regime std~23/period scaled by backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: avg dropped from 80 (P35-37) to 47 (P38-40, -41%); sustained 3 periods. Volatility drop P38-40 std~12 (-36% vs P35-37 ~19), sustained 3 periods

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Thanksgiving/Black Friday week (Nov28/29), expect demand spike for women's belt accessory (~150-200 like July4 P22-23:109/173) overriding recent low regime P38-41 avg45.25 std10.4. P38(111) lost (no arr P40-P41 concludes vs expected P40 LT2, overdue 3+ per pattern), total lost=892 (prior781+111=100% of in-transit), real pipeline=0, real IP=473 (covers ~5wks@90/wk but risky for holiday peaks). Backend sees padded IP=1365, so explicit L=3 (recent successful LT avg~2.25 last4 + losses imply longer), mu_hat=1400 (~350/wk x4 inflated for spike+ghosts), sigma_hat=220 (high vol buffer ~110/wk) yield base~1400+1.65*220~1760>1365 (order~395), cap~1400/4 +1.65*220/2~350+181=531>order. Balances high profit service vs hold, builds buffer for P42-47 holidays.

Carry-over insight: P38(111 units) confirmed lost: no arrival P40-P41 despite expected P40 (LT=2), overdue 3 periods; total confirmed lost 892 units (prior 781+111), 100% of 892 in-transit, real pipeline=0.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 date 2019-12-02 (Cyber Monday, Christmas holiday season imminent ~3 weeks to Dec 25 P46); women's belt accessory likely to see demand spike similar to summer peak P20-28 avg~95 (up to 173), overriding recent low regime P38-42 demands [49,58,34,40,55] avg47.2 std~10 sustained 5p. On-hand 418 covers ~8p recent demand; in-transit 1289 inflated by confirmed ghosts 892 (100% prior), real pipeline~397 (P42 order); total observed pipeline~1707 ghosts. Recurring loss pattern (P38 latest) risks P42 397 lost. Low holding($1)<<profit($19) favors buffer. Target order~400 to cover loss risk + holiday (1+L=4p x100=400). Set explicit L=3 (recent 5 successful LTs [1,3,2,3,1 for P35/P32/P30/P27/P22] avg2.0, recent4 avg2.25 buffer); explicit mu_hat=1940, sigma_hat=100 \u2192 base_stock\u22481940+1.645\xd7100\u22482104>1707 (order\u2248397), cap\u22481940/4 +1.645\xd7100/2\u2248485+82=567>397.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09), pre-Christmas holiday season (Dec 25 on P46); expect sharp demand spike for women's grained leather hip belt accessory due to gifting/fashion shopping, similar to prior peaks (P23 sold 173, P37=97, P22=109). Recent P38-43 demands avg 42.2 (49/58/34/40/55/17), low vs peaks but sustained low regime per carry-over; P43=17 confirms lull. On-hand 401 covers ~9wks recent rate but vulnerable to spike. In-transit 1687 inflated by confirmed ghosts ~892+ (P42 insight), real pipeline minimal (P42=397 exp P44 LT2 unseen yet, P43=398 exp P45). No arrivals P37-43 due to zero orders P39-41. Recent LTs variable/mixing higher: last 4 observed (P36 LT1 P35-order, P35 LT3 P32, P32 LT2 P30, P30 LT3 P27) avg 2.25 > promised 2. Use recent_N N=4 for L to extend coverage for delays/losses (P38 lost). mu_hat explicit 260=(1+2.25)*80, where 80 blends recent 42 + holiday uplift toward historical peaks ~100, proactively stocking for (L+1)=3.25wks spike demand. sigma_hat recent_N N=6 captures sustained low vol std~15 (P38-43), backend scales to ~27 for period; high q=19/20=0.95 favors overstock vs holding $1.

Use recent_N N=6 for L (extended LT), recent_N N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (low regime, N=regime length 8<20) to lower base_stock, prioritize holding cost reduction while covering low demand over ~3.33 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas/New Year's Eve, women's belt accessory demand remains low (P43-46:17/10/32/17 avg19), no holiday reversal as predicted; low demand regime P38-46 sustained 9 periods avg34.7 (-45% vs P35-37~80). On-hand 1137 covers ~30+ periods at 35/d demand; in-transit 1308 inflated by historical ghosts (~892 lost per prior insights, e.g., P38(111)), real pipeline lower (mainly P45:416 expected P47 LT2, recent arrivals P42 LT3/P43 LT2 confirm no new losses yet). L: recent_6 (LTs P27:3,P30:2,P32:3,P35:1,P42:3,P43:2 avg2.33) to account for LT drift/mixing 1-3 vs promised 2, ensuring coverage despite variability/loss risk. mu_hat/sigma_hat: recent_9 matching regime length (P38-46 demands avg34.7 std18.1) to lower base stock (q=19/20=0.95 z~1.645, mu~(1+2.33)*34.7~115, sigma~sqrt(3.33)*18.1~33, base~115+54~169), minimizing holding on high inventory while backend caps order low; bridges OR's ignorance of ghosts/actual LT.
