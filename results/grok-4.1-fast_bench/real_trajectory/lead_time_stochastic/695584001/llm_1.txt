(b) Historical weekly demand (Mon dates): 2019-01-07:0, 01-14:0, 01-21:37, 01-28:61, 02-04:109. Strong ramp-up post-week 2 (possibly product launch); recent acceleration (+65% week-over-week last period). Avg last 3 weeks: ~69, but trend projects 120-150 next (linear extrapolation + holiday uplift). (c) Period 1 start: no conclude messages or prior orders. Promised L=2; actual inferred later from 'arrived' confirms. No missing orders possible yet. (d) On-hand:0, in-transit:0. Zero coverage for Period 1 (post-decision demand) or 2; Period 1 order arrives Period 3 arrival (visible Period 4). (e) High profit ($19) vs low holding ($1/period) favors stocking over stockouts. Base-stock policy: forecast 3 periods (L+1) at ~130 avg (~390) + safety 60 for trend/volatility/holiday (~450 total). Conservative first-period order ramps conservatively: 200 units to seed pipeline, cover ~Period 3 demand + buffer; adjust next periods on realization.",

(b) Demand: Recent P39-P43: 58/34/40/55/17 (avg~41, volatile; P43=17 low despite high inv, possible anomaly/pre-spike lull). Prior regimes: post-summer decline to ~45-69 Nov (P38-P41), no sustained holiday shift yet (1-2 periods insufficient); forecast 50-100 near-term blending recent + holiday anticipation (conservative ramp from ~40). (c) Lead time: Recent confirms LT=3 (P40->P43), LT=2 (P41->P43), aligns carry-over stable 2-3 variability (no new extremes); no confirmed losses (P42 order=100 exp P44-45 LT2-3 pending; backlog pattern sustained but arrivals resuming P41/P43). (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=153 (covers 3-4 periods at ~40-50); in-transit=1520 (extreme backlog, equivalent ~15-30 periods supply even at peaks); expected near arrivals from P42(100)/P39?/older + backlog will flood post LT2-3; high holding risk if add more. (e) Order 0: Pipeline + on-hand massively overcovers (L+1=3-4 periods x50-100=200-400 <1673 total); prioritize avoiding excess holding amid backlog/delays, capture holiday sales from existing; re-assess post-P44 if spike confirms/under-delivery.",

(d) Inventory: on-hand 143 (covers 143/30=~5 periods at recent low mean, ample for forecast even with spike); pipeline 1520 extreme (net unchanged recently, expect ~200-300 arrive near-term LT2-3 e.g. P42/43 orders 100+100 LT3/2 \u2192 P45 possible), will flood post-arrival causing high holding $1/unit/period\u2014prioritize clearing backlog.
