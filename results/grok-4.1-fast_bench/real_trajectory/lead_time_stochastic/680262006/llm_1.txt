(e) Order logic: High on-hand buffers P46-48+ demand even at spike (632 >> 3*(LT+1)*60); order 200 to replenish pipeline proactively for sustained winter/Jan ramp (historical avg120) & NY/post-holiday, balancing hold risk vs stockout (profit$4 > hold$1); conservative vs overstock.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) SUPREME sports tights/leggings for ladies (H&M Sport, functional fabric); winter activewear relevant for indoor sports/cold weather, but 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas, New Year's Eve) sees typical retail lull after holidays; historical winter highs (Jan-Feb avg~110) absent, no seasonal ramp despite Dec dates/calendar expectation for year-end fitness resolutions. (b) Demand regime: winter stall confirmed/sustained P43-P46 avg 4.5 (3,4,6,5; -86% vs historical winter ~120), flat low post-P42 BF blip=30, no recovery/acceleration signal over 4 periods aligning deep summer-fall trough extension. (c) Lead time reliable recent LT=2 (P43 order arrived P45; P39->P41), alternating LT1-2 pattern holds (no relapse); P46 order=200 in-transit expected P47-48; older in-transit 1220u includes historical ghosts (~1020u per carry-over) but no new losses. (d) Inventory ample: on-hand=627 covers ~125 periods at avg~5 demand; total pipeline on-hand+1220=1847u excess vs low regime (holding cost risk high at $1/unit/period). (e) Order 0: prioritize minimizing holding costs (627*1=$627/period penalty avoidable), zero stockout risk with buffer; replenish only on demand recovery signal.",
