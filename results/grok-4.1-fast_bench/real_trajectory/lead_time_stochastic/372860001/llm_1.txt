Old orders (P1 800 exp P3, P3 800 exp P5, P4 500 exp P6) overdue 6-9 periods, likely lost (in-transit persists w/o conclude, total ~2100u ghost); recent orders reliable. P10 400 exp P12 (LT=2).

Expected: P10 400 arrives P12 (post-decision), total avail ~565 vs ~380 demand \u2192 end ~185. No P11 order. Pipeline thin post-P12. (e) Order 400: Matches recent reliable LT arrivals/service; covers P13-P14 demand (~740-800) post-P12 end inv, assuming LT=1-2. Balances stockouts (opp cost=$1) vs holding ($1/period); conservative given LT variability/loss risk & equal margins (avoids excess).",

(b) Demand regimes: Early high (P1-P3 avg411), post-peak decline (P3-P5 329), sustained decline P8-P10/P24-P32 avg266-337 lows, stabilized uptick P33-P39 avg292 (+10% vs deep low); recent P39-P41 (241/252/210 avg234, -20% vs 292) extends low but contradicted by Black Friday calendar driver - forecast P42 spike to 350-450, then holiday avg320-350. Historical BF-equivalent spikes (e.g., P2 548, P11 427). (c) LT variability confirmed (1-3 periods, e.g., P39\u2192P41 LT2, P36\u2192P39 LT3); lost shipment crisis acute - in-transit 6500u with ~8600u potential lost (P38 300u overdue past LT3 per P41 insight, prior 20+ orders); no new arrivals P41 beyond expected P39, reinforcing high loss risk (>80% orders affected sustained). Assume LT=3 for planning, new orders ~50% delivery prob. (d) On-hand 159u (covers <1 period at 234-350 forecast); pipeline unreliable (6500u in-transit largely lost/overdue, no confirmed arrivals imminent for P42 beyond possible P40 300u LT2 - but risky); post-P41 ending 159u vulnerable to stockout. (e) Target 100% service for BF spike/holiday: forecast 4 periods (LT3+current) x avg340 demand =1360u coverage needed; subtract on-hand 159u + optimistic 300u P40 arrive = order 900u base, but derate 50% for loss risk + holding cost parity to 400u - builds buffer vs stockouts (recent frequent), tests supplier amid losses, aligns recent order cadence (300-350u).",
