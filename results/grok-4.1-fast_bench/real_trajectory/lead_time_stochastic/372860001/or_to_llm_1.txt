{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LTs mixed but recurring LT=3 (e.g., P40 order arrived P43 LT=3; P42 order arrived P45 LT=3); promised LT=2. P44 order (400, placed P44) expected P46 (LT=2) but P46 arrived=0\u2014overdue if LT=2, but consistent with LT=3 (expected P47 arrival during this period, visible next). No new losses confirmed; historical ~36% loss rate inflates in-transit to 4030 (effective ~2600+). Inventory position: On-hand 345 (covers 1-2 periods at recent ~220 demand); total pipeline + on-hand >> expected (L+1)=3-4 periods demand ~900. Demand analysis: Post-Christmas (2019/12/30) after holiday surge (P42=354, P33=405); recent P43-46: 143,209,231,224 avg 202 (-41% vs full history ~340, -43% vs pre-holiday highs). Socks demand typically dips post-holidays (returns, saturation); summer dip precedent but now winter\u2014low sustained into late Dec suggests volatility/end-of-surge normalization, forecast ~220-250 for P47. OR rec=0: Appropriate as base-stock exceeded by high position; OR assumes promised LT=2/i.i.d. demand but we adjust for LT~3/losses/seasonality\u2014still overstocked, no override needed. Strategy: Order 0 to avoid adding to bloated unreliable pipeline; burn down inventory at $1 holding cost vs $1 profit parity.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR's 0 units - on-hand 345 + massive in-transit buffer covers 3+ periods of post-Christmas low demand (~220 avg recent); avoids exacerbating lost shipment inflation amid LT~3.",
  "carry_over_insight": "P44 order (400) potentially overdue/emerging LT=3 confirmation (P46 arrived=0, expected P46 if LT=2); post-Christmas demand low P44-46 avg 221 (-37% vs full history ~340), but only 3 periods pre/post-holiday boundary.",
