No prolonged absences signaling new losses immediately (e.g., P36 order placed but not yet due). Inventory & pipeline: OH=64 sufficient for 1+ periods at recent avg demand ~50; in-transit=700 heavily inflated by confirmed phantom/lost shipments (carry-over est. ~960 prior, pattern of frequent losses like P29, P26 etc., totaling 100s of units that never arrive), so real expected arrivals low - treat effective pipeline as minimal. Demand analysis: Fall softening confirmed (P34-P37: 35,36,49,61 avg 45 vs summer 90s -50%), but clear uptrend over last 4 periods (+74% from P34 low), stabilizing at ~50-60; product is women's thong lingerie - late Oct (10/28) Halloween week likely boosts demand (costumes/sexy outfits), plus upcoming holiday gift season (Thanksgiving 11/28, Black Friday, Christmas lingerie sales).

Recent confirms: P43 arrivals (P40 LT3, P41 LT2); P44 arrived=0. Expect continued losses/delays, so order assuming LT=2-3 with high risk of non-arrival. 2.
