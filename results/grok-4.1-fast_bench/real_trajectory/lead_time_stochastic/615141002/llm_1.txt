Date 2019/12/30: post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week; expect continued Dec trough/lull as holiday peak passes, no major surge (historical Jan demand high but post-holiday dip first); no product/calendar drivers for spike. (b) Demand regime: Post-BF/Christmas low sustained P43-P46 avg52 (62,45,68,31; -20% vs winter baseline 62-100, -45% fall peak ~100); P46=31 confirms end-Dec trough extension, aligns with prior low Dec insight; forecast P47 ~40-60 conservative. (c) Lead time: Variable LT=1-3 confirmed historically (e.g., recent P42 LT3 P45, P43 LT2 P45, P44 300 no P46 arrive \u2192 LT>=3 expect P47+); no new concludes yet; lost pattern historical (total ~840+ prior), but recent reliable; in-transit 1260 likely includes P44(300 LT3?), P45(120 LT2-3+), monitor P47 conclude for arrivals/delays. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 251 (covers ~5 periods at 50 demand); in-transit 1260 massive (~25 periods), even if some lost will overstock; ending P46 251 after low demand=31, no stockouts recent. (e) Order logic: High on-hand + pipeline covers 20+ periods >> LT uncertainty/forecast; zero order minimizes holding costs ($1/unit/period) during low-demand trough; reassess post-P47 arrivals/conclude.",
