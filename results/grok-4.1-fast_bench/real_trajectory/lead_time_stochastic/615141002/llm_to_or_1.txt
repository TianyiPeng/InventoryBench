Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11), first decision, no prior period concludes or shipments. Product: women's everyday jersey top. Historical demands (5 samples Jan-Feb 2019): mean ~114.6, recent trend upward (last 3: 130 avg). Post-Chinese New Year (Feb 5), no major spikes expected yet. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Use defaults: L=promised 2 (no observed lead times), mu_hat=(1+2)*historical mean (~344), sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*historical std (~50). Balances service (q=0.5) vs holding with full history.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25), women's everyday jersey top, late winter, no major calendar events. Historical demands avg ~114.6 (99,85,106,148,135), recent game demands 79 (P1), 84 (P2) slightly lower but only 2 periods, no sustained changepoint (requires 3+). No concluded arrivals yet (normal: P1 order arrives during P3, visible in P4 conclude). In-transit 312 units covers ~3 periods at recent ~80-100 demand. On-hand 0, sales 0 so far. With profit=holding=1, z*=0, base_stock\u2248mu_hat. Use defaults: backend L=2 (promised), mu_hat=(3)*114.6\u2248344, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*std_all. Pipeline 312 near base, orders small adjustment to cover (L+1)=3 periods while minimizing holding.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, women's everyday jersey top - steady demand expected, post-winter no major events. Historical Jan-Feb demand avg ~115 (high variance, peak 148), but game Periods 1-3 demands 79/84/71 avg 78 (-32%), consistent lower regime over 3 periods, low variance. No arrivals (P1 order overdue past promised L=2, but unconfirmed LT; if LT=3 arrives during P4 visible P5). On-hand=0, no sales yet, in-transit=316 (~4 periods coverage at recent demand). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture lower mean/variance regime (mu_hat~(1+2)*78=234, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*6.6~11); default L=2 as no confirmed arrivals/LT observations yet. Balances lower demand forecast vs holding, builds base stock ~234 while cap limits overorder; monitors for LT drift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift lower from mid-Feb: Periods 1-3 avg 78 vs prior historical avg 115 (-32%), consistent 3 periods

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11, early March, women's jersey long-sleeved top). Recent demands: P1-3 avg 78 (low regime per carry-over), but P4 spiked to 509 (+544% vs P1-3 avg), indicating potential demand regime shift higher (consistent with possible seasonal spring uptick, though single period). P1 order 158 overdue (expected P3 arrival, no P4 conclude message; likely lost per rules, inflating in-transit 162 which includes lost 158 + pending P3 4). Only one confirmed lead time=2 (P2 order arrived P4). Use default L=2 (matches observed). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and spike (P1-4 demands avg~186, high std~278), yielding mu_hat~(1+2)*186=558, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*278~482; boosts base_stock~558 (z=0) despite inflated pipeline 162, targeting order~396 to cover ~3 periods high demand (~500/period) and offset lost shipment. Balances service (avoid lost sales like P4's 355) vs holding.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18 mid-March): Women's long-sleeved jersey top (everyday collection) sees massive demand surge in early March P4(3/4):509, P5(3/11):595 (avg 552, +610% vs P1-3 avg 78), signaling sharp changepoint upward likely from spring fashion transition post-winter; historical Jan/Feb avg ~115 also much lower. On-hand=0, in-transit=558 (P1:158 overdue since expected P3 no-show in P3/P4/P5 concludes; P3:4 overdue since expected P5 no-show; P5:396 recent). Only 1 confirmed LT=2 (P2 order arrived P4), no others concluded so no evidence for avg/recent LT shift, use default L=2. Use recent_N=2 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor on new high-demand regime (mean~552, std~60.8), yielding mu_hat=3*552=1656, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*60.8~105; ensures high base_stock~1656 targets coverage of ~3 periods high demand despite pipeline gaps/overdues, balancing lost sales vs holding (q=0.5 conservative), while cap limits overorder.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Women's long-sleeved jersey top, late March spring transition possibly driving demand. Recent demand regime shift upward from P4: P4-6 demands 509/595/274 (avg 459, std ~166) vs P1-3 avg 78 (+490%), sustained 3 periods; historical pre-game avg ~115 also lower. On-hand 122 low relative to demand; in-transit 815 includes overdue P1 order 158 (expected P3 arrival if LT2, now 6 periods late \u2192 likely lost) and P3 order 4 (overdue from P5). Observed LTs: P2 order LT=2, P5 order LT=1 (avg 1.5). P6 order 653 pending. Use 'calculate' for L (backend avg observed LT=1.5) to reflect recent variability/shorter LT. mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=3 to capture high-demand regime, ensuring base_stock covers ~ (1+1.5)*459 ~690 demand over review+lead, balancing stockouts (lost sales) vs holding on overstock/possible lost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift higher from Period 4: Periods 4-6 avg 459 vs Periods 1-3 avg 78 (+490%), consistent 3 periods; Recent lead time shorter: P5 order LT=1 (vs promised 2), P1 order 158 overdue 6+ periods (likely lost)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): Early April, post-March demand spike (P4-6 avg 459, possibly pre-Easter seasonal for long-sleeved women's top; Easter 2019-04-21 may influence but P7 dropped sharply to 86 suggesting peak ending, entering spring lower demand regime). On-hand 36 low but pipeline 1292 (36+1256) covers many periods: includes P1:158 (lost, overdue 7+), P3:4 (delayed, overdue 5+ if LT=2), P6:653 (likely LT=2 arriving P8), P7:441 (future). No new arrivals in P7 confirm no LT=1 for P6. L=recent_N N=2 (last observed LTs: P5 LT=1, P2 LT=2; avg 1.5) to reflect recent shorter/variable LT vs promised 2, bridging OR backend's promised LT assumption. mu_hat=recent_N N=3 (P5-7:595/274/86 avg~318 *(1+L)~795) detects post-spike drop (P7 -81% vs P4-6) for conservative forecast avoiding overstock. sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 (high recent vol ~260) matches volatility. With q=0.5 (z~0), base_stock~795 < pipeline so order~0 now (good, holding=profit), but params position for future balance when pipeline arrives/depletes, maximizing R_t by preventing stockouts post-delays/losses.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8, early April): Women's long-sleeved jersey top; spring season likely dampens demand post-winter. Recent demand P7:86, P8:112 (avg 99), aligns with historical samples avg ~115 and P1-3 avg 78; March spike (P4-6 avg 459) ended at P6 (274 to 86, -68%). On-hand 1018 high (holding risk), in-transit 162 (P1:158 overdue 8 periods since P1 likely lost; P3:4 overdue 4 periods since P3 likely lost). Observed LTs from concludes: P2 order LT=2, P5=1, P6=2, P7=1 (avg 1.5, recent shorter than promised 2). No new sustained changepoint (low demand regime only 2 periods <3). L=calculate (backend avg all 4 observed LT=1.5 for accurate pipeline coverage). mu_hat=recent_N N=2 (P7-P8 avg 99 *(1+1.5)=~248 low base_stock to deplete excess inv). sigma_hat=recent_N N=2 (low recent vol ~18, minimal impact as z=0). Ensures order~0 now (base_stock <<1180 pipeline), balances service vs holding by using recent low demand/LT evidence ignoring transient spike.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15, mid-April spring): Long-sleeved women's jersey top demand in clear post-spike decline (P7-9: 86,112,81 avg93 vs P4-6 avg459, -80% drop, consistent 3 periods; aligns with seasonal warming reducing need). High on-hand 937 + in-transit 162 (likely P1 158 + P3 4 overdue 7+ periods past promised LT2, signaling losses) covers 10+ periods at recent demand rate, minimizing holding costs. Lead times from concluded: P2 LT2, P5 LT1, P6 LT2, P7 LT1 (recent 4 avg1.5 vs promised 2). Use recent_N=4 for L to reflect shorter average LT, reducing overstock risk. recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures new low-demand regime (mean~93, low vol), yielding low base_stock to limit orders amid excess inventory and balance q=0.5 service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift lower from Period 7: Periods 7-9 avg 93 vs Periods 4-6 avg 459 (-80%), consistent 3 periods; Lead time average 1.5 periods sustained (4 observations: P2/P6 LT=2, P5/P7 LT=1); P3 order 4 overdue 7+ periods (likely lost)

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), late spring; women's long-sleeved jersey top demand likely tapering (spring transition). Recent demands P7-10: 86,112,81,47 (avg 81.5, confirming low regime from P7 shift noted in carry-over). No major calendar events post-Easter (4/21). LT evidence: 4 observations (P2 LT2, P5 LT1, P6 LT2, P7 LT1, avg 1.5 sustained). Pipeline high (OH 890 + IT 162=1052, IT likely lost P1 158+P3 4 overdue 8+ periods, no new arrivals expected). Use recent_N N=4 for L (avg LT 1.5 vs promised 2), mu_hat ((1+1.5)*81.5\u2248204), sigma_hat (sqrt(2.5)*~27\u224838) to reflect recent low mean/volatility. With z*=0, base_stock=mu_hat low << pipeline \u2192 order=0, minimizes holding on excess while preparing for low demand; recent focus compensates backend's use of full history (ignores spikes) and unaware lost IT.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29, late April spring). Long-sleeved women's jersey top demand low in warmer weather; recent p7-11 demands: 86,112,81,47,30 (avg 71, trending down to p9-11 avg 53); sustained low regime post p4-6 spike and p10 insight (p7-9 avg93). High on-hand 860 + in-transit 162 (lost P1:158 + P3:4, overdue 10+ periods, ignore for pipeline). No orders needed (pipeline >> demand). LT observations sustained avg 1.5 (last 4: P2@2, P5@1, P6@2, P7@1). Use recent_N N=4 for L (1.5); recent_N N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low demand mean~71/var, yielding low base_stock~(1+1.5)*71 + z*sqrt(2.5)*~29 ~178 (z=0 since profit=holding=1), order=0 vs pipeline>1000, minimizes holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further shift lower from Period 9: Periods 9-11 avg 53 vs Periods 7-8 avg 99 (-47%), consistent 3 periods

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6, early May, spring; upcoming Mother's Day 5/12 in P14). Recent low demand regime sustained: P9-12 demands 81,47,30,48 (avg 51.5, std ~21), consistent with carry-over shifts lower since P7-9; high on-hand 812 (~16 periods at recent rate) + in-transit 162 (P1:158 + P3:4 orders, overdue 12+/10+ periods, likely lost as per insights). No new arrivals since P8, confirming no pending recent orders. LT observations unchanged (last 4: P2/P6 LT=2, P5/P7 LT=1, avg 1.5). Use recent_N N=4 for L (1.5), mu_hat ((1+1.5)*51.5 ~77), sigma_hat (sqrt(2.5)*21 ~33) to match low-demand/low-vol regime, lowering base_stock for q=0.5 (z=0, ~mu_hat); high pipeline 974 ensures order~0, minimizing holding costs; conservative on Mother's Day spike (no historical evidence, everyday product).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13): Mid-May spring season for women's long-sleeved ribbed jersey top; demand low post-spikes, likely seasonal decline as warmer weather reduces need for long-sleeves (near Mother's Day May 12, but P13 demand=35 confirms no uptick). Recent demands P9-13: 81,47,30,48,35 avg=48.2 (std~20), continuing low regime from P10/P12 carry-over shifts (P9-11 avg53, now stable ~48 over 5 periods). On-hand=777 high (holding cost pressure), in-transit=162 (P1 158+P3 4 overdue 12+ periods, confirmed lost per prior insights, no arrivals since P8). No recent orders, so no expected arrivals. Lead times: 4 obs (P2 LT2, P5 LT1, P6 LT2, P7 LT1) avg=1.5 sustained. Parameters use recent_N to reflect low demand/volatility regime (chgs at P10/P12, regime_length=5>=3, N=5) and short LT (all 4 obs, N=4), yielding low mu_hat~(1+1.5)*48=120, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.5)*20~32 (low z*=0 since p=h=1), base_stock~120 to minimize holding vs pipeline=939.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20): Late spring, demand for long-sleeved women's jersey top remains low amid seasonal shift to summer wear (no major holidays imminent post-Mother's Day). Recent demands P9-14 (81,47,30,48,35,43) avg 47.3 confirm sustained low regime since P9 changepoint (carry-over P10/P12 insights), vs prior spikes. P10-14 avg 40.6 even lower but stable. High pipeline: on-hand 734 + in-transit 162 (P1 order 158 + P3 order 4, overdue 13+ periods, confirmed lost per carry-over). 4 observed LTs (P2/P6=2, P5/P7=1) avg 1.5 sustained. Use 'calculate' for L=1.5 (shorter than promised 2, adjusts base stock down). mu_hat 'recent_N' N=6 for low-demand regime (length 6>3). sigma_hat same for low recent volatility. Low mu_hat ~ (1+1.5)*47=211 ensures base_stock << pipeline (896), yielding order~0 to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period = profit), balancing low service risk given excess inv.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27): Late spring/early summer; long-sleeved jersey top (women's everyday) sees sustained low demand as weather warms, consistent with seasonal drop. Recent demands P9-15 (81,47,30,48,35,43,53) avg 48, std ~16.5, stable low regime from P9 (7 periods, post P12 insight). No new changepoint. High inventory (on-hand 681 + in-transit 162 = 843) covers ~17 periods at 50/wk; no recent orders, prior lost (P1/P3 noted). LT observations sustained avg 1.5 (4 arrives: P2/P6 LT=2, P5/P7 LT=1). Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low demand regime (avoids inflating from early spikes P4-6); recent_N=4 for L to use observed avg 1.5 (shorter than promised 2). Low mu_hat ~48*(1+1.5)=120 targets base_stock near current pipeline min, minimizing new orders/holding while covering demand; low recent sigma reduces buffer for stability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3): Early summer; long-sleeved women's jersey top demand low due to seasonal shift to warmer weather, confirmed by sustained low regime P9-16 (demands:81,47,30,48,35,43,53,36; avg=46.6, std~15.9). High on-hand=645 covers many periods of low demand (~15+ periods); in-transit=162 are overdue P1(158)/P3(4) orders, likely lost (no arrival 13+ periods past expected). No recent orders, so no new LT observations; prior 4 LTs (2,1,2,1) avg=1.5< promised 2. Use 'calculate' for L to inform backend of shorter actual LT avg, reducing base stock target. Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to focus on current low-demand regime (ignores early spikes P4-6), yielding mu_hat~(1+1.5)*46.6~117, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.5)*15.9~25; balances low service needs vs high holding (645 inv) with profit=holding=1 (q=0.5, z=0 conservative).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10), early summer; long-sleeved women's jersey top sees sustained low seasonal demand (off-season for winter apparel). Recent P9-P17 demands: 81,47,30,48,35,43,53,36,27 (avg 44, std low ~18), stable low regime since P9 changepoint (9 periods, consistent with carry-over shifts lower post-P8). High on-hand 618 covers ~14 periods at 44/unit (618/44); in-transit 162 = lost P1(158)+P3(4), ignore for pipeline. Observed LTs stable avg1.5 (4 obs: 2@1, 2@2). Use recent_N N=4 for L (all obs), recent_N N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect low demand regime (mu_hat~(1+1.5)*44~110, low base stock prevents overorder amid high inv/holding cost; q=0.5 conservative service).

Carry-over insight: Demand further stabilized low summer regime: P13-P17 avg39 vs P9-P12 avg52 (-25%), 5 consistent periods

Lead times stable avg 1.5 (4 observations: LT=2,1,2,1). Use 'calculate' for L to reflect observed avg < promised 2. Use recent_6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=6 >=3, post-P12 changepoint) to anchor low mean/volatility, yielding low base_stock ~ mu_hat=(1+1.5)*37~92 + z*sigma (low sigma), ensuring minimal new orders amid high pipeline, balancing service (cover low demand) vs holding (avoid adding to 591+ inv).

Recent demands P13-P20 (May6-Jul1, 8 periods): 35,43,53,36,27,27,33,13 avg=33.4 (low regime confirmed by carryover P13-P17 avg39, extended consistently). High on-hand 545 + in-transit 162 covers 20+ periods at ~30/demand; holding cost high ($1/unit/period), so low mu_hat/sigma_hat prevents overordering. Lead times sustained avg1.5 (4 obs: P2/P6=2, P5/P7=1); no new arrivals/observations since P8. Parameters use recent_N to capture low demand regime (N=8, regime_length=8>3) and LT regime (N=4); OR backend will compute low base_stock ~33.4*(1+1.5) +z*sigma, capped low, balancing service (cover low demand) vs holding (avoid excess amid high inventory).

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand further low in summer: P18-P20 avg24 vs P13-P17 avg39 (-38%), consistent 3 periods

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8, mid-summer): Low demand regime for long-sleeved women's jersey top confirmed sustained (P17-21 demands:27,27,33,13,20 avg=24, std~7.4; fits carry-over summer low P18-20 avg24, P21:20 consistent -38% drop). High on-hand 525 covers >20 periods at current rate; in-transit 162 likely lost P1(158)+P3(4) overdue 20+ periods. No recent orders/arrivals since P8. Observed LTs (4 total, all recent): P2->P4 LT2, P5->P6 LT1, P6->P8 LT2, P7->P8 LT1; avg=1.5 sustained per carry-over. Use 'calculate' for L to inform backend avg observed LT=1.5 (vs promised 2). Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current low stable summer regime (backend scales to (1+L)~2.5-3 periods: mu~60, sigma~12), reducing base_stock to minimize holding costs on excess inventory while covering low demand + pipeline.

Recent demands P13-P22 avg 32 (low regime since P10, summer stabilization per carry-over P18/P21). High on-hand 491 + in-transit 162 = 653 covers 20+ periods at 30/wk; P1/P3 orders likely lost (overdue 20+ periods, still in-transit). No new arrivals/LT obs post-P8. LT sustained avg 1.5 (4 obs: P2/P6 LT2, P5/P7 LT1). Use recent_4 for L to reflect shorter actual LT. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_10 (regime length ~10 summer periods, N=max(min(10,20),3)=10) for low mean/volatility vs early spikes. Low params ensure low base_stock < pipeline, no ordering to cut holding costs amid excess inv.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22), mid-summer, low demand expected for long-sleeved women's jersey top (summer seasonal low confirmed in carry-over P18+ avg~24-27). Recent demands P19-23 avg 25.4 (33,13,20,34,27), stable low regime no new changepoint. Lead times: 4 observations (P2->4 LT2, P5->6 LT1, P6->8 LT2, P7->8 LT1) avg 1.5. In-transit 162 = lost P1(158)+P3(4), overdue 21-23 periods, phantom pipeline (already noted in carry-over, sustained). On-hand 464 + phantom 162 = net 626 ample now (~25 periods at 25/unit). Compensate phantom by inflating mu_hat explicit: real_mu = 2.5 * 25.4 \u224863.5 +162 phantom =225.5 \u2192226; backend targets net_pos~226 (real on-hand ~64, covers 2.5 periods @q=0.5 z=0, minimizes holding while preventing future stockouts despite phantom). L calculate for avg1.5 (used in scaling/cap). sigma recent_5 for low vol ~8.9 scaled. No order expected (626>>226), good vs holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29, late summer): Women's long-sleeved jersey top sees sustained low summer demand regime (carry-over confirmed P18-20 avg24, P21-24 demands 20/34/27/21 avg25.5 similar to recent avg~25/period). No demand changepoint; stable low vs winter highs. High on-hand 443 (covers ~18 periods at 25/period), in-transit 162= P1(158)+P3(4) lost (overdue 24+ periods, no conclude). Lead times: 4 sustained obs avg1.5 (P2LT2,P5LT1,P6LT2,P7LT1). Use recent_4 for L (avg1.5 bridges shorter actual vs promised2). Demand changepoint ~P10 to low summer (15+ periods), recent regime P15-24 (10 periods) avg29.1, low vol; recent_10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat ensures low base_stock, minimal orders given high inventory, balances low holding cost vs service (OR caps anyway). No calendar spikes expected end-July.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5, early Aug summer): Women's long-sleeved jersey top in sustained low summer demand regime (carry-over P13+ avg~30-40 dropping to ~25 recent). Recent P16-25 demands: [36,27,27,33,13,20,34,27,21,42] avg=28, std~10. Slight uptick P25=42 but not sustained shift (vs P18-21 avg~23). High OH=401 + IT=162=563 covers ~20 periods at ~28/wk; holding cost pressure with profit=holding=1. Lead times stable avg1.5 (4 obs: LT=2,1,2,1 from P2/P5/P6/P7 orders); no new arrivals/concludes since P8, IT=162 likely overdue P1=158 (lost per carry-over). Use recent_N N=10 for mu/sigma (summer regime ~17 periods P9+, N=min(17,20)=10 recent for changepoint recency); recent_N N=4 for L (all obs). Low mu_hat~(1+1.5)*28=67, low sigma~sqrt(2.5)*10~15.8 drives conservative base_stock ~67 (q=0.5), ensuring order~0 to minimize holding while covering low demand; backend ignores losses but params bridge via low forecast.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12, mid-August summer). Low summer demand regime continues (P17-P26 avg 30.8, consistent low ~20-40, women's long-sleeved jersey top off-season). High on-hand 364 + in-transit 162 (likely includes lost P1:158 overdue 25+ periods, P3:4 lost), covers many periods of low demand. No new arrivals since P8. Sustained LT observations (4x: 2,1,2,1 avg1.5). Use recent_N N=4 for L (lowers base_stock). mu_hat recent_N N=10 (P17-26 low regime, (1+L)*30.8 low forecast). sigma_hat recent_N N=10 (low recent volatility). Low params minimize new orders, reduce holding on excess inventory; backend caps anyway.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019/8/19), late summer; women's jersey top sees sustained low summer demand regime per carry-over (P13+ avg ~35-50, recent P18-27: demands 27,33,13,20,34,27,21,42,37,51 avg 30.5). High on-hand 313 + in-transit 162 (likely lost P1 order 158, overdue 26+ periods; P3 order 4 also lost). No recent arrivals confirm lead times stable avg 1.5 (last 4 obs: P7 LT1, P6 LT2, P5 LT1, P2 LT2). Recent P25-27 demands 42,37,51 avg 43 (+~70% vs P18-24 avg~25) hints possible late-summer uptick but only 3 periods, not yet sustained shift. Use recent_4 for L to capture avg 1.5; recent_10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to focus low-demand/low-vol regime (ignores early spikes), yielding low mu_hat~(1+1.5)*30.5~76, low sigma_hat for base_stock ~mu_hat (z=0 at q=0.5). Ensures minimal/no new orders vs high pipeline, cuts holding costs while covering low demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand 287 + in-transit 162 (likely lost P1/P3 orders) = 449 covers ~15 periods at 30/period demand; high position minimizes ordering need. LT observations sustained mix (last 4: P2 LT2, P5 LT1, P6 LT2, P7 LT1 avg 1.5 < promised 2), use recent_4 for L to reflect shorter actual LT and reduce overstock risk. Demand forecast recent_10 (P19-P28 avg~30) for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures low regime (changelength~10+ periods post-P18 stabilization); (1+L)~2.5*30=75 base, with q=0.5 low z*, prioritizes avoiding holding costs on excess inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2, Labor Day Monday, early fall/back-to-school season for women's long-sleeved jersey top; potential demand uptick for fall apparel but no sustained evidence yet). Recent demands P22-P29 avg 35 (fluctuating 21-51, stable low post-summer). On-hand 242 covers ~7 periods at 35/unit; in-transit 162 = lost P1(158)+P3(4) overdue 28+ periods (no conclude, remain in-transit indefinitely). No active pipeline incoming. High buffer vs low demand minimizes ordering need. LT sustained avg 1.5 (4 obs: P2/P6 LT=2, P5/P7 LT=1). Use recent_N N=4 for L to reflect shorter LT (lowers (1+L) to 2.5 vs promised 3, reduces base_stock). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=20 (P10-P29 low regime 20 periods, avg~35 low mean/volatility vs all-history high spikes/mean~100+; changepoint post-P9 high inventory drawdown). Params ensure low base_stock ~2.5*35 + z*low_sigma < current pipeline 404, preventing orders while balancing low holding risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift higher from Period 22 (late July): P22-P29 avg35 vs P18-P21 avg24 (+46%), consistent 8 periods

Current demand regime higher since P22 (late July, P22-P30: 9 periods avg 37, +46% vs prior summer lows P18-P21 avg24), confirmed sustained.

On-hand 192 covers ~5 periods at recent avg37; parameters use recent regime for mu/sigma (N=9, regime_length=9) to capture uplift, recent LT (N=4) to adjust pipeline view; balances service for potential fall increase vs holding cost (q=0.5) with high inventory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16): Mid-September, early fall season for long-sleeved women's jersey top; back-to-school and cooling weather likely driving demand uptick (P29:45, P30:50, P31:76, avg57 vs prior summer P22-P28 avg34, +68%). Confirmed higher regime since P22 (10 periods, avg41), with acceleration in recent 3. High pipeline (OH116 + IT162=278, IT likely includes lost P1 158/P3 4 overdue 30+ periods). No new arrivals since P8 (no orders since P7). LT sustained avg1.5 (4 obs: LTs 2,1,2,1). Use 'calculate' for L=1.5 (shorter LT means less review+lead coverage needed). recent_N N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures low-but-rising fall regime (mu~(1+1.5)*41~102, well below pipeline to avoid overstock/holding; std recent~16). With q=0.5 z=0, base_stock~mu low, order~max(0,102-278)=0 prevents excess holding while recent low params ensure backend doesn't overorder if IT lost. Covers ~2.5 periods recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand further increase into early fall from P29: P29-P31 avg57 vs P22-P28 avg34 (+68%), consistent 3 periods

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Early fall season for long-sleeved women's jersey top; demand ramping up post-summer lows (carry-over confirms increases from P22/P29). Recent demands P29-32: 45,50,76,75 (avg 61.5, +68%+ from prior ~34-39), consistent 4 periods indicating sustained fall regime shift. On-hand=41 low vs recent ~70 demand (risk stockout this period), in-transit=162 confirmed lost (P1=158+P3=4 overdue 20+ periods, no conclude ever). No real pipeline. LT sustained avg1.5 (4 obs: P2/P6=2, P5/P7=1). Use recent_N=4 for L/mu/sigma to capture shorter LT and current demand regime/vol (low recent std vs early spikes); lowers base stock vs default (all-data mean~200+), reduces overstock risk post summer inventory burn-down (1018\u219241), ensures coverage for ~2.5 periods demand (~154) with profit=holding=1 (q=0.5).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): Late September, fall season start; long-sleeved women's jersey top demand rising seasonally (historical Jan-Feb ~115 avg, recent P31-33:76/75/186 avg112 +136% vs P29-30:47.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=162 (P1:158 + P3:4, overdue 30+ periods, confirmed lost per history/carryover). No recent arrivals/orders. Demand spike P33=186 after stockout (sold only 41). Pipeline ghosts will subtract 162 from base_stock, so high mu_hat needed to trigger order ~200+ for 1+L~2.5 periods coverage (forecast ~110*2.5~275, net order 275-162~113 min). L=calculate (sustained avg1.5 from 4 obs:2,1,2,1). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=3 (chgpnt P31: recent high regime consistent 3p, avg112/vol~52 vs summer lows). z=0 (q=0.5) so base=mu_hat~(1+1.5)*112=392, order~392-162=230; recent vol for cap allowance. Addresses lost pipeline by inflating mu_hat over ghosts.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand regime further shift higher into late Sep/early fall: P31-P33 avg112 vs P22-P30 avg~38 (+195%), consistent 3 periods

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/7): Early October, fall season onset ideal for long-sleeved women's jersey top; demand rising seasonally matching historical Jan-Feb avg~115. Recent changepoint P31-P34 demands 76/75/186/108 (avg 111, +190% vs summer P22-P30 ~38), consistent 4 periods confirming fall regime shift (P33/34 stockouts signal urgency). On-hand=0 covered by in-transit=337 (incl. P34's 175); no new LT observations (P34 arrived=0 expected), prior 4 LTs avg1.5 sustained. Use recent_N=4 across params to focus OR backend on current high-demand/low-LT regime: scales base_stock/mu_hat/sigma_hat to recent mean111*(1+1.5)~278, var~45*sqrt(2.5)~71, balancing profit=1 vs holding=1 with elevated service for fall spike while capping overstock.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime sustained into early Oct: P31-P34 avg111 vs P22-P30 avg~38 (+190%), consistent 4 periods

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14, Canadian Thanksgiving Monday - potential retail demand boost for fall/winter apparel like long-sleeved jersey top). On-hand=0, in-transit=337 (P1:158 + P3:4 lost=162 stuck indefinitely + P34:175 expected LT=2 arriving during P36). Recent demand P31-P35: 76,75,186,108,71 avg=103.2 (fall regime sustained per carry-over, volatile std~51). Stockouts P34-P35 (179 demand unmet). LT recent avg=1.5 (4 obs), but P34 order !=LT1 (no P35 arrival). Pipeline inflated by 162 lost; backend unaware, so inflate mu_hat by 162 atop (1+default L=2)*110 fall forecast=330+162=492 to target effective base_stock ~330 accounting for real pipeline post-arrival. Sigma recent_5 captures vol. Ensures orders ~155 now (492-337), then ~175 next (492-(162+155)) replacing real pipeline despite lost bias. z=0 so sigma mainly for cap (adequate).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Late October, fall season for long-sleeved women's jersey top; sustained high demand regime from P31-P37 avg 102 (76,75,186,108,71,90,105), upward trend into cooler weather. On-hand=0, recent stockouts (P33-P37 sold<demand). In-transit=590 = lost P1(158)+P3(4)+likely P34(175)=337 + reliable P36(155)+P37(98)=253. P34 overdue past LT=3 (promised arrive P36 conclude visible, LT=3 P37 conclude; both arrived=0). Lost shipments inflate pipeline; to compensate, desired base_stock=(1+2)*102=306, set explicit mu_hat=306+337=643 so order=643-590=53 replaces lost drag (actual IP post-order=253+53=306). L default (promised 2, observed avg 1.5 but recent delays unconfirmed sustained). Sigma recent_7 for high vol (std~38, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*38~66), supports cap>order qty. Balances service (cover ~100/wk demand) vs holding.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4): Early November, pre-Thanksgiving/Christmas; long-sleeved women's jersey top demand rising for winter/holidays (historical Jan avg~115, recent P36-38:90/105/119 avg~105 up +20% vs summer lows). Fall high-demand regime sustained P31-P38 (8 periods, avg~104). On-hand=0 (stockouts P34-P37 full, P38 partial 98/119), pipeline=545 includes confirmed lost~337 (P1:158,P3:4,P34:175 past LT=3 no P36-38 arr) + P36:155 overdue LT=2 (no P38 arr) possibly lost/delayed LT=3 + P38:53; effective arriving pipeline low ~50-200. Recent LTs short/sustained avg1.4 (5 obs:1,1,2,1,2). To counter backend underordering from ghost lost pipeline (subtracts full 545), explicit mu_hat=800 covers true ~105*3=315 demand over L~2 + ~485 offset for ghosts/losses (order~255 to build buffer for spikes/holidays). recent_N=8 for sigma_hat captures fall vol~37/period *sqrt(2.4)~58.

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11), approaching Thanksgiving (P42 ~11/25-12/2 incl. Black Friday), expect demand spike for women's long-sleeved jersey top (fall/winter suitable). Recent demands P31-P39 avg ~99 (sum 890/9), but Oct highs (P33:186, P37:105, P38:119) + holiday ramp forecast weekly ~140 avg over next 3 periods (100+140+190=430). Confirmed lost shipments total 337 units (P1:158 overdue 39p, P3:4 overdue 37p, P34:175 overdue 6p past LT=3); in-transit 645 overstated by 337 (real pipeline ~308).

Period 41 (2019/11/18): Mid-November, approaching Thanksgiving (11/28) and Black Friday (11/29); as a long-sleeved women's jersey top (fall/winter everyday), demand likely to spike soon amid holiday shopping. Recent demand P31-P40 avg 95 (76,75,186,108,71,90,105,119,60,61), confirming sustained fall regime (+190% vs summer lows per carry-over). On-hand 34 low vs recent demand ~60-119; in-transit 672 bloated w/ ~337 lost (P1:158, P3:4, P34:175; pattern sustained). P38 order 53 overdue past LT=2 (no arr P40). Observed LTs (6): P2:2, P5:1, P6:2, P7:1, P37:1, P36:3 \u2192 avg 1.67. Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture fall volatility/mean for (1+L)~2.67 periods demand ~253 mean, higher base_stock compensates phantom pipeline & imminent spike while balancing q=0.5 service vs holding. recent_N=6 for L uses sustained recent avg. OR backend will cap order but elevated params ensure coverage despite losses/delays.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Pre-Thanksgiving/Black Friday week; long-sleeved women's jersey top likely sees holiday demand spike (historical winter ~115 avg, recent fall regime ~94-111). Recent demands P39-41 avg~62 (possible post-Halloween lull), but prior P32-41 avg94 with volatility from spikes (e.g., P33:186). High position 223 OH +417 IT=640 covers many periods even at 100+ demand. Lost pattern sustained (P34:175, now P38:53 overdue >3pd past promised, no arr P41). LT recent 3 obs (P39 ord LT2@P41, P36 LT3@P39, P37 LT1@P38) avg2. Use recent_N N=3 for L to match sustained avg~2 despite variability/losses. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=10 (P32-41) captures fall regime length~10pd (shift from summer ~35 at P30+), (1+L)~3pd forecast ~282 mean/ std scaled; avoids overreacting to recent 3pd dip amid holiday anticipation. Balances service for spike vs holding (q=0.5) with high inv, OR cap limits excess.

Carry-over insight: P38 order 53 overdue past LT=3 periods (no arrival in P39-P41 conclude), lost pattern sustained

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02), early December pre-Christmas holiday ramp-up for women's long-sleeved winter top; anticipate demand surge ~150/period (historical Jan avg~115, recent peaks P33:186/P42:231, fall sustained ~110 per carry-over, post-Thanksgiving P42:231 +250% vs P39-41 avg62 confirms shift onset). On-hand=0, in-transit=417 bloated by sustained lost shipments ghost inventory ~390 (P1:158/P3:4/P34:175/P38:53, all overdue >>3 periods per history/insights); effective pipeline ~27 (P40:27, possible LT=3 arrival in P43). Position overstated by 390, risks chronic underordering/stockouts. Desired effective base_stock=450=(1+2)*150 holiday median. mu_hat explicit=840=450+390 compensates ghosts (backend order~423 brings total position to 840/effective to 450). L=calculate (7 observed LTs:2,1,2,1,3,1,2 avg1.71). sigma_hat=default leverages historical std/vol for cap/safety. Ensures high service/profits during holiday despite losses/lead variability, limits overstock as q=0.5.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), early December pre-Christmas; women's long-sleeved ribbed jersey top aligns with winter/holiday shopping/gifting demand spikes (e.g., prior Thanksgiving P42:231, Sep P33:186). Recent demand stable fall regime P31-P43 (13 periods) avg~101 (carry-over sustained +190% from summer lows), volatile with spikes suggesting holiday uplift ahead. On-hand=0 risky for P44 demand post-decision; in-transit=813 high but effective lower due to sustained losses (P34:175 overdue 10p, P38:53 overdue 6p, prior P1/P3). Recent LTs: P40 LT3, P39 LT2, P36 LT3, P37 LT1 (avg 2.25). No new arrivals expected P44 (next P43:423 ~P45-46). Set L recent_N=4 for recent delay avg 2.25; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=13 for fall regime changepoint (P31 start, sustained 13p evidence per history/carry-over avg~101, std~50); scales base~(1+2.25)*101~323 (z=0), pipeline>>base so OR orders ~0 avoiding hold while recent vol boosts cap if needed; compensates delays/losses via higher L/recent data without overordering.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), pre-Christmas (Dec 25 ~P46). Women's long-sleeved jersey top suitable for winter/holiday; anticipate demand spike like Thanksgiving P42:231 (Nov25), Sep23:186, Halloween~P38:119. Recent demands P42-44:231/62/45 volatile post-spike avg113. Fall regime sustained ~111 (P31-34). Ghosts confirmed 390 (P1:158+P3:4+P34:175+P38:53 lost, no arrives ever); live pipeline P43:423 only (total in-transit 813 overstated). Compensate by inflating mu_hat by 390. L recent_4 obs LTs (P40:3,P39:2,P36:3,P37:1 avg2.25). Forecast ~140/period holiday-adjusted (fall 111 + uplift), 1+L~3.25 periods raw_mu~455; explicit mu_hat=900 (inflated 455+390+buffer for spikes) yields order~87, effective target 900-390=510 (~157/period), balances stockouts vs holding (q=0.5). Sigma recent_12 (P33-44) captures vol ~100 mean/high std for cap.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 date 2019/12/23 is Christmas week; expect major demand spike for women's long-sleeved top (holiday gifting/apparel peak, evidenced by Thanksgiving P42 demand=231, Sep-end P33=186, historical Jan avg~115). Recent Dec demands low (P43-45 avg~58) but calendar drives proactive high forecast. Confirmed lost shipments P1=158, P3=4, P34=175, P38=53 total~390 inflate in-transit 477 (true pending~87 from P45), gross IP=355+477=832 vs true~442. Target base_stock~1100 to cover expected high cum demand next ~3 periods (~350/week: P46~300, P47~200, P48~150+volatility/buffer), yielding order~268 (cap sufficient: weekly_mu~367 + hist vol safety). L calculate uses all 9 observed LTs avg~1.89 (2,1,2,1,1,3,2,3,2). Sigma default leverages full hist high vol (early 500+ demands) for cap>300. Balances high service vs holding given p=h=1.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): Post-Christmas/New Year's Eve, low demand expected for women's long-sleeved jersey top as holiday peak (e.g., P42:231 on 11/25) passed; recent P43-P46 demands 62/45/68/31 avg52 (-50% vs P34-P42 avg~101), changepoint at P43 with 4 consistent low periods. On-hand 324 + in-transit 745=1069 covers 20+ periods at avg52 demand; sustained lost shipments (P34:175, P38:53 overdue >3 periods past expected). Recent LTs stable (last5 obs: P37 LT1, P36 LT3, P39 LT2, P40 LT3, P43 LT2 avg2.2). Set L recent_5 to use avg~2.2>promised2 accounting for delays/losses; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_4 to capture low mean/vol regime (mu~(1+2.2)*52~157, low sigma~sqrt(3.2)*17~30), yielding low base_stock=mu +0*sigma~157 (q=0.5) vs pipeline, minimizing holding costs on excess inv while buffering low demand/losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift lower post-holiday from P43: P43-P46 avg52 vs P34-P42 avg101 (-49%), consistent 4 periods
