Demand analysis: Peak Christmas season (2019/12/16 Monday to Dec25), calendar expects strong surge for long-sleeved women's top (winter/holiday gifts); P42=231 Thanksgiving spike, P43=62/P44=45 post-TP lull but pre-Christmas rush imminent, historical fall avg~110, expect 150-250/period x3 remaining=450-750 total. OR rec=0 ignores ghosts inflating pipeline, low historical mean (~100 initial), no seasonality/lead variability adjustment. Strategy: Override to 250u matching prior holiday orders (P43/P44), arrives P47 (LT=2) to buffer high-demand P47 without excess ending inventory; covers potential 200+/period avoiding stockouts (e.g., P42 lost 167 sales) while minimizing holding on last periods.

OR rec=0 uses promised LT=2 and full history mean, correctly signals no order needed due to massive pipeline/overstock risk (holding cost=$1/u/period).
