(b) Demand regimes: Long high P28-P41 avg~82, BF peak P42=221 (+170%), post-BF lull P43-P45 avg~19 (-91% crash), sustained 3 periods but calendar-imminent Christmas overrides as new peak regime emerging (not yet data-confirmed). Forecast P46 high 200 avg recent high regime + BF precedent. (c) LT confirmed 2 periods recent large orders (P43 300->P45 LT2, P41 200->P43 LT2, P39 200->P41 LT2); variable 1-3 prior but 300s reliable, no losses recent; P44 300 expected P46 arrival (visible P47), P45 300 expected P47; no new overdues, losses pattern prior small 100s only. (d) On-hand 851 (covers 35+ periods at recent 24 avg or 4 at 200 spike); in-transit 1800 (likely P44 300 + P45 300 + pipeline backlog, total ~2651 visible units >> demand needs); high holding exposure but service level 100%. (e) Order 300 to hedge Christmas multi-period peak (3+ per carry-over prediction), match successful large-order size (avoids small-order loss pattern), replenish pipeline for post-holiday while high profit covers $1 hold; conservative vs overstock risk but prioritizes no stockouts (4$ profit loss).",
