Current date 2019-02-11 is post-CNY, likely normalization or slight drop; no major upcoming events (Valentine's Feb 14 unlikely to spike denim jeans demand significantly).

OR recommendation: 92 units (capped base-stock policy using full history mean=52, L=2, q=0.95; cap\u224892 reflects single-period mean+safety to avoid overordering when pipeline empty). Strategy: Follow OR baseline closely for Period 1 as no game-specific evidence of lead time drift, lost orders, or regime shifts; upward historical trend noted but not yet sustained in-game or post-CNY confirmed.

Multiple lost orders confirmed historically (backlog 832 units inflating in-transit, unreliable pipeline - no recent arrivals expected). Inventory: On-hand 344 (high, covers 10+ periods at recent avg demand ~35); in-transit 832 ghost inventory. Demand analysis: Sustained downward regime since P36 (2019/10/14) through P46 (12/23), avg 49 (P36-46: 63,81,72,46,38,37,85,47,29,26,13) vs prior high P20-35 ~95 (-48%); recent P43-46 avg 29 confirming post-Thanksgiving/Christmas decline (P42=85 holiday bump, P46=13 low). Product (ladies skinny ankle jeans) sees low winter/post-holiday demand (ankle style less suitable cold weather, sales slump 12/30 New Year's Eve). OR recommends 0 using promised LT=2 and full history (diluted by old highs/lows). Strategy: No order needed - 344 on-hand buffers (L+1)=4 periods demand (~140-200) at LT belief 2-3; avoid adding to holdings amid low demand outlook and lost shipment risk. Follow OR baseline.",
