P32 order (60) overdue if LT=2 (no P34 arrival), poss LT=3 arrive P35 or lost. In-transit 1200 likely ghost/lost (carry-over: prior 1140 fully lost, zero live post-P23; no large recent orders match). (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 157 (P34 end), covers 8-15 periods at 10-20 demand. Pipeline unreliable (1200 ghost, minimal/zero expected live arrivals soon). No stockouts recent. (e) Order logic: High on-hand vs low demand = heavy holding risk ($1/unit/period); order 0 preserves cash, avoids adding to lost-prone pipeline; re-assess if fall uptick materializes (covers ~12 remaining periods).",

Historical Jan-Feb ~134 avg irrelevant to current winter-end regime. (b) Demand ultra-low sustained P40-46 avg ~3.9 (1,1,15,2,2,5,1; P42=15 outlier not repeated), confirms carry-over no holiday uptick into Christmas week; forecast ~2-5/period, no regime shift. (c) LT variable 1-3 periods historically, but in-transit 1140 fully ghost/lost (6+ confirmed losses per carry-over, zero live pipeline); no new arrivals expected. (d) On-hand 169 ample for 30+ periods at ~4 demand/period; no pipeline, ending inv high risks holding costs ($1/unit/period \xd7169=$169 loss/period if unsold).
