  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, historical actuals vary 1-3 periods with sustained lost shipments (e.g., P38 order 100u 5+ overdue by P44, pattern persists; recent P44 order 100u likely overdue as absent P46). In-transit 980u reflects heavy past ordering but high loss risk (historical totals ~180u+ non-arriving escalating). Inventory: On-hand=0 (risking stockout P47), massive pipeline covers 10-20+ periods even at 50% loss rate (~490u effective). Demand analysis: Christmas surge P45=73/P46=70 (+360% from P42-P44 avg~12), but P47=12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's Eve - expect sharp drop to historical winter lows (~20-30, cf. initial Jan-Feb avg~38) as holiday gifting peaks over; necklace accessories not strong NYE driver. OR rec=0 aligns with base-stock exceeded by pipeline (its mu_hat + safety <<980); no override needed as (L+1)=3 periods demand outlook ~60-90 << pipeline. Strategy: Order 0 to avoid excess holding on likely declining demand, rely on pipeline (monitor for further losses).",
