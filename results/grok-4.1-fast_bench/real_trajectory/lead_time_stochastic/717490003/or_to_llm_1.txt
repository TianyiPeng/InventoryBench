{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows variation (1-3 periods) and many losses (total ~1445+ units stuck, current in-transit 825 confirms sustained lost shipment pattern with no recent arrivals P33-46 despite prior orders). No new arrivals expected soon as recent orders=0. Inventory position: On-hand=83 (covers ~5 periods at recent avg demand 15), in-transit=825 (likely permanent losses, no holding cost until arrival). Demand analysis: Winter low sustained P36-46 avg~15 (-80% vs summer P16-23 avg110, 11 periods confirmed including P46=16 post-Christmas); no holiday spikes (e.g., P42 Thanksgiving=22 minor, P45-46 Christmas=16 no surge); 2019/12/30 post-Christmas into New Year, T-shirt demand remains low in cold weather. OR recommendation: 0 units (appropriate given low recent demand mean/variance, high on-hand relative to forecast).
