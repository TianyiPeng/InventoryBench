(b) Demand regime: Winter trough sustained P36-P45 avg15 (range7-24, volatile but -85% vs high regime102); P38-P45 avg13.1; low post-summer decline deepened winter, no Christmas spike evidence yet (P45=16 slight up but within volatility).

(c) Lead time/missing: Promised LT=2, historical variability 1-3; no recent orders since P32, but arrival drought P36-P45 (10 periods arr=0) confirms sustained winter supplier failure/loss pattern; in-transit 1228 entirely ghosts (prior losses ~1228 accumulated). No new LT data. (d) Inv&pipeline: On-hand 129 covers ~8-10 periods at trough demand (~15); effective real pipeline=0 (ghosts useless, no arrivals expected); high on-hand from prior overstock during regime shift. (e) Order logic: Order 0 to avoid inflating ghosts amid supplier failure; 129 on-hand sufficient for low demand (profit=holding=1, prioritize avoiding losses/stockouts but supply unreliable; drain inventory slowly via sales minus holding equivalence).",
