  "rationale": "(a) World knowledge & product: Mariette Blazer (women's fitted jacket, tailoring) sees strong fall/winter demand for dressed events; Dec 16 (2019/12/16) is pre-Christmas week (Dec 25), prime holiday shopping peak after Black Friday (P42 Nov25), expect sustained high demand 400-700 driven by gifting/parties, aligning with carry-over forecast P43-P47 500-800. (b) Demand regime: Holiday peak confirmed (P42:733 +190%); post-BF volatility (P43:169 dip, P44:304 rebound +79%), rising trend into Christmas (P44 > P43), reinforces high regime ~400-600 avg P45-P47 vs fall baseline 290; no sustained shift (volatile 3 periods). Historical winter avg ~173 irrelevant now. (c) Lead time vs missing orders: Confirmed variable 1-3 periods (recent P43: LT3 P40/P41 LT2; high loss risk sustained, e.g., P42/P44 arrived=0 overdue possibles); no new patterns, pipeline unreliable timing but volume high. P44 order (600) exp P45-47, prior losses don't alter. (d) Inventory & pipeline: OH=327 covers <1 period at 400+ demand (risk P45 stockout); in-transit=5170 massive buffer (~10x remaining demand est 1500-2100 total P45-47), even at 50% loss risk covers fully; recent arrivals P43=800 show supply flow despite losses. (e) Final order logic: Order 600 to reinforce pipeline for P46-P47 (arrives LT1-3, within game end), hedge timing/losses/peak demand while minimizing excess holding ($1/period cheap vs $19 profit, 3 periods left); matches recent sizing (P44:600), avoids stockout penalty outweighing minor hold cost.",
