Demand analysis: Very low sustained post-summer into mid-December (carry-over P34-P45 avg ~7, 12 periods <16u, -92% vs summer peak 193); no holiday uptick signal despite Thanksgiving (P42=15 minor) and Christmas approach (P43-45:2,5,6 avg4); product Nora T-shirt (women's basic jersey) unlikely major holiday gift, favors warmer apparel in Dec; dates 2019/12/23 (Christmas Eve week) but history overrides with no spike. OR rec=0 uses promised LT/historical demand but aligns perfectly with reality (low mu, high inventory). Strategy: Follow OR at 0; high on-hand buffers any potential mild holiday bump without risking more holding costs ($1/u/p) on unnecessary stock amid phantom pipeline; monitor P46-47 for any late Christmas signal but no proactive order needed (covers L+1=3+ periods easily).",
