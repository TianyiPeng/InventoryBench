(c) LT varies 1-2 consistently recent (e.g., P10 no arr P11 \u2192 LT2 for P12; P9 LT1 P10, P8 LT2 P10); no new losses (recent orders all confirmed); known lost P1(180),P3(140),P4(120)=440 still bloating in-transit count.

(e) Order 160: replenishes pipeline for P13-P14 demand (~150/period) post-P12 coverage; balances high service (avoid $4 lost profit/stockouts like P11) vs $1 holding on existing heavy effective pipeline; matches recent order sizing.",
