(b) Demand regime: Sustained winter low, recent P41-P44: 10/41/28/3 (avg 20.5, volatile; P42=41 possible Thanksgiving/early holiday blip, but P44=3 confirms no surge). Forecast P45 ~10-20. Matches historical winter lows vs summer peaks (e.g., P20=254). (c) Lead time: Promised 2; recent confirmed LT=2 (P39->P41, P41->P43). P42(20u) overdue (exp P44 absent); chronic losses (in-transit 1330 mostly lost/ghost per carry-over total losses 740u+, no arrivals P44=0). P43(50u) exp P45 LT=2 possible. Supplier failure sustained. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=2 (covers <1 low-demand period), ending P44 inv=2 low. Pipeline unreliable despite 1330u (effective ~recent small deliveries). No confirmed arrivals imminent beyond possible P43. (e) Order logic: Low demand forecast, high holding cost (=profit), unreliable LT/losses, near end (P45/47). Order conservatively 20u to cover ~1-2 periods (~15-30 total) + minor safety, avoiding excess hold/stockouts balanced. Matches recent successful small orders.",
