(e) Order 60: Replenish conservatively for 1-2 periods holiday demand (~55 avg), buffer losses/variability; high on-hand minimizes holding risk ($1/unit) vs sales loss ($19/unit); endgame (44/47) favors service level over lean stock given unreliable supply.",

(b) Demand regime: Holiday uptick sustained P40-P44 avg45 (+25% vs P36-P39 avg36), 5 periods despite P44 dip to 32; volatile recently (P42:66 high, P43-44:38/32 low) but avg stable vs fall taper; forecast P45~45-55, P46-47 holiday peak ~60-80 given Christmas proximity.

  "rationale": "(a) Product: Ellen Thong (Malva) L 3pk, women's underwear/lingerie. World knowledge: Late Dec 2019 (12/30, post-Christmas, pre-NYE 1/1/2020). Holiday gifting/party prep demand likely peaked mid-Dec (volatile low ~30s), now post-Christmas returns/shopping fatigue + year-end taper expected for lingerie; early 2019 Jan data showed 50-70 avg but summer tapered to 60s, fall 30-50s. No major spike anticipated for NYE underwear. (b) Demand regime: Holiday uptick (P40-P45 avg43 +19% vs fall) sustained/volatile into late Dec per carry-over, but P46=16 signals sharp post-Christmas collapse (-63% vs P40-P45); recent P43-P46 avg~30 low/stable, confirming end of holiday regime into year-end low (~20-40 forecast for P47, aligning Jan historical ramp but muted post-holiday). No new sustained shift (P44-P46 only 3 periods, volatile). (c) Lead time: Promised 2, actual variable (1-3 observed), high loss rate (13 confirmed lost, sustained pattern); recent P46 arrived=0 (P44 order=60 expected P46 L=2 overdue 1 period, pending 3-period confirmation for loss); P45(70) expected P47, P46(90) P48. No new L change. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=220 (covers 7-10 periods at 20-40/wk forecast); in-transit=1495 inflated by persistent losses (e.g., prior undeclared lost keep inflating total); post-P46 ending=220 ample vs low demand, but arrivals (if any) will boost further. (e) Order logic: High on-hand + unreliable bloated pipeline + post-holiday low demand regime = no need to order; avoid adding to holding cost burden (220*1=$220/period already high); order 0 prioritizes drawing down inv while covering forecast from current stock, monitoring for arrivals/loss confirms next periods.",
