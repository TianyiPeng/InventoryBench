======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variable 1-3 periods with sustained reliability (no new losses in P24-46 concludes per carry-over). Promised LT=2 aligns reasonably. Inventory status: On-hand=0, but massive 735 in-transit pipeline (legacy from summer orders) covers 70+ periods at current very low demand rate (~9u/period P37-46 avg). No overdue losses recently. Demand analysis: Tank top (summer garment) in very low post-Labor Day/winter regime sustained P37-46 avg ~9u/demand (P46=6), no holiday uptick despite Christmas/New Year's (2019/12/30 irrelevant for tank tops); reverting to historical ~32u but actually lower now (-72% vs summer peak). OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and all-history demand (ignores regime shift to low). Strategy: Fully follow OR at 0 - no need to order with huge pipeline and minimal demand; avoids holding cost buildup. Expected coverage: In-transit sufficient for months of low demand without stockouts imminent.",
