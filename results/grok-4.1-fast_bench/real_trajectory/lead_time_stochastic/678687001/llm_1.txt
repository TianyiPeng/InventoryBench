Initial hist (Jan-Feb ~110 avg) higher than recent fall/winter lows (~30).\n(b) Demand regime: Holiday spike (P42=136 +240% vs winter) 1pd only; P43-P44 avg25 (-81% vs P42, -35% vs prior winter P37-P41 avg38). Stabilizing low post-BF ~30; Christmas proximity may lift P45-P46 to ~40-50 (winter base + seasonal), but evidence favors caution\u2014no sustained high.\n(c) Lead-time/missing orders: LT varies (1-3 observed, e.g. P32 ord arr P35 LT=3); sustained losses confirmed (no arrivals P40-P44, overdue persist). Recent P42(100u LT3?->P45), P43(200 LT2?->P45), P44(200 LT1?->P45) possible but low prob given pattern\u2014treat pipeline skeptically.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout risk P45); in-transit=1880 (mostly lost backlog per history).

{
  "rationale": "(a) KARIN SPORTS BRA (H&M fitness underwear/bra, fast-drying functional fabric, medium support): Fitness/sports apparel sees seasonal boosts from NY fitness resolutions (Jan+), holiday gifting peaks (Nov-Dec), summer activity; history aligns with early-year avg~110 (Jan'19 samples), summer decline (noted P19-26 avg~50), winter uptick (P37-41 ~38), BF/Christmas spikes (P42=136, P45=409, P46=338). P47=2019/12/30 (post-Christmas/NY Eve week): expect post-holiday drop from peaks but NY resolution uptick potential toward historical Jan~110 vs recent winter base~30-40.\n(b) Demand regime: Extreme holiday spikes P45=409 (12/16 pre-Christmas), P46=338 (12/23 Christmas week) avg374 (+900% vs P37-P44 winter/fall ~35-40); P42 BF=136 also event-driven. Post-BF lows P43-44 ~25 not sustained; overall winter+holiday volatile (high variance), transitioning post-Xmas to ~80-120 (blending resolution lift + historical Jan avg110, moderated by post-peak drop).\n(c) LT variable (1-3 observed, recent LT=2-3 e.g. P45 arrivals); sustained losses confirmed (no arr P46, persist thru P46 per carry-over; early losses like P1/P3/P4 never arrived).

Covers uncertain future but high stockout risk now/immediate.\n(e) Order 250: Target ~100-120/period forecast x (max LT3 +1 safety + loss buffer 50%) = ~400 pipeline need; conservative vs prior 350 (P46), builds buffer for NY uptick/resolution demand while minimizing holding on unreliable supply; prioritizes sales recovery ($4p vs $1h).",
