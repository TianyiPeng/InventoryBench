Demand analysis: Recent P42=101 (Thanksgiving spike), P43=41/P44=45 stockouts low (avg43, continuing Nov lull P37-P41 avg44); however, P45=12/16 approaches Christmas (P46~12/23 peak gifting week for men's socks - expect surge to 150-250+ based on summer highs ~130-140 + holiday uplift, overriding dips). Historical early-year ~33 avg irrelevant now. OR rec=0 (valid per low recent demand + high pipeline under promised LT=2/i.i.d. assumption, but ignores seasonality/losses). Strategy: Pipeline 985 likely covers 3 remaining periods' demand (~150x3=450, even at 30% loss rate ~200 lost nets 785>450); ordering more risks high ending holding ($1/unit) post-P47 with no further sales.

{
  "rationale": "Period 47 (2019/12/30, post-Christmas New Year's week). Product: men's basic sneaker socks - post-holiday demand typically stabilizes or dips after Christmas gifting peak, no major surge expected despite prior monitoring of holiday uptick (P45=64 +46% vs Nov lull avg44, but P46=55 flat/moderate confirms no sustained Christmas surge). Recent demand: P44=45, P45=64, P46=55 (avg~55, +25% vs P37-P41 Nov lull 44 but below summer highs). Long-term patterns: sustained end-of-summer/back-to-school dip P24-P37 avg68 (-48% vs summer 133), extended into Nov lull P37-P41 avg44; holiday signals not sustained (P42=101 Thanksgiving spike isolated, P43-44 low). Lead-time: stabilized ~2 periods recently (P43 LT2 P45, prior P23 LT3, P27 LT3 outliers); P44 order 200 overdue 1 period past LT2 (no P46 arrival) - aligns with persistent lost pattern (prior confirmed ~635 units lost), monitor P47 conclude for LT3 or lost. Inventory: OH=31 (low, covers <1 period), but massive in-transit=835 (covers 12+ periods at ~70 avg or 15+ at recent ~55, even accounting for potential losses). No recent arrivals in P46 (arrived=0). OR recommends 0 (using promised LT=2, historical demand - ignores losses/variability/seasonality, but aligns with high pipeline vs low-moderate demand outlook).
