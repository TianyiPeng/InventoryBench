{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2; recent confirmed LT=2 for P43 order arriving P45; P44 order (200 units) overdue past LT=2 (no P46 arrival), likely lost aligning with sustained loss pattern (e.g., P24/P26/P29 lost per carry-over); expect P45 order (250 units) possibly arriving P47 (LT=2), P46 order (250) P48. Many prior losses inflate in-transit (ghosts ~800+ per history). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0, in-transit=1593 (effective ~600-800 after ghosts); covers 4-5 periods at recent avg demand ~140 (P43-P46: 108+163+169+123=140 avg). Demand analysis: Holiday surge peaked P42-P45 avg~178; P46=123 (-27% drop) on Dec23 pre-Christmas; P47=Dec30 post-Christmas expects further decline for denim jeans (not prime return/gift item, seasonal normalization). Historical initial avg~122, recent high but fading. OR recommendation=0 based on promised LT=2 and full history (ignores losses/regimes); agree as pipeline vastly exceeds (L+1)=3 periods demand (~420 at 140 avg), even post-loss adjustment. Strategy: Order 0 to avoid excess holding on declining demand; rely on incoming pipeline to rebuild post-P46 stockout.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - in-transit 1593 units (even after ~800 ghosts) covers multiple periods of post-holiday demand (~140 avg recent, expected decline Dec30); avoids building excess amid fading Christmas surge.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand post-holiday decline initiating late Dec: P46=123 vs P45=169 (-27%), monitor for sustained drop over next periods as Christmas peak normalizes for denim jeans.",
