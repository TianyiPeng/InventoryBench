Date 2019/12/16 (Mon) is peak Christmas shopping season (Xmas Dec 25 in ~9 days, within P45-P46); apparel like denim jeans can see holiday gift/demand uptick, but this niche fashion style may not spike dramatically vs staples. Historical winter demand (Jan-Feb 2019: avg ~12) moderate; recent pre-holiday decline despite BF/Thanksgiving noted.

No new holiday spike confirmed (needs 3+ periods evidence); forecast 40-80/period short-term with caution. (c) Lead time & missing: Confirmed variable LT=1-3; sustained lost/delayed pattern (multiple orders like P26/P33 confirmed lost overdue 3-4+ periods). In-transit 1540 not yet resolved\u2014some likely lost given history; no new arrivals in P44/P43/P42/P41/P40/P39 confirms ongoing issues. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 459 ample (covers 10+ periods at 40/demand); in-transit 1540 massive (total ~2000u pipeline, even 50% loss leaves excess); recent no arrivals, low sales (P44 demand=17, ending=459 from 476). High ending inv risk with only 3 periods left (45-47). (e) Final order logic: Zero order\u2014current stock + pipeline covers all remaining demand even with holiday uptick/losses; adding risks higher ending holding costs ($1/u/period) outweighs low stockout risk (profit 19 but demand met); preserve vs overstock near endgame.",
