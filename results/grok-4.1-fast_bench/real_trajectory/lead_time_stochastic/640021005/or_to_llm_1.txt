In-transit 2204 largely ghost/unreliable per carry-over lost pattern. Inventory: On-hand 240 ample for low demand (~37/period recent avg covers >6 periods); post-decision demand for P46 satisfied from current on-hand before any new arrival. Demand analysis: Sustained very low P39-P45 avg ~37 (47,24,31,78,25,17,28), over 7 periods; prior carry-over notes low despite pre-Christmas (P43-P45 Dec2-16: avg23), no spike into Dec23 (Christmas Eve week) for jeans product - possibly low gift relevance or seasonal mismatch. Historical peaks were earlier (e.g., back-to-school Aug-Sep, early spikes Feb-Apr); current regime low stable. OR recommendation: 0 units, aligns with low mu_hat from history (ignores ghosts but correctly sees low recent demand, high effective coverage). Strategy: Follow OR 0 - no need to order given ample on-hand, unreliable pipeline, sustained low demand even near Christmas; avoids adding to ghost inventory risk while critical fractile favors avoiding stockouts but current buffer sufficient (240 >> 3*37~110 for LT+1).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - sustained low demand (P39-P45 avg 37) despite Christmas week proximity (Dec23), with ample on-hand inventory (240 covers >6 periods at recent rates).",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2; history shows variability (LT=1,2,3 observed recently, e.g., P43 order arrived P45 LT=2, no recent arrivals in P46); many lost shipments confirmed historically (e.g., P24, P34 lost), contributing to ghost in-transit 2204 (unreliable pipeline). Inventory: On-hand 232 (ample for 5-10 periods at recent avg ~30 demand/period); in-transit 2204 mostly ghost per carry-over patterns, no arrivals in P46 conclude. Demand analysis: Very low sustained post-back-to-school/Christmas slump per carry-over (P39-P45 avg37, P46=8 confirms deepening to P39-P46 avg32); Dec30 post-Christmas timing for jeans (non-holiday peak item) supports continued low demand ~20-40/period, no regime shift upward. OR rec=0 aligns with low historical mean used by OR and current realities (low demand, high on-hand, unreliable supply). Strategy: Follow OR at 0; no order needed as 232 on-hand covers (LT+1)=3 periods easily (232>>90), avoids adding to ghost inventory/holding costs amid low sales.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - demand deepened to avg 32 over P39-P46 (post-Christmas low for jeans), on-hand 232 covers 6+ periods, ghost in-transit 2204 unreliable.",
