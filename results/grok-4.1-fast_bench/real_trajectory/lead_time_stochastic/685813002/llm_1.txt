Winter regime persists but post-peak softening expected into Jan.(b) Demand regime: Holiday winter high sustained P37-45 avg~90 (+20-300% vs summer/fall baselines per carry-over), Black Friday peak 212, pre-Christmas extension P41-45 avg~100; P46=46 signals emerging post-holiday drop (-60% vs P45), but 1 period insufficient for sustained shift (monitor 3+). Forecast P47: 50-80 (conservative post-peak winter avg).(c) Lead time: Confirmed variable 1-3 periods recently (e.g., P45: LT=3/2; P39 LT=3); sustained losses (~760u total, recent P34 lost); arrival drought P46 (1 period post-P45's 300u), not yet sustained (prior droughts 4 periods noted). P44(250)/P45(250) likely arriving P47-48 (LT=2-3 exp), explaining 1555 in-transit; no new LT/loss patterns sustained.(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 142 covers 2-3 periods (at 50-80 demand); massive in-transit 1555 (likely P44/45 + backlog, ~500 imminent) risks severe overstock/holding costs post-arrival; recent sales covered but P42-44/46 stockouts lost ~400u profit.(e) Order logic: Order 0 to avoid exacerbating pipeline flood (1555u incoming vs low post-holiday demand); prioritize drawing down inventory (holding $1/u vs profit $4/u, but excess risks prolonged costs); reassess if drought persists.",
