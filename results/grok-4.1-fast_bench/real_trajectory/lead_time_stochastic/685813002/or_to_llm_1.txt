  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent concluded arrivals confirm LT variability of 1-3 periods (e.g., P45: P42 order LT=3, P43 LT=2; P43: P40 LT=3, P41 LT=2), with persistent lost/delayed shipments bloating IT to 609u (no recent arrivals in P46 despite expectations, cumulative lost >500u as per carry-over). Promised LT=2 remains unreliable. Inventory position: Strong OH=105u covers 2-3 periods at recent avg ~50-80u demand; massive IT=609u unreliable due to losses but provides buffer if any arrive. Demand analysis: Winter/sweatshirt seasonality with holiday peaks (P42 BF=212u, P43-45 Christmas avg~96u), but P46 post-Christmas dip to 46u (-59% vs P45=112), signaling potential end-of-year trough into early Jan 2020 (no major events post-Dec30). Historical winter avg ~79u (P30-39), but recent volatility and dip suggest ~50u outlook for P47. OR recommendation: 0u based on promised LT=2 and full history (mean likely pulled down by summer troughs), but aligns perfectly with bloated pipeline, high OH coverage, and lost shipment risks\u2014ordering more risks excess holding costs ($1/u/period) on unreliable supply. Strategy: Follow OR at 0u to avoid overstocking; monitor P47-49 for post-holiday demand stabilization and IT arrivals before future orders. Covers (L+1)=3-4 periods demand conservatively.",
