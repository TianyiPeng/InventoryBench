  "rationale": "(a) Product is women's swimwear bottoms (Cheeky Tanga bikini bottoms); highly seasonal with summer peaks (Apr-Aug) and deep winter troughs (Oct-Mar), no holiday demand drivers like Christmas (12/16/19) as swimwear irrelevant in Dec cold season. (b) Demand regime: sustained deep off-season trough per carry-over (P37-P41 avg33, volatile ~20-50); recent P42-P44 (75,37,35 avg49 volatile, but P43-P44 drop to ~36 confirms no recovery/holiday spike, stable low ~35-40/period matching post-Labor Day collapse pattern since P25; forecast ~35/period near-term. (c) Lead time: confirmed variable (1-3 periods historically), but no recent orders placed (since P27), thus no new arrivals/concludes; in-transit 5150u are persistent ghosts from prior lost shipments (e.g., P24/P26 confirmed lost, pattern of 9+ lost totaling 7000+u); no overdue inference needed. (d) Inventory/pipeline: on-hand 911u covers ~26 periods at ~35dmd/period (excessive vs holding $1/u/pd); pipeline 5150u ghosts (ignore for coverage, won't arrive); post-P44 ending 911u from sustained no-order strategy avoiding more ghosts. (e) Final order logic: order 0 to minimize holding costs on excess inventory during confirmed winter trough; on-hand ample for low demand, no pipeline support needed, avoid adding to ghost risk.",
