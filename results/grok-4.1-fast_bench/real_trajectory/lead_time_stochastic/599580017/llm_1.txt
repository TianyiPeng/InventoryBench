Initial zeros, then ramp-up (61\u219298\u2192152, +37%, +55%). Recent 3-period avg ~104, last=152, linear trend slope ~46/wk suggests next ~198. Forecast Period 1 (2/11) ~170-200; early season build.

{
  "rationale": "(a) Swimwear (women's bikini bottoms): Highly seasonal with summer peaks (Jun-Aug, e.g., July4 demand 771+), sharp post-summer decline to off-season lows (Sep-Jan). Current 2019/12/30: late Dec post-Christmas/New Year's eve, deep winter off-season; historical Jan 2019 starts at 0 demand, no calendar drivers for swimwear spikes. (b) Demand regime: Very low winter stable P43-P46 avg56 (51/57/58/57), consistent with prior off-season avg36-55 (P37-P42 volatile but no shift); P42:113 outlier (Thanksgiving, irrelevant for swimwear). Forecast P47: ~55, sustained low thru Jan. (c) Lead time: Total delivery failure sustained (no arrivals P28-P46: 19pd straight, vs prior 16pd thru P43); 4260 in-transit backlog lost indefinitely (ultra-delays >20pd past LT2 exp for oldest). Recent LT observations irrelevant as pattern broken. (d) Inventory: On-hand 82 covers ~1.5 periods demand (82>55); pipeline 4260 worthless (holding cost $4260/period >> profit); ending inv from P46:82 after 57 sold. (e) Order 0: On-hand covers forecast + buffer; avoid adding to lost backlog amid $1 holding=$1 profit (breakeven only at 100% sell-thru, impossible); preserve capital for potential spring ramp-up.",
