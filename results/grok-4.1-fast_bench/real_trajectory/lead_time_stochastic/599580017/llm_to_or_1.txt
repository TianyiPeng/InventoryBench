Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), swimwear product. No prior in-game history, on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demands [0,0,61,98,152]; changepoint after first 2 zeros (regime_length=3, recent mean=103.67 vs all=62.2). Swimwear demand ramping early year ahead of summer season. No lead time observations. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent higher demand regime (mu_hat~(1+2)*103.67=311, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*45.6~79); L default (promised=2). Raises base_stock to cover rising demand over 3 periods, balancing p=h=$1 (q=0.5) while minimizing initial stockouts/hold costs. No overdue shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18), swimwear bottoms. Winter season but demand ramping up seasonally toward spring/summer (historical: Jan7:0, Jan14:0, then changepoint to higher; Period 1 demand=129 confirms). On-hand=0, in-transit=179 (from Period 1 order=179), no arrivals in Period 1 conclude as expected (promised L=2 means arrives during Period 3). Pipeline covers ~1.4 periods at recent demand ~110-130. No concluded arrivals yet, so no lead time inference possible. Changepoint evidence: post-2019-01-14, sustained high demand regime over 4 periods (Jan21:61, Jan28:98, Feb4:152, Feb11:129; mean=110, +>100% vs prior 0). Set L=default (promised 2). mu_hat recent_N=4 (mean~110 *3=330). sigma_hat recent_N=4 (std~39.5 *sqrt(3)~68). Raises forecast to recent regime, boosting base stock ~330 (z~0 for q=0.5) to cover demand spikes, order ~151 to replenish after stockout, balancing profit from sales vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-01-21: avg increased from 0 (first 2 periods) to 110 over last 4 periods (61,98,152,129; >100% increase, sustained)

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25): Swimwear product entering early season ramp-up (late Feb, post-winter). Demands surging: historical 0,0 then shift to 61,98,152 (avg ~104), game P1:129, P2:213 (recent avg 130.6 over last 5). Carry-over confirms regime shift at 2019-01-21 sustained >100% increase. On-hand=0, in-transit=330 (P1 order 179 expected arrive during P3 if L=2; P2 order 151 during P4). No arrivals yet (normal, first possible in P3 conclude). No overdue/losses. Use L default (promised 2, no observed LTs). mu_hat recent_5 (regime length=5 since changepoint, N=5; backend computes 3x mean~392 to cover rising demand over L+1=3). sigma_hat recent_5 (captures recent volatility ~sd=54, sqrt(3)x54~94). Addresses stockouts by boosting base_stock~392 (z~0 so ~mu), order=min(392-330,cap)~62, balancing q=0.5 service vs holding; anticipates seasonal swim demand growth.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), swimwear bottoms, early March - off-peak season but demands surging (P1:129, P2:213, P3:175, avg 172; prior regime ~110 avg). Stockouts persist (sold=0 each period), on-hand=0, in-transit=392 (P1:179+P2:151+P3:62). No arrivals through P3; P1 order overdue (promised L=2 \u2192 arrive P3, but arrived=0 in P3 conclude), suggesting longer lead or loss. New demand changepoint: avg +55% to 172 over last 3 periods. Set mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_3 (N=3=max(min(regime_length=3,20),3)) to capture elevated mean/volatility (~172, std~42), scaling to (1+L)~4 periods \u2192 base_stock ~688 + z*168 for q=0.5. L explicit=3 to bridge backend's promised L=2 unawareness, ensuring coverage for delay. Pipeline 392 covers ~2.3 periods@172; params prompt ~300 order, balancing lost sales vs holding amid delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 2 (2019-02-18): avg increased from 110 (prior 4 periods:61,98,152,129) to 172 over last 3 periods (129,213,175; +55% increase, sustained)

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11), swimwear product; early spring, sustained high demand regime ~172 avg (P1-P4:129,213,175,173), no new calendar spikes evident. On-hand=0, in-transit=483 (P1:179 overdue/no arrival in P3/P4 concludes, possibly lost/delayed LT>3; P3:62 expected P5; P4:242 expected P6). Confirmed LT=2 (P2 order arrived P4). P1 order overdue flags potential losses. Use default L (promised 2, matches recent observed). recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime length>=4 since shift at P2, N=max(min(4,20),3)=4; avg~172, std~34). Base stock~ mu_hat=3*172=516 (z*=0), order=min(516-483,cap)~33 to cover demand while minimizing holding; recent params ensure OR adapts to high-demand regime despite possible pipeline losses.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): Swimwear product in early spring; sustained high demand regime (carry-over confirmed shifts to avg ~174 last 5 periods: P1=129, P2=213, P3=175, P4=173, P5=181; mean=174.2, std~30). Pipeline: in-transit=518 (P1:179 overdue since exp P3, absent P3-P5 concludes\u2192likely lost; P3:62 overdue since exp P5, absent P5\u2192likely lost/delayed; P4:242 exp P6; P5:35 exp P7); effective pipeline ~277 after losses. Only 1 LT observed=2 (P2\u2192P4). To bridge lost shipments & overstated pipeline (backend unaware), explicit L=3 for (1+L)=4 period coverage (~696 demand). mu_hat recent_5: (1+3)*174.2=697 base_stock target (z=0). sigma_hat recent_5: sqrt(4)*30~60 for cap. Orders ~697-518=179 to rebuild despite losses, balancing service (high demand) vs holding (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost/delayed shipments pattern: P1 order 179u (exp arrive P3, absent P3-P5 concludes); P3 order 62u (exp P5, absent P5 conclude)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Swimwear bottoms, late March approaching spring/summer season with potential spring break demand spikes; historical pattern shows sustained high demand since early Feb (last 6 periods: 129,213,175,173,181,200 avg=178.5, std~28.8; recent 3:173-200 avg=184.7). No new demand changepoint (stable high regime, regime_length=6 >=3). Lead times observed: P2->P4 (2), P5->P6 (1); avg=1.5 but lost shipments (P1 179, P3 62 prolonged absent; P4 242 absent P6 conclude, 1pd past exp L=2) inflate in-transit 662 (likely effective ~179 from P6 only). On-hand=0 risks stockouts. Reconcile: set L explicit 3 to account for delays/lost as effective longer lead time, bridging OR backend's lack of lost awareness. mu_hat recent_N N=6 (regime_length=6, cap20,min3) for high-demand evidence. sigma_hat recent_N N=6 matching volatility. Yields base_stock~714 (z=0), order~52 vs cap~225; rebuilds inventory post-losses, targets service >50% given profit=holding=1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1): Swimwear product, early April spring timing signals rising seasonal demand into summer/Easter (Apr 21), confirmed by P7 demand spike to 268 (up from prior). Demands P4-P7:173,181,200,268 (mean 205.5, +19% vs all-history mean 191); sustained upward regime since P5 (length 4 periods). Pipeline 714u unreliable: P1 179u lost (absent 5+ periods past exp P3); P3 62u delayed 3 periods past exp P5; P4 242u delayed 2 periods past exp P6; only P2 L=2, P5 L=1 observed (avg 1.5). Set L explicit=3 to bridge delay/lost risk, increasing base stock coverage over longer horizon. mu_hat recent_N=4 captures rising regime mean 205.5*(1+3)=822. sigma_hat recent_N=4 for matching volatility (std~43*sqrt(4)~86). Balances higher service for profit vs holding by inflating L/mu for unreliability/rise, targets base~822 - unreliable 714 + losses ~ order buffer while capping overstock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5 (2019/3/11): avg increased from 172 (prior) to 216 over P5-P7 (181,200,268; +25%, sustained 3 periods); Confirmed lost shipment P1 179u (absent through P7, 5 periods past exp P3); Extended delays P3 62u/P4 242u still pending >2-3 periods past exp (P5/P6)

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8): Women's swimwear bottoms; spring ramp-up into Easter (Apr 21) and summer, demand surging with P8=376 (record high), P6-P8 avg=281 (+30% vs prior P5-P7 avg=216, sustained 3 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=591 = P1:179 (lost), P3:62 (overdue 4+ periods past exp P5), P4:242 (overdue 3+ past P6), P8:108 (recent, likely reliable); phantom ~483u, effective pipeline ~108u. Observed LTs: 2(P2\u2192P4),1(P5\u2192P6),2(P6\u2192P8),1(P7\u2192P8) avg=1.5. To counter phantom overstatement (backend subtracts full 591), set explicit mu_hat=1491 (base_stock=1491 targeting effective coverage ~1000u for 3 periods @ ~330u/period), sigma_hat=424 to yield cap\u2248900u (1491/3 +1.645*424/\u221a3 \u2248497+403=900); order=900u (1491-591=900 \u2264cap), yielding effective post-order ~1008u + new reliable supply. L=default (2) conservative buffer over avg1.5. Addresses losses by inflating target/cap to force catch-up order, balancing profit/holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 (2019/3/18): avg increased from 216 (P5-P7) to 281 over P6-P8 (200,268,376; +30%, sustained 3 periods); Confirmed lost shipments P3 62u (absent P5-P8 concludes, 4 periods past exp P5); P4 242u (absent P6-P8, 3 periods past exp P6)

Recent demand P6-P9 (200,268,376,295) avg=284.75, std=72.8, confirms sustained high regime from P6 shift (+30% per carry-over).

Effective pipeline ~1250u (P8=108 exp P10, P9=900 exp P11). Explicit L=6 inflates base_stock=(1+6)*284.75~1709>1491 (order~218) or higher; recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat ensures undistorted cap~285+120=405 based on true recent mean/volatility. Compensates losses/delays (OR unaware) by enabling order~cap while base>pipe, balancing stockouts vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment P4 242u (absent P6-P9 concludes, 4 periods past exp P6); total lost shipments inflating pipeline: 483u (P1=179, P3=62, P4=242)

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22): Swimwear product in late April, seasonal ramp-up toward summer expected; Easter (Apr 21) may influence but demand stable high. Recent demands P6-P10: 200,268,376,295,367 (mean=301, std~68); continuing prior upward regime from P6 shift (avg 281 P6-P8), now sustained 5 periods at ~301 (+7%, volatile but consistent high). Pipeline: on-hand 641 (covers ~2 periods), in-transit 888 (likely P10 405 + delayed; older lost P1/3/4 total 483 confirmed absent through P10, not inflating actual arrivals). LT observed (6 concludes): 2,1,2,1,2,1 (recent_N=6 avg=1.5 vs promised 2); use recent_N=6 for L to reflect variability/shorter actuals. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=5 (regime length=5 since P6 changepoint, N=max(min(5,20),3)=5) to capture current high mean/volatility, ensuring base_stock ~301*(1+1.5)=753 + safety, covers (L+1)~2.5 periods demand post-decision while balancing profit/holding=1:1 (q=0.5). Addresses losses by shortening L, recent demand focus avoids overstocking on outdated low demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29): Late April swimwear bottoms; seasonal demand ramp-up into summer confirmed by surging sales (P11:477, P10:367, P9:295, P8:376). On-hand 164 low vs ~380 avg demand. In-transit 888 = 483 lost (P1:179 absent >9pd past exp P3; P3:62 >6pd past P5; P4:242 >6pd past P6) + 405 from P10 (exp P12 L=2). Nominal IP=1052 inflated by 483 lost \u2192 backend underorders perpetually. Observed LTs: last 6 arrivals (P2@4 L2, P5@6 L1, P6@8 L2, P7@8 L1, P8@10 L2, P9@10 L1) avg 1.5. Recent demand regime P8-P11 avg 379 (376,295,367,477; sustained high post prior 281 avg). Forecast per-pd 379 \xd7 (1+1.5)=947. Inflate mu_hat explicit by lost 483 \u21921430 targets nominal base_stock=1430, orders ~378 (actual effective target 1430-483=947 matching forecast over 2.5pd). Sigma recent_4 for cap ~ \u03bc\u0302/2.5 +1.645\xd7118/1.58 ~573+123=696 >order. L recent_6 informs cap realistically.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 (2019/4/8): avg increased from 281 (P6-P8) to 380 over P9-P11 (295,367,477; +35%, sustained 3 periods)

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6): Women's swimwear bottoms, early May entering peak summer season ahead of Memorial Day (5/27), sustaining high demand regime (P9-P12: 295,367,477,468; avg=401.75, std\u224886.9). On-hand=0, in-transit=1266 inflated by confirmed lost (P1=179, P3=62, P4=242; total\u2265483u) + potential P10=405u (absent P12 conclude, 1 period past exp P12 for LT=2). Observed LTs remain 1-2 (avg=1.5), but losses unreported create survivor bias & effective longer LT. To counter phantom pipeline & target base_stock covering ~4 periods high demand (1607), use explicit L=3 (buffers delays/losses), recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime length=4 since P9 shift, captures sustained 400+ mean/vol). Backend: mu_hat=(1+3)*401.75=1607, z=0 (p=h=1), order\u22481607-1266=341 (>0 despite inflation), capped ~545; rebuilds real inventory for service while minimizing hold cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13): Swimwear bottoms, mid-May approaching Memorial Day (P16 ~5/27), expect sustained high demand into summer peak. Recent demands P9-P13: 295,367,477,468,332 (avg 388, sustained high per carry-over shifts to ~380+). P13 dip to 332 but single period, no confirmed downshift. On-hand=0 (stockout P13), in-transit=1607 inflated by lost P1(179),P3(62),P4(242)=483u + delayed P10(405, exp P12 but absent P12-P13 concludes, now 2 periods past). Observed LTs avg 1.5 (mix 1-2), but losses/delays require buffer: explicit L=3 for effective LT+loss risk, increasing (1+L) factor. recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures current regime (mean~388, std~82; with L=3, mu_hat~1552, sigma_hat~sqrt(4)*82~164), raising base_stock to counter inflated pipeline, order proactively vs stockouts while cap limits overorder. z*=Phi^{-1}(1/(1+1))=0.0 wait no q=profit/(p+h)=0.5, z~0 but higher mu/sigma still boosts.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed delayed shipment P10 405u (exp arrive P12, absent P12-P13 concludes, 2 periods past); lost/delayed total inflating pipeline ~888u (P1 179+P3 62+P4 242+P10 405), sustained pattern

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20): Swimwear bottoms in late May, pre-Memorial Day (May 27, P16), seasonal demand drivers suggest sustained high ~420+ per period, potential spike ahead. On-hand=0 after P14 stockout (arr=378 from P12 L=2, demand=417). In-transit=1229 entirely ghost shipments inflating pipeline: confirmed lost P1=179 (exp P3 absent >12p), P3=62 (exp P5 >9p), P4=242 (exp P6 >8p), P10=405 (exp P12 absent P12-P14 3p); P13=341 (exp P15 pending, lost pattern). Recent demand P9-P14 avg=393 (295,367,477,468,332,417), P11-P14 avg=424; no new changepoint (stable high regime from P9 insight). Observed leads avg~1.57 (7 obs: four 2s, three 1s) but losses make effective longer. Since profit=holding=1, z=0, base_stock=\u03bc\u0302; inflated pipeline causes underordering. Compensate with explicit \u03bc\u0302=2600 \u22481229 ghosts + 3\xd7450 (1+default L=2 \xd7 uptrended forecast + buffer). Explicit \u03c3\u0302=500 (>>sqrt(3)\xd774\u2248128 recent vol) boosts cap\u22482600/3 + 1.645\xd7500/\u221a3 \u2248867+475=1342, allowing order\u22482600-1229=1371 capped@1342 to cover ~3 periods despite ghosts/loss risk.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment P10 405u (absent P12-P14 concludes, 3 periods past exp P12); lost pattern persists with P13 341u exp P15; total ghosts inflating pipeline 1229u (P1 179+P3 62+P4 242+P10 405+P13 341)

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27 Memorial Day): Swimwear bottoms, early summer peak likely with sustained high demand (recent P11-P15 avg 413, P9-P15 avg 389, prior regime 380). On-hand 0, IP 2571 inflated by confirmed ghosts 1229u (P1=179, P3=62, P4=242, P10=405, P13=341), real transit ~1342u (P15 order). Resolved loss rate 1229/3032=40.5%, survival r=59.5%; exp real arrive P17:1342*0.595\u2248797u. Target real IP for protection: ~3pd*430 (avg L~2, peak adj)=1290u. Required addl exp real: (1290-797)=493u, order Q=493/0.595\u2248828u. Set explicit mu_hat=2571+828=3399 to trigger order~828u despite ghosts. L 'calculate' uses avg observed LTs (7 obs: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2 avg1.57). Sigma recent_5 (P11-15 std~62) for vol/cap.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3): Swimwear bottoms in early June post-Memorial Day (P16 demand=525, +42% over recent avg), entering peak summer season with July 4 (~P21) likely spike; proactively buffer high demand forecast ~450-500/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=3399 inflated by sustained lost shipments ~1229u (P1=179, P3=62, P4=242, P10=405, P13=341 per carry-over), real pipeline ~2170u (P15=1342 + P16=828) covers ~4.3-5 periods at 450/demand. No new arrivals P16 confirm P13 lost (absent >2 past exp P15). Current demand regime (shift P9) sustained P9-P16: 8 periods avg=406 (std~79 sample), minor uptick P13-P16 avg=411 (+1%). Observed lead times 7x: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2 avg~1.57. To counter ghost bias (backend position inflated \u2192 under-orders), explicit mu_hat=4000 triggers order~601u (base=4000 >3399), yielding real position~2770u (~6 periods coverage @450 + loss buffer); cap ample ~1700u. L=calculate reflects actual avg lt<2. Sigma=recent_8 captures regime vol sqrt(1+L)~137. Balances service vs holding by inflating base_stock only enough for coverage despite losses.

Observed LTs (9 total, recent all): 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,1 (avg 1.56; 4x LT1,5x LT2; no shift). Use recent_9 for L (backend avg~1.56), mu_hat (backend (1+1.56)*398~958, covers horizon), sigma_hat (backend sqrt(1+1.56)*recent std~95, low z* needed as q=0.5).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/6/17): Peak summer season for swimwear (women's bikini bottoms), demand sustained in high regime since changepoint P9 (2019/4/8) with avg 388.3 over P9-P18 (10 periods: 295,367,477,468,332,417,370,525,330,302; confirmed by prior carry-over shifts upward to ~380). Recent P16-P18 (525,330,302) avg 386 consistent, no new shift. High on-hand 1538 covers ~4 periods demand; in-transit 1830 inflated by confirmed permanent ghosts 1229u (P1:179, P3:62, P4:242, P10:405, P13:341 absent 4+ periods past exp arrivals); real in-transit P17:601u only, real position 2139. No new overdues. L default (promised 2, consistent with recent mix LT=1-2 avg~1.6 but losses separate). mu_hat explicit 2394 = 3*388.3 +1229 ghosts (true LT+1 demand + ghosts adjustment to bridge gap, ensures base_stock = true_base + ghosts so OR orders when real_pos < true_base despite inflation). sigma_hat recent_N N=10 (~sqrt(3)*88\u2248152) for cap/volatility. With z=0 (q=0.5), base=mu_hat targets service vs holding; parameters prevent premature halt in ordering due to ghosts while avoiding excess given current coverage.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24): Peak summer for women's swimwear bottoms; recent demands P10-P19 avg 410.5 (spikes to 525,517); July 4th approaching (P21 ~7/1, P22 ~7/8), anticipate continued high/spiking demand ~450/period. On-hand 1021 sufficient short-term; in-transit 1830 = exact sum of known lost shipments (P1:179 + P3:62 + P4:242 + P10:405 + P13:341 + P17:601, all overdue multiple/single periods, no arrivals expected). Real pipeline ~0, position overstated by 1830 ghosts (permanent in-transit). z*=0 (p=h=1), base_stock=\u03bc\u0302; inflate \u03bc\u0302 = 3*450 (= real (1+promised L=2) demand target 1350) + 1830 ghosts =3180 to induce order=3180-2851~329 covering real needs despite fake pipeline. L/sigma default (L for cap permissive, sigma irrelevant for base but aids cap). Compensates lost pattern without overordering (cap non-binding).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1): Peak summer for swimwear (bikini bottoms), July 4th holiday weekend approaching, expect sustained high demand ~500-800/period based on recent escalation (P20:771 spike). On-hand 250 low vs recent demand (will stockout); in-transit 2159 heavily inflated by persistent ghosts (e.g., confirmed P13 341u lost, prior P1/P3/P4/P10 ~888u, plus P17 601u delayed 2+ periods past exp P19). Observed LTs avg~1.56 (9 samples: five 2s, four 1s), but losses make effective LT longer/unreliable. Changepoint: summer regime P16-P20 avg489 (+23% vs prior P12-P15 ~397). Set L explicit=3 to buffer delays/losses (bridges backend's ignorance of ghosts by inflating base_stock/pipeline target); mu_hat recent_N=5 captures summer mean~489*(1+3)=1956; sigma_hat recent_N=5 for high vol~188*sqrt(4)~376. Higher targets counter ghost inflation, trigger orders to cover (L+1)=4 periods demand, balance stockouts vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 (2019/5/27): summer peak avg 489 over P16-P20 (525,330,302,517,771; +23% vs prior P12-P15 avg 397, sustained 5 periods); Confirmed lost shipment P13 341u (absent P15-P20 concludes, 6 periods past exp P15)

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08): Peak summer season for swimwear (women's bikini bottoms), post-July 4th but demand remains high (P16-P21 avg 506, sd 174; recent P19-P21 avg 627). On-hand 0, in-transit 2159 = 1830 ghosts/overdue (P1:179, P3:62, P4:242, P10:405, P13:341, P17:601 all confirmed absent multiple periods past exp) + 329 reliable (P20 order, exp P22). Effective position ~329. No new arrivals in P21. L 'calculate' uses avg ~1.56 (9 observed: 4x LT1, 5x LT2). mu_hat explicit 3500 = ~ (1+2)*550 recent/seasonal forecast +1830 ghosts adjustment, yielding effective base ~3500-2159=1341 order (~2.5 periods demand), countering ghost-inflated pipeline subtraction. sigma_hat explicit 300 \u2248174*sqrt(3) ensures cap > order (cap ~3500/3 +0.95*300 ~1495). Maximizes service in peak while minimizing excess hold given q=0.5.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment P17 601u (exp P19, absent P19-P21 concludes, 3 periods past); total lost inflating pipeline 1830u (prior 1229 + P17 601)

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15): Mid-summer for women's swimwear bottoms; demand remains elevated in summer peak regime (carry-over P16 avg 489, sustained; recent P16-P22 avg 511, P20-P22 avg 635 post-July 4 peak). On-hand=0; in-transit=3171 inflated by ~1830 confirmed lost shipments (P1:179, P3:62, P4:242, P10:405, P13:341, P17:601; no new arrivals in P22 conclude beyond P20's 329). Real pipeline ~1341 (P22:1341 pending). Forecast weekly demand ~570 (blend recent: last7=511, last3=635). With L=2, protection period demand ~1710. To offset ghosts for backend (base_stock=mu_hat since z=0), explicit mu_hat=3600 (~1710 demand +1830 ghosts) targets order~3600-3171=429 to cover upcoming demand/service. L=default (promised 2, matches recent observed LTs ~1.6-2). Sigma=recent_N N=7 captures summer volatility (regime length~7 since P16 changepoint) for adequate cap (>expected order). No stockout buffer needed beyond this as profit=holding=1 balances via q=0.5.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand 831 covers ~1.6 periods at recent avg; in-transit 2259 heavily inflated by persistent lost shipments (~1830u ghosts per prior insights: P1=179,P3=62,P4=242,P10=405,P13=341,P17=601; no new arrivals contradict). Observed LTs (11 total: mostly 1-2; recent avg ~1.57). Chgpt at P16 sustained 8+ periods \u2192 N=8. Use L 'calculate' (backend avg observed ~1.55, reflects actual shorter LTs). mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=8 (captures high mean/vol; backend (1+L)*recent_mean offsets low default/ghost pipeline bias, raises base_stock for service despite inflated pipeline subtraction; higher sigma boosts safety stock vs holding cost).

On-hand 121 low vs ~625 demand; in-transit 2259 inflated by ~1830-2200 ghosts (carry-over lost total ~1830 + potential P23 429), effective real pipeline ~550. Pipeline ghosts cause underordering; compensate by explicit L=4 (effective longer LT from sustained losses/delays > promised 2, max observed delays 5+ periods past exp). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=5 captures high recent regime (N=5=regime length). Yields mu_hat=5*625=3125, sigma_hat=sqrt(5)*~110\u2248246; base_stock\u22483125 (z\u22480); order\u2248745 (min(3125-2380, cap\u2248625+180=805)). Effectively builds real inventory position toward ~2500 coverage over 5 periods while respecting cap.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19): Late summer for swimwear; demand sharply declined post-summer peak with new changepoint at P25 (avg 206 over P25-P27: 309,176,132 vs prior P20-P24 avg 625, -67% drop, sustained 3 periods). On-hand 866 covers 4+ periods at recent avg 206; in-transit 2826 inflated by sustained lost shipments (carry-over ghosts ~1830u+, pattern persists). Recent observed LTs (last 5: 2,3,1,2,2) avg 2.0 aligns with promised, no new LT shift. Use default L=2; recent_N N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low-demand regime (backend: mu~(1+2)*206=618, low base_stock << pipeline avoids overorder/holding costs despite ghosts; service maintained for low vol).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 (2019/7/29): avg decreased from 625 (P20-P24) to 206 over P25-P27 (-67%, sustained 3 periods)

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26): Late summer for swimwear bottoms; post-peak demand decline sustained, avg 193 over P25-P28 (309,176,132,155; regime shift at P25 confirmed, now 4 periods). High on-hand 711 covers ~4 periods at current rates; in-transit 2826 inflated by prior lost shipments ~1830u + P26 order 996u overdue 1 period (exp P28 LT2, absent P28 conclude). No new sustained losses (1 period <3). L 'calculate' uses avg of 13 observed LTs (6x1, 7x2, 1x3 \u2192 ~1.77) reflecting variable delays without overestimation. mu_hat 'recent_N' N=4 captures low-demand regime (backend: ~2.77*193=534). sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=4 low vol ~69 \u2192 sqrt(2.77)*69~115. Low base_stock=534 (z=0) << net inv 3537 triggers order~0, minimizing holding on excess/ghosts while covering low demand + LT variability.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2 Labor Day): Swimwear demand in steep post-summer decline, sustained low regime P25-P29 demands [309,176,132,155,139] avg 182 (down ~67% from summer peaks ~625 per carry-over). Labor Day may prompt minor final spike but trend evidences continued drop (P27-P29 avg 142). On-hand 572 covers ~4 periods at recent mean; in-transit 2826 heavily inflated by persistent lost shipments (carry-over total ~1830u+ ghosts like P17 601u, P26 996u delayed past exp P28). Observed LTs recent (last 6: 2,3,1,2,2,1 avg~1.8) stable around promised 2, no new shift. Use default L (promised 2, backend scales correctly). recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=5 since P25 drop, N=max(min(5,20),3)=5) adapts forecast to low demand: mu~(1+2)*182=546, sigma~sqrt(3)*73~126 (low vol). Lowers base_stock vs all-data (higher summer mean), ensures OR caps orders low despite ghost pipeline (subtracts inflated 2826\u2192order~0), balances low service need vs holding cost on 572 OH.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 (2019/8/12): avg decreased from 206 (P25-P27) to 142 over P27-P29 (132,155,139; -31%, sustained 3 periods); Confirmed delayed P26 996u (exp P28, absent P28-P29 concludes, 2 periods past, adds to lost pattern)

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9): Post-summer slump for swimwear (women's bikini bottoms), demand sharply dropping - P30=78 continues low regime from P25 changepoint (309 to 78), avg P25-P30=165 (sustained 6 periods, -67% from prior summer peak). On-hand 494 covers ~3 periods at recent rates; in-transit 2826 inflated by persistent ghosts (e.g., prior ~1830u + P26 996u now 3 periods past exp P28, absent P28-P30). No new arrivals P30. L recent_4 observed LTs (latest: P25@2, P23@3, P22@1, P20@2; avg=2, no shift). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_6 reflects low-demand regime (chagepoint P25, N=6>=3 sustained). Low mu_hat~(1+2)*165=495 << position~3320 targets minimal base_stock, ensuring OR orders ~0 to minimize holding on ample effective inventory despite ghosts, balancing service (low risk stockout) vs. cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16): Swimwear bottoms, late September post-Labor Day (P30 2019/9/2), end-of-season demand crash confirmed in recent data\u2014P30:78, P31:65 (avg 71.5, -50% vs P27-P29 avg 142). Forecast mu_d~80/period. On-hand 429 covers ~5-6 periods; in-transit 2826=ALL ghosts (matches carry-over total: prior ~1830 + P26 996 lost, absent P28-P31 4+ periods past exp P28; no recent real orders P27-P31=0). Effective position~429 (real pipeline=0). To bridge ghost inflation for backend (base_stock = mu_hat since z=0), set explicit mu_hat=3100 = ghosts 2826 + real target 274=(1+2)*137 (conservative recent_5 mean 114 scaled up slightly for buffer). L default (promised 2, recent avg LT=2 over last 5 observed). Sigma recent_5 captures low recent vol ~36. Ensures backend orders ~3100-3255= -ve now (0 order), but builds real pipeline for future as on-hand depletes; cap ample ~3100/3=1033. Addresses lost pattern by inflating nominal base_stock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Late September, post-swim season for women's swimwear bottoms; demand collapsed to avg 58 (P30-32:78,65,30; -59% from prior 142 avg P27-29), sustained 3 periods, trending near-zero. On-hand 399 (covers ~13 periods at 30/wk), in-transit 2826 entirely ghost inventory per carry-over lost shipments totaling exactly 2826u (P1=179+P3=62+P4=242+P10=405+P13=341+P17=601+P26=996), no real pipeline, no recent arrivals (P28-32). Position effectively 399 only. Remaining ~15 periods demand est. 40/wk avg (~600 total) + safety. To bridge lost shipment gap (backend unaware, sees inflated pipeline), set explicit L=11; default mu_hat=(1+11)*all-time mean(~323)=~3876 >3225 reported position, induces order ~650 to target effective position ~3900 for coverage. z=0 (q=0.5) so sigma irrelevant. Prevents stockout while limiting overstock given low demand/season end. No new LT observes (no arrivals).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30 (2019/9/2): avg decreased from 142 (P27-P29) to 58 over P30-P32 (78,65,30; -59%, sustained 3 periods); Confirmed lost shipment P26 996u (absent P28-P32 concludes, 5 periods past exp P28); total confirmed lost 2826u (all in-transit ghosts: P1 179+P3 62+P4 242+P10 405+P13 341+P17 601+P26 996)

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=364 covers multiple low-demand periods (holding cost risk high). In-transit=3051 inflated by confirmed lost shipments totaling 2826u (P1=179,P3=62,P4=242,P10=405,P13=341,P17=601,P26=996); actual pipeline ~225u low (e.g., recent P33 order=225 exp P35). No new arrivals in P33. L=default (promised 2; recent observed LT~2, no sustained shift despite lost pattern). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 (changeloint P30, N=max(min(4,20),3)=4; adapts to low regime, (1+2)*52=156 mean covers review+lead demand conservatively low). Low parameters yield low base_stock; high ghost pipeline + on-hand >> base_stock ensures order~0, avoids adding inventory in low-demand slump, prioritizes minimizing holding costs (Profit=Holding=1).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=302 covers ~6 periods at current rate; in-transit=3051 inflated by ~2826u confirmed lost ghosts (per carry-over), real pipeline minimal (~225 from P33 order). Position ~3353 >> low demand forecast. High holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit $1; default L=2 (recent observed ~2, losses already inflating pipeline). recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat yields mu_hat=3*54=162, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*20.6~36; base_stock low << position triggers order~0, avoids adding to holding costs while ghosts mislead backend on pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14): Off-season for swimwear (post-summer, no major events boosting demand). Demand sustained low since changepoint P30 (avg 58 P30-P32, now avg 51 over P30-P35: 78,65,30,35,62,38; continued decline confirmed by low P33-P35:35,62,38 avg45). On-hand 264 covers ~5 periods at 50/demand; in-transit 3051 inflated by confirmed ghosts ~2826u (carry-over), total pipeline 3315 >> needs. Observed LTs avg ~1.62 (13 arrivals: 4x1,7x2,1x3,1x3), close to promised 2 despite losses/delays (e.g., no new arrivals P33-P35). Use recent_6 (regime length=6, P30-P35) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to set low mu_hat~(1+2)*51=153, base_stock=153 (z=0 since q=0.5), ensuring order=0 vs huge pipeline, minimizes holding while covering low demand; L default aligns with observed avg.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand 446 sufficient for ~9 periods at current rate; in-transit 2826 confirmed ghosts (no new arrivals expected). Recent LT observations: P36 LT3 (P33), P27 LT2 (P25), P26 LT3 (P23), P23 LT1 (P22), P22 LT2 (P20); avg 2.2. No new overdue shipments beyond known losses. Parameters use recent_7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low-demand regime (N=7=max(min(7,20),3)); recent_5 for L to reflect recent LT avg>promised 2. This lowers base_stock to minimize overstock/holding costs given ghosts inflating pipeline and ample on-hand, while covering low demand over extended LT.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Late October, off-season for swimwear (post-summer, pre-holidays irrelevant to product); demand remains very low ~45 avg (P30-P37: 78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50; std~18), continuing P30 shift to low regime (sustained 8 periods, no new changepoint). On-hand 396 covers ~9 periods of demand (396/45), only 9 periods left to 47; in-transit 2826 all confirmed lost ghosts (no arrivals expected). Recent LTs: last 5 observed (P33 LT3, P25 LT2, P23 LT3, P22 LT1, P20 LT2; avg 2.2). Use recent_8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect low current regime (backend scales last 8 demands by 1+L); recent_5 for L to capture recent LT drift toward 2-3. High pipeline ghosts ensure order~0 (ideal: avoid adding ghosts, minimize holding on excess 396 vs low demand). q=0.5 implies conservative base stock matching low mu_hat.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4): Off-season for swimwear (women's bikini bottoms); sustained low demand regime since Period 30 changepoint (carry-over: avg 58 P30-P32, extended to P30-P38 avg 48.6 over 9 periods:78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36; no new shift, stable ~30-78). On-hand 360 sufficient for ~7 periods at 50/demand; in-transit 2826 confirmed lost ghosts (no new losses/overdues as no orders since P33). Recent LTs variable (last 5 observed: P36 LT3, P27 LT2, P26 LT3, P23 LT1, P22 LT2; avg 2.2). Parameters: L recent_5 captures recent avg LT~2.2 vs promised 2; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_9 uses low-demand regime (N=9=regime length) for low base_stock~146 (3*49), low cap~50; ensures OR orders ~0 despite inflated pipeline (base_stock <<3186), minimizing new lost orders/holding while covering low future demand (profit=holding=1, z=0).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11): Winter off-season for swimwear (bikini bottoms), no holiday demand drivers (Thanksgiving Nov 28 unlikely for swimwear). Recent demand P30-P39 (10 periods post-P30 regime shift): avg 47.1, std 16.1, stable low sustained. On-hand 326 covers ~8 remaining periods (40/47) at 47/unit (total exp ~376, buffer ok w/ low var). In-transit 2826 = confirmed lost ghosts (P1:179, P3:62, P4:242, P10:405, P13:341, P17:601, P26:996; no new delays). No real pipeline. Compensate ghosts for OR backend: true_mu_hat=(1+2)*47.1=141.3; explicit mu_hat=141.3+2826=2967.3 so order=true_base - true_IP (326). z*=0 (p=h=1), sigma irrelevant for base_stock but recent_N for cap. L default (promised 2, obs avg~1.8). Ensures responsive ordering if demand rises/stock depletes, balances low holding vs service.

Carry-over insight: Low demand winter regime stabilized: avg 47.1 (std 16.1) over P30-P39 (10 periods, -67% vs summer peaks); sustained pattern

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18): Mid-November winter, swimwear demand remains in stabilized low regime (avg 46.6 over P30-P40 11 periods: 78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42; std~16, consistent with carry-over P30-P39 avg47.1 std16.1, -67% vs summer). No upcoming holidays boost swimwear (Thanksgiving/Black Friday irrelevant). On-hand 284 covers ~6 periods demand (~47/wk), pipeline 2826 entirely ghosts (confirmed lost total 2826u, no arrivals since P36). No overdue new shipments (none expected P40/P41). Regime sustained >11 periods post-P30 changepoint, no new shifts. L default (promised 2; observed avg~1.8, recent incl 3s but stable). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_11 reflects low winter demand precisely for low base_stock~(1+2)*47 + z*sqrt(3)*16 ~140 + ~15 (q=0.5 z~0)=155 << pipeline 2826, ensuring order~0 to minimize holding costs on excess on-hand while short-term covered; compensates OR ignorance of ghosts by low mu/sigma (avoids overordering if partial arrivals).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25): Late November, approaching Thanksgiving (Nov 28) and winter holidays; swimwear demand remains very low (winter off-season), no seasonal spike expected. Recent demands P30-P41 (12 periods): 78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50,36,34,42,17; avg=44.2, std\u224818.1, confirming sustained low winter regime (carry-over P40: avg47.1/std16.1 P30-P39). On-hand=267 covers multiple low-demand periods (~40/wk); in-transit=2826 entirely ghosts (confirmed lost total 2826u, no arrivals P37-P41). No new orders/overdues. Recent LTs (last 5 observed arrivals: P36 LT3(P33), P27 LT2(P25), P26 LT3(P23), P23 LT1(P22), P22 LT2(P20); avg=2.2). Use recent_N=12 for mu/sigma to anchor low regime (mu_hat\u2248(1+~2.2)*44.2\u2248150, sigma_hat\u2248sqrt(3.2)*18\u224832); recent_N=5 for L to reflect recent delays. Ensures conservative base_stock (~150) << pipeline (3093), yielding order=0 to avoid overstock/holding costs amid ghosts and low demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2): Winter off-season for swimwear bottoms, post-Thanksgiving low demand expected (no holiday relevance). Low winter regime stabilized (carry-over P30-P39 avg 47.1 std 16.1, extended to P30-P42 avg ~50 despite P42=113 anomaly - single period Black Friday outlier, not sustained 3+). On-hand 154 covers multiple low-demand periods; in-transit 2826 mostly ghosts (carry-over total 2826u lost confirmed). No new arrivals (P42 conclude arrived=0). Observed LTs recent: last 5 (P36 LT3, P27 LT2, P26 LT3, P23 LT1, P22 LT2; avg 2.2). Changepoint evidence: sustained low since P30 (13 periods). Set L recent_5 to capture recent delays/loss pattern (vs default 2); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_13 (regime_length=13, P30-P42) for low mu~50-60 x(1+L)~3*150-180, low sigma~20*sqrt(3)~35; low base_stock ensures OR orders ~0 (base - inflated pipeline 2980 >> base), balances low service need vs holding cost, ignores ghosts by low forecast.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9): Winter low-demand regime for swimwear continues (stable avg ~47-55 over P30-P43, std~30; P42=113 likely Black Friday outlier, P43=51 normalizes). On-hand=103 covers ~2 periods at 50/period; in-transit=2826 all confirmed ghosts/lost per carry-over (no arrivals since P36, pattern persists). Pipeline massively inflated, backend will order 0 unless mu_hat > ~2929. Set explicit mu_hat=3130 (~2929 pipeline + 200 buffer for remaining 4 periods * ~50 demand) to enable order-up ~200 despite ghosts, covering future while minimizing excess holding (q=0.5 targets 50% service). L default (promised 2, observed avg~1.8 but losses extend effective). Sigma default (full history high var ensures ample cap>200). No new changepoint (low demand sustained 14+ periods).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16): Winter low-demand regime for swimwear (beachwear bottoms) persists into Christmas season; unlikely demand spike as product mismatches holiday gifting/shopping. Recent P35-P44 demands avg 48.1 (std ~26), consistent with stabilized winter avg 47.1 (P30-P39). No sustained changepoint (P42=113 outlier, ~4SD). Real position ~247 (on-hand 46 + recent P44 order 201), exceeds desired base ~144 ((1+2)*48), so optimal order ~0 despite lost ghosts ~2826 inflating in-transit to 3027/full position 3073. Use recent_10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low regime vs overall higher historical mean; default L=2 as observed avg ~2. Ensures backend low base_stock yielding order=0, minimizing holding on adequate real coverage while bridging ghost gap implicitly.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23, Christmas week): Swimwear demand expected very low (near zero seasonally irrelevant), confirmed winter low regime extended P30-P45 (16 periods, avg ~50.6, consistent with P40 carry-over avg 47.1 P30-P39). Recent demands P40-P45 avg 56.3 (std ~28, includes outlier P42=113 Thanksgiving?). Pipeline 3027 = confirmed lost ghosts 2826u + recent P44 201u (exp P46); no arrivals since P36 (10 periods), lost/delayed pattern persists. On-hand 0, recent demand ~50-60 causing stockouts. Use recent_N N=16 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained low regime (changeloint P30 confirmed sustained 16p >3), scaling to (1+L=2 promised) covers ~151 low demand over 3p (base_stock ~151 <<3027 pipeline \u2192 order=0). Default L (promised 2) as recent observed avg ~1.8-2.25, close enough; avoids inflating for ghosts (order=0 accepts ~50 lost sales/period, better than adding new ghosts). Balances low service/holding given unreliable supply.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): End-of-year winter period for swimwear bottoms; demand low post-Christmas/New Year's (minimal seasonal relevance). Low winter regime stabilized (carry-over P30-P39 avg 47.1 std 16.1, extended to P46). Recent demands P43-P46: 51,57,58,57 (avg 55.75); P42:113 (Thanksgiving outlier). On-hand=0; in-transit=3027 (inflated by confirmed lost shipments ~2826u + overdue P44 201u absent P46 conclude). No arrivals since P36. Reconcile: ghosts mean actual pipeline low, risk stockouts. L recent_5 observed LT (3,2,3,1,2 avg~2.2) accounts sustained delays/losses vs promised 2. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_10 (P37-P46 demands avg~51.5 std~25) focuses low regime (changeloint P30, regime_length=17>10, N=10<20 cap). Ensures base_stock=mu_hat~(1+2.2)*51.5~165 >0 but order=cap~51.5 +1.645*25/sqrt(3.2)~51.5+23~75, covering 1-2 periods low demand despite ghost pipeline; balances sales vs holding.
