No prolonged absences past expected windows. Inventory & pipeline: OH=441 (post-P45), in-transit=592 (total pipeline covers ~14 periods at recent avg 70 demand), recent coverage strong (P45 sold 75 from 516 start). Demand analysis: Date 2019-12-23 (Christmas week shopping peak), ladies push-up denim jeggings likely see holiday outfit demand spike; historical fall/winter high sustained P33-P42 avg~140 (9 periods >=94, peaks 227/183), but post-Thanksgiving P43-P45 avg 60 (35+69+75, -57% drop, 3 periods sustained moderating trend despite seasonal expectation). Recent P44-P45=72 rising slightly, potential Christmas acceleration to 100-150+, but high inv buffers spikes (441 OH covers 3-5 high-demand periods alone). OR rec=0 based on promised LT=2 and full-history mean (diluted by summer lows), ignores recent highs/losses but correctly flags overstock vs base-stock. Strategy: Follow OR=0; no order needed as pipeline vastly exceeds 3-period (L+1) forecast (3x~120=360 <1033 total inv), avoids holding costs given q=0.5 balance; monitor P46 demand for confirmation of holiday spike.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent arrivals confirm variable LT 1-3 periods (e.g., P43 order arrived P45 LT=2, P42 LT=3); no new lost shipments as P46 conclude shows arrived=0 but recent orders P44-P46 were all 0 units, matching expectations; prior losses (e.g., P34) are historical, no emerging pattern in latest periods. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=410 (covers ~13 periods at recent avg 31), in-transit=592 (likely from earlier high orders, sufficient for 20+ periods); total pipeline >1000 units vs recent demand ~50 avg, no stockout risk for many periods. Demand analysis: Post-Thanksgiving/Christmas moderation sustained (P43-P46 avg 52.5, down -62% from P33-P42 high 136 avg); P46=31 confirms holiday slump extension into late Dec; product (denim jeggings) sees post-holiday demand drop as shopping season ends/New Year's approaches, no back-to-school/fall peak continuation; historical initial samples (39-73) irrelevant now. OR recommendation: 0 units, aligned with high inventory and uses promised LT=2/historical demand but underestimates recent moderation\u2014fully agree, no override needed as excess stock risks high holding costs ($1/unit/period).
