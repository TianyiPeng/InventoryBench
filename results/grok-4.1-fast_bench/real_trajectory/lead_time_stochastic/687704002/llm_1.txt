Lost pattern sustained (P1/P3/P4 =1300 units multi-period overdue >>2); P10 order (200) pending (exp arrive P11-12 if LT=1-2, but lost risk high).

(e) Order logic: Ample on-hand avoids stockout risk (no OOS since P4); modest order 100 rebuilds uncertain pipeline, balances holding cost ($1/period on excess) vs profit ($19/unit), covers ~3 periods ahead (L+1 w/ variable LT) at low demand forecast.",

High on-hand risks holding costs ($1/unit/period) if demand stays low.

Date 2019-12-02 (Mon): Cyber Monday, start of Christmas shopping peak (Dec 25 ~3 weeks away); expect strong demand surge for gifts/fashion (post-BF Nov29 spike in P42=119). (b) Demand regime: Pre-holiday lull P38-P41 avg~53 confirmed; sharp rebound P42=119 (+124% vs P41=53), sequential +70% vs P40-P41 avg51; early holiday acceleration signal (BF/CM/Christmas build), forecast P43 ~120-150 rising to 150-200/period into Dec peak (historical Jan-Feb highs 100-277 context). Recent 3-period avg 74, but trend up. (c) LT: Variable 1-3 sustained (recent: P39 LT2, P36 LT3, P35 LT1, P37 LT1); promised 2 unreliable. Lost pattern chronic (>2250 units pending, 11+ shipments multi-period overdue); no new confirms (P42 order=250 too recent for LT=1-3 arr in P42/P43). Ignore in-transit arrivals. (d) Inv/pipeline: On-hand 344 entering P43 (post P42 end=344, demand=119); covers ~2-3 periods at 120-150 forecast. Pipeline 2250 unreliable (lost pattern); no expected near-term arrivals (recent orders LT1-3 would show by now if arriving). High holding risk but sales profit $19>>$1/period. (e) Order 250: Match P42 order size for holiday surge coverage (344 covers P43-P44 @120-150, +250 arrives ~P45-46 LT2 avg for P46-P47 peaks); balances sales max vs hold min (4 periods left); conservative vs higher peak risk.",
