{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LT=3 sustained (e.g., P40->P43 LT3, P42->P45 LT3, P36->P39 LT3); promised=2 but actual variability 2-3 with losses; no new concludes in P46 to update. Inventory analysis: On-hand=358 (high from P45 arrivals:150+200=350 net), in-transit=1017 (includes cumulative ~1,067 lost/ghost per carry-over, real pipeline likely much lower but still ample); total position covers 20+ periods at ~50/period demand. Demand analysis: Post-holiday stable low regime P43-P46: 39,38,51,64 (avg 48, slight uptick P46 but within volatility, no sustained surge); aligns with carry-over post-Christmas drop after Thanksgiving P42=119; date 2019/12/30 end-of-year no major denim event expected (post-Christmas sales possible but historical low confirmed). Product: Ladies skinny ankle denim jeans - winter low season post-holidays. OR recommendation: 0 units (appropriate given high pipeline/OH vs low mu_hat from history). Strategy: No order needed - OH+expected near-term arrivals cover 1+LT=4 periods demand (~200) multiple times over; avoid adding to holding costs/loss risk. Follow OR unchanged.",
