Historical low winter demand shifted to sustained summer/BTS high since P21 (July), accelerating late BTS (Aug-Sept). P33 demand=704 record aligns with BTS climax/promo. Expect continued high or slight post-peak in early fall jeans demand. (b) Demand regime: Peak BTS sustained/accelerating P26-P33 avg~310 (184-704), last 3p (P31-P33) avg 408 (+56% vs P28-P30 avg262), upward trend (240\u2192279\u2192704) confirms new ultra-high regime vs prior summer highs; forecast P34 ~350-450 accounting for potential softening but BTS momentum. (c) Lead time/missing: Recent LT=1-3 (e.g. P30 LT2/P32, P31 LT1/P32, P27 LT3/P30); no new LT confirm P33 (arr=0). Lost pattern persists: P29 (350u placed P29) no arr by P33 (overdue 4p past LT=2, 1p past max obs LT=3 \u2192 LT>=5, confirmed lost); aligns w/ history (P23/24/26 lost). P32 (300u) pending (exp LT2 arr P34). (d) Inv/pipeline: On-hand=0 (post P33 stockout, lost sales on 704-371=333u @ $4=$1332 opp cost). In-transit=2940 (~8-10p at 350/d forecast, massive buffer but LT var/loss risk erodes). Near-term arr likely P34 (e.g. P32 LT2=300u possible); total pipeline covers ~10p but history shows 20%+ loss rate. (e) Order logic: Large pipeline mitigates but recent stockouts (P33 huge loss, prior P24-25/27-29) + LT/loss risk + new ultra-high regime require proactive order. Target 350u to match recent avg demand/LT coverage (arr ~P36), replenish eroded pipeline, balance $4 profit vs $1 hold (net positive hold 3p+), ensure service level >95% w/ safety for var/spike; conservative vs 704 outlier but covers sustained 400+ trend.",
