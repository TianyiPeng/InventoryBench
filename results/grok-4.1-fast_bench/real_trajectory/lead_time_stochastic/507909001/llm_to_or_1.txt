Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11), first decision with no prior orders or conclude messages. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demands: [80,144,194,176,129], mean~144.6, recent decline from peak 194 to 129. Mid-February, near Valentine's Day (Feb 14), but no strong evidence of spike in women's blouses yet. No lead time observations. Use defaults: backend applies L=2 (promised), mu_hat=(1+2)*mean(all)=~433.8, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*std(all)~sqrt(3)*42.5~73.6. Ensures base stock covers expected demand over review+lead with safety stock q=4/(4+1)=0.8. No overdue shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18), post-Valentine's Day (Feb 14 during Period 1 week). Women's blouse demand spiked in Period 1 to 250 vs historical avg 144.6 (samples: 80,144,194,176,129; std ~37). Likely one-off seasonal spike; expect normalization but hedge higher. On-hand=0, in-transit=218 (Period 1 order, expected arrive Period 3 arrival phase, visible Period 3 conclude; no overdue as first order). No concluded arrivals yet (normal for L=2). Explicit mu_hat=592 ((1+2)*avg(hist mean 144.6 + P1 250)/2=197.3*3) to uplift base_stock for higher recent demand regime, covering ~3 periods ~600 total despite backend's historical samples bias low. L default (promised 2, no observations). Sigma default (sqrt(3)*hist std ~64) as no volatility shift evidence. Addresses potential lead drift/lost by conservative mean uplift; high q=4/(4+1)=0.8 prioritizes service to max profit from sales over holding.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25), women's blouse/shirt. Late February, no major holidays but possible late-winter fashion demand uptick. Historical demands (5 samples up to 2019-02-04): avg ~145, std ~44. Game demands: P1 (2019/2/11):250 (+73% vs hist avg), P2 (2019/2/18):454 (+81% vs P1). Clear demand regime shift upward at P1 start, regime length=2 (chngpt evidence: consecutive jumps >70%). No concluded arrivals yet (P1 conclude arrived=0 normal for LT>=1; first possible arrival during P3 from P1 order). In-transit=512 (P1:218+P2:294), on-hand=0. No overdue shipments. Use L default (promised 2, no obs data). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=2 (N=2 as regime_length=2<3, capped by recent game samples; backend computes (1+2)*mean([250,454])=1056 mu, sqrt(3)*std([250,454])~250 sigma vs default ~434/76). Raises base stock/target to match surge (q=4/5=0.8 implies high z*, covers ~3pd demand ~1056 w/ buffer), prevents stockouts vs default underestimate; holding cost controlled by capped policy.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, women's gently tailored shirts; possible spring seasonal demand buildup. Historical demands (5 samples up to 2019-02-04): mean ~145. Actual demands: P1:250, P2:454, P3:312 (mean ~339, +134% shift, sustained over 3 periods confirming changepoint at P1). On-hand=0, in-transit=1102 (P1:218 + P2:294 + P3:590). No arrivals yet; P1 order overdue (promised L=2, expected arrive during P3 but arrived=0 in P3 conclude). Use default L (no observed lead times yet to average). mu_hat recent_3 and sigma_hat recent_3 to reflect high-demand regime over last 3 periods (backend scales by sqrt(1+L)); this boosts base_stock to cover ~3 periods of elevated demand (~1000+ units) while z* balances profit=4 vs holding=1 (q=0.8), addressing stockouts and potential delays/losses without overordering given pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: avg increased from historical 145 to recent 339 (+134%) sustained over 3 periods; P1 order overdue (expected Period 3 arrival but arrived=0)

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11), women's gently tailored shirt; early March, post-Valentine demand possibly lingering but no major upcoming events; recent demand regime shift sustained (P1-4: 250,454,312,214; avg 307.5 vs hist ~145, +113%); on-hand 80 low vs ~300 demand; pipeline 875 = P1:218 (overdue/possibly lost, expected P3 arrival not in P3/P4 concludes), P3:590 (expected P5), P4:67 (P6). One confirmed LT=2 (P2 order). Use default L=2 (promised, matches sole observation). recent_4 for mu/sigma to capture high mean/volatility regime (std~103); yields mu_hat~(1+2)*307.5=923, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*103~178; high base stock (~923 + 0.84*178 ~1072) minus pipeline~955 triggers modest order to buffer service (q=0.8) vs holding, compensating potential P1 loss by proactive stocking.

Carry-over insight: P1 order lost: overdue by 2 periods past expected P3 arrival (no conclude in P3 or P4); demand regime shift sustained over 4 periods: avg 308 (+113% vs hist 145)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18), spring season approaching for women's blouses (stretch cotton shirt), no immediate holidays but sustained high demand regime since P1 confirmed over 5 periods (demands:250,454,312,214,190; avg=284, +96% vs historical ~145). Pipeline reconciliation: in-transit=997 includes P1:218 (lost, overdue >3 periods past expected P3), P3:590 (overdue 1 period past expected P5, P5 arrived=0), P4:67 (expected P6), P5:122 (expected P7); effective reliable pipeline ~779, on-hand=0 risks stockout. Only 1 observed LT=2 (P2 order). Changepoint evidence: demand shift at P1 sustained 5 periods. Chosen: L default (promised 2, matches sole observation); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=5 (regime_length=5, max(min(5,20),3)=5) to capture elevated mean/variance, inflating base_stock > pipeline despite backend's unawareness of losses, boosting orders to cover ~3*284=852 demand while z*=0.84 limits overstock for profit/holding=4/5.

Carry-over insight: P3 order overdue by 1 period past expected P5 arrival (P5 conclude arrived=0); demand regime shift sustained over 5 periods: avg 284 (+96% vs hist 145)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Late March, spring season for women's blouses; no major holidays imminent (Easter April 21). Recent demand sustained high regime: P1-P6 demands [250,454,312,214,190,173], avg 265.5 (+83% vs hist mean 145), vol high std~98 vs hist~40; regime length 6 periods confirmed by carry-over. On-hand=0; in-transit=884 includes lost/overdue: P1=218 (lost), P3=590 (overdue past P5), P4=67 (overdue past P6), P6=9 (pending). Observed LTs only from concludes: P2\u2192P4 LT=2; P5\u2192P6 LT=1. Use recent_N N=2 for L (avg last 2 observed LTs=1.5) to adapt to recent faster LT but buffer losses with high mu/sigma. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_6 to capture sustained high demand/vol regime, ensuring base_stock covers (1+L)~2.5 periods demand ~665 despite unreliable pipeline; helps OR balance high service (q~0.8 profit/(profit+holding)) vs holding by elevating parameters for losses/delays.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern sustained: P1(218), P3(590), P4(67) overdue/lost (total 875 units, no arrives despite 2+ periods past expected); LT variability confirmed (recent LT=1 vs prior 2)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/04/01), early spring approaching Easter (04/21) which may boost women's blouse demand. High demand regime sustained P1-P7: demands [250,454,312,214,190,173,255] avg~264 (+82% vs hist mean145), changepoint at P1 confirmed by 7-period elevation. Pipeline in-transit=950 overstated by likely lost shipments P1(218 overdue 5p), P3(590 ov3p), P4(67 ov2p) total~875 (per carry-over), effective pipeline~75 (P6:9 + P7:66 pending). On-hand=0, repeated stockouts (P7 sold=0). No arrivals P7. To compensate lost/inflated pipeline & variability (observed LTs:2,1), use explicit L=3 to inflate base_stock coverage to 4 periods (countering unreliable arrivals). recent_N N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to match sustained high mean/volatility regime (N=7=max(min(regime_len=7,20),3)). This elevates base_stock ~mu*4 + z*sigma*2 (high q=0.8 favors service), driving orders despite bloated pipeline, balancing stockouts vs holding.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), spring apparel season for women's blouses; Easter ~4/21 (Periods 10-11) may drive upcoming demand spike. Demand regime shift sustained over 8 periods: game avg 275 (+90% vs hist 145), recent P7-P8 255/354 high. Lost shipments sustained (P1:218 overdue 6+ per, P3:590 overdue 4+, P4:67 overdue 3+; total 875 stuck in pipeline 1143, overstates availability). Observed LTs variable (last 4: 2,1,2,1 avg 1.5). On-hand 0 risks stockout. Set L explicit=3 to extend coverage for delays/losses (effective LT longer). mu_hat/sigma_hat default uses all 8 samples (mean~275, std~94): mu_hat~(1+3)*275=1100, sigma_hat~sqrt(4)*94=188, z~0.84 (q=0.8), base_stock~1100+158=1258 >1143 pipeline \u2192 orders ~115 (under cap~352), replenishes despite overstated pipeline while balancing holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=1143 but P1(218),P3(590),P4(67) lost/overdue (total 875, no arrives 4+ periods past expected), effective pipeline ~268 from P8. Stockouts persistent (P9 demand=147 unsold). Demand regime high sustained P1-9: mean=261 (+80% vs hist 145), std~98 (vs hist ~42); P9=147 dip but single period, no sustained changepoint. Observed LTs: 2(P2->P4),1(P5->P6),2(P6->P8),1(P7->P8) avg=1.5/mixed, but losses indicate unreliability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter (4/21/19), women's spring blouse; demand volatile but high regime sustained since P1 (P1-P10 avg 257 vs hist 145, +78%, confirmed over 10 periods). On-hand 50, in-transit 941 (875 lost P1=218/P3=590/P4=67 overdue >4-7 periods + P10=66 pending); effective reliable pipeline ~116 low vs ~3 periods demand (~750), but backend subtracts full inflated pipeline. Observed LTs for arrived: 2,1,2,1,2 (avg 1.6, recent variability sustained); explicit L=3 compensates losses/unreliability for longer buffer (effective LT longer due to ~38% loss rate on early orders). mu_hat recent_N N=10 captures regime shift (avg 257, L=3 \u2192 ~1027); sigma_hat recent_N N=10 (high vol std~90 \u2192 \u03c3\u0302~180). Yields base_stock ~1027 + 0.84*180 \u22481178 >991 pipeline, order ~187 (under cap~405), rebuilds stock to cover demand/service while minimizing excess holding on reliable inv.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29, late April post-Easter). Recent demand P9-P11: 147,218,140 avg 168 (-32% vs game avg 246), potential downward regime shift sustained 3 periods, aligning closer to hist mean 145; possible seasonal post-Easter drop for women's blouses. Confirmed lost shipments P1(218), P3(590), P4(67) total 875 units (no arrival despite >>2 periods overdue), inflating in-transit 1134 (effective pipeline ~259 from P10:66 + P11:193). Backend unaware of losses, subtracts full 1134 \u2192 underorders. Compensate by explicit mu_hat=1600, sigma_hat=350 yielding base_stock \u22481600 + 0.84*350 \u22481894 (>1134, order ~760); targets inflated forecast 3*220=660 + ghost 875 + safety ~200. L default (promised 2). Observed LTs (5): 2,1,2,1,2 avg 1.6, variable but no new shift. Ensures higher service vs holding despite ghosts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward starting Period 9: avg P9-P11 168 (-32% vs prior game avg 246), sustained over 3 periods with post-Easter timing; lost shipment pattern sustained: P1(218), P3(590), P4(67) total 875 units overdue >6 periods

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6 early May, post-Easter ~April 21, approaching Mother's Day May 12 but no demand uptick evidence yet; women's blouse). Downward demand regime shift starting P9 sustained over 4 periods (P9-P12 demands 147,218,140,148 avg 163, -34% vs prior game avg ~246, aligns with post-Easter apparel slowdown). Pipeline bloated at 1895 (includes confirmed lost P1/3/4=875 + P10=66 overdue past expected P12 + P11=193/P12=761 expected soon); on-hand=0. LT observations (5 total from concludes): P2o LT2, P5o LT1, P6o LT2, P7o LT1, P8o LT2 (avg 1.6, mixed 1-2 variability sustained). Set L recent_5 (N=5) for avg ~1.6 reflecting reality vs promised 2. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_4 (N=4) for low regime mean~163 std~37; with L~1.6, mu_hat~(2.6)*163~423, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.6)*37~60, yields modest base_stock ~500-600 (z~0.67 for q=4/5=0.8) << pipeline so minimal order, balancing service vs holding amid bloat/lost risk & low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward regime extended to 4 periods P9-P12 avg 163 (-34% vs prior game avg 246), sustained post-Easter; lost shipment pattern continues: P10(66) overdue past expected P12 (P12 arrived=0), total overdue/lost ~941 units

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13, mid-May post-Mother's Day, spring blouse demand). Downward demand regime post-Easter changepoint at P9 sustained over 5 periods (P9-P13 demands:147,218,140,148,112; avg=153, -44% vs P1-P8 avg=275), confirmed by consistent lower sales and low ending inv. Recent std~36 low volatility. Lost shipments inflate pipeline (1702 in-transit includes ~941 lost: P1=218,P3=590,P4=67,P10=66 overdue >2pd past expected); effective position lower but still high vs low demand forecast. P12=761 expected arrive P14 (LT=2, visible P15). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low regime (mu_hat~(1+2)*153=459, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*36~62), default L=2 (recent arrives LT=2 e.g. P11,P8,P13 concludes). Lowers base_stock vs full history (early high demand), balances service (cover ~153/wk + buffer) vs holding (high position incurs cost, low order-up-to curbs excess). Addresses losses indirectly via regime params as backend subtracts inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward regime sustained over 5 periods P9-P13 avg 153 (-44% vs P1-P8 avg 275), post-Easter confirmed; P10(66) lost confirmed (overdue past expected P12 arrival, no conclude in P12/P13)

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20), post-Easter late spring; women's blouse demand in sustained downward regime since P9 (6 periods: demands 147,218,140,148,112,86; avg 142, -48% vs P1-P8 avg 275), trending lower (last 3 avg 115, P14=86 lowest). On-hand 756 high (from P14 arrivals 761 + prior 81 -86 sold), in-transit 941 stuck (lost: P1=218, P3=590, P4=67, P10=66 total 941). Recent LT observations stable at 2 (P8-10:2, P11-13:2, P12-14:2). High IP~1697 vs low demand favors low base_stock to avoid overordering amid holding costs; order likely 0. Set mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=6 (regime_length=6>=3, evidence: post-Easter drop sustained 6 periods confirmed by consistent low avgs). L default (promised 2 matches recent observed LTs). Low mu_hat~426, sigma reflects recent vol, yields conservative z* q=4/(4+1)=0.8, base_stock low relative to IP, balances low demand vs hold cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward regime sustained over 6 periods P9-P14 avg 142 (-48% vs P1-P8 avg 275), post-Easter confirmed with P14=86 further drop

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27 Memorial Day): Women's blouse demand in sustained post-Easter downward regime P9-P15 (7 periods, avg 135, -51% vs P1-P8 avg 275), low vol; Memorial Day may sustain low retail demand. On-hand 659 sufficient short-term, but in-transit 941 = stuck lost shipments (P1:218, P3:590, P4:67, P10:66; no new overdue). OR backend sees overstated pipeline ~1600, will underorder indefinitely post-onhand depletion. Compensate by explicit mu_hat = (1+2)*recent_7 mean (406) + 941 lost =1347, yielding bs~1347 + 0.84*sqrt(3)*42~1408 >941 stuck pipe (orders resume when onhand <~467). L recent_3 (last 3 LTs=2 stable, avg2). sigma_hat recent_7 for current regime vol; balances high illusory pipe vs holding cost/service.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward regime extended to 7 periods P9-P15 avg 135 (-51% vs P1-P8 275), post-Easter/Memorial Day sustained; recent LT stable at 2 (last 3 observations all 2); lost shipment pattern sustained at 941 units in-transit

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3, early June post-Memorial Day). Women's blouse demand in sustained downward post-Easter regime (changeloint P9 after Easter ~4/21), extended 8 periods P9-P16 avg 126.5 (demands:147,218,140,148,112,86,97,64; -54% vs P1-P8 avg 275), P16=64 confirms low summer start. On-hand 595 covers ~4.7 periods at 127/period > L+1=3. Phantom lost shipments fixed 941 units (P1:218 overdue>P3, P3:590>P5, P4:67>P6, P10:66>P12; no concludes). Recent LT stable 2 (last 3: P8@P10 LT2, P11@P13 LT2, P12@P14 LT2). No reliable in-transit. Inflate mu_hat explicitly by 941 to compensate phantom pipeline: true_mu_hat=126.5*3=379.5 +941=1320.5, ensuring computed base_stock = true_base +941, so order=true_base - actual_position (ignores phantom). Sigma recent_8 (std_d~47.9, sigma_hat~83) for true volatility/service. L default (promised=2 matches recent). This balances low demand holding cost vs future stockout risk despite inflated virtual position.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward regime extended to 8 periods P9-P16 avg 126.5 (-54% vs P1-P8 avg 275), sustained post-Easter/Memorial Day; lost shipment pattern sustained: 941 units phantom in-transit (P1:218, P3:590, P4:67, P10:66)

Demand downward regime sustained P9-P17 (9 periods, avg 133, -52% vs P1-P8 avg 275), post-Easter/spring holidays; P17=189 single spike insufficient to break regime (needs 3+ sustained). On-hand 406 covers ~3 periods recent demand (~130/period); 941 in-transit phantom lost (P1:218, P3:590, P4:67, P10:66, overdue >6 periods). Recent LT stable at 2 (last 4 observations: P10,P13,P14 all LT=2, prior mixed). Use default L=2 (matches recent); recent_N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low demand regime (changelpoint P9 post-Easter, regime_length=9), ensuring base_stock covers ~3 periods low mu while z* balances profit/holding; ignores phantom pipeline via forecast adjustment.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/6/17), post-Father's Day (6/16), women's summer blouse; recent demands P17=189, P18=176 (avg 182, post-Memorial Day P16=64 low), suggesting uptick from downward post-Easter regime (P9-P16 avg~127, -54% vs early game); forecast ~170/period amid summer stabilization. On-hand 230 covers ~1-1.5 periods at recent rates (depleting from 756 at P14 end); in-transit 941 all phantom lost (P1:218, P3:590, P4:67, P10:66, sustained >6 periods past expected). No real pipeline, LT stable at 2 (last 4 obs: all 2). To counter phantom pipeline bias (backend subtracts inflated position ~1171), inflate mu_hat by ~941 offset vs normal (3*170=510); explicit mu_hat=1450 ensures base_stock >>1171 (e.g., +0.84*sigma~120 yields ~1570, triggers ~400 order qty to rebuild vs cap). Sigma recent_10 captures P9-P18 vol (~50/period, sqrt3*50~87). L default (promised=2 matches recent). Balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding by targeting actual coverage over LT+review despite phantom drag.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24), women's blouse post-Memorial Day (P16 low demand 64), showing upward demand shift P17-P19: 189,176,277 avg 214 (+69% vs P9-P16 avg 126), sustained 3 periods, changepoint P17 with summer recovery. On-hand 0 after P19 stockout (demand 277 > 230 start). In-transit 1291 includes ~941 phantom lost (P1:218,P3:590,P4:67,P10:66 overdue >6+ periods) + recent P19:350 (exp P21 if LT=2), unreliable pipeline. LT stable at 2 (last 3 obs: P12@P14,P11@P13,P8@P10 all LT=2). Use default L=2. mu_hat recent_N=3 captures high mean 214*(1+2)=642 for base_stock boost. sigma_hat recent_N=3 matches vol ~55*sqrt(3)~95. Addresses stockouts/high service need (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding, ignores phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward starting Period 17: avg P17-P19 214 (+69% vs P9-P16 avg 126), sustained over 3 periods post-Memorial Day recovery; lost shipment pattern sustained: ~941 units phantom in-transit (P1:218, P3:590, P4:67, P10:66)

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019/7/1, early July post-Memorial Day, pre-July 4th; women's blouse). On-hand=0, in-transit=1291 (941 phantom lost from P1:218/P3:590/P4:67/P10:66 + recent P19:350 real). P20 stockout demand=205. Upward demand regime sustained P17-P20 avg=212 (+68% vs P9-P16 low 126), regime length=4. Recent LT stable at 2 (last observations P10/P13/P14 all 2). Compensate phantom pipeline illusion: backend subtracts full 1291 but real pipeline~350; inflate mu_hat explicitly = 3*212 +941=1576 to target effective base_stock ~1647 >1291, yielding order~356 (1+ period demand) while balancing q=0.8 service vs holding. L default (confirmed 2). Sigma recent_4 for regime volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward extended to 4 periods P17-P20 avg 212 (+68% vs P9-P16 avg 126), sustained over 4 periods post-Memorial Day recovery

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08): Early summer post-Independence Day (July 4); women's blouses in sustained upward demand regime since P17 (post-Memorial Day recovery, changepoint after P9-P16 low avg 126.5), P17-P21 demands [189,176,277,205,200] avg 209 (+65%), std 39.4, sustained 5 periods. Pipeline: in-transit 1642 = 941 confirmed phantoms (P1:218,P3:590,P4:67,P10:66 lost) + P19:350 (overdue 1pd past P21 expected LT=2) + P21:351 (exp P23); effective ~701 units. On-hand 0 risks P22 stockout (no expected arrival P22). Recent confirmed LT=2 stable (last obs P11/12->P13/14). To offset phantom pipeline bias (backend subtracts full 1642), set L explicit=8 to inflate base_stock~(1+8)*209 + 0.84*sqrt(9)*39.4 ~1885+99=1984 >1642+cap~1916, yielding order=cap~209+1.645*39~274 (1pd forecast+safety), rebuilding effective inv despite losses. recent_N=5 for mu/sigma reflects regime (N=max(min(5,20),3)). Ensures high service (avoid lost sales, profit$4) vs holding$1 on on-hand only.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward extended to 5 periods P17-P21 avg 209 (+65% vs P9-P16 avg 126.5), sustained post-Memorial Day/early summer; lost shipment pattern sustained with P19(350) overdue 1 period past expected P21 (P21 arrived=0), potential phantom total ~1291 units

LT stable at 2 (recent confirms P10,P13,P14). Phantom inventory confirmed 1291 units (P1:218, P3:590, P4:67, P10:66, P19:350 lost - overdue >2 past P21); reliable pipeline 626 (P21:351 arrive P23, P22:275 P24), total in-transit 1917. Inflate mu_hat by phantom to bridge: true_mu=(1+2)*204.17=612.5 \u2192 explicit 1903.5; true_sigma=sqrt(3)*37.5=65 explicit.

Carry-over insight: P19(350) lost confirmed (overdue 2+ periods past expected P21, no P21/P22 conclude), phantom total 1291 units sustained; demand upward regime extended to 6 periods P17-P22 avg 204 (+61% vs P9-P16 126), early summer sustained

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Set L recent_5 to use actual avg ~1.8 shortening review period; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 (P17-P23 regime length 7, avg demand 190, high std~51 from outliers 277/105) yields mu_hat~(1+1.8)*190~563, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.8)*51~85; lowers base_stock vs default/all-history (early high demands inflate mean~185 but volatile), reduces orders/caps to avoid adding to high inventory while covering ~3 periods demand ~570; z*=Phi^{-1}(4/(4+1))=0.63 service ~73% balancing profit vs holding amid losses.

LLM Rationale:

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5 early August, summer for women's blouses - potential steady/back-to-school ramp but recent data shows drop). Demand changepoint: downward shift P23-P25 avg 105 (-49% vs P17-P22 summer avg 204), sustained 3 periods, post-early summer high. Inventory: on-hand 312 covers ~3 periods at recent 105; in-transit 1661 overstated by ~1291 phantom lost (P1:218, P3:590, P4:67, P10:66, P19:350) + P23:42 overdue past expected P25 LT2 (P25 arrived=0). Real pipeline low (~328 from P25 exp P27). LT observed recent 5: 2,1,2,2,2 avg 1.8 (variability sustained). Params: L recent_5 reflects avg LT variability; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_3 captures new low-demand/low-vol regime (mean~105, std~10); lowers base stock (~300 + z*~30) vs phantom-high pipeline \u2192 minimal order, balances service vs holding on high on-hand amid low demand/low arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward starting Period 23: avg P23-P25 105 (-49% vs P17-P22 avg 204), sustained over 3 periods late summer/early Aug; lost shipment pattern sustained: P23(42) overdue >1 period past expected P25 (P25 arrived=0), total phantom ~1333 units

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12): Late summer for women's blouse; downward demand regime since P23 (2019/7/15) sustained over 4 periods (P23-26 demands:105,117,92,144 avg114, -44% vs P17-22 summer avg204), confirmed late summer dip with P26=144 slight recovery but below prior regime. Chgpoint at P23 validated by consistent low avg vs prior and seasonal timing. LT: 10 observed (seq:2,1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,3), recent_5 (last:3,1,2,2,2 avg2.0) stable around promised 2 despite variability. On-hand 210 covers ~1.5 recent periods; in-transit 1619 inflated by sustained lost shipments (~1333+ phantoms like P1:218,P3:590,P4:67,P10:66,P19:350; P23:42 arrived LT3). recent_N N=5 for L uses stable recent avg2, bridging backend's promised LT ignorance. recent_N N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat weights current low-demand regime (regime_length=4>3), yielding modest base_stock=(1+2)*114 ~342 mean + z*sigma buffer; high phantom pipeline suppresses backend orders preventing overstock, while params ensure coverage for (L+1)=3 low-demand periods despite non-arriving transit, balancing stockouts vs holding on actual on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward regime extended to 4 periods P23-P26 avg 114 (-44% vs P17-P22 204), sustained late summer; recent LT avg 2.0 over last 5 observations (3,1,2,2,2) with LT=3 example

Recent demands P23-P27:105,117,92,144,212 avg134 (down vs game avg~190). On-hand=326 covers ~2-3 recent periods; in-transit=1291 sustained phantom lost (P1:218,P3:590,P4:67,P10:66,P19:350, no new lost/overdue as recent orders arrived P26/P27). LT observations recent5:2(P27/P25),3(P26/P23),2(P23/P21),1(P23/P22),2(P14/P12) avg=2.0 stable. Use recent_N N=5 for L/mu/sigma to capture recent low demand regime/vol (std~41 vs hist~30) and LT avg2; mu_hat=3*134=402 targets coverage for low demand, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*41~71 supports service amid vol; lowers base_stock vs default high-mean all-history, limits orders given high phantom pipeline (OR caps anyway), balances holding on real on-hand while hedging recent patterns/missing shipments by not inflating mu unrealistically.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/8/26): Late August, back-to-school season likely driving recent demand increase for women's blouses (P26=144, P27=212, P28=232; avg 196 last 3 periods, +72% vs P23-P25 avg 105). Phantom in-transit 1291 units sustained (lost: P1=218, P3=590, P4=67, P10=66, P19=350; total 1291, no recent arrives of old orders). On-hand 94 low vs expected ~200 demand. LT observations recent: P27(LT=2), P26(3), P23(2&1), P14(2) \u2192 recent_5 avg=2.0 handles variability. mu_hat recent_3 captures upward shift (196*(1+L)~588 for L=2, higher base_stock counters phantom pipeline for service). sigma_hat recent_3 (low recent vol~46*sqrt(1+L)) balances holding. Ensures OR orders enough despite inflated pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2 Labor Day): Recent demand upward regime shift starting P27 (212,232,255 avg 233, +104% vs P23-P26 avg 114), sustained 3 periods amid late summer/early fall transition and Labor Day holiday potential for apparel spikes; consistent stockouts P28-P29 (ending OH=0) with high demand ~230-255; phantom in-transit 1291 units (lost P1:218,P3:590,P4:67,P10:66,P19:350?) inflates pipeline, risking underordering. Use recent_3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to target higher (1+L)*233 mean / sqrt(1+L)*~18 std, elevating base_stock despite phantom pipeline; L recent_5 (LTs:2,3,2,1,2 avg=2.0) maintains stable LT estimate amid variability. Parameters boost service level for rising demand while holding costs low via backend z=q/(q+h) with profit=4/holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward starting Period 27: avg P27-P29 233 (+104% vs P23-P26 avg 114), sustained over 3 periods late summer/early fall Labor Day; lost shipment pattern sustained ~1291 units phantom in-transit

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9 Monday, post-Labor Day weekend P30=9/2). Women's blouse demand regime upward sustained P27-P30: 212,232,255,344 avg 261 (+129% vs prior downward P23-P26 avg 114), 4 periods evidence with Labor Day spike P30=344 (+48% vs P27-P29 avg 233). On-hand=0 after P30 stockout (demand 344, sold=0). In-transit=1291 phantom (lost: P1=218, P3=590, P4=67, P10=66, P19=350; sustained pattern, no new arrives). Recent LT stable avg 2.0 (last 5 obs: P27 LT2(P25), P26 LT3(P23), P23 LT2(P21)/LT1(P22), P14 LT2(P12)). Chgpoint P27 confirmed sustained 4+ periods. L=recent_5 for stable LT. mu_hat explicit=2100 (base forecast 3*270=810 inflated +1291 phantom loss to target inflated base_stock ~2100 + 0.84*~100 >1291 pipeline, enabling order ~800-900 to refill despite overstated pipeline; 270/period blends recent 261 avg + upward trend/spike). sigma_hat=recent_4 captures recent vol (std~58 incl spike, scales to ~100). Addresses losses by inflating mu_hat so OR orders aggressively now (base > phantom pipeline, cap scales to ~270 +1.64*58 ~450 but inflated higher), balancing high service for profit vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand upward regime extended to 4 periods P27-P30 avg 261 (+129% vs P23-P26 avg 114), sustained post-Labor Day; Labor Day spike confirmed P30=344 (+48% vs P27-P29 avg 233)

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16 mid-Sept, early fall post-Labor Day). Demand upward regime sustained over 5 periods P27-P31: demands 212,232,255,344,329 (avg 274, +140% vs P23-P26 low avg 114), with Labor Day spike P30=344 and P31=329 continuation; major stockouts P30-P31 (673 lost sales). On-hand=0, in-transit=2087 (includes ~1291 phantom lost + P31 796 etc., overestimates pipeline). Women's blouse demand likely sustained into fall wardrobe transition. No new arrivals in P31 (expected none yet). Recent LT observations avg ~2.0 (last 5: 3,1,2,2,2 per prior). Use recent_N N=5 (regime length=5 for demand, recent stable LT) for L/mu_hat/sigma_hat to inflate base_stock vs phantom pipeline, target higher orders to cover ~274*(1+2)=822 demand over review+LT while balancing holding (z*=Phi^{-1}(4/(4+1))=0.806). Counters lost shipments by using recent high mu_hat/sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand upward regime extended to 5 periods P27-P31 avg 274 (+140% vs P23-P26 avg 114), sustained post-Labor Day into mid-Sept

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23, late September, fall transition for women's blouses/shirts). Recent demand upward regime from P27-P32 sustained 6 periods post-Labor Day (P30=344 spike), avg 285 (212,232,255,344,329,339), +140% vs prior low P23-P26 avg114; high volatility std~59. On-hand 457 covers ~1-2 periods recent demand; in-transit 1291 mostly phantom lost shipments (~1291 units: P1:218,P3:590,P4:67,P10:66,P19:350), backend will subtract phantoms reducing orders, so inflate mu_hat/sigma_hat via recent_N to boost base_stock. LT all observed avg~1.75 (12 obs: mix 1,2,3), recent similar; use calculate for L to reflect avg actual LT < promised 2, shortening base_stock period but with higher demand params to balance service vs holding. recent_N N=6 for mu/sigma captures regime changepoint at P27 (Labor Day/post-summer recovery), N=6=min(regime_len=6,20); helps OR target high service (q=4/(4+1)=0.8) despite phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand upward regime extended to 6 periods P27-P32 avg 285 (+140% vs P23-P26 avg 114), sustained post-Labor Day into late Sept with P32=339 confirming high fall demand

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): Late September, fall fashion season for women's blouses/shirts; upward demand regime from P27 sustained 7 periods (P27-P33 demands:212,232,255,344,329,339,378 avg=298, +161% vs P23-P26 avg=114.5), confirmed by P33=378 peak amid post-Labor Day into fall. On-hand=79 low vs expected ~300+ demand (likely stockout), in-transit=1291 mostly phantom lost (P1:218,P3:590,P4:67,P10:66,P19:350 sustained >10 periods overdue). Recent LT observations (last 5: P32 LT=1, P27 LT=2, P26 LT=3, P23 LT=2&1) avg~1.8, close to promised 2 with variability. Set L recent_5 to reflect recent avg LT; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 to capture sustained high mean/volatility regime (chimepoint P27, regime_length=7 so N=7). This raises base_stock ~3*298=894 (with L~2) + safety stock for vol, prompting OR to order aggressively to cover (L+1)=3 periods high demand despite phantom pipeline, balancing high service (q~0.8) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand upward regime extended to 7 periods P27-P33 avg 298 (+161% vs P23-P26 avg 114.5), sustained late Sept fall demand confirmed with P33=378 peak; lost shipment pattern sustained ~1291 units phantom in-transit

Recent demand regime P27-P36 (10 periods) mean_pd=255.2, std_pd~90; forecast (1+L=3)pd: mu=765, sigma=sqrt(3)*90~156. To bridge phantom gap, explicit mu_hat=765+1291=2056, sigma_hat=156 ensures base = real_target(765+0.84*156~896) + phantom; backend orders real_target - real_pipeline despite inflated pipeline, balancing high service (q=0.8) vs holding while compensating lost shipments. L default (promised 2, recent obs avg~1.7 consistent).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28, late Oct pre-Halloween): Downward demand regime sustained over 4 periods P34-P37 (demands 208,128,127,158; avg 155, -48% vs P27-P33 avg 298), late Oct post-Sept peak drop confirmed, no Halloween spike evidence yet for women's blouse; on-hand 548 covers ~3-4 weeks recent demand, in-transit 1482 includes ~1291 phantom lost (P1:218,P3:590,P4:67,P10:66,P19:350), effective pipeline overstated so backend under-orders appropriately. Reconcile: recent arrivals P36 (P35 LT1), no new overdue confirmed. Use 'calculate' L (all observed LT avg ~1.85 bridging promised 2/variability/losses); recent_N N=4 mu_hat/sigma_hat for low regime mean/vol (backend: ~2.85*155=441 mu, sqrt(2.85)*~38=64 sigma), lowers base_stock vs default to cut holding on buffer/phantoms while z*=Phi^{-1}(4/(4+1))=0.63 service covers vol; cap limits overorder.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward extended to 4 periods P34-P37 avg 155 (-48% vs P27-P33 avg 298), sustained late Oct

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019/11/4 early Nov post-Halloween pre-Thanksgiving/Black Friday holidays); demand downward regime sustained P34-P38 avg 145 (-51% vs P27-P33 avg 298) with P38=106 confirming late Oct drop, but calendar signals upcoming holiday clothing demand spike similar to Labor Day/Sept peaks (330-380); on-hand 567 covers ~4 periods at recent 145 pd but vulnerable to ramp-up; in-transit 1357=phantom total (sustained lost: P1:218/P3:590/P4:67/P10:66/P19:350/P36:66=1357, no recent real pipeline); overdue P36(66) lost >2pd past exp P38. L default=2 (promised, conservative vs recent avg1.6 last5 LT despite short trend). mu_hat explicit 2107= real holiday forecast 250pd*(1+2)=750 inflated +1357 phantom adjustment (counteracts backend pipeline subtraction for effective order to real position). sigma_hat explicit 140=sqrt(3)*~81pd (elevated vol for spikes/loss uncertainty vs recent std36). Yields base~2107+0.84*140~2225 >1924 pos, order~301 (reasonable replen for holidays), cap~702+1.645*140/1.73~702+126~828 ok; balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding by building real inv proactively while ignoring phantoms.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward extended to 5 periods P34-P38 avg 145 (-51% vs P27-P33 avg 298), post-Halloween sustained; P36(66) lost confirmed (overdue >2 periods past expected P38 arrival, no P37/P38 conclude), phantom total 1357 units sustained; Recent LT avg 1.6 over last 5 observations (P26:3, P27:2, P32:1, P36:1, P38:1), shortened trend confirmed

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11, Veterans Day week), women's blouse/shirt. Demand downward regime from P34-P39 sustained 6 periods, avg 138.5 (208,128,127,158,106,104; -51% vs P27-P33 fall peak avg 298), post-Halloween drop into early Nov, no pre-Thanksgiving (P42 Nov25/28) uptick yet despite potential holiday clothing demand. On-hand 529 covers ~4 periods recent demand; in-transit 1592 includes sustained phantom ~1291 units lost (P1:218,P3:590,P4:67,P10:66,P19:350 etc.; updated -P36:66 arrived P39 LT3). Actual pipeline low (~301 from P39 order). Recent LT 6 obs: P23 LT3, P25 LT2, P31 LT1, P35 LT1, P37 LT1, P36 LT3; avg 1.83, variable 1-3. Parameters: recent_N N=6 for L matches recent avg/variability. EWMA_gamma=0.3 for mu_hat partially adapts to low regime (weights recent ~30%) but retains prior higher demand influence, inflating (1+L)mu to compensate phantom-overstated pipeline (OR under-orders otherwise). recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat captures recent vol (~39) for balanced safety stock vs holding cost given high inv and low demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward regime extended to 6 periods P34-P39 avg 138.5 (-51% vs P27-P33 avg 298), post-Halloween/early Nov sustained; P36(66) arrived P39 LT=3 (not lost as previously assessed), phantom total ~1291 units sustained; LT variability sustained recent 6 obs avg 1.83 (range 1-3)

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18), mid-November pre-Thanksgiving (11/28) and Black Friday (11/29), women's blouse demand likely to rise for holiday shopping, but current post-Halloween downward regime sustained over 7 periods P34-P40 (demands:208,128,127,158,106,104,96; avg 132.4, -51% vs prior P27-P33 avg 298). On-hand 433 covers current low demand; in-transit 1592 includes ~1291 phantom units (lost: P1:218,P3:590,P4:67,P10:66,P19:350 etc.), so real pipeline lower\u2014parameters conservatively reflect recent low demand to avoid overordering into high holding costs amid phantoms. LT variability sustained (recent 6 obs:3,1,1,1,2,3 avg 1.83); use recent_N N=6 for L to capture this vs default promised 2. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=7 for downward regime (changelength=7>=3, evidence: sustained drop post-Halloween confirmed in multiple periods), scaling backend to ~397 mean demand over 1+L~3 periods (q=0.8 favors stockout avoidance but recent low mean tempers base_stock amid high on-hand/phantom buffer).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25): Thanksgiving week (Nov 28 holiday, Black Friday Nov 29), Cyber Monday Dec 2, early Christmas shopping season for women's blouses - primary calendar anchor forecasts upward demand shift to ~250/period (comparable to Labor Day P30=344, late-Sept peaks ~350 avg), overriding sustained downward regime P34-P41 (8 periods, avg 129, std~38). On-hand 629 covers ~2.5 periods at 250/demand; phantom in-transit 1291 units (P1:218, P3:590, P4:67, P10:66, P19:350) sustained, no recent real pipeline. Reconcile: backend overestimates pipeline by 1291, under-orders; inflate base_stock by ~1291. L calculate (all 16 obs avg 1.75, 1+L=2.75). Normal forecast: mu_hat=250*2.75=688, sigma_period=70 (elevated vol), sigma_hat=sqrt(2.75)*70~116, z*sigma~97, base~785; inflated mu_hat=785+1291=2076 -> explicit 2075 balances service (q=0.8 high) vs holding by countering phantom, enabling orders if needed post-spike while capping excess. Sigma explicit 120 for holiday vol.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): Early December, Christmas ~3 periods away (Dec 25); women's blouse/garment upper body expects major holiday demand spike (calendar event: Christmas retail peak for apparel/gifts; past game peaks P2:454, P30:344/P32:339/P33:378). Recent P40-P42 demands 96/105/150 avg~117 (-51% vs P27-P33 high 298) sustains post-Halloween down regime (P34-P39 avg138) but P42=150 uptick post-Thanksgiving (11/25 P42). On-hand 479, in-transit 1547 (sustained ~1291 phantom lost per carry-over: P1:218/P3:590/P4:67/P10:66 etc.; recent real in-transit ~256 from P42 order). Effective real pipeline ~735 insufficient for 3-period holiday demand ~350 avg (1050 mean + vol buffer). No new arrivals P42 (expected). Reconcile overdue: no new lost confirmed. LT recent 7 obs avg~1.86 (P41:2, P39:3, P38:1, P36:1, P32:1, P27:2, P26:3), close to promised 2. Set L default (promised 2); explicit mu_hat=2500 (~833/period x3, inflated for holiday spike + phantom compensation); sigma_hat=500 (high vol for peaks); yields base_stock~2500+0.84*500~2920 >2026 pipeline (order~894), cap~833+1.645*500/sqrt(3)~833+475=1308>894 allows replenish without overstocking real inv; balances high service for profit vs holding by triggering order now for spike despite phantom bias.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), pre-Christmas ~2.5wks out (Dec25 in ~P46); women's blouse expects holiday demand spike based on retail calendar (gifts/apparel peak late Dec). Recent demand P43=50 lowest ever (post-Thanksgiving Nov28 lull), sustains downward regime P34-P43 (10 periods, avg 123, -59% vs P27-P33 avg298 post-Halloween). On-hand 429 covers ~3.5 recent wks demand; in-transit 2442 overstated by sustained ~1291 phantom lost shipments (P1:218,P3:590,P4:67,P10:66,P19:350 etc.), causing backend IP-inflation & under-ordering. Recent LT obs (last 5: P41:2, P39:3, P38:1, P36:1, P32:1 avg1.6, variability sustained). No new arrivals P42-P43 (P42 order 256 expected P44 LT=2). Set L recent_5 to reflect shortened actual LT avg; mu_hat EWMA_gamma=0.2 for slow adaptation pulling toward higher historical/seasonal mean (~200 overall) to anticipate holiday uptick despite recent low regime; sigma_hat recent_10 (low vol ~45, values 50-208) limits excess safety stock but z*sigma boosts base_stock vs phantom IP. Ensures coverage (1+L)~2.6*~150-200=390-520 + safety ~40, prompting orders for holiday risk while minimizing holding on phantom-adjusted IP.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward regime extended to 10 periods P34-P43 avg 123 (-59% vs P27-P33 avg 298), sustained post-Halloween/Thanksgiving with P43=50 confirming lull

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019/12/16), pre-Christmas (Dec 25 ~P46) for women's blouse/shirt - expect major demand spike (gifting/winter apparel), akin to Labor Day P30=344 (+104% prior), fall peaks P33=378. Recent downward regime P34-P44 11 periods avg~121 (-59% vs P27-P33 avg298), confirmed post-Halloween/Thanksgiving lull (P43=50 low). On-hand 326 covers ~2-3 low-demand periods but risks stockout on spike (e.g., 300 pd demand exhausts quickly). In-transit 2442 overstates pipeline due to sustained phantom ~1291 (lost P1:218,P3:590,P4:67,P10:66,P19:350) + new P42:256 overdue past expected P44 LT=2 (P44 arrived=0). Observed LT 16 cases avg~1.75 (range1-3, recent6 avg1.83). L=calculate uses avg observed LT~1.75 for accurate backend (1+L)~2.75 pd coverage. mu_hat explicit 3500 targets ~1270 pd avg (blends recent121 + holiday uplift to peak~450 avg over 2.75pd, compensating phantom by inflating ~3500 >2768 pipeline to force ~730 order buffer). sigma_hat explicit 250 for elevated holiday vol (covers spikes >400). Ensures high base_stock~3500+0.84*250~3620 triggers orders despite phantom (cap~1270+ \u03a6^{-1}(0.95)*250/\u221a2.75~1270+250~1520 ample), balancing service vs holding amid losses/shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward extended to 11 periods P34-P44 avg 121 (-59% vs P27-P33 avg 298), sustained post-Halloween/Thanksgiving into mid-Dec pre-Christmas lull; lost shipment pattern sustained: ~1291 units phantom + P42(256) overdue >1 period past expected P44 (P44 arrived=0), total ~1547 units

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23): Christmas week peak for women's blouses/shirts (gifts, holiday outfits); expect major demand spike ~350-400/period similar to Sept peaks (P32=339, P33=378) and early highs (P2=454), overriding recent downward regime P34-P45 avg~121 (-59% vs prior highs). High pipeline (on-hand 1363 + in-transit 2234=3597) covers multiple periods even at peak, but parameters boost mu_hat/sigma_hat for service level during spike (q=0.8 needs ~84th percentile cover).

LT recent 6 obs:1,1,3,2,3,2 avg=2.0 stable/variable. Use recent_N N=6 for L (avg~2); explicit mu_hat=1100 (~3*367 peak forecast over 1+L); explicit sigma_hat=250 (elevated vol for spikes vs recent std~30). High base_stock offsets phantom pipeline drag, minimizes stockouts/holding imbalance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward starting Period 46: Christmas peak confirmed by calendar (12/23 major shopping), expected 300-400 vs recent 121 (+180%), sustained pattern pending first data; lost shipment pattern sustained ~1291 units phantom in-transit

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): post-Christmas/New Year's week for women's blouse; no Christmas peak materialized (P46 demand=69 vs expected 300-400, -43% vs P34-P45 avg~121). Downward demand regime sustained P34-P46 (13 periods, avg 117, -60% vs P27-P33 avg 298) confirmed by low P46. High coverage: on-hand 1294 + in-transit 2234 (incl. ~1291 phantom P1/P3/P4/P10/P19 + P45 order 943 expected P47 LT=2). No new overdue shipments (P42/P43 arrived P45). LT recent avg ~1.83-2.2 (last 10 obs incl. 3,2,2,3,1,1,1,2,3,1), close to promised 2. Use default L=2; recent_N N=13 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low recent mean~117/volatility, yielding base_stock ~(1+2)*117 + 0.84*low_sigma_recent <<3528 pipeline \u2192 order~0, balances low service risk (ample coverage) vs high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Christmas peak absent: P46 demand=69 (-43% vs P34-P45 avg 121), downward regime extended to 13 periods P34-P46 avg 117 (-60% vs P27-P33 298), sustained post-Christmas lull; lost shipment pattern sustained ~1291 units phantom in-transit
