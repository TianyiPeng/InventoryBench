Low variance prior, now high due holidays. (c) Lead time/missing orders: Promised LT=2 erratic (1-3 observed); chronic delays sustained 25+ periods (early mega-delays + recent), no arrivals P42/P40/P37; backlog growth to 1530u as of P42 (+110u via P42 order, no arr) confirms supplier bottleneck/transit pileup, not losses (transit tracks orders). No new LT inference; expect delayed arrivals. (d) Inv&pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout P42 lost ~223 sales); in-transit=1530u massive backlog (covers years at avg80, but delayed); recent pipeline: P42 ord110 pending (exp arr P44-45), P41 ord90, P40 90, P39 110 etc. all delayed; P43 arrivals unknown/post-decision, recent trend 0/low. High risk immediate stockout. (e) Order logic: Forecast P43~200 (Cyber Monday peak); cover (L+1)=3 periods ~600u but cap vs holding/backlog; ramp up from recent 90-110 to 200 balancing stockout loss ($4p/u) vs hold($1p/u); ensures service level holiday surge despite delays.",
