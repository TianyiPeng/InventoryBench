Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LTs remain variable (1-3 periods, e.g., P36 order LT=3 in P39, P39 LT=2 in P41); losses persist (historical like P29, P19); no new patterns from P46 conclude (no arrivals yet for recent orders). Pipeline: On-hand=0, but in-transit=930 units is exceptionally high (equivalent to 7-9+ periods at avg 100-135 demand), likely from accumulated orders during prior stockouts/low inventory; covers (L+1)=3-4 periods easily even at high demand. Demand analysis: P45-P46 Christmas spike (117,135; +200% vs P39-P44 low lull avg37), but P47=12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's likely demand drop (historical Jan-Feb ~122 avg from initial data, carry-over summer highs faded to holiday variability); no sustained post-spike regime yet. Calendar: End-of-year post-holiday normalization expected for lingerie (underwear bottoms), less urgency than Black Friday/Christmas. OR rec=0: Aligns with base-stock policy given massive pipeline > base_stock (OR uses promised LT=2, all-history demand ~100 mean, but caps order_raw<0); no override needed as additional orders risk high holding costs ($1/unit/period) with profit=$1. Strategy: Order 0 to avoid overstock; monitor incoming arrivals in upcoming concludes to confirm pipeline delivery.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - 930 in-transit covers 7-9+ periods of demand (even at recent 117-135 highs), post-Christmas 12/30 likely sees demand drop after P45-P46 spikes.",
