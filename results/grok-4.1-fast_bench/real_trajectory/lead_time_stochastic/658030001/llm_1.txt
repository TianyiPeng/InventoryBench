Date 2019/9/30 (late Mon, end-Sep): Post-peak back-to-school (Aug-early Sep) into fall fashion transition; denim demand sustained by cooler weather/school year continuity, no major holidays yet (Halloween Oct31). Historical early-year spikes (Feb~150) match seasonal fashion cycles.\n(b) Demand regime: Back-to-school high sustained avg~150 P26-33 (100,166,133,105,167,178,138,213; 8 periods vs summer~22 +580%, carry-over avg141 extended by P33=213). Forecast P34 ~150-200 (momentum from P33 peak, fall support).\n(c) Lead time: Variable 1-3 periods recently (P33:0 arrivals; P32: LT2/1; P30: LT3/2); no new drought (single P33=0 vs prior 6-8 streaks), but losses historical. In-transit 1950 reflects P23+ orders (e.g., P33:200 exp P35 L2; multiples overdue possible but recent deliveries confirm functionality.\n(d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 49 (low, post-P33 sell 213 from 262); in-transit 1950 ample (~13 periods@150), but timing risk (variable LT/drought history) threatens P34 stockout if no arrival (49<150 forecast). Pipeline covers long-term but short-term gap.\n(e) Order logic: Order 200 to buffer P34-36 demand (~150*3=450) vs low on-hand + uncertain near-term arrivals, matching recent high-demand strategy (P28-33:200s serviced peaks); balances stockout risk (lost profit) vs holding (pipeline heavy but LT variability).",
