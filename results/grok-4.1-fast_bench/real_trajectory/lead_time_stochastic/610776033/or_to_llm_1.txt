  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: From history, mixed LT=1-2 confirmed (e.g., recent patterns in P10-P23), with persistent lost shipment pattern (multiple orders like P19 never arrived, per carry-over); P46 conclude shows arrived=0, no new arrivals, in-transit remains 1700 (likely old pending orders, some may be lost). When deciding for P47, arrivals for P47 happen after decision, visible in P48. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0, but massive in-transit=1700 units covers extensive future low demand even if LT=2 (covers 1700/10=170 periods at recent avg~10); adding orders risks high holding cost ($1/unit/period) if they arrive amid stockouts. Demand analysis: Winter nadir sustained per carry-over (P43-P46 demands:63/12/7/6, avg~22 dropping to ~8); date 2019/12/30 (New Year's Eve) unlikely to spike T-shirt demand (lightweight women's jersey basic unsuitable for cold/holidays); historical winter pattern near-zero for T-shirts. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised L=2 and full history (low recent mean pulls it down). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - no need to order with huge pipeline and negligible demand; prioritize avoiding excess inventory holding costs. Expect low demand ~5-20 for P47.",
