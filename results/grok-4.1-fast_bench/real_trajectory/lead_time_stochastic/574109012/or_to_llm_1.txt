Inventory analysis: On-hand=0, so Period 2 demand (est. 50-70 based on recent history) will result in stockout. Pipeline=194 covers ~3 periods of demand at recent avg ~60 (Period 1:53, prior 60/68).

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LTs variable (P32 LT=3, P33 LT=3, P35 LT=1, P37 LT=1); promised=2, but pattern of LT=1 or 3 for fall orders, with losses (no arrivals past expected). P40 conclude arrived=0 confirms no new arrivals; P34 order 200 (placed P34) overdue by 6+ periods (expected ~P36), solidifying loss alongside prior P29:100, early P1:194/P3:17. In-transit 511 exactly matches lost totals (194+17+100+200=511), so effective pipeline=0 (lost shipments persist in-transit indefinitely, never arrive). Inventory analysis: On-hand=255 covers ~3-4 periods at recent avg demand ~75 (P37-P40:89/93/63/56 avg75.25), projecting end-P41 ~185 (minus ~70), end-P42 ~105 (minus ~80), end-P43 ~-45 (minus ~150 holiday spike risk) - high stockout risk P43 without new orders. Demand analysis: Sweater in late fall (11/18/2019), pre-Black Friday (11/29 ~P42), Thanksgiving (11/28 ~P42), Christmas (~P46); carry-over confirms fall acceleration (P30-P33 avg ~150, peaks 216), recent softening P37-P40 avg75 down ~30% from P31-P33 159 but elevated vs summer lows (no sustained new low regime per carry-over); calendar demands proactive buildup for holiday surges (historical peaks 198 early, recent 216). OR recommendation: 0 units - valid under its assumptions (promised LT=2, full history mu diluted by summer lows, sees fake 511 pipeline covering base-stock), but ignores lost shipments, LT variability, seasonality.

Step 2: Inventory & demand analysis - On-hand 277 covers P44 demand (recent max 216 P33/P42:168, avg P35-P43 ~84 but spikes).
