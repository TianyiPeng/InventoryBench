Aligns historical winter build-up (Oct high 400+, Nov stable 300, Dec surge). (b) Demand sustained pre-holiday high P40-P44 avg 317 (271/285/461/200/367), volatile (P42 peak 461, P43 dip 200, P44 rebound 367) but elevated +50% vs summer/fall lows; forecast P45 ~370 (Dec accel), P46 Christmas ~450-500 spike, P47 ~220 post-holiday. (c) LT variability 1-3 sustained (recent P43 LT2/3, P41 LT2, P40 LT3); P44 arrived=0 confirms P42 order 350 overdue LT2 (exp P44), likely LT3 P45 or lost (fits pattern of ~20-30% orders lost). No new LT shift. (d) On-hand 233 critically low vs P45 exp 370 (sold~233, ~140 stockout risk pre-arrivals). In-transit 4540 bloated by cumulative lost (~3k+ from history ex P1/3/4/10/13/14/17/29/34 etc.); effective pipeline recent reliable: P42 350 (prob LT3 P45), P43 450 (LT2 P45), P44 350 (LT2/3 P46/47) ~1150 incoming soon, likely builds buffer post-P45 to ~600-900 end-P45 for P46 peak. (e) Order 400 to target P47 post-holiday ~220 + safety 150-200 for LT uncertainty/volatility (arrives P46-48, covers end-game even if LT1 aids P46); matches recent order pattern (350-450), balances peak stockout risk (lost profit=1) vs holding (=1/period) given 3 periods left & pipeline support.",
