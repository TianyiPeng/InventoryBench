Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). No prior order/arrival history; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demands: 367 (2019-01-07), 213, 219, 181, 125 (2019-02-04); mean=221, showing downward trend but no confirmed sustained regime shift (gradual decline over 5 weeks, no abrupt changepoint with 3+ consistent periods). Post-Chinese New Year (Feb 5), early Feb no major spikes for women's basic joggers (Valentine's minor). Use defaults: L=promised 2; mu_hat=(1+2)*221=663; sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*std(samples) to provide base stock covering 3-period demand + safety stock (z\u22480.84 for q=4/5=0.8), balancing high profit vs low holding. Orders now to arrive Period 3 (visible Period 4).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18, Presidents' Day). Product: Women's joggers (everyday basics, lightweight sweatshirt fabric). Historical demands: 367 (1/7), then drop to 213,219,181,125 (2/4), Period 1 (2/11):123. Clear changepoint after 1/7: recent 5 periods avg=172 (down 53% from 367), lower volatility. On-hand=0 (stockout in P1, demand=123 unsold), in-transit=369 (P1 order, expected arrive during P3 per promised L=2; no conclude yet, so no overdue/loss). No observed lead times. Presidents' Day may have minor retail impact, but recent demands low/declining (post-winter peak?). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime length=5 >=3) to lower (1+L)xmean/std targets vs default (high due to initial 367 outlier), reducing base_stock given pipeline=369, balancing service vs holding (q=4/5=0.8). L=default (no data).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift after 2019-01-07: avg decreased from 367 to 172 (-53%) sustained over 5 periods (213,219,181,125,123)

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25), late winter, womens joggers (everyday basics) in confirmed low-demand regime post-2019-01-07 shift (carry-over: avg 172 over initial 5 periods). Game demands fit: P1=123, P2=165; full recent 6 samples (2019-01-14 to P2: 213,219,181,125,123,165; mean=171). No changepoint; sustained low mean/variance. No concluded arrivals (expected: P1 order arrives during P3 if LT=2, visible P4). In-transit=585 (P1=369+P2=216) covers ~3 periods (1+L=3) at 171/wk (~513). On-hand=0, prior lost sales. L=default (promised 2, no observed LTs). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N=6 to anchor low regime, lowering base_stock vs default (all ~199 mean). Ensures service vs holding (q=0.8), buffers pipeline shortages.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, women's lightweight joggers (winter/sweat fabric) likely seeing post-winter demand decline or stabilization. Full demand samples: 367(Jan7 outlier),213,219,181,125(Feb4),123(P1 Feb11),165(P2 18),82(P3 25). Confirmed downward regime post-Jan7 (carry-over), avg last 5 samples (181,125,123,165,82)=135.2 (vs all-sample ~221). Recent volatility (165\u219282) but regime sustained low. No arrivals observed (P1 order 369 overdue past promised L=2, no P3 arrive; P2 216 due P4). In-transit 585 covers ~4x recent avg demand. Pipeline high, so parameters target lower base-stock to minimize holding. L=default (no confirmed arrivals/lead times to average). mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_5 to use current regime (low mean/high vol), yielding mu_hat~(1+2)*135=405, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*std_last5(~68), z~0.84 service balances profit4/hold1; reduces overstock risk vs default higher stats.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11), early spring; women's joggers (winter-ish basics) likely seeing seasonal demand decline post-winter. Recent demands: P1:123, P2:165, P3:82, P4:51 (avg 105, down from prior regime ~172). P1 order (369) overdue >2 periods past promised LT=2 (expected P3 conclude, none by P4), still in-transit: likely lost shipment (remains in-transit indefinitely). Effective reliable pipeline ~0 beyond on-hand 165 (covers ~3+ recent low-demand periods). One observed LT=2 (P2 order). Chgpoint: sustained low-demand regime post-01/07 confirmed prior; recent 4 periods validate low mean/vol. Use L calculate (avg observed LT=2); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_4 to anchor on current low regime (mu~(1+2)*105=315; sigma~sqrt(3)*50~87), yielding base_stock~387. Pipeline view 534>387 triggers order~0, balancing high-q=0.8 service vs hold risk given phantom transit & low demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand further regime shift: avg decreased to 99 over last 3 periods (165,82,51) from prior low regime 172 (-42%)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18), early spring; women's lightweight joggers (everyday basics). Demand context: low regime since post-2019-01-07 (carry-over avg172 over prior 5, further drop to99 avg P2-4), recent P1-5 demands [123,165,82,51,146] avg113.4 std~46.6 (regime length~5). LT inference: only observed LT=2 (P2 order arrived P4); P1 order=369 overdue since expected P3 arrival (arrived=0 in P3/P5 concludes), prolonged absence 3+ periods past promised \u2192 signals likely lost shipment (remains in-transit 369). Current: on-hand=19 low, total pipeline=388 inflated by suspect lost order. Parameters: L 'calculate' (avg observed LT=2); mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=5 (backend: mu_hat=3*113.4~340, sigma_hat=~sqrt(3)*46.6~81; base_stock~340+0.84*81~406 >388 \u2192 orders ~18; cap~113+1.645*81/sqrt(3)~189). Addresses lost shipment gap (OR backend unaware) by basing on recent low regime for conservative mu but sufficient base >pipeline to trigger modest order, balancing service vs holding amid uncertainty/possible late arrival.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25): Late March spring, women's lightweight joggers (everyday basics) - no major calendar events nearby (Easter ~Apr 21 distant); steady non-seasonal demand expected but volatile recently. On-hand=0, in-transit=390 (P1:369 overdue/likely lost - expected arrive P3 if LT=2 but no conclude through P6; P6:21 pending). Recent demands: P4=51 low, P5=146, P6=151 high (stockout P6), avg last 3=116 but rebound from prior low regime (carry-over P2-4 avg99). Only 1 observed LT=2 (P2->P4); P1 lost not LT drift. No new sustained changepoint (rebound only 2 periods <3). Defaults use full samples (hist mean221 + game P1-6 mean120 \u2192 overall ~166/wk); L=2 \u2192 mu_hat=3*166~498, sigma_hat=\u221a3*~75~130, base~498+0.84*130~607 >390 pipeline \u2192 orders ~217 (under cap~240), compensates phantom 369 by triggering order to cover ~3wk demand at current levels + safety, balancing service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment: Period 1 order 369 units no arrival in expected Period 3 or subsequent through Period 6 (5 periods past promised LT=2)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1, early April, approaching Easter Apr21 which may boost casual womenswear like joggers). Recent demand shift up: P5-P7 demands 146,151,187 (mean 161, +62% from prior P2-P4 mean99), sustained 3 periods post-low P4=51; evidence confirms new high-demand regime vs prior carry-over decreases. Only observed LT=2 (P2 order arrived P4), matches promised despite P1=369 lost (not in-transit for LT calc). On-hand=0, in-transit=620 (likely P6=21+P7=230 + possible others; actual pipeline may be lower excluding lost). Use recent_3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture high mean/low vol regime over 1+L~3 periods (mu_hat~483), balancing stockouts vs holding (q=4/5=0.8 targets high service); default L=2 as no LT drift evidence. High pipeline may limit new order, but params ensure base_stock covers ~3*161 demand + safety.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: avg increased from 99 (P2-P4:165,82,51) to 161 (P5-P7:146,151,187) (+62%) sustained over 3 periods

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8), early spring; women's lightweight joggers demand likely softening (P8=90, -52% from P7=187, -44% from P5-7 regime avg=161). On-hand=161 covers 1+ periods at ~100-150/wk; in-transit=369 is confirmed lost P1 order (no arrival 7+ periods past expected P3, still listed as pipeline). Observed LTs: P2ord LT=2, P6 LT=2, P7 LT=1 (avg=1.67), but losses indicate unreliability; explicit L=3 inflates (1+L)=4 to bridge OR's unawareness of losses, ensuring base_stock covers phantom pipeline. mu_hat recent_4 (P5-8:146/151/187/90 avg=143.5 \u2192574) captures post-P5 upshift + recent drop. sigma_hat recent_4 (sd~40 \u219280) reflects high recent vol. Yields base_stock~641 (574+0.84*80) >530 pipeline \u2192 orders ~111 (under cap~210), replenishing true needs vs holding on 161 + preventing stockouts if demand rebounds.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15, mid-spring): Women's joggers (everyday basics) demand likely tapering as weather warms; recent pattern P7:187 (high), P8:90 (-52%), P9:59 (-34%) suggests possible downward shift post-P5 spike (carry-over), but only 2 low periods\u2014not yet sustained 3+. On-hand 102 sufficient for current low demand; in-transit 481 ample (includes P9 order 112 expected ~P11 LT2, others). Reconciled pipeline: P1:369 lost (carry-over), recent arrivals confirm LT variability (P4: LT2 from P2; P8: LT2 from P6, LT1 from P7). Use L 'calculate' (avg observed LTs 2,2,1 = 1.67) to adjust backend from promised 2, bridging LT=1 anomaly and loss risk. mu_hat 'recent_N' N=5 (P5-P9:146,151,187,90,59 mean=126.6; regime from P5 carry-over shift, length=5) for (1+L)~2.67x126.6~338 demand coverage, capturing post-spike drop vs all-time mean~117 but volatile history. sigma_hat 'recent_N' N=5 (std~51) reflects recent high volatility from spike/drop. Balances high q=4/5=0.8 service vs holding by lowering mu_hat/sigma_hat vs default (ignores recent drop), prevents overorder amid ample pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22, post-Easter April 21). Women's lightweight joggers: spring season, casual wear demand dropping as weather warms, no major upcoming events (Mother's Day May 12 ~3 weeks away). Recent demand regime shift down confirmed P8-P10: 90,59,44 avg 64 (-60% from P5-P7 avg 161), sustained 3 periods. Historical game demands mean 109.8, std 51.4. Pipeline overstated by lost P1 order 369 (confirmed overdue >8 periods past expected P3, still in 'in-transit'). Recent LTs: P9->P10:1, P7->P8:1, P6->P8:2, P2->P4:2 (avg 1.5). On-hand 170 covers ~3-4 recent low demand periods. To bridge lost shipment gap (backend unaware, subtracts ghost 369), inflate mu_hat explicitly to ~default 330 + 369 adjustment =700, targeting base_stock ~700 + ~75 safety =775 >539 pipeline for ~236 order-up-to cover future + recovery. L default (promised 2), sigma default leverage full history volatility. Ensures higher service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: avg decreased from 161 (P5-P7:146,151,187) to 64 (P8-P10:90,59,44) (-60%) sustained over 3 periods

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29): Women's joggers (everyday basics). Demand continues sharp decline in low regime since P8 shift (carry-over confirmed P8-P10 avg64), now P8-P11:90,59,44,34 avg57 (-11%), sustained 4 periods, no seasonal spikes expected late April. On-hand=136 covers ~4 periods at recent demand; in-transit=652 ample pipeline (total ~788 vs low demand). Confirmed lost only P1 (369); recent arrivals: P9@LT1(P10), P7@LT1(P8), P6@LT2(P8), P2@LT2(P4). Observed LTs last4:1,1,2,2 avg1.5. Reconcile: no new overdue beyond known lost. Use recent_N N=4 for all params to capture sustained low-demand regime (N=regime_length=4, min3 max20) and recent LT variability; lowers mu_hat~(1+1.5)*57~129, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.5)*std~22 (low vol), yielding conservative base_stock to minimize holding on excess pipeline vs profit-driven service.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6, early May spring): Seasonal decline in demand for lightweight joggers as warmer weather reduces need; recent demands P8-P12 (90,59,44,34,33) confirm low regime since changepoint at P8 (length 5 periods, avg 52 vs prior 161), with further softening in last 3 (P10-P12 avg 37, std ~5 low volatility). On-hand 103 covers multiple low-demand periods; in-transit 652 = lost P1 (369, no arrival past expected) + P11 (283, expected P13 if L=2). Recent lead times (4 obs: P2:L2, P6:2, P7:1, P9:1 avg 1.5) shorter than promised 2. Use recent_4 for L (captures avg 1.5); recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (low mean/volatility regime). Low mu_hat ~(2.5)*52=130, low sigma_hat ~sqrt(2.5)*24=38 ensures base_stock ~150 << pipeline 755, preventing overorder/holding costs despite partial lost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg decreased from 64 (P8-P10:90,59,44) to 37 (P10-P12:44,34,33) (-42%) sustained over 3 periods; Recent lead times avg 1.5 confirmed (last 4 obs: 2,2,1,1)

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13, mid-May, no major holidays/seasonal peaks for women's everyday joggers; demand stable low post-multiple downward shifts). On-hand=351 (high vs. recent ~36/day demand), in-transit=369 (confirmed lost P1 order, 13 periods past expected). Recent demands P10-P13:44,34,33,35 (mean=36.5, std~4.5, fits P11 shift to ~37 regime). Observed LTs (5 total): P2ord@P4(LT2), P6@P8(2), P7@P8(1), P9@P10(1), P11@P13(2); avg=1.6, recent pattern sustained. Use L recent_5 (avg~1.6 < promised 2, accounts for shorter actuals); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_4 (lowers base_stock to ~95-110 for (1+1.6)*36.5, reduces overordering given high OH + lost pipeline, balances high q=0.8 service vs holding on excess).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20): Late spring/early summer; women's lightweight joggers demand continues seasonal decline into warmer weather (recent: P11-14 demands 34,33,35,18 avg~30, vs prior regimes higher). High on-hand 333 covers many periods of low demand; in-transit 369 is confirmed lost P1 order (no arrival 12+ periods past expected P3). Recent lead times stable avg 1.6 (last 5 obs: P2->P4:2, P6->P8:2, P7->P8:1, P9->P10:1, P11->P13:2). No new arrivals expected soon. Use recent_N=5 for all params to capture sustained low-demand regime (post-P11 shift) and actual LT~1.6 < promised 2; lowers mu_hat~(1+1.6)*32.8~125, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.6)*std_recent~1.6*15~24 (rough), yielding conservative base_stock~125+0.84*24~135 to minimize overstock/holding costs given high inventory & low demand, while backend cap limits excess orders.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, late spring/early summer). Lightweight women's joggers; demand typically lower in warmer months. Recent demands P11-P15: 34,33,35,18,23 (avg 28.6, std ~6.8), confirming sustained low regime post prior shifts. On-hand 310 (high, covers 10+ periods at recent rate), in-transit 369 (P1 order, confirmed lost per carry-over, no arrival 13+ periods past expected). Recent LT observations (last 4: P13 LT2, P10 LT1, P8 LT2/P6, P8 LT1/P7; avg 1.5). No new orders pending arrival. Parameters use recent_N to set low mu_hat/sigma_hat reflecting current low demand/volatility regime, paired with recent LT avg, yielding low base_stock to minimize holding costs on excess inventory while covering (1+L)~2.5 periods demand (~70 units).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3): Early summer; joggers (women's lightweight sweatshirt fabric) expect low demand due to seasonal shift to warmer weather. Recent demands P13-P16: 35,18,23,15 (avg 22.75), continuing downward from prior low regime ~37 (P10-P13 avg36.5). Sustained low <25 over 4 periods confirms further drop. On-hand 295 high (covers ~13 periods at 23/wk), in-transit 369 is confirmed lost P1 order (no arrival 16 periods past LT=2). No recent orders, so no new pipeline. Lead times stable: last 4 obs (P11 LT2, P9 LT1, P7 LT1, P6 LT2) avg1.5. Use L recent_4 to reflect actual shorter/variable LT. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 (P10-P16 regime length=7, demands 44,34,33,35,18,23,15 avg~29 low mean/variance) to forecast low (1+L)~43-58 demand over review+LT, minimizing orders given high inventory/low demand, balancing low holding risk vs stockout (profit=4x holding=1 favors service but current buffer ample).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg decreased from 36.5 (P10-P13:44,34,33,35) to 18.7 (P14-P16:18,23,15) (-49%) sustained over 3 periods; Summer low demand for joggers confirmed (May-Jun avg<20)

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10): Summer low demand for women's joggers confirmed, recent P14-P17 demands 18,23,15,20 avg=19 (std~3.4), regime sustained 4+ periods (no new shift, P17=20 fits). High on-hand=275 covers ~14 periods at 19/wk; in-transit=369 is confirmed lost P1 order (overdue 15+ periods). No pending arrivals expected (no orders since P11). Recent LTs: last 4 observed (P13 LT2 P11-order, P10 LT1 P9, P8 LT2 P6, P8 LT1 P7) avg=1.5. Use recent_4 for all to reflect low demand regime (N=4=max(min(4,20),3)) and recent LT distribution: lowers mu_hat~(1+1.5)*19=38.5, low sigma~sqrt(2.5)*3.4~5.4 for conservative base-stock ~38.5+0.84*5.4~45 (q=4/5=0.8), order~max(0,45-275-369)=0 avoiding overstock/holding costs.

High on-hand=264 covers ~15 periods demand; in-transit=369 likely lost P1 order (no arrival 16+ periods past LT=2, as flagged). No recent orders, so no expected arrivals. Pipeline overstates due to lost shipment; use recent_N N=5 for L (observed LTs:2,2,1,1,2 avg=1.6< promised 2, sustained); recent_N N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (low recent mean~17.4, low std~4.6) to set low base_stock ~17.4*(1+1.6) + 0.84*4.6*sqrt(2.6) ~45 + ~7 =52, minus high pipeline=0 order, minimizing holding costs on excess inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24), late June summer period for women's lightweight joggers - confirmed low demand season (May-Jun avg <20). Recent demands P14-P19 (summer regime, 6 periods): 18,23,15,20,11,5; mean=15.3 (down from prior regimes), std\u22486.5 (low vol). Further drop in last 3 (P17-P19 avg=12, -36% from P14-P16 avg=18.7). High on-hand=259 covers ~17 periods at 15/wk; in-transit=369 is confirmed lost P1 order (overdue 17+ periods past LT=2). No recent orders, so no new arrivals expected. Lead times: 5 observations [chronological recent: P11 LT=2, P9 LT=1, P7 LT=1, P6 LT=2, P2 LT=2], avg=1.6. Use recent_N N=5 for L to reflect actual ~1.6 < promised 2. recent_N N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained summer low regime (length=6), yielding low base_stock ~ mu=15.3*(1+1.6)\u224840, sigma~sqrt(2.6)*6.5\u224810; with q=0.8 (z\u22480.84), base_stock\u224848 covers low demand while minimizing holding on excess inv (OR caps order anyway, but low params prevent future over-ordering despite lost pipeline ignorance).

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg decreased from 18.7 (P14-P16:18,23,15) to 12 (P17-P19:20,11,5) (-36%) sustained over 3 periods

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01): Early July, peak summer - confirmed low demand season for women's lightweight joggers (prior summer May-Jun avg<20, now even lower). Recent demands P18-P20:11,5,5 (avg=7, -63% from prior P14-P17 avg=19), new downward regime shift sustained 3 periods. On-hand=254 covers ~36 periods at recent avg7 demand; in-transit=369 is lost P1 order (overdue 18+ periods past promised LT=2). No recent arrivals/orders since P13. Observed LTs stable last4: 2(P11->P13),1(P9->P10),1(P7->P8),2(P6->P8) avg=1.5. Use recent_N N=4 for L (shorter actual LT reduces risk period). New regime justifies recent_N N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat: low mean=7, low std~3.5 yields low mu_hat~(1+1.5)*7=17.5, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.5)*3.5~6; base_stock~17.5+0.84*6~24 << pipeline=623 ensures order=0, minimizes holding costs on excess inv while covering low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: avg decreased from 19 (P14-P17:18,23,15,20) to 7 (P18-P20:11,5,5) (-63%) sustained over 3 periods

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22, 2019-07-08 (summer, early July). Women's joggers in summer show sustained low demand regime per carry-over (shift at P18 to avg~7, now P18-21:11,5,5,5 avg=6.5, -63% from prior, consistent with summer low <20 confirmed P17). On-hand=249 (high, covers >40 periods at ~5-10 demand), in-transit=369 is lost P1 order (overdue since expected P3, confirmed P7, phantom pipeline). No recent arrivals since P13. LT observations: 5 total (2,2,1,1,2 avg=1.6), recent stable avg~1.6 no new drift. Use L recent_N=5 for accurate avg LT<2 to backend. mu_hat recent_N=4 (P18-21 mean=6.5 *(1+~1.6)=~21) captures sustained summer low regime (length=4>=3). sigma_hat recent_N=4 (low vol~3) reflects stable low demand. Low params yield low base_stock, ensuring order~0 given high inv, minimizes holding cost while covering low demand + LT; bridges lost shipment gap by conservative forecast.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23, 2019/7/15 mid-summer; women's joggers in summer low-demand regime confirmed (May-Jul avg ~10-20, recent P18-P22:11,5,5,5,15 avg=8.2). High on-hand 234 covers ~30 periods at recent rate; in-transit 369 is confirmed lost P1 order (overdue 20+ periods past LT=2). No recent arrivals/shipments. Observed LTs stable: last 5 (P4:2,P8:2+1,P10:1,P13:2) avg=1.6 vs promised 2, so recent_N N=5 for L to reflect shorter actual LT. Demand changepoint at P18 sustained low mean=8.2/vlow var (regime length=5>3), so recent_N N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat: mu_hat~(1+1.6)*8.2~24.6 low to minimize overstock/holding (234+369 pipeline >> need); sigma_hat low ~sqrt(2.6)*~4 reflects tight recent vol. Addresses lost shipment by conservative low params reducing new orders; backend base_stock low vs high pipeline\u2192minimal order.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22): Late summer (July), low demand regime for lightweight joggers confirmed by carry-over insights (summer avg<20, recent shifts down to ~7-12). Recent demands P14-P23 (10 periods): 18,23,15,20,11,5,5,5,15,11; avg=12.8, sustained low (fluctuations but no new upward shift confirmed, as P22-P23 uptick=15,11 only 2 periods <3 threshold). On-hand=223 covers 20+ periods (~12.8/wk), IP=592 (223+369 lost P1 shipment, overdue since P3, confirmed lost). No arrivals expected P24 (no recent orders due LT~1-2). Recent LTs last 4 obs (P6:2, P7:1, P9:1, P11:2) avg=1.5. Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length~10+ summer periods, max(10,3)<20) for low (1+L)~38 mu_hat, low volatility; recent_N=4 for L=1.5. Ensures low base_stock << IP, order=0 to minimize holding on excess (~$213/period cost vs ~$51 profit), let deplete naturally. OR backend balanced high service now (buffer), low future order risk. No lost shipment changes.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019/7/29): Late summer, women's joggers in lightweight fabric confirm sustained low demand regime (summer low <20, recent P18-P24 avg 7.7: 11,5,5,5,15,11,2). High on-hand 221 covers 30+ periods at recent rates; in-transit 369 is lost P1 order (overdue 22+ periods past promised LT2). No recent orders, so no new arrivals expected soon. LT inferred from last 5 concludes (P4 LT2, P8 LT2/1, P10 LT1, P13 LT2; avg 1.6, recent 4 avg 1.5). Changepoint: low demand sustained since P18 (7+ periods), N=7 for recent regime. Use recent_N N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low mean/volatility (mu~(1+1.5)*7.7~29, sigma~sqrt(2.5)*4.7~7.4), L recent_4 for avg1.5. Low params ensure base_stock << pipeline (590), order~0, minimizes holding while backend balances q=0.8 service.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5): Early August, summer season for women's joggers (lightweight sweatshirt fabric) - low demand sustained as per carry-over (summer avg<20, recent shifts to ~7-9). Recent demands p19-p25 (5,5,5,15,11,2,8) avg~7.3, regime from p18 sustained 8 periods (-63% shift confirmed p21). On-hand=213 covers ~25+ periods at ~8/unit; in-transit=369 is lost p1 order (overdue 23+ periods past LT=2). Observed LTs sequence:2,2,1,1,2 (last5 avg1.6). No recent orders. Set L recent_5 for actual ~1.6; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_7 for low regime (N=7=max(min(8,20),3)). Low mu_hat~(1+1.6)*7.3~23, low sigma \u2192 low base_stock; OR caps order=0 given pipeline+on-hand>>base, avoids holding cost on excess while service high short-term.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019/8/12), late summer; women's joggers see sustained low demand due to seasonality (carry-over confirms summer lows <20 since P14, now avg ~8 recent). Recent demands P22-P26:15,11,2,8,4 (mean=8, std~5.2); no rebound. High on-hand=209 (covers 25+ periods at current demand), in-transit=369 (P1 lost order, overdue 24+ periods past promised LT=2). No orders since P11. Observed LTs (5 total): 2,2,1,1,2 (recent avg=1.6). Use recent_N N=5 for L (captures variable but sub-2 LT regime), mu_hat (lowers forecast to (1+1.6)*8~20 vs default high early samples), sigma_hat (low recent vol). Ensures low base_stock ~25 (q=0.8, z~0.84), order=0 given massive pipeline, prioritizes avoiding holding costs on excess inv.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19), late summer, women's joggers in low-demand season (summer avg <20 confirmed, recent even lower). Demand P18-P27 (10 periods): [11,5,5,5,15,11,2,8,4,13], avg 7.9, std ~4.4, sustained low regime no new changepoint (volatile but mean stable ~8). No arrivals since P13, P1 order 369 still in-transit (lost as per carry-over). On-hand 196 covers ~25 periods at recent demand rate; high holding cost. Observed LTs stable: last 4 (P6:2, P7:1, P9:1, P11:2) avg 1.5. Set L recent_4 to reflect actual avg LT< promised 2, lowering pipeline need. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_10 captures low summer regime (backend: (1+~1.5)*7.9~20 base, low sigma for tight control).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9, early Sep, post-Labor Day/back-to-school but no demand uptick yet; women's lightweight joggers see sustained summer low into early fall). Recent demands P21-30 avg 7.8 (70/9), stable low regime since P18 shift (carry-over P21), no new changepoint (last 3:5,4,8 avg5.7 not sustained drop vs prior). On-hand 179 sufficient for ~20+ periods at 8/wk (16 periods left to 47), phantom in-transit 369 (lost P1 order, overdue since P3, confirmed carry-over). Observed LTs: 5 total (2,2,1,1,2 avg1.6), recent 5 same. Use recent_10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (mean~7.8 std~4.3, (1+1.6)*7.8~20, sqrt(2.6)*4.3~7, base~20+0.84*7~26 <<548 pipeline \u2192 order=0, avoids overstock/holding while phantom blocks reorders (safe as inv covers horizon). recent_5 L=1.6 reflects mixed 1-2 actual vs promised 2, lowers base further.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16): Early fall, women's joggers in lightweight fabric; sustained summer low demand continued into Sept (P30-31:8,8), no uptick evidence despite seasonal shift potential. Last 10 demands (P22-P31:15,11,2,8,4,13,5,4,8,8) avg=7.8, std~4.2, stable low regime post Period 21 shift. On-hand=171 covers ~22 periods at current rate; in-transit=369 is lost P1 order (overdue 29+ periods past LT=2). Observed LTs (5 recent: P13 LT=2, P10 LT=1, P8 LT=1&2, avg=1.6). Parameters use recent_N to reflect low demand/vol/lead-time: L recent_5 for avg~1.6; mu_hat recent_10 *(1+L)~20; sigma_hat recent_10 *sqrt(1+L)~6.8. Low base_stock~25 (z~0.84) << pipeline~540 triggers order=0, avoids overstocking amid high holding costs while covering low demand; compensates lost shipment by relying on ample on-hand.

LLM Rationale:

On-hand 164 covers ~20+ periods at current rate; in-transit 369 is overdue P1 order (lost, confirmed prior, 30+ periods past expected). Recent LTs stable avg 1.6 (last 5 obs: P11->P13:2, P9->P10:1, P7->P8:1, P6->P8:2, P2->P4:2); no new arrivals/overdues. Stable low demand regime since P18 (chngpt P21), length 12+ periods, N=12. L recent_5 for faster actual LT; mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_12 for low mean(7.5)/low vol, yielding base stock ~(1+1.6)*7.5 + safety ~30, orders=0 given high pipeline/on-hand, minimizes holding while covering low demand/service.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30): Late September, lightweight joggers in summer low-demand regime persisting (no fall uptick evident; P22-P33 demands [15,11,2,8,4,13,5,4,8,8,7,6] mean=7.58, sample std=3.85). On-hand=158 covers ~20 periods at current rate; in-transit=369 is lost P1 order (no arrival 33 periods past expected P3). No overdue new shipments (no orders since P11). Set L=recent_5 (all 5 observed LTs [2,2,1,1,2] from P2/P6/P7/P9/P11 avg=1.6). Normal mu_hat=(1+1.6)*7.58=19.72; normal sigma_hat=\u221a2.6 * 3.85=6.21. Explicit mu_hat=19.72+369=388.72 (inflates base_stock by phantom 369 for effective normal targeting ignoring lost); sigma_hat=6.21 (normal). Ensures backend orders as-if real pipeline only (~25 target -158=0 now), low cap~156 limits overorder, balances high service low-demand vs holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019/10/21): Fall season, women's joggers in lightweight fabric; demand remains in sustained low regime (~7 avg over last 15 periods P22-P36: demands 15,11,2,8,4,13,5,4,8,8,7,6,5,5,4; sum=105, avg=7) continuing from summer lows, no evidence of seasonal uptick yet despite cooler weather. On-hand=144 covers ~20 periods at recent demand; in-transit=369 is overdue P1 order (promised arrive P3, now 34 periods past, confirmed lost per carry-over). No arrivals since P13. Observed LTs (chronological arrivals): P4(2), P8(2), P8(1), P10(1), P13(2); recent 5 avg=1.6. Use recent_N=5 for L to reflect shorter recent LTs; recent_N=15 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture current low-demand regime (N=15 as regime_length~16+ periods since P21 shift, capped<20). This lowers base_stock target vs default (early high-demand samples inflate mean/std), reducing over-ordering/holding on high on-hand amid low demand, balancing service (q=4/(4+1)=0.8) vs holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): Late October, approaching Halloween but joggers (women's lightweight basics) unlikely to spike; winter demand may gradually increase but carry-over confirms sustained low since summer (P14+ avg ~7-10). Recent demands P28-37 avg ~6.8 (5,4,8,8,7,6,5,5,4,16), P37=16 outlier (+150%) not sustained (single period). On-hand 128 covers ~18 periods at avg 7 demand (> remaining 10 periods to 47). In-transit 369 is phantom lost P1 order (confirmed overdue > promised LT=2 by many periods). No recent orders/LT obs beyond P13 (LT=2). Use recent_N N=5 for L (last obs LTs:2,1,1,2,2 avg1.6) to reflect variable recent LTs. recent_N N=20 for mu/sigma (P18-37 regime length>20, avg~7.3 low/vol low) yields low mu_hat~(1+1.6)*7.3~19, sigma_hat low ~7, base_stock~24 << pipeline 497 \u2192 order=0 optimal, balances low service need vs holding, phantom irrelevant as no order needed.

No new arrivals expected (no recent orders). Reconcile: IT stuck, no losses/overdues beyond known. Use recent_N=4 for L (confirmed avg=1.5 from last 4 obs: LTs 2,1,2,1), recent_N=20 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low mean/vol in current regime (chgpnt P14 sustained >20p), yielding low mu_hat~(1+1.5)*7=24.5, low sigma_hat=sqrt(2.5)*low_std~low, low base_stock < pipeline \u2192 order~0, minimizes holding costs.

On-hand 114 covers 15+ periods at ~7 demand; in-transit 369=confirmed lost P1 order (no arrival post-P3). No other overdue shipments (last arrival P13 from P11 LT=2). LT stable: 5 obs (2,2,1,1,2) avg1.6. Use recent_N N=5 for L (~1.6); recent_20 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (P20-P39 demands mean=7.25, low std~4.3), so mu_hat~(2.6)*7.25=18.85, sigma_hat~sqrt(2.6)*4.3~6.9, base_stock~18.85+0.84*6.9~24 vs pipeline=483, order=0.

Joggers (women's lightweight casual wear) show sustained low demand regime since P21 shift to ~7 avg (last 20 periods P21-40 demands avg~6.8, e.g., many 4-8, outliers 1-16; no sustained holiday spike despite winter season, recent P37-40:16/4/10/1 avg~7.75 consistent). On-hand 113 covers expected ~6/wk *7 remaining periods (~42 units) with buffer; in-transit 369 is P1 lost shipment (overdue 38+ periods past LT=2), effective pipeline=113 only. No ordering needed (OR will see pipeline=482>>low base_stock, order=0). Set L recent_5 (5 obs: P2/P6/P7/P9/P11 LTs 2,2,1,1,2 avg1.6 vs promised 2). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_20 to capture low mean/volatility regime (regime_length~20 since P21 changepoint). Ensures low base_stock~ mu~(1+1.6)*6.8~27 + z*sigma~low, balances low service risk (ample stock) vs holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019/11/25), pre-Black Friday (11/29) and Thanksgiving (11/28); joggers as casual basics may see holiday demand uptick, but no sustained evidence\u2014recent demands low and consistent (P22-P41: 20 periods avg 6.9, P37-P41:16/4/10/1/2 avg 6.6; prior regimes also low post-summer). On-hand 111 covers 15+ periods at ~7 demand; in-transit 369 = confirmed lost P1 order (no arrival past expected P3, still pending). No recent orders, no overdue arrivals expected. Observed LTs (5 total: P2->4:2, P6->8:2, P7->8:1, P9->10:1, P11->13:2; avg 1.6)\u2014use recent_5 for L to reflect mixed 1-2. Sustained low demand regime (post-P21 avg ~7, continued)\u2014recent_20 for mu_hat/sigma_hat weights long low regime (N=20=min(regime ~28 periods,20)), yielding low base_stock ~ (1+1.6)*6.9 + z*sigma_low ~20-30 vs pipeline 480, ensuring order~0 to minimize holding on excess while high q=0.8 buffers potential spike/service.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02), early December approaching Christmas (around P46), joggers as casual loungewear may see holiday uptick, but no sustained evidence yet\u2014recent demands volatile but low (P23-P42 avg 6.7, last 5:4,10,1,2,11 avg 5.6). Sustained low regime since P18 (25 periods). On-hand 100 covers remaining ~5 periods even at 20/unit (100 units). In-transit 369= lost P1 order (overdue 40+ periods). Observed LTs: 5 cases (2,2,1,1,2) avg 1.6; use recent_N N=5 for L to reflect shorter actuals vs promised 2, preventing overstock. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=20 matching regime length min(25,20) to weight low demand/volatility, ensuring low base-stock targets minimize holding on excess inventory while backend's q=4/5 balances service.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9), pre-Christmas holiday period for lightweight joggers (women's basics). No evidence of demand uptick; recent demands stable low (P34-P43 avg 6.3: 5,5,4,16,4,10,1,2,11,5), consistent with sustained low regime since P21 insight (23+ periods). Occasional spikes (P37:16, P42:11 near Thanksgiving) not sustained. On-hand 95 covers ~15 periods at avg 6 demand; in-transit 369 is confirmed lost P1 order (overdue >40 periods past expected P3). Observed LTs: 5 total (P4:2, P8:2&1, P10:1, P13:2), recent 5 avg 1.6. Use recent_N N=5 for L (shorter actual LT); recent_N N=20 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (low mean/variance regime, regime_length~23 capped 20). Lowers base_stock = (1+~1.6)*~6*20samples + z*sigma (low), minus high pipeline \u2192 minimal orders, balances high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding cost on excess inv.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16), mid-December pre-Christmas; joggers (casual loungewear) may see minor holiday uptick but no evidence\u2014recent demands low (P25-P44: 20 periods avg 6.45, P40-P44 avg 4.4). On-hand 92 covers ~15+ periods at current rates; in-transit 369 is confirmed lost P1 order (no arrival 44 periods later). No orders since P11 (arrived P13 LT=2). Pipeline overstates coverage due to lost shipment. Sustained low demand regime since P14 (30+ periods). LT observations: last 4 (P11 LT2, P9 LT1, P7 LT1, P6 LT2) avg 1.5. Use recent_N=4 for L (1.5), recent_N=20 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (low mean/variance). Keeps mu_hat~(1+1.5)*6.45~29 low vs pipeline 461; OR orders ~0, minimizes holding on excess OH with 3 periods left.

Carry-over insight: Continued low demand pre-Christmas: P40-P44 avg 4.4 (1,2,11,5,3) no holiday spike (+/- minor variance from 6.45 prior 20-period avg); sustained 5 periods

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23, Christmas week). Joggers (women's everyday basics) show no holiday demand spike; sustained low demand confirmed pre-Christmas (P40-P45: demands 1,2,11,5,3,2 avg=4; prior 20-period avg 6.45 minor variance). On-hand 90 ample for ~18+ periods at recent rates; in-transit 369 is P1 lost shipment (overdue 43+ periods past promised LT=2, no conclude ever). No other overdue arrivals expected. Recent lead times stable avg~1.6 (5 obs: 2,2,1,1,2). Changepoint: low demand regime sustained 10+ periods (P36-P45 avg 5.8, low variance). Set L recent_5 (avg 1.6); mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_10 (mean 5.8, sd~4.9). Yields low base_stock ~21 << pipeline 459 (ghost-inflated), triggers order=0 to minimize holding costs on ample actual inventory (90) vs low demand, bridging lost shipment gap without overordering.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): End-of-year post-Christmas period for women's joggers (winter/everyday wear). Continued low demand regime confirmed (P40-P46: demands 1,2,11,5,3,2,4; avg=4, sustained 7 periods, aligns with P45 insight of pre-Christmas low avg 4.4, no holiday spike). On-hand=86 covers ~20 periods at current rate; in-transit=369 is confirmed lost P1 order (no arrival 46 periods past expected). No recent orders, so no overdue shipments. Recent LT observations (last 4: P13 LT=2, P10 LT=1, P8 LT=1&2) avg=1.5; use recent_4 for L to reflect shorter actual LT. Demand forecast uses recent_7 (regime_length=7>3, <20) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained low mean~4/vol, yielding low base_stock to minimize holding costs on high on-hand while covering (1+L)~2.5 periods demand (~10 units). High q=0.8 favors service, but low params prevent overorder.
