(b) Demand regime: Holiday volatility sustained P42-44 (141 spike P42/11-25 pre-Thanksgiving, then 52,52 P43-44); recent 5-period avg P40-44=69 (44,57,141,52,52); post-fall dip P37-41 avg50 transitioned to volatility, no sustained shift (last 3=141/52/52 mixed); anticipate Christmas ramp-up to 100-150+ vs lull based on seasonal peak. Historical winter avg~86. (c) Lead-time/missing: Promised LT=2, recent stable LT=2 (P41->P43, P39->P41) but variability 1-3 observed; losses pattern persists (P42 order 100 overdue 1 period, absent P44 conclude exp LT2); P43 order 150 exp arrive P45 (post-decision, visible P46); many prior lost inflate in-transit. (d) Inv&pipeline: OH=339 (high, covers 4-6p at 50-80 or 2-3p at 150); in-transit=2300 mostly ghost (~1900+ lost per insights), real pipeline ~ recent 100(P42 overdue)+150(P43 exp)+others uncertain. (e) Final order logic: High OH + exp arrivals cover potential Christmas spike (150-200) x3 remaining periods (45-47); order modest 100 to buffer stockout risk (profit 19>>holding 1) vs excessive inv/holding amid unreliable pipeline/losses; conservative given 339 start + possible 150 arr.",
