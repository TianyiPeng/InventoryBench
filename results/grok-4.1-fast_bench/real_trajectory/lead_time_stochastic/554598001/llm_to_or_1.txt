Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11), first decision with on-hand=0, in-transit=0. No prior orders or conclude messages, so no lead time observations or overdue shipments. Product: women's basic T-shirt (everyday jersey), steady demand category. Historical weekly demands: 78(Jan7),58(Jan14),47(Jan21),42(Jan28),40(Feb4), showing clear declining trend (overall mean=53, recent 3 mean=43, -19% drop; first 2 mean=68). Changepoint around mid-Jan with lower regime sustained over last 3 periods (std~3.6 low). Post-Chinese New Year (Feb5), no major spikes expected soon (Valentine Feb14 minor for basics). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to reflect current lower demand regime over (1+L)=3 periods (~129 mean). L= default (promised 2, no data). Sigma_hat=default for conservative volatility (overall std~15.6 covers potential). High q=4/(4+1)=0.8 favors service; parameters ensure base_stock covers recent mean + safety over 3 periods, minimizing initial stockouts while avoiding excess hold on declining demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-Jan14: recent 3 periods avg 43 vs prior 68 (-37%), sustained decline confirmed

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18), mid-February, women's everyday t-shirt (non-seasonal peak). Carry-over confirms sustained demand decline post-Jan14: prior avg~68, recent avg~43 (-37%). P1 demand=48 aligns with recent regime (last 4: 47,42,40,48 avg=44.25). On-hand=0, in-transit=69 (P1 order), arrival expected during Period 3 (promised L=2), visible in P3 conclude; no overdue/losses yet (normal per timing). No major calendar events. Parameters: L=default (no observed lead times); mu_hat=recent_N N=4 for lower mean across 3 periods (~132); sigma_hat=recent_N N=4 for reduced recent volatility (~3.4 vs overall ~15). Lowers base stock to match decline, balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding cost, leverages in-transit coverage.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25), women's everyday T-shirt basics, late winter\u2014no major calendar events nearby (Valentine's past on Feb14, possible lingering effect on P2 demand spike?). Historical demand declining post-Jan14 (carry-over confirmed avg~43), P1 demand=48 aligns, but P2=120 massive spike (+167% vs prior avg~45), indicating volatility shift but not yet sustained (1 period). Pipeline: 120 in-transit (P1 order=69 expected during P3 if LT=2; P2=51 during P4), no arrivals observed yet (expected), no overdue/losses. On-hand=0. Use default L (promised 2, no concluded LT data). mu_hat recent_3 (last demands Feb4:40, P1:48, P2:120; avg~69 \u2192 ~207 for 3 periods) to upweight recent spike/volume. sigma_hat recent_3 (high std~52 \u2192 ~90) for elevated volatility coverage. Raises base stock above pipeline (~120) to protect service (high profit=4 vs hold=1) against sustained high demand, limits overstock via backend cap.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, no major holidays for women's basic t-shirts; steady everyday demand expected but recent in-game demands volatile (P1:48, P2:120 spike possibly Presidents' Day 2/18, P3:77) vs historical decline to ~43 avg post-Jan14. On-hand=0, in-transit=262 (P1:69 overdue-no arrive P3 conclude so L>2 or lost for that order; P2:51 due P4; P3:142 due P5). No confirmed arrivals/lead times yet. Use default L (promised 2, conservative as only 1 overdue). mu_hat recent_3 (mean~82*(1+2)=~245) captures recent higher/volatility vs historical low. sigma_hat recent_3 for elevated std~27*sqrt(3)~47 to buffer spikes, balancing higher service for profit vs holding; OR backend will order to base_stock - pipeline (262 high, so modest order).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11): Women's everyday t-shirt basics, early March post-winter - demand may stabilize but recent game demands show volatility with decline (P1:48, P2:120 spike, P3:77, P4:39). Historical pre-game also declining (avg ~53). On-hand 12 low, pipeline 259 high (includes P1:69 overdue since expected P3 arrival - likely lost; P3:142 exp P5; P4:36 exp P6). One confirmed LT=2 (P2 order arr P4). To bridge lost/delay gap for OR (unaware), set L explicit 3 for longer coverage. mu_hat recent_N=4 (game demands mean 71 *4=284) reflects recent regime incl volatility/decline vs historical. sigma_hat recent_N=4 captures high std~36.5 *2~73 for safety. High pipeline likely limits order-up-to, balances service vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern emerging: P1 order 69 units overdue by 2+ periods past expected P3 arrival, still in-transit P5

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18), early spring; Nora women's jersey T-shirt (everyday basics) - no major events, demand declining per carry-over regime shift post-Jan14 (recent hist avg43 vs prior68, -37%) confirmed in game P4:39/P5:55 (avg47) vs earlier P1-3 avg82. On-hand=0, in-transit=334 (P1:69 overdue>3per past P3 LT2-likely lost; P3:142 overdue1per past P5-likely lost/delayed; total ghosts~211; effective pipeline~123). Recent demand regime low/sustained decline, forecast ~50-60/day \u2192 ~3per (L+1=3) =150-180. Target effective base~200 (demand+safety). Required observed base=334 + (200-123)~411. L=default (confirmed LT=2 from P2\u2192P4 arrival). mu_hat=explicit 380 (~3*82 overall mean inflated temp by ghosts~200 to hit base~420 w/ safety). sigma_hat=default (full hist vol incl game spike P2). Ensures backend base>pipeline despite ghosts, orders ~80-90 (under cap~170), rebuilds real inv vs holding on ghosts/service loss. Addresses losses by inflating target base_stock.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed for P1 (69 units overdue 3+ periods past expected P3 arrival, still in-transit P6); P3 (142 units) overdue 1 period past expected P5 arrival

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019/3/25), late March, women's everyday t-shirt basics; post-winter demand stable low ~47 avg last 3 periods (P4:39, P5:55, P6:47; std~8), confirming sustained decline from early ~60-70 avg (carry-over shift post-Jan14). No major calendar events imminent. On-hand 40 (covers partial P7 demand ~47, risk stockout); in-transit 330 overstated: P1(69) lost (overdue 4+ past expected P3), P3(142) lost (overdue 2+ past P5), P4(36) overdue 1 past P6, P6(83) expected ~P7+1.5=~P8.5; real pipeline ~40+36+83=159. L 'calculate' uses avg observed LT=1.5 (all 2 obs: P2->P4 L=2, P5->P6 L=1). mu_hat explicit 420 (~3x recent 2.5*47~118, inflated by ~lost 211 equiv over horizon) + sigma_hat explicit 80 (elevated vs recent ~14, for buffer/cap); targets base~420+0.84*80~487 >370 pipeline \u2192 order~117 (cap~420/2.5 +1.64*80/sqrt(2.5)~168+83=251 allows); compensates lost shipments by forcing order to recover real low pipeline/stockout risk, prioritizing profit (q=0.8) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern sustained/worsening: P1 (69 units) overdue 4 periods past expected P3 arrival; P3 (142 units) overdue 2 periods past expected P5; P4 (36 units) newly overdue 1 period past expected P6 arrival

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01), early spring; Nora women's basic t-shirt demand may rise with warmer weather (P7:83 up from P6:47). Recent demands volatile but stable regime post-P2 spike: last 5 (P3-P7) avg 60.2 (77,39,55,47,83). On-hand 0 risks stockout; in-transit 448 high but losses sustained (P1:69 overdue 5pd past P3, P3:142 ov3pd past P5, P4:36 ov2pd past P6 per carry-over), effective pipeline ~448-247=201 uncertain. Observed LTs: P2@P4(LT2), P5@P6(LT1); losses suggest longer effective LT. Set L explicit=3 to inflate (1+L) coverage/buffer delays/losses (OR unaware). recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat uses current regime (N=5=regime length post-P2, evidence: consistent ~40-80 vs P2 outlier). Higher L/mu boosts base_stock > pipeline despite holds, balances service (avoid lost sales) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern worsening: P1 overdue 5pd past expected P3, P3 3pd past P5, P4 2pd past P6 (no P7 arrival); effective LT > promised 2 confirmed by sustained delays

On-hand 146 covers ~2-3 periods; in-transit 247 (P1:69 overdue 6pd past exp P3, P3:142 overdue 4pd past P5, P4:36 overdue 3pd past P6) highly unreliable due to sustained losses. Observed LTs from concludes: 2(P2@P4),1(P5@P6),2(P6@P8),1(P7@P8) avg1.5, but losses confirm effective LT>2; set L explicit=3 to inflate (1+L) coverage in base_stock, compensating backend's unawareness of losses/delays by boosting target inventory. recent_N=5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat uses current regime (post-decline but volatile), ensuring ~3x recent mean ~167 target minus pipeline, with cap protection; promotes sales during spikes while limiting excess holding.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15), mid-spring for women's basic jersey T-shirt; stable everyday demand expected ~50-60 avg (historical mean 58 across 14 samples), recent P9=28 low but isolated vs prior P7=83/P8=55 avg~55, no sustained new decline; Easter 4/21 nearby may mildly boost apparel. On-hand=118 covers 2+ periods; in-transit=247= P1(69 overdue 7pd past expected P3 arrival), P3(142 overdue 5pd past P5), P4(36 overdue 4pd past P6), lost pattern sustained (carry-over confirmed effective LT>2). Pipeline=365 bloated by losses; backend subtracts full. Set L=explicit 5 to reflect effective longer LT from losses, default mu_hat=(1+5)*58.36\u2248350, sigma_hat=sqrt(6)*~25\u224861, base_stock\u2248350+0.84*61\u2248400>365 enables order~35 (min cap), aggressive buildup for unreliable supply, high service q=0.8 vs holding.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22), post-Easter (4/21); spring season for women's basic t-shirt expects moderate demand ~40-50/period (recent P8-P10 avg 42). Demand context: sustained decline per carry-over, recent P9=28 low but P10=43 recovery. Inventory: on-hand=75 (covers 1-2 periods), in-transit=282 = lost P1(69 overdue since P3, 8pd), P3(142 overdue since P5, 6pd), P4(36 overdue since P6, 5pd) total lost~247 + P10(35 expected LT1-2). Effective IP~110 vs reported IP=357 (overstated 247). Observed LTs (concluded only): P2@P4(L=2), P5@P6(1), P6@P8(2), P7@P8(1); avg=1.5. L=calculate (1.5) reflects observed avg. mu_hat=explicit 390: targets ~2.5pd demand (2.5*45\u2248112) inflated by ~247 lost + safety ~230 total boost, so base_stock\u2248390 + 0.84*default_sigma(~45)\u2248428 > reported IP=357 \u2192 orders ~70 to rebuild effective IP to ~180 (covers 3-4pd demand+safety). sigma_hat=default uses full history std*sqrt(2.5) for balanced vol. Addresses losses by inflating base_stock to offset overstated pipeline, balancing high service (q=0.8) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern sustained through P10: P1(69u overdue 8pd past P3), P3(142u 6pd past P5), P4(36u 5pd past P6) no arrivals in P9-P10; total 247u overstated pipeline confirmed lost

On-hand 34 low; in-transit 350 includes 247 lost (P1=69 overdue 9pd past P3, P3=142 ovd 7pd past P5, P4=36 ovd 6pd past P6; avg delay 7.3pd?

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6 early May): Nora women's basic t-shirt; spring season but no immediate major events (Mother's Day May 12 next period, minor potential uptick unconfirmed). Recent demand stable regime P10-12: 43/41/41 (avg 41.7, low vol); confirmed early decline per carry-over. Pipeline 360u severely overstated: sustained lost pattern (P1:69 overdue 10pd past P3, P3:142 ov8pd past P5, P4:36 ov7pd past P6 =247u); P10:35 ov1pd past P12 (pattern suggests likely lost, total ~282u lost); effective pipeline ~78u (P11:68 exp P13 LT2, P12:10 exp P14).

Inflate mu_hat explicit +280 lost offset to ~384; sigma_hat explicit 60 (boost safety amid losses/uncertainty).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13): Mid-spring for women's basic T-shirt; summer demand potential but no evidence of uptick\u2014recent demands P9-P13 (28,43,41,41,31) confirm sustained low regime (avg 36.8 vs overall hist ~50, -26%). On-hand 37 low (covers ~1pd); in-transit 367 heavily overstated\u2014~292u lost (P1:69 overdue 11pd past exp P3, P3:142 ov10pd past P5, P4:36 ov9pd past P6, P10:35 ov3pd past P12; per carry-over pattern); recent P12:10/P13:75 may arrive but unreliable. Observed LTs (successful): 2,1,2,1,2 (avg~1.6) but losses imply effective LT>2. Set L explicit=3 to buffer delays/losses (base stock covers 4pd demand despite fake pipeline). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=5 for low-demand regime (P9+ changepoint: vol/mean drop sustained 5pd). Higher L+recent low mu boosts base stock (q=4/5=0.8 \u2192 high service), forces backend to order past overstated pipeline, minimizing stockouts vs holding.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20), late spring; Nora women's basic jersey T-shirt, everyday wear - no major events, demand sustained in low regime post-Jan14 shift (recent 7 periods P8-P14 avg 43.7, overall game avg ~55 but decline confirmed). On-hand 0, in-transit 357u overstated by sustained lost shipments ~282u (P1:69 overdue 12pd past P3, P3:142 ov10pd past P5, P4:36 ov9pd past P6, P10:35 ov3pd past P12); reliable pipeline ~75u (P13 order exp P15 arrival after decision).

Lost pattern sustained, effective LT>>2 requires inflating base_stock target >513u to force orders despite bogus pipeline. Observed arrived LTs avg~1.67 but ignore for explicit longer effective LT. Set L explicit=9: default mu_hat~(1+9)*57.5\u2248518 + z*default_sigma_hat~63 \u2192 base~581>513, triggers order min(68, cap~98). mu_hat/sigma_hat default use full history (mean57.5, sd~25) balancing recent Memorial uptick/vol vs early data.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019/6/3): Early summer (June start), women's jersey t-shirt; seasonal demand uptick expected and confirmed by recent changepoint at P14 - P14-P16 demands 67/87/51 avg 68 (+25% vs P1-P13 avg 54). On-hand=0 (stockouts P15-P16 demands 87/51), in-transit=607 overstated due to sustained lost shipments (e.g., P13 75u overdue 2pd past expected P15; older P1/P3/P4/P10 etc. 5-15pd+ overdue, ~500u likely lost per pattern). No arrivals expected reliably in P17 (P15 156u LT=2 dubious). L explicit=10 inflates horizon to compensate unreliable pipeline/losses, yielding high base_stock. mu_hat recent_3 (N=3, regime length=3) captures uptick mean=68.3*(11)=752. sigma_hat default conservative vol. Results: base~752+0.84*sqrt(11)*24.5~752+77=829 >607, order~222 clipped to cap~68+1.64*24.5~113 (positive order rebuilds real inventory despite fake pipeline, balancing stockouts vs holding).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand215 covers near-term; in-transit462 severely overstated by sustained lost shipments (e.g., P1:69u overdue14+pd past P3, P3:142u past P5, P4:36u past P6, P10:35u past P12, P13:75u 2pd past P15, total>350u lost per history/carries). Recent demand P14-P17:67,87,51,35 avg60 (regime length4 post-P14 changepoint). Explicit L=3 accounts for effective LT>2 due to delays/losses (backend unaware), inflating (1+L)=4pd coverage. mu_hat recent_4 (backend:4*60=240) and sigma_hat recent_4 capture summer volatility/regime vs all-data (mean56 std high from early outliers). Higher base_stock compensates bad pipeline, prioritizes service (q=0.8) over holding despite on-hand215.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019/6/17), mid-June summer peak for women's t-shirt (Nora jersey basic); expect moderate demand 50-60 amid seasonal uptick. Recent P14-P18 demands: 67,87,51,35,43 (avg 56.6, std ~20.7), slight +4% vs P1-P13 avg ~54.5, confirming minor sustained shift from carry-over P14 uptick (now 5 periods). On-hand 172 covers ~3-4 weeks recent demand; in-transit 462 severely overstated per sustained lost shipments (e.g., P1 69u overdue ~16pd past P3, P3 142u ~14pd past P5, total lost ~500u+). No P18 arrival (expected none recent); unreliable pipeline requires higher effective L. Set L explicit=3 to bridge losses/delays (observed LTs avg 1.6-1.75 recent/most but ineffective due to non-arrivals). mu_hat recent_N N=5 captures current regime (backend: 4*56.6~226). sigma_hat recent_N N=5 for volatility (backend: sqrt(4)*20.7~41). Boosts base_stock ~260 to improve service vs holding, orders more despite overstated pipeline.

Recent demand regime shift since P14 sustained P14-P19 avg 62.5 (67,87,51,35,43,92) vs P1-P13 ~54 (+15%), P19=92 spike confirms uptick. On-hand 80 low vs recent highs; in-transit 462 grossly overstated (lost pattern sustained: P17 105u overdue past exp P19 LT2 no-arrival P19, plus prior P1/3/4/10/13 etc. totaling 300+u lost). No recent conclude arrivals P18-P19. Reconcile: actual pipeline << reported, urgent coverage needed for (L+1)~3-4 periods ~200+ demand. L explicit=3 (effective LT>2 per sustained delays/lost); mu_hat recent_N N=6 (regime length=6>=3, captures summer mean 62.5*(1+3)=250); sigma_hat recent_N N=6 (recent vol ~21). Boosts OR base_stock ~250 + z*~21*sqrt(4) (z~0.84 q=4/5), targets high service despite lost pipeline, offsets underordering; cap also scales up. Minimizes stockouts (profit-dom) while curbing excess hold on unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained P14-P19 avg62.5 vs P1-P13 avg54 (+15%), P19=92 peak confirms summer t-shirt demand; Lost shipment pattern: P17(105u) overdue past expected P19 arrival (no P19 arrival), total overstated pipeline ~462u sustained

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21, 2019/7/1: peak summer for women's jersey t-shirts, expect continued high demand; recent P18-20 demands 43/92/131 (last3 avg~89, +60% vs prior regime ~54-62), P20 record 131 confirms uptick. On-hand=0 post-P20 stockout (demand131>sold80); in-transit=462 mostly lost/overdue (carry-over: P1/P3/P4/P10/P13/P17 etc. >3pd past expected, total~462 overstated, actual pipeline near0). No arrivals P18-P20. Sustained lost pattern requires compensation: backend unaware of losses/overstatement, subtracts full pipeline. L explicit=3 (effective LT>2 per carry-over sustained delays); mu_hat explicit=500 (4pd*125pd forecast for summer peak, inflated to drive base_stock~574>462); sigma_hat recent_N=3 (last3 std~44, sqrt(4)*44~89, z*~75 safety stock). Ensures order~112 (min(112,cap~197)) to cover 3-4pd high demand, high service q=0.8 vs holding.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8, early July summer peak for women's jersey t-shirt). Recent demand P19-P21: 92/131/142 (avg 122, +122% vs P1-P18 avg ~55), sustained regime shift confirming seasonal summer uptick; expect continued high demand ~120-140/period. On-hand=0, multiple recent stockouts (P15/16/20/21). In-transit=575 severely overstated due to chronic lost shipments (e.g., P1=69u overdue >19pd past P3; P3=142u >18pd past P5; P17=105u 3pd past P19; total lost ~500u inferred as they never conclude/arrive but inflate pipeline). Surviving orders show LT=1-2 (avg~1.6), but effective LT>2 due to high loss rate. Set L=explicit 4 to buffer extended effective LT/losses, forcing higher base_stock~(1+4)*122=610 + z*~40=650>575 pipeline for positive order despite cap~140. mu_hat/sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 (regime_length=3>=3) captures peak mean/vol without dilution; addresses losses by inflating target above fake pipeline while balancing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: P19-P21 avg122 vs P1-P18 avg55 (+122%), sustained 3 periods confirming peak summer t-shirt demand; Lost shipment pattern worsening: P17(105u) overdue 3pd past expected P19 arrival (no P19-P21 arrivals for it), ancient losses (P1/P3/P4 etc.) >15pd overdue, total overstated pipeline 575u (+113 from P21 order)

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15 mid-July summer peak for women's t-shirt). Recent demand regime P19-P22: 92,131,142,133 avg124.5 (+126% vs P1-P18 avg~55), sustained 4 periods confirming peak. On-hand=0, stockouts P21(142),P22(133). In-transit=658 but ~462u ancient lost (P1/P3/P4/P10/P13 etc. >15pd overdue per carry-over), plus P21(113u exp P23 LT2), P22(83u exp P24); effective pipeline ~196u. No arrivals P18-P22 (5pd). Reconcile: overstated pipeline causes backend underorder; compensate with explicit mu_hat=850 (est lost 462 + 3*130 demand coverage for L=2 horizon), explicit sigma_hat=100 (inflates safety ~84u vs recent std~22*sqrt3~38). L=default (promised 2, aligns with recent successful LTs). Base~850+0.84*100=934>658, order~276 < cap~850/3 +1.64*100/sqrt3 \u2248283+95=378.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22): Peak summer for women's t-shirt (Nora jersey basic), demand sustained high P19-P23: 92,131,142,133,141 (avg 128, +133% vs P1-P18 avg~55), 5 periods confirm regime shift. On-hand=55 (low vs ~140 exp demand, likely stockout), in-transit=739 overstated by ~550u due to sustained lost shipments (ancient P1/P3/P4/etc. >20pd overdue, no resolution; recent arrivals only recent orders LT=1-2). Reconcile: expected arrivals P24 from P22? No, P22 arrived P23 LT1; P23(277u) exp P25 LT2. Losses make pipeline unreliable; backend unaware, so counter by explicit L=3 (>promised 2, matching effective delay/loss risk), recent_5 mu_hat/sigma_hat capture peak regime (mu~(1+3)*128=512 base, sigma~23*sqrt4~46), elevates base_stock to order more aggressively despite fake-high pipeline, balancing high service (profit$4) vs holding$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak sustained/extended P19-P23 avg128 vs P1-P18 avg55 (+133%), 5 periods confirm peak summer t-shirt demand; Lost shipment pattern sustained: ancient losses unresolved (>20pd overdue total ~550u), pipeline 739 overstated despite recent LT=1-2 arrivals for P21/P22

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, pipeline=739 overstated by sustained ancient losses (~550u >20pd overdue P1/P3/P4 etc.) + recent misses (e.g., P23 277u no LT1 P24 arrival, overdue); effective pipeline ~200u sporadic recent arrivals. L explicit=5 for effective LT prolonged by losses/delays (need target base stock covering 6 periods despite promised 2). mu_hat recent_N N=6 scales to ~786 capturing summer peak. sigma_hat recent_N N=6 ~49 (low vol sqrt(6)*~20). Backend base_stock ~786 + 0.84*49 ~827 >739 pip triggers order ~88 (capped ~131+1.64*20~164), starts rebuilding vs ghosts while high service for $4 profit/unit vs $1 hold; cap prevents excess amid uncertainty.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019/8/5), peak summer season for women's t-shirt (Nora T-shirt, everyday basics); sustained demand regime shift since P19 confirmed by carry-overs, P19-P25 demands [92,131,142,133,141,146,157] avg 134.6 (+145% vs P1-P18 avg ~55), increasing trend to 157 confirms ongoing high summer demand. On-hand=0 (stockout risk), in-transit=826 heavily overstated per sustained lost shipment pattern (ancient losses ~550-600u unresolved >20pd overdue; recent P23 order 277u overdue past expected P25 arrival as no P25 arrival; total effective pipeline <<826). Observed LTs avg ~1.6 but unreliable due to losses/no-shows (e.g., 0 arrivals P24-P25). Set L explicit=6 to account for effective LT>>2 from delays/losses, inflating base_stock ~ mu_hat=942 + z*sigma_hat~54.6 (~988 total) >826 pipeline to trigger ordering ~161 (near cap~168=134.6 +1.645*20.6). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=7 uses regime_length=7 (changenoint P19 sustained 7pd evidence), backend computes (1+6)*134.6=942 and sqrt(7)*20.6~54.6 capturing high mean/volatility; balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding by overriding fake pipeline to cover ~6pd ahead demand despite losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak extended/sustained P19-P25 avg135 (+145% vs P1-P18 avg55), 7 periods confirm peak summer t-shirt demand; Lost shipment pattern worsening: no arrivals P24-P25 (P23 277u overdue past expected P25), total overstated pipeline 826u with ancient losses ~600u

On-hand 141 covers ~1pd demand; in-transit 711 overstated (~600u ancient lost like P1/P3/P4, per carry-over), effective pipeline low risking stockouts despite recent P26 arrival (P23 LT=3). Reconcile: many overdue (e.g. P17/P25/etc. no show). Chgpoint P19 sustained 8pd \u2192 N=8. Recent LTs avg~1.7 but LT=3 recent + chronic losses \u2192 effective coverage >2.

On-hand=0 post P28 stockout (demand 163>110); in-transit=624u heavily overstated (~600u ancient losses P1/P3/P4 etc. + recent overdues like P26 162u overdue past expected P28 LT2 arrival, no P28 arr). Reconcile: expected recent arrivals absent, lost pattern sustained worsens effective LT. Set L explicit=4 (best estimate > observed max LT=3 + buffer for sustained delays/losses, inflates base_stock to counteract overstated pipeline subtraction). mu_hat recent_N=10 (regime_length=10 since P19 shift, evidence: post-P19 demands consistently 92-163 vs prior ~55, backend computes (1+4)*135.9=679.6). sigma_hat recent_N=10 (high vol std~20 in peak regime, scales to sqrt(5)*20~45 for safety stock). Ensures base_stock~717 >624 pipeline (order~93 < cap~169), builds inventory vs holding cost while serving high profit demand; higher L/mu bridges OR backend's ignorance of losses/delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak extended P19-P28 avg135.9 (+147% vs P1-P18 avg55), 10 periods sustained late summer t-shirt demand; Lost shipment pattern worsening: P26(162u) overdue past expected P28 arrival (no P28 arr), total overstated pipeline 624u with ancient ~600u unresolved

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2 Labor Day): Women's t-shirt in late summer/early fall; peak demand regime sustained P19-P29 (11 periods) avg 140 (+154% vs P1-P18 avg 55), confirmed by P28=163, P29=180 highs despite calendar shift. Changeloint at P19 (avg 122 P19-P21 vs prior 55), regime length=11 (max(11,3)=11). On-hand=0 (stockout P29 demand=180); in-transit=718 overstated (~600 ancient lost +162 P26 overdue 2pd past expected P28 no-arr P28-P29 +94 P29 recent). No arrivals P28-P29 sustains lost pattern. Parameters: L explicit=6 accounts for effective LT>promised 2 (losses/delays, recent LT=1-3); mu_hat recent_11 scales to (1+6)*140=980; sigma_hat recent_11 ~sqrt(7)*23=61. Base_stock~980+0.84*61~1031 >718+cap~178 (cap=140+1.645*23~178), yields order=cap~178 to aggressively cover demand despite overstated pipeline, balancing high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9), post-Labor Day early September; Nora women's t-shirt sustained peak summer demand regime from P19-P30 (12 periods, avg 137.75, +150% vs P1-P18 avg ~55), confirmed no sustained decline (P30=114 single period fluctuation within volatile highs like P27=118). On-hand=0, in-transit=897 overstated by ~700u lost (ancient ~600u P1/P3/P4 etc. >25pd overdue + recent P26 162u overdue 3pd past expected P28 arrival, per carry-over pattern). Reconciled: expected P31 arrival possibly P29 94u (LT=2), but losses suggest low reliability. L explicit=3 (recent LT=3 P23->P26 confirmed, avg all observed LT~1.75 but effective longer due sustained delays/losses). mu_hat explicit=1300 (normal 4pd@138=552 inflated +~750 lost adjustment to force base_stock>>pipeline). sigma_hat explicit=60 (~sqrt(4)*25 recent std, modest safety inflate). Backend base~1350>897 (order~453), capped at~374 ensuring rebuilds effective inv while balancing service (q=0.8) vs holding; addresses OR unawareness of losses by parameter inflation.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019/9/16): early fall, women's summer t-shirt (Nora jersey basic); sustained summer peak demand regime from P19-P31 (13 periods, avg ~134 vs pre-P19 avg ~55, +145%), recent P29-P31 (180,114,87 avg 127) volatile/slight dip but no sustained decline (not 3+ consistent periods lower). On-hand=0, in-transit=1272 overstated by ~600u ancient lost (P1/P3/P4 etc. >25pd overdue) + recent (P26 162u overdue 4pd past expected P28 L=2, P29 94u overdue 2pd past P31, P30 179u/P31 375u pending); effective pipeline far lower, repeated stockouts (P31 sold=0/87 demand). No arrivals P28-P31 (4pd). L explicit=3 to buffer recent LT=3 (P23-P26) + sustained delays/lost (OR backend unaware). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N=13 (peak regime_length=13=max(13,3),min(13,20)) to capture sustained high mean/vol vs default's low historical mean; ensures base_stock ~ (1+3)*134 + z*(sqrt(4)*high_std) covers 4pd high demand despite losses/overstatement, prioritizing service (profit$4 >> holding$1, q=0.8) to boost sales vs holding risk.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019/9/23): Late September, end of summer/post-Labor Day (9/2 P30), t-shirt demand decline confirmed vs peak (P30-P32 avg 101.3 vs P19-P29 avg 140, -28%, sustained 3pd). Recent demands P28-32: 163/180/114/87/103 avg 129.4 (std 40.3). On-hand 451 covers ~4pd at 100/demand; pipeline 718 overstated by ~650u lost (ancient ~600u sustained + P26 162u overdue 5pd past P28 exp + P29 94u overdue 2pd past P31 exp, no arr P32). Recent LTs avg ~1.7 (calculate would use ~1.71), but default L=2 conservative for cap/variability. Normal mu_hat=3*129.4=388, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*40.3~70; inflate mu_hat by 650u lost to offset overstated pipeline, ensuring backend orders correctly as-if actual position (inflated_base - overstated_pos = normal_base - actual_pos). Base~1040+0.84*70~1099 <1169 pos \u2192 order~0 now (correct, high OH), but future depletion triggers proper reorders. Addresses losses by systematic inflation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: P30-P32 avg 101.3 vs P19-P29 avg 140 (-28%), sustained 3 periods confirming post-summer t-shirt demand decline; Lost shipment pattern sustained/worsening: P26(162u) overdue 5pd past expected P28 (no P29-P32 arr), P29(94u) overdue 2pd past P31 (no P32 arr), total overstated ~650u with ancient ~600u unresolved

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/9/30): Late September, t-shirt demand in post-summer decline regime confirmed sustained P30-P33 (114,87,103,112 avg=104, std~10.8) vs prior peak P19-P29 avg~140 (-26%), no evidence of further shift (P33=112 fits regime). On-hand=339 covers ~3+ periods at 104 demand/period. In-transit=718 overstated by sustained lost shipments (ancient ~600u + P26=162u overdue >6pd past P28 + P29=94u overdue 3pd past P31, no arr P32-P33); actual pipeline ~339 low/unreliable. Recent LTs (last 5 observed: P30 LT2, P31 LT1, P25 LT2, P23 LT3, P21 LT2 avg=2.0) match promised. Use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor post-decline regime (length=4, N=max(min(4,20),3)=4), recent_N N=5 for L (recent avg LT=2.0); boosts base_stock appropriately for unreliable pipeline/service while recent low mean/volatility curbs overstock vs holding cost ($1 vs profit $4).

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019/10/07), fall post-summer for women's t-shirt: demand regime post-P30 decline sustained P30-P34 (114,87,103,112,83) avg 99.8 vs summer P19-P29 avg140 (-29%), regime_length=5 confirmed with no reversal. On-hand=256 (covers ~2.5 periods at 100/d), in-transit=718 but carry-over flags ~600 ancient lost/overstated (e.g. P26=162u, P29=94u >5pd overdue past expected LT2 arrivals), no arrivals P33-P34 sustains lost pattern causing future shortfalls despite overstated pipeline subtraction. Reconcile: recent reliable arrivals P32 (P30 LT2=179u, P31 LT1=375u); overdue add uncertainty. Compensate by L explicit=3 (effective LT>promised2 per LT=3 obs P23->P26, sustained delays/losses inflate coverage to 4 periods). mu_hat recent_N=5 for post-changepoint regime (N=max(min(5,20),3)=5, backend (1+3)*99.8~400). sigma_hat recent_N=5 (backend sqrt(4)*~14.2~28). Higher base_stock target ~400 + 0.84*28~424 counters ghost pipeline underordering, balances service vs holding amid high inv but loss risks.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer decline extended P30-P34 avg99.8 vs P19-P29 avg140 (-29%), sustained 5 periods confirming fall t-shirt drop; Lost shipment pattern sustained: no arrivals P33-P34 (2pd), P29(94u) overdue 5pd past expected P31 LT2, ancient unresolved ~600u total overstated pipeline sustained

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019/10/14): Mid-fall, women's basic t-shirt demand in post-summer decline regime sustained P30-P35 avg 93.8 (114,87,103,112,83,64) vs summer peak P19-P29 avg ~140 (-33%), with P35=64 signaling further drop toward winter lows (~50 from early 2019 samples). On-hand 192 covers ~2-3 periods at ~70 forecast; in-transit 718 severely overstated by sustained lost shipments (~600 ancient P1/P3/P4/P10/P13/P17 etc. + recent P26 162u overdue 8pd past P28 expected LT2, P29 94u overdue 6pd past P31 LT2), effective reliable pipeline ~0-100, risking stockouts P38+. Recent LTs avg ~1.9 (calculate), but losses dominate.

Reconcile: actual pipeline likely ~300u after losses; backend unaware, sees high pipeline, underorders. Bridge via explicit L=20 (effective LT inflated due to sustained losses/delays >promised 2) + recent_N=7 (regime length 7>=3, changepoint P30 confirmed by 7 consistent lower-demand periods vs summer) for mu_hat/sigma_hat: scales mu_hat~21*91.9=1932, sigma_hat~sqrt(21)*18.4~84; base_stock>>949 pipeline forcing order=cap~92+1.645*18.4~122 (recent-demand level), balancing service vs holding by modest ordering to rebuild true pipeline proactively.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019/10/28): Late fall/winter, Nora women's t-shirt in post-summer demand decline regime confirmed P30-P37 avg91.4 (8 periods, -35% vs P19-P29 peak avg140), recent P35-37:64/80/88 stabilizing low ~80. On-hand=24 low vs ~90 demand (stockout risk), but in-transit=960 massively overstated due to sustained lost shipments (no arrivals P33-P37=5 consec periods; ancient ~600u + recent overdue like P26/P29 unresolved). Reconcile: actual arriving pipeline near-zero despite 984 total; urgent order needed. Observed LTs recent avg~2 (e.g., P30:2,P31:1,P25:2,P23:3,P22:1) but losses equiv to infinite LT. Set L=explicit 10 to buffer 11 periods demand, yielding mu_hat~(11*91.4)=1005 + z*sigma~1050 >984 pipeline forcing order>0 up to cap~95. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=8 (regime_length=8>=3, changepoint P30 sustained decline evidence: post-summer avg91.4<<peak140). This inflates base_stock to overcome fake pipeline, balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding by capping, anticipates continued low demand/no near arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer decline extended P30-P37 avg91.4 vs P19-P29 avg140 (-35%), sustained 8 periods confirming fall/winter t-shirt drop; Lost shipment pattern worsening: no arrivals P33-P37 (5 consecutive periods), P36(119u)/P37(123u) approaching overdue per pattern, total overstated pipeline 960u (+242u) with ancient ~600u unresolved

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=98 covers ~1-2 periods at ~60 demand; pipeline=906 severely overstated per sustained lost pattern (ancient ~600u unresolved + recent overdue e.g. P36 119u past expected P38 LT2, P26/P29 etc.); recent arrivals sporadic (P38 only LT1 P37 123u, prior gap P33-P37). Reconcile: effective position low due to losses, risk stockout despite apparent high pipeline. L=calculate (all 15 observed LTs avg1.67: 6x1,8x2,1x3); mu_hat=recent_N N=9 (regime length=9 since P30 changepoint, avg86.7); sigma_hat=explicit 900 (inflated vol proxy for lost shipment uncertainty/supply risk, adds ~756 buffer z*sigma to base_stock~243+756=999\u2248pipeline, enables small order ~90 to rebuild vs phantom pipeline while capping overorder; cap ample ~580). Balances low winter demand (low mu) vs high uncertainty/high holding via inflated safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer decline extended/deepening P30-P38 avg86.7 vs P19-P29 avg140 (-38%), sustained 9 periods with P38=49 confirming winter t-shirt drop; Lost shipment pattern sustained: P36(119u) overdue 1pd past expected P38 LT2 (absent from P38 arr), ancient ~600u unresolved, total overstated pipeline 906u despite P38 LT1 arrival

On-hand 156 covers ~2 periods at recent demand ~70; in-transit 801 severely overstated (~600u ancient losses like P1/3/4/26/29 unresolved + pattern), recent partial arrivals (P36 LT3 arr P39 119u, P37 LT1 arr P38 123u) but sustained losses require higher base_stock. Recent LTs variable 1-3 (e.g. P36 LT3, P37 LT1, P23 LT3), avg~1.8-2 but effective >2 due to losses/delays. Set L explicit 3 to extend (1+L)=4 period horizon, counter overstated pipeline, boost base_stock. mu_hat recent_10 captures low regime mean ~84*(1+3)=336. sigma_hat recent_10 for recent vol ~std(P30-P39)~25*sqrt(4)~50, balances high service q=4/5 vs holding amid unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand winter low sustained/deepened P30-P39 avg84 vs summer peak140 (-40%), 10 periods confirm fall/winter t-shirt drop; Lost shipment pattern sustained: ancient ~600u unresolved, recent overdues persist (e.g. P26 162u >11pd past expected P28); Recent LT variability 1-3 confirmed (P36 LT3 arr P39, P37 LT1 arr P38)

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019/11/18): deep winter for women's basic t-shirt, demand drop sustained P30-P40 avg~79 but deepening changepoint at P38: P38-P40 demands 49/61/28 avg46 vs P30-P37 avg~90 (-49%), 3 periods confirm deep winter low regime. On-hand 128 covers ~3 periods at ~46 dmd; in-transit 801 overstated by ancient lost ~600u + recent e.g. P38(69u) overdue past expected P40 LT2 (no P40 arr), actual position ~329 > needed base~150. Recent LT obs: P39 LT3(P36), P38 LT1(P37), P32 LT2(P30)/1(P31) \u2192 last 4 avg1.75.

On-hand 95 covers ~2 periods low demand; in-transit 787 overstated (~600u ancient lost + P38 69u overdue 2pd past P40 LT2 expected, P26/P29 etc. sustained lost), effective pipeline lower prompting need for higher base_stock. Recent LTs (last 4 observed arrivals: P41 LT2, P39 LT3, P38 LT1, P32 LT2) avg 2 confirms variability 1-3. Use recent_N N=4 across params: mu_hat~(1+~2)*46.25=139, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*13.6~23.6 (std P38-P41=13.6); boosts base_stock~139+0.84*24~167 vs pipeline (effective <787), counters overstatement/losses while matching low regime to minimize holding on low sales (~$4*46-$1*inv).

On-hand 31 low vs ~50pd demand risk; in-transit 787 severely overstated (~600u ancient unresolved + recent e.g. P38 69u overdue 3pd past expected P40 LT2, no P40-P42 arr). Recent LT obs P38=1, P39=3, P41=2 avg=2. To bridge OR's unawareness of losses/overstated pipeline (total ~818), explicitly inflate mu_hat=850 (~3pd equiv 283pd pretending high demand), sigma_hat=225 (high vol pretend) yielding base_stock~850+0.84*225~1040 >818 targeting ~220 order-up (min'd by cap~497 w/L=2); L recent_N N=3 avg2 confirmed.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019/12/9): Deep winter for women's basic t-shirt, pre-Christmas but no demand spike expected; recent demand P38-P43 avg 44.3 (49,61,28,47,64,17), std 18.5, deepening low confirmed P43=17, sustained 6pd regime shift since P38 (-52% vs P30-P37 avg91). Lost shipments sustained (ancient ~600u + P38 69u overdue 5pd past P40 LT2 no arr P40-P43, P29 94u etc.), overstated transit ~800u, fake IP=1023 vs real ~14+~250(P43 222 pending)=~264.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16, mid-December near Christmas): Nora women's t-shirt in deep winter low demand regime (basics unlikely to spike for holidays given recent P40-44 demands 28,47,64,17,17 avg 34.6); on-hand=0, in-transit=1237 overstated (~600u ancient lost + recent overdues e.g. P38 69u >5pd past expected P40 LT2, no P40-P44 arr for it); lost pattern sustained (no arr P40,P42-P44, 4/ recent pd gaps), recent LT var 1-3 avg~2 (e.g. last7 observed: LT2,1,3,1,2,2,3).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019/12/23): Pre-Christmas week, t-shirt demand remains ultra-low in deep winter/holiday (P43-45:17,17,21 avg18.3, -63% vs P38-P42 winter avg49.8), sustained drop confirmed; no holiday spike expected for winter apparel like t-shirts. On-hand 201 covers ~10 periods at recent ~20/wk demand; in-transit 1015 heavily overstated (~600u ancient lost + P38 69u >6pd overdue past P40 expected LT2, others); effective pipeline much lower risking future stockouts despite appearance. High position (1216) ensures order~0 this period. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to anchor low demand/vol (mean~18, low std~2) across (1+L)~3 periods, minimizing overstock/holding. recent_N=5 for L (recent LTs: P45:2,P41:2,P39:3,P38:1,P32 LT1/2 \u2192 avg~1.8-2, variability but no new shift); adjusts base_stock conservatively higher than promised-only while bridging losses by inflating coverage periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: P43-P45 avg18.3 vs P38-P42 avg49.8 (-63%), sustained 3 periods confirming ultra-low holiday/deep winter t-shirt demand; Lost shipment pattern sustained/worsening: P38(69u) overdue 6pd past expected P40 LT2 (no P40-P45 arr), ancient ~600u unresolved, total overstated pipeline ~1015u

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): End-of-year holidays/New Year's, women's t-shirt demand ultra-low in deep winter/holiday regime. Recent demands P43-P46: 17,17,21,15 (avg 17.5, std~2.1), -64% vs P38-P42 avg49.8, sustained 4 periods confirming changepoint at P43. On-hand 186 sufficient for ~10 periods at 20/wk (~$186 holding cost vs ~$80 profit), in-transit 1015 overstated (~600u ancient lost + P44 228u overdue past expected P46 LT2 no-arrival + others). Recent LTs: P45 LT2, P41 LT2, P39 LT3, P38 LT1 (last 4 obs avg=2.0). No need to order (base_stock low << pipeline to yield order=0, minimizing added holding); parameters use recent_N N=4 to capture low demand/vol regime (mu_hat~(1+2)*17.5=52.5, sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*2.1~3.6, base_stock~52.5+0.84*3.6~56) and LT=2, balancing low service need vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift extended at Period 46: P43-P46 avg17.5 vs P38-P42 avg49.8 (-64%), sustained 4 periods confirming ultra-low holiday/deep winter t-shirt demand; Lost shipment pattern sustained/worsening: no P46 arrival (P44 228u overdue past expected P46 LT2), total overstated pipeline 1015u with ancient ~600u unresolved
