{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent arrivals confirm variable LT=2-3 periods (e.g., P46 no arrival; P45: P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2; P43: P40 LT=3, P41 LT=2), but carry-overs highlight persistent lost shipments pattern (total ~1162 units ghost inventory previously matching in-transit; current 982 likely similar unreliable). Do not expect meaningful pipeline inflows. Inventory analysis: On-hand=240 sufficient for 12+ periods at recent winter low demand avg ~17 (P43-46: 17,17,21,15); no stockout risk despite ghost in-transit. Demand analysis: Date 2019/12/30 end-of-year winter trough for t-shirts (women's basics), no holiday surge expected (post-Christmas lull); sustained lows P40-46 avg ~22 confirm deep decline (-77% vs summer peak), aligns with seasonal calendar (cold Dec weather suppresses t-shirt demand). OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and full history (ignores losses/seasonality), but baseline matches reality given high OH and low mu_hat from recent data. Strategy: Follow OR at 0 - no need to order, avoid adding to holding costs; high OH buffers any minor arrivals or demand uptick.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - on-hand 240 covers 12+ periods of confirmed low winter t-shirt demand (~17 avg P43-46), unreliable ghost pipeline (982 units likely lost) eliminates need to order.",
