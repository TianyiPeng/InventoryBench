{
  "rationale": "(a) World knowledge/product: CARINA HIGH SUPPORT BRA (H&M Sport ladies sports bra, functional fitness underwear). Period 47 date 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas Monday, end-of-year week). Holiday shopping peaks past (BF 11/25 P42, pre-Xmas 12/16 P45, Xmas 12/23 P46), but New Year's fitness resolutions drive sports/fitness apparel demand surge into early Jan (historical Jan samples avg~68: 81/48/71/68/74). Product matches fitness season boost.\n(b) Demand regime: Pre-holiday low volatile ~28 avg P30-P41 sustained. Holiday/fitness spike P42-P46: demands 123/22/9/211/185 (avg110, peaks BF/pre-Xmas/Xmas), +290% vs prior low, volatile high sustained 5pd (carry-over P42-P45 avg167 confirmed/extended). P47 post-Xmas likely transitional drop but NY fitness sustains elevated ~80-120 (vs summer lows), risk peaks 150+.\n(c) Lead time/missing: Promised LT=2, actual variable 1-3 (recent: P40 LT3, P39 LT2, P37 LT1, P27 LT3). In-transit 1170 = confirmed lost ~930 (P1/3/4:210ea, P10/29/38:120/120/60; per carry-over) + P44:60 overdue (placed P44 exp P46 LT2, absent P46 conclude) + P46:180 recent (exp P48 LT2, possible LT1 P47 ~20% recent). No reliable arrivals imminent; chronic loss pattern (~70% orders lost long-term).\n(d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout P46, lost ~99 sales @185 demand). Pipeline 1170 ineffective (99% lost/delayed); effective near-term supply=0. Covers 0 periods demand.\n(e) Order logic: Forecast ~100/period x (LT2+1)=300, but unreliable supply/losses require aggressive replenishment + safety for peaks/NY fitness. Order 180 matches recent high demand avg/peaks, recent order size (P46), balances stockout risk (4profit lost >>1holding); builds buffer vs chronic losses.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand spike regime extended P42-P46 avg110 (+290% prior low avg38), sustained 5 periods volatile high peaks 123/211/185 matching BF/pre-Xmas/Xmas; P44 order (60 placed P44) lost (overdue 2 periods past LT=2 exp P46, absent P46 conclude consistent with loss pattern).",
