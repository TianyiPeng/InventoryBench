Promised LT=2 with historical variability (1-2), but irrelevant without new orders. Inventory position: On-hand=108 (covers ~15-18 periods at recent avg demand 6-7), ending P44=108 after demand=2; no pipeline to rely on. Demand analysis: Sustained very low stabilization P38-P44 avg ~6.5 (demands:6,6,8,6,6,8,2), with recent P42-P44 avg 5.3 (6,8,2) showing -27% drop vs P38-P41 ~7.3, no rebound into Christmas (P44 12/9 demand=2 despite holidays); product is long-sleeve airy cotton shirt/blouse \u2013 not typical hot Christmas gift, aligns with no winter/Thanksgiving/Christmas uptick observed over 7+ periods. Pre-game historical low ~10 irrelevant vs current regime. Calendar: P45=12/16, Christmas P46=12/23-Dec25, but no early signal of spike (P44=2), risk holding cost on excess but stockout risk low given inventory buffer. OR recommendation: 0 units, using historical mean (low now) and promised LT=2, aligns perfectly with reality (high on-hand, low demand regime, no pipeline). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - order 0 to avoid adding to high on-hand amid sustained low demand; buffer covers (L+1)=3 periods easily (18+ >3); monitor for potential late Christmas spike but no evidence yet warrants conservatism to minimize holding costs.",
