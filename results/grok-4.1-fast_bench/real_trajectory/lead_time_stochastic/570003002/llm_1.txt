Date 2019-02-11 (Monday, early February, post-Super Bowl Feb 3, during Chinese New Year Feb 5-15) unlikely to spike basic T-shirt sales significantly; possible minor holiday gifting but primarily staple item. Historical data (5 weeks Jan-Feb 2019: 35,53,41,57,52; avg 47.6, recent Feb4=52) supports consistent weekly demand ~45-55.\n(b) Demand regime stable: mean ~48, low variance (std~9), no evident shifts or seasonal patterns in provided history; forecast Period 1 demand ~48 based on historical average/recent trend.\n(c) No prior 'conclude' messages; promised lead time=2 periods untested. No in-transit or missing orders to assess.\n(d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 1 will fully stockout (demand after decision, no arrivals). First order arrives Period 3 (covers demand from Period 3 onward).\n(e) Order 50 units (rounded historical avg+recent bias) to arrive Period 3, matching ~1 period's expected demand upon arrival while minimizing initial overstock risk (profit=holding=1 balances sales vs. carry cost). Subsequent orders will pipeline to steady-state coverage for L+1=3 periods.",

  "rationale": "(a) Product is VICTOR SLIM VN T-SHIRT (men's basic V-neck cotton jersey T-shirt, upper body/underwear category). Year-round staple demand; historical early-year ~47 avg, summer peaks ~70 (P14-20), late summer decline to ~40 (P21-28 per carry-over), winter steady ~45-50 with pre-holiday spikes (P37=83 Oct21, P42=99 Nov25, P46=60 Dec23 pre-Christmas). Current P47=2019/12/30 (post-Christmas, pre-NY Eve): expect dip/steady ~40-50, no major T-shirt demand driver for NYE (not party/formal wear).\n(b) Demand regimes: summer uptrend P14-16 avg72 (+26% vs prior), late summer downtrend P21-26 avg52/-28%, late Aug further decline P25-27 avg39.7. Recent winter P39-46 avg49 (39/35/40/99/35/36/47/60), stable ~50 with holiday spikes; no new sustained shift (spikes not 3+ consistent periods).\n(c) LT variability 1-3 sustained (recent: P45 P42-LT3/P43-LT2; P43 P40-LT3/P41-LT2; P41 P39-LT2; P26 P23-LT3). Lost shipments pattern sustained (phantom in-transit ~1100u prior, now 950u); no recent orders (P44-46=0), last real arrivals P45 (P42/P43), no new losses/overdues to confirm; pipeline effectively 0 reliable units.\n(d) On-hand=383 (P46 end), ample for ~7-8 periods at 50/wk recent avg (P41-46 avg53). In-transit=950 phantom (no arrivals expected soon, pattern confirmed). No stockouts since P40; depleting slowly ~50/wk.\n(e) High on-hand covers LT=3 + safety (200-250u needed) with buffer vs spikes; order 0 avoids phantom risk/additional hold cost (profit=hold=$1, prioritizes sales from existing inv over excess). Reassess when on-hand <200.",
