  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent arrivals confirm lt=2-3 periods (P42 order arr P45 lt3, P43 arr P45 lt2, P41 arr P43 lt2, P39 arr P41 lt2); P46 conclude shows arrived=0 (expected if no orders from P44/P45 arriving then). Promised lt=2 holds recently, but historical lost shipments persist (in-transit ballooned at 937u, likely includes old lost orders). Inventory: On-hand=208 (enough for ~10 periods at recent 20u demand), in-transit=937u adds massive future supply despite losses. Demand analysis: Recent low and stable P40-46: demands 31,27,42,17,19,27,20 (avg~26u), confirming extended decline (-24% vs prior); date 2019/12/30 post-Christmas (P46 demand only 20u), no lingerie demand spike expected for New Year's (gift/post-holiday lull). OR rec=0 aligns with base-stock policy given high inventory vs low mu-hat. Strategy: Follow OR's 0 - no need to order amid excess coverage for 3+ periods (L+1=3), prioritize avoiding holding costs on ballooned pipeline.",
