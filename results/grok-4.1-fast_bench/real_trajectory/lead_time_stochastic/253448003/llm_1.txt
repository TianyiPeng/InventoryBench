(b) Demand: Sustained low fall regime persists per carry-over (P35-P42 avg~28-34, no pre-Christmas/BF uptick); recent P39-P43:25/31/27/42/17 (avg28.4, range17-42, P42=42 not sustained as P43=17 drops -60%, volatile low <40 majority). No confirmed holiday acceleration (1/5 periods >40). Forecast P44~25-40 conservative, possible ramp but unconfirmed. (c) Lead-time/missing: Variable LT=1-3 confirmed (e.g., P40\u2192P43 LT3, P31\u2192P32 LT1); sustained losses (P29=250, P26=150, P24=250 etc., many 3+ overdue no conclude). Recent no orders P41-P43 (0), P40 arrived P43; IT=1850 implies delayed pre-P40 shipments (LT>3?) or system-tracked pending despite losses. No new LT/loss confirms. (d) Inventory/pipeline: OH=529 (~15-20 periods at 25-35/demand); IT=1850 massive buffer (covers 50+ periods even if 50% lost per pattern); total supply >> remaining 4 periods (44-47). Post-P43: start P44 w/529 OH + pending IT arrivals. (e) Order: 0 units. Ample coverage avoids adding to high holding exposure ($1/u/p, 4 periods left); prioritize drawdown pipeline amid unconfirmed demand uptick/low regime. Service risk nil.",

Date 2019/12/16 (Mon), pre-Christmas (Dec25) in Australia - calendar expects holiday retail spike for gifts/lingerie, but historical data shows no uptick through early Dec (P42 Nov25=42 slight rise, but P43 Dec2=17/P44 Dec9=19 low). (b) Demand regime sustained low: P35-P44 (10 periods) avg 27.6 (range 17-42, stable <45), extending fall low regime (-40% vs hist avg44); recent P42-P44 avg 26 no sustained increase or Christmas acceleration evident despite calendar. Forecast ~30/period conservative. (c) LT variable (1-3 observed, recent P40 order arrived P43 LT=3); lost pattern historical but recent P40 arrived; no new orders since P40 so no expected arrivals soon; in-transit 1850 likely accumulated lost historical orders (no conclude ever), not imminent supply. (d) On-hand 510 covers 3 remaining periods (~45,46,47) at 30/wk forecast (90 total, end ~420) or even 100/wk spike (300 total, end ~210); massive in-transit inert (lost). High on-hand risks holding costs ($1/unit/period accumulating to end). (e) Order 0: ample coverage vs low sustained demand regime, avoids exacerbating high ending inv holding penalties late-game; monitor for spike but no evidence justifies adding pipeline amid LT/loss risks.",
