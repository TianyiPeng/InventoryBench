No new losses confirmed in P45 (both expected partially arrived late/on-time); historical in-transit 1170 unreliable (prior ~1020u lost), but assume ~50% arrival rate conservatively \u2192 ~500-600u expected over next 2-3 periods from P44/P45 250u each + others. Inventory analysis: On-hand 514 ample for 3+ periods at recent avg79 or holiday peak 150-200; ending P45=514 after demand=87.

Inventory analysis: On-hand 470u (post-P46 demand 44u, ending from 514u), ample for multiple periods even at elevated ~80u demand; total position ~1640u but effective much lower due to losses. Demand analysis: Post-Christmas (2019/12/30), lingerie demand likely drops sharply after holiday surge/gift peak (historical early-year ~45u, P1-P5 avg~47u); recent P43-P46 (Dec weeks) avg~70u (-53% vs P36-P42 holiday ~150u), with P46=44u confirming dip continuation into Christmas week; no surge expected now, risk of further decline into Jan. OR recommendation: 0u, based on promised LT=2 and full history (empirical mean low due to pre-surge data), aligns well with high on-hand, unreliable pipeline, and post-holiday outlook.
