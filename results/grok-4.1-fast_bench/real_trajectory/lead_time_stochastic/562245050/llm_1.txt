(d) Inv & pipeline: OH=83 covers 1-2 periods (~40) or partial holiday; transit=1985 huge/unreliable (past backlogs/losses) but recent arrivals P43=150u, P41=120u; expected P45: P43(150) LT2 + P42(80) LT3 ~230; P46: P44(100) LT2 + P43 LT3 etc.; ample coverage despite risks. (e) Order logic: OH83 + exp P45 arr~230 yields ~313 start P45 (>130 demand); pipeline covers P46-47; near endgame (45/47), order minimal new units to limit added holding/backlog (transit already excessive, net cost if excess post-P47); target ~80 for avg demand 2-3 periods ahead balancing spike risk vs holding=profit.",

Date 2019/12/23: Christmas week (Mon pre-Dec25), major holiday retail peak for clothing/gifts/outfits; expect demand spike (similar to P42 Thanksgiving 130 vs avg~40). Winter relevant but jeans versatile. Historical Jan~70 avg supports moderate winter base + holiday lift to 100-150+ forecast vs recent 30-40. (b) Demand: Stable low regime P43-45 avg34 (30/37/36), extending fall low (P34-36 avg39); no sustained shift (stable, not down), but calendar anticipates holiday upward break unconfirmed. (c) Lead time/missing: LT=2-3 sustained recent (P40 LT3@P43, P41 LT2@P43, P42 LT3@P45, P43 LT2@P45); no new losses (recent orders arriving); intermittent arrivals (P44=0, but P43/45 yes); huge transit 1835 likely includes delayed but expect some P46 (e.g. P44 order100 LT2). (d) Inventory/pipeline: OH=277 covers 7+ low-demand periods or 2 holiday-spike (150); transit=1835 massive buffer overrides LT risk. Expected: P44(100) poss P46 LT2 + backlog trickle. (e) Order 120: Matches holiday forecast (base40 + holiday~3x), replenishes pipeline for P48-49 arrival post-Christmas/NewYear; balances stockout risk (holiday upside) vs holding with ample current buffer (profit=holding neutralizes marginal cost).",
