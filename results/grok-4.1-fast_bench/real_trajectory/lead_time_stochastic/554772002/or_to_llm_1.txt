Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=48 covers 3+ periods of recent low demand (~15 avg P41-P45: 20,33,8,10,14); in-transit=790 bloated by historical losses (~790u cumulative per carry-over), but effective pipeline low/reliable via LT=2 pattern - no imminent stockout risk. Demand analysis: Sustained deep winter taper for T-shirts (13+ periods from P29, recent P41-P45 avg~17 with volatility but no regime shift); date 2019/12/23 (pre-Christmas) unlikely to spike basic jersey T-shirt demand (holiday favors warmer/gift items, prior Thanksgiving P42=33 not repeated). Historical initial ~69 irrelevant vs. confirmed seasonal low. OR recommendation: 0 units aligns with low \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 from full history + high effective inventory position. Strategy: Follow OR exactly - order 0 to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) on ample coverage; monitor P46 demand for any unexpected holiday effect next period.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent arrivals confirm LT=2 sustained (P43 arrive P41 order LT=2; P45 arrive P43 LT=2); no new concludes show deviations or losses in P44-P46 (arrived=0 or expected). Cumulative lost shipments ~790u bloat in-transit, but effective pipeline reliable at LT=2 for recent orders (P41/43 arrived); ignore bloated in-transit for forecasting. Inventory: On-hand=34 (from P46 end), covers ~2-3 periods at recent avg demand ~15 (P41-46: 20,33,8,10,14,14 avg16.5). No imminent stockout. Demand analysis: Deep winter taper for T-shirts confirmed into late Dec (P41-P46 sustains prior 13-period low avg~20, post-Thanksgiving volatility not repeating upward; P46=14 continues low). Date 2019/12/30 (New Year's Eve) unlikely to spike T-shirt demand (cold weather, indoor focus). Historical initial ~69 irrelevant vs sustained seasonal low. OR rec=0 aligns perfectly: low \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 from history drives base-stock near pipeline+on-hand; cap irrelevant at 0. Strategy: Follow OR 0 - no override needed; excess on-hand risks holding cost $1/u/p, low profit risk at $4/u given demand outlook. Order 0 preserves reward.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - sustained winter low demand avg ~16/period over P41-P46 with on-hand 34 covering 2+ periods; recent LT=2 reliable but supplier loss history and no demand uptick justify no ordering.",
