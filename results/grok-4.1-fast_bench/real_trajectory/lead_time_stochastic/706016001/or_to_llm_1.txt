{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed variable LT=1-3 periods from recent concludes (e.g., P45: P42 order LT=3, P43 LT=2; prior examples like P36 LT=3). Promised LT=2, but delays common; recent holiday orders (P42, P43) arrived eventually LT=2-3, suggesting delays rather than permanent losses for recent shipments (challenges prior 'lost' assumptions for P42). No new concludes indicate fresh losses. Pipeline: On-hand 1943 + in-transit 10229 (includes old presumed-lost ~10k, but recent 2000+ expected: P44 order 2000 LT=2 arrives P46, P45 2000 possibly LT=1-2 in P46/P47). Inventory position ~12k covers 3+ periods even at holiday peaks. Demand analysis: Recent P43-P45 avg 670 (674/680/657), stable high +15% vs Nov avg ~584 (carry-over), confirming sustained holiday elevation into late Dec (3 periods); P42 BF surge 3100 outlier, but Christmas Eve P46 (2019-12-23) risks similar peak (~2000-3000) for skinny jeans (holiday gifting/outfits). Historical early-year ~650-700 aligns with non-holiday base, but seasonality drives surges. OR rec 0: Uses promised LT=2 + full history (ignores recent high demand, seasonality, delays); base-stock covered by perceived pipeline/on-hand. Strategy: Follow OR 0 - position ample for P46-48 demand outlook (670-3000/period x3=~5k max needed); ordering more risks excess holding on already-high effective stock post-expected P46 arrivals (~4000+), while profit 19x vs holding 1x favors avoiding overstock but losses prevented by buffer. No override needed as seasonality covered by current pipeline.",

Inventory position: On-hand 1468 (from P46 ending), ample buffer; covers 2-3+ periods even at 500-600 demand. Demand analysis: Holiday surge peaked P42=3100 (Black Friday/early Dec), stable high ~670 avg P43-P45 (+15% vs Nov 584), but P46=475 signals post-Christmas decline (-29% vs P43-P45 avg), aligning with apparel calendar (post-Dec 25 drop-off into New Year's, low seasonal demand for jeans).
