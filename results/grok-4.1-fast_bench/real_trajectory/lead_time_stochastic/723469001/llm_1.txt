Date 2019/12/16 (Mon), week of Dec16-22 pre-Christmas (Dec25); peak gift-buying season for lingerie/underwear likely drives demand uplift (historical holiday ramp P37-P42 avg~77 +70% vs prior lows). (b) Demand: Holiday uplift P37-P42 avg77 sustained 6p per carry-over, but recent drop P43-P44 avg26 (-66% vs uplift); sub-50 regime P40-P44 avg47 (5p); potential Christmas spike imminent outweighs recent lull, forecast P45 ~80-120 rising. Long-term avg~80, summer peak~190, post-peak drop~90s now holiday. (c) Lead-time/missing: Variable L=1-3 sustained; recent arrivals P41-P43 but P44 none (P42:150u overdue L2=P44, poss L3=P45); P43:200u expected L2=P45; historical losses heavy (910u+), resumption fragile; in-transit 2000 likely mix overdue/lost. (d) Inventory/pipeline: Start P45 on-hand=367 (high, covers ~4wks@avg90); in-transit=2000 (no holding cost, poss losses); poss arrivals P45: P42(150 L3)+P43(200 L2)=350; total supply >> demand horizon. (e) Order logic: Endgame (45/47), oversupply (2367+ total vs ~300-400 remaining demand); minimize holding on 367+expected arrivals; order 0, let pipeline cover holiday spike/service.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand uplift broken P43-P44 avg26 (-66% vs P37-P42 avg77, 2p evidence; not sustained); no arrivals P44 extends drought 1p (P42:150u overdue past L2)",

  "rationale": "(a) Product is women's push-up bras/lingerie (Kelly 2pk), gift-relevant for Christmas (Dec 25, 2019/12/23 is peak pre-holiday week; expect gifting spike like prior Mother's Day +70% or summer highs 150-230). Australian summer holidays boost lingerie demand. (b) Demand regimes: High sustained P16-P21 avg190; post-peak drop P22-P31 avg92; recent low P43-P44 avg26 (-66% vs holiday uplift P37-P42 avg77), P45=63 (+174% vs P44 but single period, not sustained; pre-Xmas ramp possible, forecast 150-250 for P46 based on calendar + prior spikes). Historical early-year low ~50-80. (c) Lead time variable L=1-3 (recent: P42->P45 L3, P43->P45 L2, P40->P43 L3, P41->P43 L2, P39->P41 L2); losses sustained historically (910u+ lost prior) but arrivals resumed P41-P45 (no new misses confirmed); in-transit 1650 suggests pipeline but overdue risks (e.g., P44=0). No new L inference from P45. (d) On-hand 654 covers 3-4 periods even at 150-200 demand; in-transit 1650 (likely P44+ priors arriving L2-3 in P46-P48) ample pipeline vs. expected holiday demand; high holding risk ($1/u/p) on excess. (e) Order 0: Inventory buffers P46+ demand (654 > forecast); avoid adding to bloated pipeline/holdings amid variable L/losses; monitor post-Xmas drop.",

  "rationale": "(a) World/Product: Women's push-up bras/lingerie. 2019/12/30: Post-Christmas (12/25 passed), NYE eve (12/31). Lingerie demand typically lulls post-holidays (gift returns/NYE outfits minor); aligns recent P44 low(23), pre-Xmas ramp P45-46(63,65 avg64). No major uplift expected vs normal ~50-70.

Long-term post-peak drop P22+ ~90-100 superseded holidays; forecast P47 ~60 (conservative recent avg, no sustained holiday tail). (c) Lead-time/Missing: Recent mixed L=2(P43->45,etc)/3(P42->45); P46 arr=0 normal (post-decision). Recent deliveries resumed (P39-43 arrived), losses easing per prior; in-transit 1650 likely old overdues (pattern known). No new overdue confirmations. (d) Inv/Pipeline: On-hand 589 (~10p at 60/d), in-transit 1650 (ample even w/ losses); recent arr P45 added 350, covers far ahead. (e) Order: Excess stock + pipeline >> forecast*3-4p lead buffer.
