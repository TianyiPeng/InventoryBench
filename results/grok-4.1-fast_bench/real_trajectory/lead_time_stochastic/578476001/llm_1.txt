Forecast P45 ~130-180 (holiday peak anticipation). (c) Lead-time: Recent LT=1-3 reliable sustained (e.g., P40 LT3/P41 LT2 in P43, prior P27-P36); selective lost pattern persists (e.g., P38 lost per carry-over); P42(240 exp LT2=P44 absent), P43(240 exp LT2=P45 pending), P44(240 exp LT2=P46 pending)\u2014no new losses confirmed beyond existing pattern.

Expected P45 arrivals: potentially P42 LT3/P43 LT2 (+480), further bloating OH. (e) Order 0: Pipeline excess covers P45-P47+ (even partial arrivals suffice); adding risks more holding/unsold at end (R_t penalizes ending inv); prioritize sell-through over replenishment in holiday volatile/high-inv state.",
