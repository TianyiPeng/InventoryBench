Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Chronic supplier lost/delay pattern confirmed in carry-over (e.g., P34, P38, P42 orders lost after 3-6p past LT=2; recent P46 conclude shows arrived=0, consistent with delays on recent orders like P44/P45). In-transit 1153 units include chronically delayed old orders (P1/P3/P13 etc.) effectively lost for planning, plus recent pipeline arriving sporadically after 1-3 periods. Inventory analysis: On-hand 662 + massive 1153 in-transit provides ~18 periods coverage at recent avg demand ~100 (P33-46 avg ~140, but P43=72/P46=79 dips); ending inv will incur high holding costs ($1/u/p), no stockout risk. Demand analysis: High regime sustained P33-46 into late Dec (pre-Christmas avg146 P33-44), but P46=79 (post-Christmas week 12/23-12/30) shows ~40% dip vs P45=125; end-of-year/New Year's unlikely to spike trouser demand (women's slim stretch trousers more fall/winter/back-to-school, not holiday party); possible post-holiday taper emerging but not sustained 3+ periods (prior dips like P43=72 not shifted regime). OR rec=0 uses promised LT=2 and full history (ignores regime shifts/losses), but aligns perfectly with excess inventory and softening outlook. Strategy: Order 0 to minimize holding costs, rely on pipeline/on-hand; monitor P47 demand and P48 conclude for taper confirmation.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR's 0 units recommendation - on-hand 662 + 1153 in-transit covers 15+ periods at ~100 demand; post-Christmas P46 demand dipped to 79 signaling potential taper, no need to risk more holding costs amid chronic supplier losses.",
