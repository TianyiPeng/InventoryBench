Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019/2/11): First period, no prior orders or conclude messages. Women's trousers, early Feb post-holiday season, no major events imminent (Valentine's minor impact expected). Historical demands: 59,59,54,63,78 (mean~62.6, std~8.1), slight uptick in last sample but not sustained (1 period). No changepoints or lead time data. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use defaults: backend computes mu_hat=(1+2)*62.6\u2248188, sigma_hat=sqrt(3)*8.1\u224814, balancing service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding with promised L=2. Covers ~3 periods demand safely.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019/2/18), women's slim trousers. Recent demand: Period 1=72, prior historical Feb 4=78, Jan 28=63 (last 3: mean 71, up ~24% from early Jan mean 57). Possible winter/post-Valentine steady demand around 70-75. No arrivals observed yet (Period 1 conclude: arrived=0, expected). In-transit=78 from Period 1 order, expected to arrive during Period 3 (L=2), visible Period 4. On-hand=0, likely stockout in Period 2. No lead times observed, use default L=2. Use recent_3 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent higher mean/variance regime (changepoint ~late Jan, sustained 3 periods: 63,78,72), informing backend (1+2)*71\u2248213 base demand over review+lead, balancing higher service (q=0.8) vs holding amid stockouts. Pipeline=78 partially covers post-arrival demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift late Jan/early Feb: last 3 periods (2019-01-28:63, 02-04:78, Period1:72) avg 71 vs first 3 (59,59,54) avg 57 (+24%)

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25): Women's skinny trousers, late winter, no immediate holidays but carry-over confirms demand regime shift late Jan/early Feb to higher avg ~71 (63,78,72), now sustained with Period 2 demand=80 (last 4: 63,78,72,80 avg 73.25, +24-30% vs early 57). On-hand=0, in-transit=162 (P1 order 78 + P2 84), no arrivals yet as expected (P1 order due during P3 if L=2, visible P4). No lead time observations (no 'arrived' with details). Use default L=2 (promised). recent_N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained high-demand regime (regime_length=4 >=3), informing backend base_stock for (1+2)=3 periods ahead: higher mu_hat targets ~220 mean demand, balancing q=4/5=0.8 service vs holding, while pipeline covers near-term.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4), early March, women's skinny trousers; post-winter steady demand expected, no major calendar events. High demand regime sustained: last 5 demands (1/28:63, 2/4:78, P1:72, P2:80, P3:73) avg 73.2 vs early avg ~57 (+28%). On-hand=0, stockouts continuing (demands 72+80+73=225 lost sales). In-transit=231 (P1:78+P2:84+P3:69). No arrivals in P1-P3 concludes; P1 order overdue past promised LT=2 (expected P3 arrive). No confirmed LTs yet (no 'arrived>0' messages). Use default L=2 (promised). mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_5 to capture sustained high mean/variance regime (std~6.5 recent vs ~2.5 early), yielding higher base_stock ~3*73=219 + safety, balancing service (avoid more lost sales) vs holding ($1/unit). Pipeline covers ~3 periods demand if arrives on time.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained 5+ periods (P1-P3 + prior 2): avg 73 (+28% vs early); P1 order overdue past LT=2

Daily Profit: $208.00, Daily Holding Cost: $32.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11, early March, women's skinny trousers): Post-Feb high demand period; sustained high regime (late Jan-P3: avg ~73, +28% vs early Jan ~57) per carry-over, but single-period drop P4 demand=52 (-29% vs prior avg 75), not yet sustained changepoint. No major calendar events imminent; possible end-of-winter peak. Inventory: on-hand=32 (covers <1 period at ~60-70 demand), in-transit=147 (P1:78 overdue > promised LT=2 - expected during P3 but P3/P4 concludes show no arrival from P1; likely lost per prolonged absence rule; P3:69 due during P5). Real position ~101 vs observed 179 (overstated by 78). Confirmed LT=2 (P2 order arrived P4). To bridge OR unawareness of lost orders/permanent pipeline inflation: explicit mu_hat = recent_5 mean 71*(1+2)=213 +78 lost adjustment=291 (raises base_stock ~78 compensating phantom inventory, balancing high q=0.8 service vs holding); sigma_hat recent_N=5 captures recent volatility (std~11 vs early ~4); L default=2 (sole observed LT=2). Ensures coverage despite delays/losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (78 units) likely lost: no conclude message despite 3+ periods past promised LT=2 (expected arrival during P3, absent in P3/P4 concludes); remains in-transit indefinitely.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019/3/18): Early spring, women's skinny trousers; recent demand drop post-Feb peak (P4=52, P5=55 avg 53.5 vs P1-P3 avg 75, -29%), possible end of winter demand regime, only 2 periods so not fully sustained. Inventory: on-hand=0 (stockout risk), in-transit=263 (P1:78 lost, P3:69 overdue past promised LT=2/absent P5 conclude, poss LT=3 arriving P6 or lost, P5:116 expected P7 if LT=2). Pipeline inflated by losses/delays (~147 units unreliable), OR will under-order; counter by explicit L=3 (bridging actual delays/losses beyond promised 2, only 1 confirmed LT=2). mu_hat recent_N=5 (N=5 from recent regime length>3 with high variance transition, mean66.4*(1+3)=265.6) for balanced forecast capturing drop. sigma_hat recent_N=5 (std~13.7*sqrt(4)~27.5) for elevated volatility. Higher L/mu/sigma boost base_stock >> inflated pipeline, prioritizing service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding despite recent low demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25), late March approaching Easter (Apr 21 ~4 periods away); women's spring trousers may see demand uptick, but recent changepoint P4-P6: demand dropped to avg 48 (52,55,37) vs P1-P3 avg 75 (-36%). Inventory: on-hand 79 covers ~2 periods at recent rate; in-transit 171 inflated by lost P1 (78) + likely lost P3 (69 overdue since expected P5 arrival, absent P5/P6 concludes), actual reliable pipeline ~24 (P6 order); effective IP ~103. Use calculate L (avg observed LTs= (2+1)/2=1.5 from P2/P5 orders) to reflect variability. EWMA_gamma=0.25 for mu_hat balances high historical mean (~62) with recent drop for (1+L)~2.5 period forecast ~150-170. Default sigma_hat adds safety vol from all data (~15) for z*sigma ~20-25, base_stock ~170-195 < overstated IP=250 so conservative order~0 now, but higher than recent_3 (~144+12=156) to hedge Easter spike/losses & prevent underorder despite inflated IP. Addresses losses by higher-than-recent params boosting base_stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to low starting Period 4: P4-P6 avg 48 (-36% vs P1-P3 avg 75), sustained 3 periods; P3 order (69 units) likely lost: no conclude by P6 (2 periods past expected LT=2 arrival in P5)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019/4/1, early spring): women's skinny trousers in low demand regime sustained P4-P7 (52,55,37,51; avg 48.75, -34% vs P1-P3 avg 75), no immediate calendar events but possible seasonal shift. On-hand=28 (risk stockout vs ~50 demand), in-transit=171 bloated by likely lost P1=78 (overdue 5+ periods past expected P3), P3=69 (overdue 3+ past P5), P6=24 pending but did not arrive P7 (arrived=0 in P7 conclude, ruling out LT=1 as with P5 order). Observed LTs: P2 order LT=2 (P4), P5 LT=1 (P6); avg=1.5. Use 'calculate' for L to reflect observed avg LT variability/loss risk. 'recent_N' N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (regime_length=4 >=3) to downweight early high-demand, forecast low mu~ (1+1.5)*49=122, low sigma~sqrt(2.5)*7=11; lowers base_stock/cap to curb overordering despite junk pipeline, balances high profit q=0.8 service vs holding amid unreliable supply.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019/4/8, early April pre-Easter 4/21); women's skinny trousers - possible minor spring/Easter uptick but no evidence yet. Demand: sustained low regime P4-P8 (52,55,37,51,42) avg 47.4 (-37% vs P1-P3 avg 75), hist avg 62.6. On-hand 10 low (risk stockout P9 demand~45), in-transit 147= lost P1(78)+P3(69) phantom pipeline (no conclude ever, overdue >3 periods past LT2). No orders P4/7/8=0, no arrivals due P9/P10. Reconcile: effective pipeline ~0, need order now. Use default mu_hat/sigma_hat (full hist+game ~13 samples mean~60 std~15 \u2192 L~2: mu~180 sigma~26 base~200>157 \u2192 order~43<cap~73) to force order despite low recent; recent_5 would base~153<157\u2192order=0 bad. L calculate (avg 3 observed LT 2(P2\u2192P4),1(P5\u2192P6),2(P6\u2192P8)=1.67) reflects actual LT for arrived orders, bridges unreliability w/ higher base.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times avg 1.67 (3 obs: P2\u2192P4 LT2, P5\u2192P6 LT1, P6\u2192P8 LT2); lost rate 40% (2/5 orders P1/P3 never arrived)

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15): Spring season for women's skinny trousers; demand low regime sustained P4-P9 (52,55,37,51,42,31 avg 44.7, -23% vs P1-P3 avg 75), further drop P8-P9 avg 36.5 confirms seasonal decline. On-hand 0 after P9 stockout (sold 10/31). In-transit 189 overstated by ~147 lost (P1:78 expected P3, P3:69 expected P5, no arrives by P9). Actual pipeline ~42 (P9 order). 3 observed LTs: P2-P4=2, P5-P6=1, P6-P8=2 avg 1.67. OR backend unaware of losses sees high pipeline, risks underordering (default L=2 mu~173<189\u2192order=0). Set L recent_3 (1.67) for accuracy. mu_hat explicit 240 (~90 pd equiv over ~2.67 pd, buffers ghosts/losses forcing base~253>189, orders~64 to cover ~2pd demand ~80 w/ safety). sigma_hat recent_6 captures low vol std~9.5 pd \u2192 sigma_hat~15.5, adds ~13 safety. Balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding despite ghosts.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime extended P4-P9 (6 periods avg 44.7 pd, -23% vs early; P8-P9 further -11% to 36.5); lost pattern sustained (P1/P3 no arrive 6+ pd past expected); LT observations stable avg 1.67 (no P9 arrive)

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22, day after Easter 2019/4/21): women's skinny trousers in spring post-holiday, low demand regime from P4 sustained (P4-P10 avg 41.3), with recent changepoint to very low at P8 (P8-P10 demands 42/31/21 avg 31.3, -36% vs P4-P7 avg 48.8). On-hand 21 covers ~1 period low demand; in-transit 212 overstated by lost P1(78)+P3(69)=147 (sustained pattern), +P10(65) pending (LT~1-2, possible arrive P11/P12). LT obs: 4 arrived orders LTs 2(P2->P4),1(P5->P6),2(P6->P8),1(P9->P10) avg1.5. Use L recent_4 (N=4) for accurate avg LT=1.5 < promised 2. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_3 (N=3, recent changepoint P8 regime len=3) to reflect very low demand/volatility, yielding lower base_stock despite overstated pipeline; this prevents excessive orders/holding costs given low sales and permanent lost pipeline inflation, while cap limits overage.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to very low starting Period 8: P8-P10 avg 31.3 (-36% vs P4-P7 avg 48.8), sustained 3 periods; Observed lead times avg 1.5 (4 obs: 2,1,2,1)

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29, late spring): women's skinny trousers in low seasonal demand phase. Recent demands P8-P11 (42,31,21,23) confirm very low regime avg 29.25 (-40% vs prior low P4-P7 avg 48.8), sustained 4 periods; earlier high demand (P1-P3 avg 75) irrelevant. On-hand 0, in-transit 212 = lost P1(78)+P3(69) + P10(65 pending; no P11 arrival so LT>1, poss LT=2 arriving during P12). Observed LTs stable last 4: 2(P2->P4),1(P5->P6),2(P6->P8),1(P9->P10) avg 1.5. Use recent_N N=4 for L (short avg LT), mu_hat/sigma_hat (low mean/vol for regime). Lowers base_stock vs default (high early mean), balances high service (q=4/5=0.8) vs holding amid losses/decline; expects low order-up-to given pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Very low demand regime sustained P8-P11 (4 periods avg 29.25, -40% vs P4-P7 avg 48.8); LT observations stable avg 1.5 (4 obs: 2,1,2,1)

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): Spring season for women's slim trousers; no major events imminent (Mother's Day ~May12 minor relevance). Very low demand regime sustained P8-P12 (42,31,21,23,28 avg=29, -40% vs P4-P7 avg48.8), no new changepoint (P12=28 fits). On-hand=0, pipeline=212 inflated by lost P1(78),P3(69),P10(65 no arr P12 conclude despite LT<=2 expected; now overdue). Observed LTs stable last 4: P2->P4(LT2),P5->P6(1),P6->P8(2),P9->P10(1) avg1.5. Actual incoming pipeline~0. Desired actual position~(1+1.5)*29 + ~0.84*13(safety)~73+11=84. To counter inflated pipeline w/o backend awareness, explicit mu_hat=300 targets backend base_stock~300 (order~300-212=88; actual position~88 covers need). L recent_4 for accurate avg1.5 (used in cap). Sigma recent_5 (low vol sqrt(2.5)*8.3~13). Ensures service vs holding balance, proactively covers losses/stockouts.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019/5/13): Mid-May, post-Mother's Day (5/12), women's skinny trousers in spring; demand very low as seasonal shift to summer apparel likely, recent P8-P13 demands (42,31,21,23,28,19) confirm sustained very low regime avg 27.3 (-40%+ vs early highs). On-hand=0, in-transit=313 includes likely lost P1(78),P3(69),P10(65 overdue 2+ pd past LT2 expected P12 arrive, absent P12/P13 concludes), effective pipeline only P13(101) expected ~P15. No arrivals P11-P13 concludes. Use recent_N N=6 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture low mean/volatility regime (regime_length=6 from P8 changepoint); recent_N N=4 for L (stable obs:2,1,2,1 avg1.5 < promised 2, no new obs); shorter L reduces base stock but aligns with observed faster arrivals despite losses; lowers overstock risk on low demand while high q=0.8 targets good service.

Carry-over insight: Very low demand regime extended P8-P13 (6 periods avg 27.3, sustained drop); P10 order (65 units) likely lost: no conclude despite 2+ periods past expected LT=2 (arrive P12, absent P12/P13 concludes); lost rate now ~50% (3/6 orders); LT observations stable avg 1.5 (4 obs:2,1,2,1)

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019/5/20): Late spring/early summer; women's skinny trousers face seasonal demand drop as warmer weather favors lighter apparel (Memorial Day ~1wk away unlikely boost). Very low demand regime sustained P8-P14 avg 25.9 (7pd), further decline P12-P14 avg21.3. On-hand=0, pipeline=313= P1:78(lost)+P3:69(lost)+P10:65(lost)+P13:101(pending, expected LT=2 arrive this pd but LT avg1.5 obs; no P14 arr suggests LT=2 for P13). Recent stockouts P12-14: demand64 sold=0, lost profit~$256. High lost rate~43% bloats pipeline (backend subtracts full 313, suppresses orders). Counter: explicit L=6 (effective LT extended by sustained losses/delays, obs LT=1.5 only for arrived). mu_hat/sigma_hat default leverage full hist mean~43/std~22 \u2192 base~(1+6)*43 +0.84*sqrt7*22 ~300+48=348>313 (order~35), capped ~43+1.64*22~78 (reasonable vs low regime, restarts supply vs permanent stockouts).

Carry-over insight: Very low demand regime extended P8-P14 (7 periods avg 25.9, -5% vs P8-P13); further decline pattern P12-P14 avg 21.3 (-24% vs P8-P11); P10 order (65 units) lost confirmed (absent thru P14, 3pd past expected LT=2); lost rate sustained ~43% (3/7 resolved orders); seasonal trousers demand low late May confirmed (P13-P14:19,17).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27, Memorial Day Monday - minor retail boost unlikely for women's trousers). Seasonal low demand for trousers confirmed late spring/early summer (P13-P15:19,17,14 avg16.7; P15=14 lowest). Very low regime P8-P15 (8pd avg24.4) sustained with further decline P12-P15 avg19.5 (-25% vs P8-P11 avg29.25), std~6pd. On-hand=0, in-transit=383 but lost=313 (P1:78, P3:69, P10:65, P13:101 confirmed lost - no arrive P14 LT1/P15 LT2, 3pd past avg LT1.5); effective pipeline~70 (P15:70 pending LT1 arrive possible P16). Recent LT stable avg1.5 (4 obs:2,1,2,1 no new). Stockouts P12-P15. Explicit L=1.5 matches recent avg. Explicit mu_hat=410 (~2.5pd x inflated 164pd mean accounting lost rate~50% + safety), sigma_hat=25 (inflated ~1.6x recent for loss/vol uncertainty). Yields base_stock~410+0.84*25=431>383 pipeline, order~48 (min(48, cap~410/2.5 +1.645*25/sqrt(2.5)~164+26=190)), replenishing ~2.4pd demand despite lost-inflated pipeline; high service q=0.8 balances lost sales vs holding.

Carry-over insight: P13 order (101 units) lost confirmed (absent P14-P15 concludes, 3pd past LT=1 exp P14, 2pd past LT=2 exp P15); Very low demand regime extended P8-P15 (8 periods avg 24.4, sustained); further decline P12-P15 avg 19.5 (-25% vs P8-P11 avg 29.25), sustained 4 periods; seasonal trousers demand low late May/early summer confirmed (P13-P15 avg 16.7)

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03): early June summer start, women's slim trousers demand seasonally minimal (P16:6, P13-P16 avg14). Ultra-low demand regime P13-P16 sustained 4pd avg14 (-52% vs P8-P12 avg29), further decline confirmed. On-hand=0 (recent stockouts), in-transit=432 bloated by ~313 ghost units from 50% lost rate (4/8 resolved: P1=78,P3=69,P10=65,P13=101 lost; pending P15=70,P16=49 ~119 expected). Observed LT stable avg1.5 (4 obs), but high sustained losses bloat pipeline permanently, suppressing orders. Bridge gap by explicit L=30 (inflates base_stock >> pipeline despite short observed LT, effective for unreliable supply); recent_N N=4 (regime_length=4) for mu_hat/sigma_hat captures ultra-low mean=14, std~5.72: backend mu_hat=31*14=434, sigma_hat~sqrt(31)*5.72~32, base~434+0.84*32~461>432, cap~14+1.645*5.72~23, order~23 (net ~11.5 exp at 50% loss matches demand, balances profit/holding).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to ultra-low starting Period 13: P13-P16 avg 14 (-52% vs P8-P12 avg 29), sustained 4 periods; P13 order (101 units) lost confirmed (absent P14-P16 concludes, 3pd past LT=2 exp P15); lost rate sustained ~50% (4/8 resolved orders); early June summer minimal trousers demand confirmed (P16:6).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019/6/10): Early June summer, minimal demand for women's slim trousers confirmed (seasonal low, P17 demand=8). Ultra-low regime P13-P17 sustained (demands 19,17,14,6,8 avg 12.8, -43% vs P8-P12 avg~29). LT observations stable: 6 arrived orders (LTs: P2-P4:2, P5-P6:1, P6-P8:2, P9-P10:1, P15-P17:2, P16-P17:1) avg 1.5. Lost sustained ~40% (P1:78, P3:69, P10:65, P13:101; inflate in-transit to 337, total position 448 >> needs). Recent vol low (last5 std~5.7). High excess inventory; low params ensure low base_stock~(2.5*12.8 + z*~14)=~45, minus pipeline\u2192order~0, cuts holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Ultra-low demand regime extended P13-P17 avg 12.8 sustained 5 periods; LT avg 1.5 stable (6 obs:2,1,2,1,2,1); lost rate ~40% sustained (4/10 orders lost)

On-hand 104 covers 10-15 periods; in-transit 337 inflated by lost orders (e.g., P1=78, P3=69, P10=65, P13=101 remain indefinitely). LT stable avg 1.5 from 6 concluded obs (2,1,2,1,2,1); no new arrivals P18 (normal, P17 order pending). Use recent_6 across params: regime_length=6 (P13-P18 ultra-low changepoint), backend computes L=1.5 avg last 6 LTs, mu_hat=(1+1.5)*11.8\u224829.5 low to match demand drop minimizing overstock/holding amid unreliable pipeline, sigma_hat=sqrt(2.5)*std(recent6\u22485.6)\u22488.8 for vol matching recent low variance. Balances high q=0.8 service vs holding by anchoring to current summer low regime, ignoring early high-demand samples.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24, late June summer): women's summer trousers demand minimal/near-zero as expected seasonally (trousers off-season); ultra-low regime sustained P13-P19 avg 11.1 pd, with further decline to minimal levels P16-P19 (6,8,7,7) avg 7.0 pd (-45% vs P13-P15 avg 16.7), sustained 4 periods (chgs confirmed by consistent low sales when stocked P17-19). On-hand 97 covers ~14 pd at 7 pd rate; in-transit 337 (P1:78 lost, P3:69 lost, P10:65 lost, P13:101 lost, P17:24 overdue past LT=2 exp P19 arrive absent); effective pipeline ~97 (lost pattern sustained, OR backend unaware). LT stable avg 1.5 (6 obs:2,1,2,1,2,1). Use recent_N N=6 for L (stable regime length=6); recent_N N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (further decline changepoint P16 regime_length=4, low mean/vol to yield low base_stock ~ (1+1.5)*7 + z*low_sigma << 434 pipeline \u2192 order~0, minimizes holding on excess inv while service high).

Carry-over insight: Demand further decline to minimal summer trousers levels starting Period 16: P16-P19 avg 7.0 (-45% vs P13-P15 avg 16.7), sustained 4 periods; P17 order (24 units) likely lost: no arrive P19 conclude despite LT=2 expected during P19 (1 period past); lost rate ~45% sustained (5/11 non-zero orders lost)

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01): Peak summer (early July), women's slim trousers demand remains minimal/near-zero seasonally, as confirmed by carry-over and recent history P16-P20 demands (6,8,7,7,2) avg 6 (-14% vs P16-P19 avg7), sustained 5 periods in ultra-low/minimal regime starting P16 (-45% vs prior). High on-hand=95 covers 15+ periods at avg6 pd; in-transit=337 bloated by sustained ~45% lost rate (e.g., P17 order 24u lost confirmed: absent P19-P20 concludes, 2pd past LT=2 exp P19 arrive). Observed LT stable avg1.5 (6 obs:2,1,2,1,2,1; no new in P20). Parameters use recent_6 for L to capture avg1.5< promised2 (helps backend lower base stock sooner); recent_5 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect current low mean/vol ((1+L)~2.5*6~15 mu, low sigma), yielding low base stock q=0.8 to prioritize holding cost reduction vs service given pipeline illusion from lost shipments.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08): Mid-summer, minimal demand for women's summer trousers confirmed sustained (P16-P21 demands:6,8,7,7,2,6 avg 6.0, std~2.2; -14% vs prior ultra-low P13-P15 avg16.7). Position high at 89 on-hand +337 in-transit=426, covers 70+ periods at ~6pd. No upcoming holidays boosting trousers. LT stable avg1.5 from 6 obs (2,1,2,1,2,1; no new obs). High lost rate ~45% sustained; conservative low mu_hat/sigma_hat prevents overordering. Use recent_N N=6 for all: L~1.5 (observed avg), mu_hat~(1+1.5)*6=15 (low demand regime length=6pd sustained), sigma_hat~sqrt(2.5)*2.2~3.5 (low vol). Ensures base_stock low (~15+0.84*3.5~20), order=0 given position>>base; bridges lost shipments via observed LT/low demand.

Carry-over insight: P17 order (24 units) lost confirmed (absent P19-P21 concludes, 3pd past LT=2 exp during P19); lost rate sustained ~46% (6/13 non-zero orders); Minimal summer trousers demand regime extended P16-P21 avg 6.0 (-14% vs P13-P15 avg16.7), sustained 6 periods

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019/7/15 mid-July): Peak summer season for women's slim trousers; demand remains minimal as expected seasonally (trousers low in summer heat). Sustained ultra-low regime P16-P22 (7 periods: demands 6,8,7,7,2,6,2 avg 5.4, std ~2.2, -14% vs prior low). On-hand=87 covers 15+ periods at current rate (high due to prior stockouts avoided); in-transit=337 entirely lost orders (P1:78, P3:69, P10:65, P13:101, P17:24 confirmed absent multiple periods past exp LT=2). No arrivals in P22 conclude (no new LT obs). LT stable avg 1.5 (6 obs: P2\u21924:2, P5\u21926:1, P6\u21928:2, P9\u219210:1, P15\u219217:2, P16\u219217:1). Use recent_N N=6 for L (stable avg 1.5 < promised 2, lowers base_stock horizon); recent_N N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (captures sustained minimal regime changepoint at P16, (1+L)~2.5x5.4~13.5 mu, low sigma reduces overstock risk). OR backend: low mu/sigma/L \u2192 low base_stock (~13-20) << on-hand+pipeline \u2192 minimal/no order, cuts holding cost on excess 87 OH while high q=0.8 protects rare uptick; ignores losses (handled by low ordering).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/7/22): Late July summer, minimal demand for women's trousers confirmed seasonally. Recent demand P16-P23 (8 periods: 6,8,7,7,2,6,2,4) avg 5.25, sustained ultra-low regime; further drop P20-P23 avg 3.5 (-33% vs P16-P19 avg 7.0). On-hand 83 covers 20+ periods at current rates; in-transit 337 = sum of confirmed lost orders (P1:78, P3:69, P10:65, P13:101, P17:24), no real pipeline. LT stable avg 1.5 (6 obs:2,1,2,1,2,1). Use recent_N=6 for L to reflect observed avg LT; recent_N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained low demand/volatility, lowering base_stock. OR backend subtracts full pipeline (incl lost), ensuring near-zero orders to minimize holding on excess OH while covering low demand over (L+1)~2.5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Minimal summer trousers demand regime extended P16-P23 avg 5.25 sustained 8 periods; further decline to avg 3.5 P20-P23 (-33% vs P16-P19 avg 7.0) sustained 4 periods

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29): Late July summer, minimal demand for women's summer trousers confirmed (seasonal low). On-hand=75 covers 10+ periods at recent avg~5.6pd; in-transit=337 entirely lost shipments (P1:78, P3:69, P10:65, P13:101, P17:24 confirmed lost, no arrives ever). No arrivals since P17. Demand regime minimal sustained P16-P24 (9 periods: 6,8,7,7,2,6,2,4,8 avg=5.56, -68% vs early year). LT stable avg1.5 (6 obs:2,1,2,1,2,1; no new obs). No overdue new orders. Use recent_6 for L (stable LT regime 6 obs). recent_9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (demand regime length=9, captures sustained low mean/volatility ~2.2). Lowers base_stock to minimize overstock/holding given high 'pipeline' (lost), high on-hand, low demand; q=0.8 favors service but params prevent excess ordering.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05): Peak summer for women's skinny trousers; seasonal minimal demand confirmed extended P16-P25 (10 periods avg 7.4, skewed by P25=24 spike after P24=8; prior P16-P23 avg~5.6). No sustained changepoint to higher demand (only 2 periods uptick vs prior lows, lacks 3+ consistency). On-hand 51 + in-transit 337 = 388 pipeline covers 50+ periods at avg 7.4 demand, minimizing holding costs ($1/unit/period) vs profit $4. LT stable avg 1.5 (6 obs: 2,1,2,1,2,1; no new arrivals P18-P25, lost rate sustained ~46%). Use recent_N N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat (minimal regime length=10, max(min(10,20),3)=10) to set low (1+L)~2.5 *7.4~18.5 mean_demand_period, low vol; recent_N N=6 for L=1.5.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12): Late summer/early fall transition for women's slim trousers; seasonal low demand extended through P24 (avg ~6 P16-P24), but sharp regime shift upward P25=24 (+200% vs P24), P26=94 (massive spike, avg P25-P26=59, +900% vs prior summer avg). On-hand=0 after P26 stockout (demand=94>51 start); in-transit=337 exactly sums lost orders (P1=78, P3=69, P10=65, P13=101, P17=24), no expected arrivals (no orders since P17). Effective pipeline=0, high stockout risk amid demand surge likely tied to back-to-school/fall prep. LT stable avg1.5 (6 obs unchanged, no new arrivals). Use recent_N N=3 (P24-P26) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture recent upshift/volatility (mean~42, high std~43); recent_N N=6 for L (avg1.5). This boosts base_stock aggressively vs default (lowers q=0.8 but counters losses/0-pipeline by targeting higher mu/sigma for (1+L)~2.5 periods coverage ~105 mean + buffer), minimizing future lost sales while limiting overstock given holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19): Late August, women's slim trousers; seasonal ramp-up to fall/back-to-school/work likely driving demand surge (prior summer minimal avg~5-8/pd P16-P24). Recent changepoint P25: demands P25-P27=24,94,104 avg74 (+1300% vs P16-P24 avg5.6), sustained 3 periods confirming high regime return to early-year levels ~60-80. On-hand=0, in-transit=337 all confirmed lost (P1:78+P3:69+P10:65+P13:101+P17:24=337 exact, no arrivals since P17 despite ample time past LT=1/2). No live shipments pending. LT stable avg1.5 (6 obs:2,1,2,1,2,1). Lost rate ~46% sustained. Explicit mu_hat=640, sigma_hat=235 with L=1.5 yields base\u2248640+0.84*235=837, order=837-337=500 capped at cap\u2248640/2.5 +1.64*235/\u221a2.5=256+244=500. Offsets fake pipeline to build true coverage ~500 gross (exp net~275 after 45% loss) for 2.5pd@110pd + safety/vol, balancing high service (q=0.8) vs holding amid stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to high starting Period 25: P25-P27 avg 74 (+1300% vs P16-P24 avg 5.6), sustained 3 periods; fall seasonal ramp-up late Aug confirmed for trousers; All 337 in-transit confirmed lost (P1:78, P3:69, P10:65, P13:101, P17:24); no live shipments.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/8/26 late Aug): Fall seasonal ramp-up for women's trousers confirmed high demand regime sustained P25-P28 (demands 24,94,104,89 avg 77.75, +1300% vs summer P16-P24 avg~5), regime length 4 periods with changepoint evidence at P25 (sudden jump post summer lows) validated by calendar (late Aug fall preview demand). Recent P26-P28 avg 95.7 even higher. On-hand 0, in-transit 774 (likely P28's 437 + prior unresolved lost), high historical lost rate ~45% means effective pipeline unreliable; parameters use recent demand for higher mu_hat/sigma_hat to boost base stock and service level vs holding cost (q~0.8 favors stock). LT stable avg 1.5 over 6 obs (2,1,2,1,2,1 no new arrives). recent_4 for demand params (regime_length=4, >=3); recent_6 for LT.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019/9/2 early Sep): fall trousers seasonal ramp-up confirmed, high demand regime sustained P25-P29 avg 78 (P25:24 transition/inventory-limited, P26-P29:94,104,89,80 avg92 +17% acceleration); prior summer minimal demand ended. Pipeline 774 in-transit (likely P28:437 + recent, no live old shipments post-lost clearance), on-hand 0, no stockouts yet from pipeline but monitor arrivals. Recent LT stable avg1.5 (6 obs:2,1,2,1,2,1; P28 order LT>=2 confirmed no P29 arrive). No new overdue/lost (P28 due P30). Set L recent_6 for avg1.5; mu_hat recent_4 (P26-P29 regime length 4>=3, mean92*(1+1.5)~320 covers high demand); sigma_hat recent_4 (low vol~10*sqrt(2.5)~16). Ensures high base_stock ~320 +0.84*16~336 (q=4/5=0.8), but pipeline 774>base_stock so order~0 conserves holding; adapts OR to actual LT/demand vs promised/all-data defaults.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime extended P25-P29 avg 78 sustained 5 periods (+1300% vs summer P16-P24 avg5.6); acceleration P26-P29 avg92 (+17% vs P25-P28 avg77) sustained 4 periods; early Sep fall trousers ramp confirmed (P29:80 high).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019/9/9): Early Sep fall trousers season post-Labor Day (Sep 2), high demand regime sustained P25-P30 (6pd avg86.5), acceleration P26-P30 (5pd avg99), P27-P30 (4pd avg100.25 +29% vs P25-P26), P30=128 peak (+60% vs P29=80) confirms building surge. OH=309 covers ~3pd at 100/pd; IT=337 all confirmed lost ghosts (old P1/P3/P10/P13/P17), inflating fake pipeline IP=646 (effective=309). Recent LT stable avg1.57 (7 obs), losses only historical/recent reliable. To bridge ghost IT, inflate mu_hat explicit=700 (equiv ~3*117 pd demand over L=2 + ~337 lost adjustment + safety for surge/vol), with default L=2 conservative (covers LT risk), recent_5 sigma captures high vol std~18 pd (sqrt3*18~31, z\u03c3~26, base~726), orders ~80 (726-646) to effective IP~389 (~3.9pd@100 +safety), balancing stockouts vs holding amid surge/losses. Cap ample ~260.

Carry-over insight: High demand acceleration to avg100/pd sustained P27-P30 (104,89,80,128 avg100.25 +29% vs P25-P26 avg59), 4 periods; P30=128 (+60% vs P29) confirms early-mid Sep fall trousers surge post-Labor Day; Observed LT stable avg1.57 (7 obs:2,1,2,1,2,1,2); recent orders reliable (P28 arrived LT2), losses confined to old shipments.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand 180 covers ~1.4pd recent demand, likely low ending; in-transit 418 (P31:81 expected LT~2 arrive P33 + unresolved old per insights confirmed lost, no overdue new). LT stable avg1.57 (7 obs:2,1,2,1,2,1,2 last P28->P30 LT2); recent reliable no losses. L recent_N N=7 uses actual avg~1.57<2 to correct backend promised LT for accurate pipeline. mu_hat/sigma_hat recent_N N=5 captures acceleration regime mean~106/vol~22 (high var 80-129) vs early low/outdated samples; raises base_stock demand forecast (1+L~2.57*106~273) for service despite position~598 high holding risk, prioritizes profit on surge (q=0.8).

Carry-over insight: High demand acceleration extended P27-P31 avg106 (+14% vs P25-P31 high regime avg92.6), sustained 5 periods; mid-Sep fall trousers surge confirmed post-Labor Day (P30:128, P31:129).

On-hand=0 after P33 stockout (83 lost sales), pipeline=482 covers ~3.2 periods at 150/dpd (L+1~2.5). LT stable avg1.5 over 8 obs (2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1), recent reliable (no new losses). recent_N N=8 for L adjusts backend to actual shorter LT; recent_N N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat boosts base_stock to ~ (2.5)*150 + z*(sqrt(2.5)*49) ~375 + 0.84*78 ~440, balancing high service vs holding with cap-aware policy.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand 260 covers current ~150-200 demand; in-transit 384 = 337 old confirmed lost (permanent pipeline overstate) + 47 P34 pending (likely LT3 arriving during P37 per recent LT3 obs). No new arrivals expected before decision. Parameters use recent_N=7 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture sustained ultra-high mean/vol regime (chgpnt P30, length=7>=3), inflating base_stock to ~ (1+1.6)*155 + z* sqrt(2.6)*47 ~410 + high safety vs historical low samples; recent_N=10 for L (10 obs:2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,3,1 avg1.6) accurate vs promised 2, slightly lower L tempers base but pairs w/ high recent demand to counter lost-overstated pipeline, prompting refill order balancing high service (q=0.8) vs holding.

Carry-over insight: Ultra-high demand regime extended P30-P36 avg155 sustained 7 periods (+3 vs P34 note); high volatility sustained P33-P36 avg179 std~47 (+15% mean vs P30-P32); LT avg1.6 over 10 obs (added LT3 P33, LT1 P35); first LT=3 obs increases variability but avg stable; recent deliveries 100% (P28/31/33/35 arrived, P34 pending LT~3)

On-hand 99 low vs ~160 demand (stockout risk); in-transit 384 = all lost/old (P1/3/10/13/17 + P34:47 confirmed lost, absent P36-P37 despite 3pd past LT=2 exp P36); no live pipeline. Reconcile: expect 0 arrivals this period (no recent orders P36/P37=0). L recent_10 avg~1.6 stable (10 obs inc recent LT3/1); mu_hat recent_8 captures sustained ultra-high mean (backend ~2.6*156=406 base); sigma_hat recent_8 for vol; params boost base_stock high (q=0.8) to cover (L+1)~2.6pd demand ~400+ safety vs holding, aggressive order to refill pipeline post losses/stockouts.

Carry-over insight: P34 order (47 units) lost confirmed (absent P36-P37 concludes, 3+pd past LT=2 exp P36); lost rate sustained ~46% (7/15 non-zero orders lost); ultra-high demand regime extended P30-P37 avg156 (+1% vs prior) sustained 8 periods; high volatility sustained P30-P37 std~47.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019/11/11): mid-November pre-Thanksgiving (Nov 28 ~P42), women's slim trousers in fall/winter peak season with sustained ultra-high demand P30-P39 (10 periods: demands 128,129,114,230,194,129,164,161,137,143; avg 152.9 std 35.7).

Addresses lost shipments by inflating base_stock offset for permanent ghosts in pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Permanent ghost inventory in-transit accumulated to ~384 units sustained (prior 337 + P34:47 confirmed lost), overstating pipeline by 74% (517 total vs live 133); actionable: inflate base_stock by ghost amount for true position targeting.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Women's slim trousers in fall/winter surge regime since P25, ultra-high P30-P37 avg156, now softened P38-P41 avg124 (-23% vs P34-P37 avg162, sustained 4pd changepoint at P38, evidence: 137/143/125/92 vs prior highs).

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09), early December pre-Christmas for women's slim trousers; expect holiday demand surge Dec16-30 (P45-P47) based on calendar, following fall ultra-high (P30-P37 avg155) then softened high (P38-P43 avg126 std41, volatile with P42:188 BFCM spike Nov25, P43:72 Dec2 lull). On-hand 243 + est live pipeline 123 (P42 order pending) = true position ~366 vs ~3pd demand 378 tight. In-transit 551 overstated by sustained ghosts ~428 (carry-over P42). LT recent stable but avg up to 2.0 (last 6 obs: P28 LT2, P31 LT1, P33 LT3, P35 LT1, P39 LT2, P40 LT3).

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16, mid-Dec pre-Christmas week for women's slim trousers; holiday retail demand potential in P46-P47 Dec23/30). Softened high demand regime sustained P38-P44 (7 periods: demands 137,143,125,92,188,72,112 avg124.1 std~37.6, high vol confirmed).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019/12/30): Late Dec post-Christmas winter trousers demand; softened high regime sustained P38-P46 (9pd avg 119, std~38 high vol confirmed by P46=79 within range of prior std~35-40). True position ~50 onhand +312 live pipeline (P44:72 +P45:101 +P46:139 recent orders, avg LT~2.14 exp soon) =362 vs backend-overstated 790 (+428 ghosts sustained). L recent_7 (last7 obs avg2.14, up15% vs overall, sustained recent increase); mu_hat explicit=119*(1+2.14)+428 ghosts=802 to inflate base_stock ~840 targeting true ~412 ((1+2.14)*119 +0.84*sqrt(3.14)*38~412) while backend subtracts full 790 yielding order~50 to cover 3pd demand~360 w/ buffer; sigma_hat recent_9 captures high vol regime. Balances high service (q=0.8) vs holding by ghost-adjusted target, prevents stockout amid losses/vol.
