Steady demand year-round, minimal seasonality; Feb 11, 2019 (post-Chinese New Year Feb 5, Presidents' Day Feb 18 upcoming) unlikely to spike sneaker sock demand significantly. (b) Demand regime: Historical data (5 weeks Jan-Feb 2019: 123,105,114,133,95; mean=114, std~14) shows stable regime around 110-120, no sustained shifts. Forecast ~114/period. (c) Lead time: Promised 2 periods; no conclude messages, cannot infer actual LT or losses yet. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 1 demand will stock out fully (inevitable startup). No pipeline to cover P1-P2. (e) Final order logic: Initiate pipeline with order covering ~1x historical mean (arrives P3 if LT=2, covers P3+ with buffer for variance; conservative to limit initial holding risk while filling for high service level, profit $4 >> holding $1).",

Dec 2, 2019 = Cyber Monday (major online sales post-Thanksgiving/Black Friday), kickoff to Christmas holiday shopping season (peaks Dec 16-25). Socks are popular affordable gifts/stockers; winter wear boosts casual socks. Historical early-year data (Jan-Feb ~114 avg) irrelevant; expect sustained holiday demand escalation from P42 spike (311). (b) Demand: Late fall decline confirmed P39-P41 avg110/P34-P40 avg168; broken by P42=311 (+184% vs P39-P41), aligns with holiday calendar trigger. Forecast P43+: 250-350 (holiday uptick, volatile post-back-to-school highs ~270). No new 3pd sustained regime yet. (c) Lead time/missing orders: LT varies 1-3 (recent: P39@P41 LT2, prior P36 LT3, P32 LT3 etc.); frequent LT=3 (6+ instances). Intermittent losses sustained (e.g., P34 300u lost overdue5+; P29 200u lost); P42 arrived=0 despite in-transit 2880 (suggests pending overdue like P40/P41/P42 orders exp P42-P44). Prolonged droughts (recent P42 0 after P41 arrival). No new LT confirms. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0 (P42 stockout sold 277/277); in-transit=2880 bloated/unreliable (cumulative pendings + overdues, history losses ~20-30% orders). Expected near-term arrivals low prob (drought pattern); pipeline covers if arrives but risks holding explosion or further losses. (e) Order logic: Order 300 for LT=2-3 arrival P45-46 (Dec16-23 Christmas peak), targets ~300 demand/period at 100% service minus safety for losses (20% buffer). Balances stockout loss (4/profit) vs holding (1/pd); minimal add to pipeline given unreliability.",

Practical everyday item, potential holiday gifting/stockings (Christmas Dec 25 upcoming ~2.5wks away from 2019/12/9).

(c) Lead time: Recent LT stable/variable 1-3pd (P43: P41 order LT=2; prior P36@3, P39@3, etc.); intermittent losses sustained (e.g., P34 lost, early droughts). No P43 arrival from P42(0)/P40(0), P39 arrived earlier; in-transit 2980 incl. many overdue (likely partial losses/delays). Promised LT=2, actual ~2-3 frequent.
