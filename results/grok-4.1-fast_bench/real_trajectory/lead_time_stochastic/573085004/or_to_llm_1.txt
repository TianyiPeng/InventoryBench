{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2 confirmed variably in past (e.g., recent P25->P27 LT=2, P27->P30 LT=3, but irrelevant now as no recent orders expected to arrive and in-transit 1593 units are confirmed junk/lost per carry-over (persistent losses like P29,P32 etc.). Inventory position: On-hand=321 ample for low demand outlook (covers 20+ periods at recent ~15-25/week); ignore junk pipeline to avoid overcounting. Demand analysis: Sustained low post-back-to-school/winter lull per carry-over; recent P43-46 (early-late Dec) demands 35,32,15,13 avg=23.75 vs P40-42 avg43 (-45%), 4 consistent low periods aligning with pre-Christmas lull despite winter jeans relevance; P46=13 (12/23) confirms holiday proximity low, P47=12/30 likely similar pre-NY low/no surge expected. OR recommendation: 0 units based on promised LT=2 and full history mean, but aligns perfectly with reality - high on-hand vs low demand forecast (OR sees all history including early highs but caps low due to current pipeline illusion).
