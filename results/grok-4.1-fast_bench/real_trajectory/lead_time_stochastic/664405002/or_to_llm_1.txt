======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variability confirmed at 2-3 periods (e.g., P42->P45 LT=3, P43->P45 LT=2, P40->P43 LT=3); P46 conclude shows arrived=0, so P44 order (200 units) overdue by 1 for LT=2 (expected P46, possible LT=3 in P47); P45 order (200) expected P47 LT=2. Lost shipment pattern persists historically (~1340 units), bloating in-transit to 1640 (mostly ghosts), but recent deliveries (P45: 150+300) were reliable. Inventory position: On-hand 359 (high vs recent demand 70-85), covers 4-5 periods even at LT=3; potential P47 arrivals (P44/P45 ~400) further buffer. Demand analysis: Post-holiday dip sustained P43-P46 avg 77 (P43:85, P44:71, P45:85, P46:70; -76% vs Black Friday P42=308 peak); date 2019/12/30 post-Christmas/New Year's end-of-season low for women's belts/accessories (no surge drivers). OR recommendation 0 aligns with high inventory, low demand outlook, and pipeline coverage for (L+1)=3-4 periods; no override needed as base-stock likely negative after pipeline subtraction. Final strategy: Order 0 to avoid excess holding costs ($1/unit/period matching profit), preserve liquidity amid ghost in-transit.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR's 0 unit recommendation unchanged - on-hand 359 covers 4-5 periods of sustained post-Christmas low demand (~77 avg P43-P46), with potential ~400 incoming from P44/P45 orders despite LT variability.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-Christmas demand dip sustained P43-P46 avg 77 (-76% vs P42 Black Friday peak 308); P44 order (200 units) overdue by 1 period (no P46 arrival vs LT=2 expected), potential lost resumption",
