Forecast P44-P47: 150-250/period (Christmas peak), conservative 200 mean vs historical winter highs (Jan ~158 avg).\n(c) Lead time/Missing: Recent confirmed LT2-3 (P41 LT2 arr P43, P40 LT3 arr P43; prior P39 LT2 P41). Variable 1-3 sustained, no parity; older multi-losses (~ghosts) but recent reliable (P43 arr). Expected P44 arr: P42 (130u, LT2 exp). In-transit 1900 risky (ghosts), but recent streak.\n(d) Inventory/Pipeline: On-hand 105 (~0.5-1 period cover). Post-P44: low risk w/expected P42 arr + pipeline, but stockout cost high (lost $1/unit, e.g. P42 -308). Total cover ample if arrivals hit, but buffer needed.\n(e) Order: 250 to target service (cover 1-2 periods high demand P46-47 arrivals LT2-3), mirror P43 amid holiday; holding penalty offset by sales gain near end (P44/47).",
