  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but confirmed variable (1-3 periods recently, e.g., P45 arrivals: P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2; P46 arrived=0 indicating misses). Persistent lost shipments inflate in-transit to 1648 without reliable deliveries (carry-over: ongoing pattern, partial arrivals only). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (stockout in P46), in-transit unreliable (history shows many losses like P32, P34 confirmed lost; high total masks effective pipeline ~low due to non-arrivals). Demand analysis: Christmas/winter peak sustained - P45=356 (Dec16), P46=180 (Dec23), avg 268 (+500% vs P43-P44 avg46); P47=12/30 still holiday/winter season for heavy leggings, expect continued high ~150-250 (cold Jan ahead, no summer low). Historical early-year (P1-P3 avg153) relevant but current peak higher. OR recommendation: 0 units - ignores recent spike, losses, LT variability, uses full history mean (pulled down by summer lows ~30-50). Strategy: Override OR aggressively - order 250 to cover (LT+1=3) periods expected demand ~180 avg x3=540 minus unreliable pipeline adjustment, plus safety (q=19/20=0.95 high service); avoids stockouts costing $19/unit profit while holding $1 low; aligns with prior P46 order=300 during spike.",
