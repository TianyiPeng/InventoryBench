{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variable 1-3 periods (e.g., P45 arrive P43 order LT=2; prior P40 LT=3, P36 LT=3), promised 2 holds roughly but with losses. No new arrivals/concludes for P46 yet. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand=54 covers 1-2 periods at recent ~25-36 demand; in-transit=918 massively inflated by confirmed ghosts ~898+ (P40, P34, etc. lost), so actual expected pipeline low (~20 units real?). Demand analysis: Recent P42-45 demands 38/10/15/36 avg~25, sustained pre-holiday low (-35% vs prior); historical summer spike (P17-23 ~109 avg) but post-summer decline to ~50 then ~30-20 stable low. Calendar/product: 2019/12/23 Christmas Eve, women's thong lingerie 3pk could see gift/party demand bump (similar to summer +100% spikes), potentially 50-80 despite recent lows (P45=36 uptick). OR rec=0 assumes low mu, high pipeline (ignores ghosts/losses), uses promised L=2/all history. Strategy: Override to 50 units for safety stock covering possible holiday spike over next 3 periods (~75-150 total need, current 54 + low pipeline insufficient); avoids stockout loss ($4/unit) vs holding ($1). Conservative given losses but proactive for event.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent arrivals confirm LT variability 1-3 periods (e.g., P40 order arrived P43 LT=3; P43 order arrived P45 LT=2); many prior orders lost or severely delayed, inflating in-transit to 968 (includes ~900 accumulated ghosts per carry-over, though some may arrive late as seen with P40). Inventory analysis: On-hand=25 sufficient for 1 period of recent low demand (~26 avg); actual pipeline low due to ghosts, but no imminent arrivals visible (P46 conclude arrived=0). Demand analysis: Pre/post-Christmas low sustained P42-46 avg 25.6 (38/10/15/36/29), no New Year's uptick (P46=29 consistent); product is women's thong lingerie, low demand logical post-holiday (no gifting/party surge evident). OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and all-history demand (ignores recent low regime, losses); aligns perfectly with low demand outlook, high ghost pipeline, and holding cost risk - no need to order and risk another ghost. Final strategy: Order 0 to avoid adding to losses, cover current demand from on-hand, rely on any late arrivals.",
