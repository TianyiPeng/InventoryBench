February 11, 2019: winter season, sleeveless tops typically low demand but historical data shows steady 115-162 units/week. Valentine's Day Feb 14 nearby, minor potential uplift for women's clothing but not a strong driver for basics. (b) Demand regime: historical 5 weeks (Jan7-Feb4) avg 134 (162,142,115,133,118), recent 3 weeks avg 122, volatile but no sustained shift (oscillating, not trending down/up significantly). Forecast 130/period absent contradicting evidence. (c) Lead time: promised 4 periods, no prior orders/concludes to infer actual or detect losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand 0, in-transit 0. No coverage for periods 1-4 (stockouts expected); first order arrives ~period 5. (e) Final order logic: initiate pipeline with forecast mean demand (134 rounded to 130 for conservatism given recent 118-133 and winter seasonality). Orders 130/period build steady-state coverage post-lead time; symmetric profit/holding costs favor matching mean over safety stock initially, adjust later via observations.",
