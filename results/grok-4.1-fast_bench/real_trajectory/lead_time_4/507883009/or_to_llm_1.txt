Recent P39-41: 98/103/65 (avg 89, dropping), but date 2019/11/25 is pre-Thanksgiving/Black Friday (Nov 28/29), entering Christmas season (P46=12/23). Women's lingerie/underwear likely sees holiday gift/sales spike similar to June peak (194-237 avg), overriding recent dip. OR recommends 58 based on full historical mu_bar~132 (implied base stock~658 for 5 periods), but underestimates upcoming seasonal surge. Strategy: Override OR upwards to 100, boosting base stock projection to ~700 (future mu_hat~140/period accounting for ~10-20% holiday uplift), ensuring coverage through P47 while minimizing excess holding (IP post-order~700 vs ~850 peak demand possible).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 58 to 100 units - high pipeline covers base needs, but adjusting upward for anticipated Black Friday/Christmas demand surge (Nov 25-Dec 30 periods) similar to prior June peak of ~200, despite recent dip to avg 89.",
