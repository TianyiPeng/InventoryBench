{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 4 periods confirmed across multiple arrivals (e.g., P46: P42 order arrived P46; P45: P41->P45; no lost shipments or drifts). Pipeline: In-transit 421 = P43(221 arrives P47) + P44(100->P48) + P45(0->P49) + P46(100->P50). Inventory projection: Start P47 OH=437; post-arrival ~658; recent demand avg P43-P46=31 (30,37,36,19), covers >20 periods even at 50/demand. Demand analysis: Low regime persists (carry-over P25-P41 ~55, now P43-P46=31 further dip post-P42 Thanksgiving spike=130 which wasn't sustained); Dec dates show post-holiday lull (Christmas P46=19 low); jeans demand seasonally low late Dec/New Year's Eve week, no imminent surge signaled. OR recommends 0 using promised L=4 and full history (ignores regime); aligns perfectly with high coverage and low demand outlook - no override needed.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - high inventory (437 OH + 421 in-transit arriving over next 4 periods) covers 20+ periods at recent low demand avg 31 (P43-P46); low regime persists post-holidays without sustained uptick.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Period 47: Demand low regime further dipped and sustained into late December/Christmas: P43-P46 avg 31 (-44% vs P25-P41 avg 55), 4 periods low variance ~7 consistent with post-Thanksgiving/Christmas jeans dip",
