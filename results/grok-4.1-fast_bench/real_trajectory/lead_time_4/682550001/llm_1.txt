Date 2019/12/30: post-Christmas (12/25), pre-New Year's; expect steady winter demand ~40-60 (no major spike like holidays, possible post-holiday dip). (b) Demand regimes: Fall surge peaked P30-38 avg85 (volatile highs140), post-Halloween decline P39-42 avg55, Dec P43-46 avg41 (28,46,64,27 volatile, no holiday lift confirmed despite monitoring; winter steady low-vol regime holds). Historical seed (Jan-Feb ~45) aligns with winter base. Forecast P47+: ~45 avg, volatile 25-65. (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (all recent arrivals e.g. P46 shows P42 order arrived); no in-transit, no losses. (d) On-hand 432 (high, post-zero orders P42-46), in-transit 0; covers 9-10 periods at 45/wk forecast. Ending inv P46=432 charged $432 holding. (e) Order 0: Pipeline empty but on-hand ample (10+wk cover > lead time); prioritize burn-down high inv to cut holding costs ($1/u/p), risk minor stockout low vs $19 profit/sale; resume if inv drops <200.",
