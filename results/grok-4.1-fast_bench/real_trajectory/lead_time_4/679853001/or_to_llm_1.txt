These cover expected arrivals for P43-P46, visible in their respective concludes. Demand analysis: Knitwear sweater in early Dec (2019/12/2), peak winter/holiday season (pre-Christmas: P46~12/23). Historical recent: P36-41 avg 194 (per carry-over late fall stabilization), but P42=661 massive Black Friday spike (11/25, +240% vs 194; huge stockout of 58). P33-42 avg ~258 (high variance, multiple >200). Summer low <<100 confirmed irrelevant; fall surge sustained per carry-over (P30+ accelerating to peaks >250).

Pipeline+on-hand=580 covers ~2 periods at 250/period - high stockout risk, especially P44 (0 arrival), P47 (our order). OR recommendation: 0 units - ignores recent high-demand regime/seasonality, uses full history low mu (~low 30s early), sees high pipeline relative to outdated low forecast. Strategy: Override OR upwards to 400 - targets pipeline total ~980 for 5 periods (~196/period base, plus safety for spikes like P42=661 and Christmas P46). Matches recent order scale (300-350), ensures P47 coverage (post-Christmas but winter), balances profit/holding (q=0.5).
