Demand analysis: T-shirt in late December (P46=2019/12/23, pre-Christmas Monday); winter nadir sustained 23+ periods from P22 (P39-45 demands:9,12,17,42,12,7,19 avg~16, Thanksgiving P42=42 bump not sustained); Christmas unlikely to spike t-shirt demand (not winter/holiday staple, recent post-Thanksgiving drop persists). Expected demand over L+1=5 periods: ~80-100 units conservatively (20/period upper bound), fully covered by 208 on-hand (excess ~100+ units, holding cost $1/unit/period). OR recommendation (230): Overestimates due to full-history mean including summer peaks (~160-180 avg), ignores regime shift to winter lows; OR assumes promised L=4 but cannot adapt to seasonality/demand drop. Strategy: Override OR to 0 - prioritize minimizing holding costs on excess inventory during confirmed low-demand winter; resume ordering only if demand rebounds post-holidays.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Set order to 0 vs OR's 230 - 208 on-hand covers 10+ periods of sustained winter low demand (~16/period avg P39-45); t-shirt seasonality nadir persists pre-Christmas with no spike expected, avoiding excess holding costs.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed consistently as 4 periods across multiple concluded periods (e.g., latest arrivals from P27 order in P31); no lost shipments evident, in-transit=0 with no recent orders. Inventory analysis: On-hand=184, in-transit=0; recent demand P44-46:7,19,24 (avg=17); P39-46 avg~18 confirms deep winter t-shirt nadir (-91% vs summer peak). Covers 10+ periods at ~18/period. Demand analysis: Women's short-sleeve t-shirt in late Dec (P47=2019/12/30, post-Christmas/New Year's Eve); no seasonal uptick expected in cold weather, sustained low ~18/period per carry-over (23+ periods from P22).
