Late April 2019 (4/29), spring fitness/athleisure season in Northern Hemisphere; rising demand for breathable activewear as temps warm toward summer; no major holidays (post-Easter). Aligns with cycling highs in warmer Mar-Apr data. (b) Demand regime: 2-period high/low cycle robustly confirmed (4 cycles: lows P2-3/6-7/10-11 avg ~40-50; highs P4-5/8-9 avg ~110-120). P10-11 lows 46/47 match prediction; thus P12-13 forecast high ~110 avg each. Recent avg ~75/period; initial hist (Jan-Feb) mixed but cycle dominates recent 10+ periods.

  "rationale": "(a) Product: PINKY Loose Fitted Tank (H&M Sport ladies loose-fitting jersey sports vest top, upper body garment). Summer sports wear (prior peaks May-Jul ~100-120), winter lows ~5-20 (Nov), holiday uptick late Nov-Dec. Date 2019/12/30: post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week; fitness resolutions may sustain moderate demand (~50-80) vs sharp post-holiday drop to winter lows, but aligns with ongoing holiday buildup tail (carry-over P42-46 rising to 107). (b) Demand regime: Holiday acceleration confirmed P42-46: 14\u219233\u219257\u219278\u2192107 (avg 58, +450% vs P39-41 winter avg7, 5p rising trend); P46=107 matches ~100 expectation. Forecast P47 post-peak dip ~70-90 (New Year's linger), P48 ~60, P49 ~50, P50 ~40, P51 ~30 (decline to Jan winter transition). No 2p high/low cycle here; seasonal holiday overrides prior patterns. (c) Lead time: Confirmed 4 periods consistently (latest P46\u2192P50 expected; all recent concludes match, e.g., P46 arrive none as expected). No overdue/lost orders; in-transit 100 solely from P46 order. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0; no arrivals P47-P49 (no orders P43-P45); P50: +100 (total start ~100); P51+: depends on today's order. P47-P49 stockouts inevitable (lost ~180 sales); P50 covered for low-mod demand. Ending inv P46=0 signals urgent replenish. (e) Final order logic: Order 120 to arrive P51, covering expected P51 ~30 + safety buffer (20-30) for potential NY resolution linger/uncertainty + build for P52+ decline; balances lost sales risk vs $1 holding (19:1 profit ratio favors coverage); matches prior peak-period sizing (e.g., P46 order=100 amid 107 demand). Pipeline post-P50: ~220 for ~120 total demand P50-P54.",
