(b) Demand regimes: Carryover summer low (P20-24 avg68) ended; recent P36-45 volatile (avg~60): lows 19-41 (P40-41,43-44), spikes 90(P42 Black Friday),89(P45). Holiday uptrend emerging (P42/P45 +100% vs Oct lows) but not sustained (3+ consistent highs absent amid volatility). Forecast P46: 120 (Christmas peak). (c) Lead time: Confirmed 4 periods consistently (latest P45: P41 ord arrived P45; all history matches, no losses/overdues). (d) Inv/pipeline: P46 start=545(onhand)+100(arr P42 ord)=645; post-dem end~525. Pipeline: +120(P47 arr P43 ord), then 0(P48=P44 ord0),0(P49=P45 ord0); total visible~545+220=765 covers 6+ periods@100dem (high buffer). (e) Order logic: High inv covers holidays + beyond (min holding drag); thin post-P47 pipeline risks Jan stockout. Order 100: modest replenish for P50 arr, targets ~1-2wk safety amid volatility/spike risk, balances profit vs $1 hold.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) Jeggings (stretch denim skinny trousers for ladies) are casual winter fashion suitable for cold weather; Dec 30 2019 is post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week, likely moderate demand post-holiday dip after P45-46 spikes (89,72 possibly pre-Christmas), aligning with early-year historical (Jan-Feb avg ~77). Winter season supports steady ~60-80 vs summer lows. (b) Demand volatile recently: P41-46 (41,90,19,26,89,72) avg 56; holiday spikes P42(90),P45(89),P46(72) vs prior lows P43-44(19,26), but no sustained regime shift (only 2-3 periods); post-holiday forecast 50-70 conservative, blending recent avg and seasonal winter base. (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (latest P46 arrival from P42); no missing orders; in-transit 220 = P43:120 (due P47) + P46:100 (due P50), no gaps/overdues. (d) On-hand 573 high (covers 8+ periods at 70/demand); post-P47 arrival: ~573+120=693 start, ample pipeline covers P47-P50+ (no arrivals P48-49 but inv >600 post-P47). (e) Order 0 to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) on excess inv (573>>forecast); zero stockout risk, preserves profit vs accumulating holdings; monitor post-holiday for adjustments.",
