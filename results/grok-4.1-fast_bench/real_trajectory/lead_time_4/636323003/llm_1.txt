Early Feb signals winter-to-spring transition; denim relevant for casual chic looks. (b) Demand regime: Historical weeks (Jan 7:19, Jan14:46, Jan21:48, Jan28:62, Feb4:85) show strong upward trend (avg 52, recent 3-wk avg 65, last 85; +140% from week1). Possible promo/seasonal ramp-up into Feb. Forecast ~90-100/period near-term, accounting for Valentine's spike. (c) Lead time: No conclude messages yet (Period 1); promised 4 periods. No evidence of drift/loss. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0, transit 0. Period 1 full stockout expected (demand after decision).

Add ~10% safety for trend/volatility/Valentine's (~50). Order 400 to initiate pipeline, balance stockout risk ($4 profit loss) vs holding ($1/period); adjust future based on actuals/concludes.",
