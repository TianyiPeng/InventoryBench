(b) Demand regime: Sustained summer low confirmed (carry-over P20-P21); recent P20-P24: 24,41,45,40,17 (avg 33.4); P21-P24 avg 35.8 (-25% vs P18-P20 avg48); P22-P24 avg34 confirming extended low regime ~30-40/period, no rebound evidence despite BSS proximity.

  "rationale": "(a) Product: Ladies skinny ankle-length stretch denim jeans (Embrace S.Skinny H.W Trash). Late Dec 2019 (P47: 2019/12/30, post-Christmas/New Year's Eve). World knowledge: Post-holiday sales possible, but jeans demand typically low in winter lull; no major spike expected for denim vs. gifts/party wear. Matches historical pre/post-holiday low regime (carry-over P39-P44 avg~33). (b) Demand regime: Low sustained (P39-P46: avg~34; recent P44-P46:31,36,38 avg35, P42-P46 avg38 incl. Thanksgiving 62 outlier). No shift\u2014stable low ~35/period, extending carry-over Dec lull into late Dec/early Jan; conservative forecast 35-45/period short-term. (c) Lead time: Confirmed 4 periods consistently (e.g., P46 order in-transit, arrives P50; all recent: P39\u2192P43, P40\u2192P44, P46\u2192P50 expected). No missing/overdue orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 800 (post-P46:838-38=800), covers ~20+ periods at 40 demand. Pipeline: 100 in-transit (P46 order, arrives P50). Total visible: 900 units, ample for low demand thru P60+. High on-hand risks holding costs ($1/unit/period). (e) Order logic: Zero order to minimize holding drag on R_t (19*sold -1*ending_inv). 800+ covers L+1=5 periods demand (~200) + safety/buffer; replenish later when inv <200-300. Reassess post-New Year.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand low regime extends late Dec post-Christmas: P44-P46 avg35 (31,36,38), sustained 3 periods matching/extending P39-P43 avg33 (-no uptick); confirming winter lull into early Jan.",
