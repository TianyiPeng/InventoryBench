{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 4 periods across all recent concluded periods (e.g., P46 arrive from P42, P45 from P41, etc.); no lost shipments or drifts observed. Inventory position: On-hand 431 + in-transit 300 (from P43 order, arriving P47) = 731 units pre-P47 demand, with no further arrivals until P51+ (P44-P46 orders=0). Recent demand: P42-P46: 371/84/108/205/142 (avg 182, but post-Black Friday P42 peak, P43-P46 avg 135); post-Christmas (P47 12/30) likely moderates to ~120-150 given end-of-holiday lull for denim jeggings and historical post-peak stabilization (e.g., post-summer trough recovery patterns). Calendar: End-Dec post-Christmas/New Year's; demand drop expected as gifting season ends, shifting to potential returns/clearance but lower volume for apparel. OR rec=0 based on promised L=4, historical demand (ignores seasonality); aligns perfectly with high pipeline covering 5+ periods at 140 avg demand (731/140\u22485.2 periods). No override needed: ordering 0 avoids excess holding costs ($1/unit/period) on already ample stock. Strategy: Defer ordering until pipeline depletes post-P47 arrival.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - on-hand 431 + incoming 300 covers 5+ periods of expected post-Christmas demand (~135 avg from P43-P46), avoiding holding costs amid holiday lull for denim jeggings.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Period 47: Post-Christmas demand moderation confirmed: P43-P46 avg 135 (-64% vs P42 holiday peak 371), with P44-P46 108/205/142 stabilizing ~150; end-of-holiday surge for denim jeggings.",
