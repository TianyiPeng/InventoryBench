Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=535 (from P45 ending), no in-transit, covers 100+ periods at recent avg demand ~5-6 (P36-45 avg=5.8: 4+16+4+10+1+2+11+5+3+2)/10. Demand analysis: Prolonged seasonal slowdown for lightweight joggers confirmed through fall (carry-over); continued into winter (P37-45 low, avg~6, blips at P37=16, P39=10, P42=11 not sustained); Dec 23 (Christmas week) unlikely to spike lightweight fabric item (winter favors heavier apparel, history shows no holiday surge). OR rec=0 uses promised L=4 and full history (initial high Feb-Mar ~150 avg dropping to ~6); aligns perfectly with high inventory and low demand outlook for next 5 periods (L+1=5, expected demand ~25-30).

Current status for Period 47 decision: On-hand=531, in-transit=0 (no pipeline risk). Demand analysis: Sustained low demand confirmed by history and carry-over insights; recent 10 periods (P37-46: demands 16,4,10,1,2,11,5,3,2,4; avg=5.8, std~5) shows no recovery even post-Thanksgiving/Christmas (P42=11/11/25, P45=2/12/16, P46=4/12/23). Product is lightweight joggers (women's basics), off-season in winter; Dec 30 (Period 47) unlikely to spike (New Year's not a jogger driver). Historical initial demands higher (avg~221) but irrelevant now. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised L=4 and all history (mean low due to recent data). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - excessive inventory (531 covers ~90+ periods at avg demand 6); ordering would amplify holding costs ($1/unit/period) with profit $4 but negligible sales risk.
