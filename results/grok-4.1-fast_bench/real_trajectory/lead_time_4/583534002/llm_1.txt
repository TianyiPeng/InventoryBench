No major retail events (e.g., no Valentine's post-peak, pre-Easter).

No confirmed recovery yet; flat ultra-low holds vs. early-game/spring highs. Pre-game winter high irrelevant now. Forecast: 5-15/period short-term, possible modest rise to 20-30 by Sep. (c) Lead time: Confirmed stable at 4 periods (multiple arrivals e.g., P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). No in-transit; no missing orders (last orders P1-3 all arrived). (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=779 (covers >50 periods at 10/unit or 100+ at recent avg). In-transit=0. No arrivals expected soon; post-P7 no orders placed. High holding exposure ($779/period). (e) Order logic: Massive buffer covers 21 remaining periods (to P47) even at optimistic 40/period recovery (840 demand). Prioritize drawdown to cut holding costs ($1/unit); order 0 avoids pipeline bloat. Reassess in 3-4 periods for fall uptick evidence.",

Demand typically higher in cooler fall/winter due to sweatshirt fabric suitability; lower in summer (matches history). Date 2019-11-11: Mid-November, pre-Thanksgiving (Nov28), Black Friday (Nov29), early Christmas shopping. World knowledge: Casual loungewear like joggers sees uptick in cold weather and holiday casual/gift demand, but pre-game winter highs (200+) not repeated in-game early periods (100-150 then drop).\n(b) Demand regime: Sustained summer ultra-low (avg ~5-8, per carry-over). Recent P35-39: 5,4,16,4,10 (avg 7.8); volatile with minor upticks (P37=16, P39=10) possibly signaling winter recovery, but not sustained shift yet (still <10 avg). Pre-game winter avg ~221 much higher, but game shows no repeat spike.\n(c) Lead time: Confirmed 4 periods consistently (e.g., P33 order arrived P37). No in-transit orders; no missing/overdue shipments.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 984 (very high, covers 100+ periods at ~8-10 demand); in-transit 0. History shows gradual drawdown from initial bulks; ~8 periods remain (P40-47).\n(e) Final order logic: Ample inventory buffers any potential holiday uptick (even if demand doubles to 20/period, sells ~160 over 8 periods, ends ~824). Ordering risks arrival P44 adding to massive ending inv (holding $1/unit/period \xd7 high avg inv \xd7 4+ periods = high cost). Prioritize minimizing holding costs over low stockout risk; order 0.",
