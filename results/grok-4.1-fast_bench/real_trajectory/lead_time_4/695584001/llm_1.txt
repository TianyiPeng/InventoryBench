(c) No prior orders/concludes, so no lead time inference; promised 4 periods, assume for now. No missing orders. (d) On-hand:0, in-transit:0; Period 1 demand will stock out fully (post-decision). Pipeline empty. (e) Order conservatively for 1x recent peak to build pipeline covering ~Period 5+ arrivals (lead 4), balancing profit=holding=$1 (favor service over excess hold); 109 units targets last observed demand as baseline, adjust up next periods on outcomes.",

Late Dec 2019 (12/30, pre-NY Eve) post-Christmas period typically sees retail slump for fashion accessories; no major spikes expected for belts (not party-specific). Historical pre-game Jan low demand aligns with winter lows. (b) Demand regime: Confirmed continued post-holiday collapse; P43-P46 (early-late Dec) avg 19 (17,10,32,17), -57% vs P38-P41 avg45, extending downward shift from Period 42 insight. Volatility low, sustained over 4 periods. Prior summer/July peaks long faded. Forecast ~15-25/period short-term. (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods across all recent arrivals (e.g., P46 shows prior orders arrived exactly); no missing/lost orders (in-transit=0, all accounted). (d) Inventory: On-hand=301 (from P46 end), in-transit=0; covers >>15 periods at ~20/period demand (301/20=15+). High holding risk ($1/unit/period). No pipeline arrivals imminent. (e) Order 0: Excessive stock avoids further holding costs; replenish only if demand rebounds (monitor NY week). Balances zero stockout risk with cost minimization.",
