Steady year-round demand expected as undershirt, less seasonal than outerwear. Date 2019/2/18 (mid-February, winter northern hemisphere) - no major retail events (post-Valentine's Feb14, pre-Easter); possible mild winter dip but recent demand contradicts. Historical weekly demands (Mon dates): 66 avg (76,64,73,53,65 up to Feb4), P1 (Feb11)=96 (+45% vs hist avg). (b) Demand regime: Historical mean ~66; recent uptick Feb4=65, P1=96 suggests possible increase but only 1 new data point post-hist - monitor for confirmation, forecast ~80 blending hist+recent. No sustained shift yet (needs 3+ periods). (c) Lead time: Promised 4 periods. P1 conclude: ordered=330 arrived=0 (expected, as arrival during P5, visible P6). In-transit=330 from P1. No evidence of delay/loss yet; too early. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0; in-transit=330 (exp arrive P5). No arrivals imminent - P2,3,4 will stockout (lost sales). Pipeline post-P5: 330 units (~4 periods at 80/unit). (e) Final order logic: High profit ($19) vs low holding ($1) favors stocking ahead vs stockouts. Order (L+1)*forecast =5*80=400 to refill pipeline for P6+ demand, scaling up from prior 330 (hist-based) for recent demand signal.

  "rationale": "(a) Product: RONNY REG RN T-SHIRT (men's basic cotton jersey round-neck t-shirt/underwear). Date 2019/12/30: post-Christmas (Dec 25), New Year's Eve tomorrow. Holiday retail surge (Cyber Monday/Christmas) peaked P42=207, sustained P43-45 avg82.7 but ended abruptly P46=58; expect winter low demand ~60 as post-holiday normalization, minimal NYE uplift for basic t-shirts. Matches historical Jan-Feb avg66. (b) Demand regime: Holiday elevated P43-45 (82.7 avg, +42% vs winter P35-41 58.4) confirmed over, P46=58 reverts to winter low (consistent with P35-41 avg58); recent P44-46 avg80.7 volatile but trending down, forecast P47 ~70 (conservative winter base). No new sustained regime shift (P46 single low). (c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods (latest P42\u2192P46); P43:300 expected P47 arrival, P44:300\u2192P48, P46:150\u2192P50; no overdue/missing orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=310 (covers ~4-5 periods at 70/demand); +P47 arrival 300 (total ~610 post-demand); remaining in-transit 450 post-P47 (covers additional 6+ periods); total coverage 10+ periods, excess vs low winter demand. (e) Order 0: High inventory minimizes holding cost ($1/unit/period) while pipeline ensures no stockouts; re-order only if demand surges beyond forecast.",
