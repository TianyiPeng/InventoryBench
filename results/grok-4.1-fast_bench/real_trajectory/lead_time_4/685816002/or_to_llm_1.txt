Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All concluded arrivals from Periods 5-46 consistently report 'lead_time was 4 periods' (e.g., P46 no arrival as P42 ordered=0; P45 no arrival as P41=0), confirming actual lead time matches promised 4 periods with no lost shipments evident. Inventory & pipeline analysis: On-hand=0 entering Period 47; in-transit=662 exactly matches undelivered orders from P43=161 (arrives P47), P44=161 (P48), P45=160 (P49), P46=180 (P50), providing ~150+ units per period for next 4+ periods (covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand at recent avg ~77). Demand analysis: Recent P43-46 demands=64,80,104,58 (avg 77, volatile post-P42 holiday spike of 207); carry-over confirms low regime P35-41 avg 59 sustained, holiday volatility not sustained; current date 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas/New Year's Eve) for men's cotton jersey t-shirt underwear expects continued low winter demand (~60-100, no seasonal spike like summer or holidays). OR recommendation: 0 units, using historical mean but ignoring recent low regime/pipeline; aligns perfectly as pipeline overcovers expected demand over lead+1=5 periods (385 expected vs 662+ incoming). Strategy: Follow OR at 0 to avoid excess holding costs ($1/unit/period) on already ample pipeline; no override needed given stable lead time, low demand outlook, and no regime shift.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - 662 in-transit (161 arriving this period, covering next 4+ periods) amply buffers recent low post-holiday demand avg ~77 with no expected spikes end-Dec.",
