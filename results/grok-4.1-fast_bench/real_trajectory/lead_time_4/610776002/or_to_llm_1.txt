Seasonal context: Date 2019/9/23 (late Sep), product is lightweight jersey T-shirt (women's everyday basics); demand declining post-summer into fall/cooler weather, aligning with drop from summer peaks (~400-500 in P15-19) to current ~140. OR recommendation: 494 units based on full historical demand (higher \u03bc including peaks ~300 overall avg), promised L=4, ignoring recent low regime/seasonality/high inventory; its base-stock likely ~700-900, minus low pipeline but not accounting for on-hand excess. Strategy: Override OR downward to 0 - high on-hand covers (L+1)=5 periods of low demand (~700); adding 494 risks massive ending inventory (holding cost $1/unit/period) with only 14 periods left (to P47), low profit upside given stable low sales.
