Expect major demand spike for jewelry/accessories pre-Valentine's; historical data (Jan-Feb 2019) shows 20-51 units/period (avg ~33), with max 51 possibly pre-spike signal. Season: Early Feb, winter/post-holiday lull ending with V-Day surge. (b) No in-game demand history (Period 1); rely on provided historical regime: mean ~33 units/period, variance moderate (std~10), recent drop to 20 (Feb 4) but V-Day overrides to forecast 50-70+ spike this/next periods then revert. (c) No prior orders/concludes; promised LT=4 periods (inferred actual unknown); no missing orders yet. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 1 demand hits post-decision (expect 0 sales/stockout); pipeline empty, so first order critical to fill for Periods 5+ visibility.

(e) Forecast 60 units/Period 1-2 (V-Day spike), 35 thereafter; total 5-period need ~240 (60*2 + 35*3); order 250 to build safety stock (holding=profit, prioritize service level early); covers ramp-up without excess.",

Date 2019-12-30 (Mon) is post-Christmas (12/25), pre-NYE (12/31); expect potential NYE party demand spike for accessories, but post-holiday sales/returns may suppress; Dec demands volatile (26,17,66,53) with holiday influences overriding fall decline regime. (b) Demand regimes per carry-over: fall decline sustained to mid-Oct avg66; recent Nov-Dec P40-46 (11/11-12/23) avg55 (54,68,63,26,17,66,53), down ~17% from Oct avg~70, but volatile/not sustained (no 3+ consistent periods); no new regime shift. Historical winter low aligns with provided 2019 Jan-Feb data (avg~27). Forecast P47 ~50-70 (NYE mild uplift from Dec avg~40). (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (all arrivals confirm, e.g., P46:140 from P42); no missing/lost orders (all tracked orders concluded). (d) On-hand=529 (post-P46), in-transit=0; no pipeline (P43-46 orders=0); covers ~10+ periods at 50/demand (or 7+ at 70/demand); high inv risks holding cost. (e) Order 0: ample coverage for (L+1=5) periods demand (~250-350) vs 529 on-hand; avoids adding to pipeline/holding while monitoring NYE demand realization next period.",
