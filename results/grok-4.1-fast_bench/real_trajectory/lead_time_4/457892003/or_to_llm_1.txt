Product (women's jersey leggings) in early June 2019 (P17 date 6/3) aligns with seasonal summer decline as weather warms, no holidays boosting demand. OR recommendation: 17 units, based on promised LT=4 and full history (higher mu from early periods), but raw order likely low/negative due to high IP vs low recent mu; cap smooths to 17. Strategy: Follow OR's 17 as conservative match to recent demand mean, avoids overordering into high-inventory position (336 IP >> 5-period demand ~120 at 24/period); prioritizes depleting excess while maintaining service amid minor demand volatility (recent std ~5).
