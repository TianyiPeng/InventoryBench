Historical data (weekly Mondays) shows demand ramp-up: Jan low-single digits to Feb highs, aligning with winter peak.(b) Demand regime: Historical avg=126 (37,22,53,215,302), but recent shift to high regime (last 2 periods avg=258.5, +105% vs prior avg=37.3); sustained uptrend evident over 5 periods, forecast ~250-300/period short-term.(c) Lead time: Promised 4 periods; no prior orders/concludes, cannot infer actual yet; no missing orders.(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 1 demand will stockout (lost ~250 profit); pipeline empty, 4-period lag means arrivals start P5.(e) Final order logic: Target base-stock for (L+1)=5 periods coverage at ~250/period forecast =1250, but conservative start at recent peak 300*4=1200 (pipeline build + safety for variance/lead drift); high margin (19>>1) favors over vs understock.",
