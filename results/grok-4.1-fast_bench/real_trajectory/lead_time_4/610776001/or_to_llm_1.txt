Inventory: On-hand=0 entering P8; ending on-hand consistently 0 with stockouts (e.g., P7 demand 448 > arrival 254). Demand analysis: Initial historical (pre-P1) avg ~157; sustained high regime P1-P7 avg=284 ((206+239+350+260+245+242+448)/7), up +81%; P7 spike to 448 (+84% vs P1-P6 avg 257).

OR recommendation: 293 units, based on promised LT=4 but outdated low-demand history (ignores regime shift), underestimates base-stock needs.
