Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "(a) Product: Fine-knit trainer socks (women's, cotton blend) - everyday apparel, modest seasonal drivers: higher winter demand possible due to cold weather, but socks less gift-oriented than specialty items. Date 2019/12/30 (Mon, New Year's Eve week, post-Christmas Dec 25). Holiday sales peaked P45(12/16:81), P46(12/23:67); expect post-holiday drop to Jan historical avg~37 (28-44) or recent lows~30, as returns normalize and gifting ends. No major Jan 2020 events spiking socks demand. (b) Demand regimes per carry-over: deep lows P39-43 avg28.6, persisting early Dec. Transient holiday spike P45-46 avg74 (+150% vs prior), but only 2 periods - not sustained (needs 3+); likely mean-reverts to ~35-45 for P47+. High variance (recent range 22-81). (c) Lead time fixed at 4 periods (all 30+ arrivals confirm 'lead_time was 4 periods'); no drifts/losses. In-transit 70 = P43 order=70, arrives P47 (confirmed pattern). Post-P47 pipeline empty (P44-46 orders=0). (d) P47 effective start: 691 on-hand +70 arrival=761. Covers 15-20+ periods at ~40 demand. Post-P47 ending ~700 (assuming d=60), covers P48-50 (~120-150 demand) + safety to P51 arrival. Excess inventory: holding costs ~$700/period vs profit $19/sold - prioritize drawdown. (e) Order 0: inventory ample for P47-50+ at expected ~40-60 demand; avoids adding to high holdings ($1/unit/period). Reassess P48 if spike sustains.",
