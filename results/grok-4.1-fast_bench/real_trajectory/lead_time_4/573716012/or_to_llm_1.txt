  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 4 periods across all recent concludes, e.g., P46 arrived=72 (ordered P42, lead_time=4), P45 arrived=120 (P41), no lost shipments or drifts observed. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, but in-transit=1205 confirmed as P43=455 (arrives P47), P44=0 (P48), P45=350 (P49), P46=400 (P50); ample coverage for 4+ periods even at recent holiday highs (avg ~200). Demand analysis: Holiday surge confirmed (P42-P46 volatile highs 117-431, avg ~214), but P46=117 (-51% from P45=239), P47=2019/12/30 post-Christmas likely reverting to trough ~50-100 (summer baseline per carry-over P24-P37 ~60-90), no sustained post-holiday signal yet. OR recommendation=0 aligns with high pipeline vs. its conservative historical mean forecast; no override needed as excess pipeline risks holding costs amid demand normalization, while covering L+1=5 periods' expected demand (~100*5=500 <1205). Final strategy: Order 0 to avoid overstocking post-surge.",
