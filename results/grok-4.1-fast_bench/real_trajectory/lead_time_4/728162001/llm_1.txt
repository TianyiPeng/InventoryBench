  "rationale": "(a) Product: Womens V-neck T-shirt cotton jersey, everyday basics upper body garment. Date 2019/12/23 (Christmas Eve week). World/calendar: Peak holiday retail season; Christmas drives clothing/gift demand spikes (e.g., similar Thanksgiving P42=134). Historical winter demand low (~36 avg Jan-Feb samples), but holiday spikes possible despite basic t-shirt not being festive/winter-specific. (b) Demand regime: Recent Dec pre-Christmas lull P43-45 avg20 (very low vs Oct P34-36 avg62 -68%, vs Nov P38-42 avg86 -77%); sustained 3 periods contradicting buildup expectation. Holiday spike risk for P46 ~134-150 (Thanksgiving analog) or higher, then post-Christmas drop to 20-50 based on winter norms + recent. No sustained shift yet beyond lows. (c) Lead time: Confirmed consistent 4 periods across all arrivals (latest P35 order arrived P39, etc.); no overdue/missing orders; single in-transit 120 from P43 (expected P47 arrival). (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 254 (covers P46 even at 200+ spike); in-transit 120 (P47); no other pipeline (P44-45 orders=0). Post-P46 (exp dem150) end~104; P47 start~224; ample for P47-P50 at exp 50/demand each (total supply 374 vs exp dem~350). (e) Order logic: High on-hand + incoming covers 5 periods even with holiday spike; equal P/H=1 favors avoiding excess holding (let deplete naturally); order 0 preserves buffer without overstock.",
