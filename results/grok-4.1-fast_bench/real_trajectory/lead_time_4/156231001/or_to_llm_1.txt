{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 4 periods across all recent concluded periods (e.g., P46 shows prior arrivals from P42 exactly 4 periods; no lost shipments evident as in-transit=1000 matches P43 order=500 arriving P47 + P46 order=500 arriving P50; P44/P45 orders=0 explain gaps). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0; in-transit=1000 (500 arrives during P47 covering P47 demand ~400 leaving ~100 end-P47; P48/P49 no arrivals risking stockouts on ~350 demand each; P50 +500). Demand analysis: Product=tights (winter/party wear); date=2019/12/30 (post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week) sustains high holiday/winter demand per carry-over (P44-46 avg=428, P46=450); expect ~350-400 for P47-P51 (elevated vs OR's historical avg diluted by summer trough ~150). OR rec=136 too low (uses full history/promised L=4 but ignores recent regime elevation + pipeline gaps). Strategy: Override upwards to 400 matching recent demand mean, targeting position ~1750 (350*5 periods) vs current 1000; covers P48-51 gaps post-P47/P50 arrivals, balances stockout risk (recent P46 lost ~358 sales) vs holding (q=0.5).",
