No strong calendar spikes evident yet.\n(b) Demand regime: Steady ~180/period (no sustained shift; single 215 not confirmed as regime change). Forecast base=180-200/period, conservative for winter continuity.\n(c) Lead time: No history (Period 1); promised=4. No orders to track as missing/overdue.\n(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Certain stockout Period 1 (demand lost); Periods 2-5 likely stockouts unless actual LT<4. Pipeline empty.\n(e) Final order logic: Order 200 (recent avg + buffer for winter/VDay) to cover ~1x expected demand arriving Period 5 (covers post-lead time). Subsequent orders will build pipeline for steady-state (order=D weekly to minimize holding=profit). Balances early lost sales vs. high holding cost; safety for LT variance/loss risk.",

No new regime shift (P43-45 avg 345 similar to prior). (c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods across all arrivals (latest P45: P41 order); no losses or drifts observed. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 617; in-transit 800 = P42:400 (arr P46), P43:400 (P47), P44:0 (P48), P49:0 (P49). P46 post-arrival ~1017 covers high demand; P47 ~900+ ample; P48/P49 thin pipeline risks stockout if demand >300. Total visible ~1417 vs ~4pd x 400=1600 need. (e) Final order logic: Order for P50 (post-holiday winter ~300-400). Replenish pipeline conservatively for sustained winter demand + safety (high service priority despite holding=profit); 400 matches recent arrivals/orders, covers expected D50 + buffer vs drop risk.",

(b) Demand regime: Holiday highs sustained (P44-46: 367/468/450 avg 428; overall P42-46 volatile avg ~389, peaks 450-468); no confirmed post-holiday drop yet (historical Jan avg ~180 but this year elevated). Forecast P47 ~400-450. (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (all arrivals confirm, e.g., P46: P42 order); no lost/missing orders. (d) On-hand 567; pipeline: P47 arr 400 (P43), P48:0 (P44), P49:0 (P45), P50:400 (P46); transit 800 matches. Projected: P47 end ~567+400-450=517; P48 end ~517-450=67; P49 major stockout risk if demand ~450 (lose ~383 sales). High inv now but gaps ahead. (e) Order 400 for P51 arrival to replenish pipeline gaps, match recent demand avg (~400), cover expected late-Jan winter demand ~350 (elevated vs historical); prioritizes sales vs holding given stockout risks.",
