Historical data (prior 5 weeks): Jan7:20, Jan14:36, Jan21:191, Jan28:160, Feb4:99\u2014shows ramp-up with mid-Jan spike (possibly promo/seasonal), recent decline to 99.

Forecast \u03bc\u2248120/period accounting for Valentine's minor boost and recent decline; high variance requires safety buffer. (c) No prior orders; promised LT=4, no actual LT or lost order inference possible yet. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0; full stockout expected this period (demand after decision). Pipeline empty.

Date 2019/12/23 (Mon): Christmas Eve week (Dec 25 holiday); peak retail/gift-buying period, expect demand spike like Black Friday P42=506. Post-Christmas/New Year's (P47=12/30) possible elevated then drop to winter lows (cf. early 2019 Jan:20-36 low then spike). (b) Demand regimes: Carry-over late fall lower avg169 (P36-39); recent P43-45 post-BF dip avg106 (110/113/95, -38% vs P40-41 avg171), sustained 3 periods confirming further decline but calendar overrides for imminent Xmas surge (forecast P46~400-500, P47~200, P48-50~110-130). BF precedent P42=506 validates holiday spike pattern. (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (all recent arrives confirm, e.g., P45=0 no arr, P43 ord350 expected P47); no missing/lost orders (in-transit 350 matches P43 ord350). (d) Inv/pipeline: On-hand 531 ample for P46 spike (covers up to 531>506 hist high). Arrivals: P46=0 (P42 ord0), P47=350 (P43), P48=0(P44), P49=0(P45), P50=our ord. Projection (dem 450/200/120/110/110): P46 end~81, P47 end~231, P48~111, P49~1, P50~ord-109; thin post-P47 risks stockout if surges persist. Total pipeline+onhand=881 covers ~4pd at 220avg but holiday uncertainty high. (e) Order 200: Replenish thin pipeline for P50+ (targets ~5pd coverage at ~120-150 regime + holiday buffer/safety); balances stockout risk (prioritize service) vs holding (high on-hand depletes post-spike); matches recent ord sizes (e.g., P39=250,P43=350) scaled to lower regime.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand regime shift to post-Thanksgiving/Christmas pre-spike dip: P43-45 avg106 (-38% vs P40-41 avg170.5); sustained 3 periods. Holiday spike pattern: P42 (11/25 BF) 506 confirms calendar-driven surges.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) Product: High-waisted skinny jeans (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS), lower body garment suitable for fall/winter fashion. Date 2019/12/30: Post-Christmas (Dec 25 ~P46 12/23), New Year's Eve eve; history shows BF P42 (11/25) spike 506 but Christmas/post-Thanksgiving dip P43-46 low (avg~98), typical retail post-holiday lull with returns/low shopping for apparel before Jan reset. No major spike expected; demand aligns with winter fashion but calendar dip dominates. (b) Demand regime: Recent P43-46 avg98 (110,113,95,75), continuing post-holiday dip per carry-over P46 insight (P43-45 avg106); P44-46 avg94 shows slight further decline (-11%). Matches seasonal post-Xmas lull, no evidence of rebound yet vs prior fall surges. Forecast P47 ~90-110. (c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods across all recent concludes (e.g., P46 no arrival as expected from P42 order=0; P43 order=350 due P47). No lost orders; in-transit 550 aligns with pending shipments incl. P43:350 + others. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 456 (high vs ~100 demand); in-transit 550 (incl. ~350 arriving P47 post-decision, visible P48); post-P47: ~456 -90 +350 ~716 start P48, plus later P50:200 from P46. Covers 7+ periods at 100/demand; excess risks high holding. (e) Order 0: Ample coverage (456 on-hand covers P47+4 periods); low demand forecast + high pipeline minimizes stockout risk while avoiding $1/unit/period holding on excess amid post-holiday lull.",
