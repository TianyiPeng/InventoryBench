Feb 11, 2019 (winter, northern hemisphere): suitable for cold weather; minor potential uplift from Valentine's Day (Feb 14) for women's apparel, but everyday item not strongly event-tied. Historical demands (prior 5 weeks ending Feb 4): 99,85,106,148,135 (avg 114.6, recent 3-wk avg 130, max 148) align with winter steady demand for long-sleeve tops, no major calendar spikes evident. (b) Demand regime: Stable winter baseline ~115-140/period; recent uptick (last 2 wks ~141 avg) but not yet sustained shift (needs 3+ periods confirmation). Forecast: 130/period near-term. (c) Lead time: Promised 4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet (Period 1, no history). No in-transit, no evidence of variance/loss. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0, in-transit 0; fully exposed to stockout this period (demand after decision). Empty pipeline means Periods 1-4 likely stockouts if LT=4. (e) Final order logic: Target coverage for LT+1=5 periods @130/period forecast =650, but conservative start (test dynamics, avoid excess hold early): order 150 (covers ~1 period demand, matches recent highs; ramp in future periods as pipeline fills). High service priority (lost profit $4 > hold $1/period).",
