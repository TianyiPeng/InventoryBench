  "rationale": "(a) World/product: Ladies high-waist skinny ankle stretch denim jeans (Embrace S.Skinny). Winter apparel suitable for cold Dec/Jan. Period 47=2019/12/30 (Mon, pre-NYE, post-Christmas Day 12/25 P46). Expect post-holiday lull/low demand (returns/gift fatigue), but potential Jan new year/winter sales ramp-up like historical early-year highs (P1 2/11:276). No major events spike for denim now. (b) Demand regime: Recent P43-P46 avg 51 (30,54,59,60), stable post-holiday low vs P40-P42 avg 155 (-67%); no rebound signal yet, prior back-to-school/holiday patterns faded. Historical winter ramp possible but unconfirmed for Dec-Jan transition. Forecast P47 ~50-70. (c) Lead time: Confirmed consistently 4 periods (all arrivals e.g. P46 from P42, P44 from P40 etc.); no drifts/losses (in-transit 250 matches P43 order=250, due P47). (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 1116 (post-P46:1176 start -60 sold=1116), +250 in-transit (P43 arr P47) =1366 total visible; covers ~22+ periods at 60/demand (1116/50=22). Very high, holding cost=$1/unit/period erodes rewards 1:1 vs profit. (e) Order logic: No order needed; stock covers lead time +20 periods; adding risks higher holding during uncertain lull. Monitor for Jan ramp in future.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand downward shift sustained P43-P46: avg 51 (30,54,59,60), -67% from P40-P42 avg 155; post-holiday/Christmas lull confirmed overriding prior Black Friday surge.",
