Date 2019/12/30: Post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week; demand typically low after holiday peak shopping (Black Friday/Christmas), with possible minor NYE uptick but jeans not primary. Upcoming Jan (P48+) aligns with historical highs (avg ~181, spikes to 244), signaling seasonal winter demand ramp. (b) Demand regime: Post-holiday low sustained P43-P46 avg 82 (-63% vs P40-P42 holiday avg 143); prior holiday upshift (P40-P42 avg 143, P42=221 spike) faded. Historical Jan data suggests imminent upshift. Recent: consistently ~80. Forecast P47: ~80-100; P48+: ramp to 150-200. (c) Lead time: Confirmed consistent 4 periods (latest: P46 arrival from P42; P43 order due P47). No missing/lost orders; all conclude on time. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 1027 + 200 in-transit (P43 order, arrives during P47) = ~1227 pre-demand P47. Post-P47 (~80 demand): ~1147 ending. No further pipeline. Ample coverage (11+ periods at 100/wk; 5+ at 200/wk). High holding risk but covers Jan ramp. (e) Order logic: High stock buffers lead time + variability/Jan upshift. Order conservative 200 to replenish for P51 (late Jan, historical high regime) without excess; balances stockout risk (lost $1/sale) vs holding ($1/period/unit). Zero risks depletion if demand spikes early.",
