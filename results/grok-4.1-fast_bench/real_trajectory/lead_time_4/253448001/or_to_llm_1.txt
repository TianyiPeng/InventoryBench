{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: No concluded periods yet (first period), so assume promised lead time of 4 periods; no in-transit or overdue shipments. Inventory status: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so Period 1 demand will be fully unmet regardless of order.

Current date 2019/2/11 (Monday, week includes Valentine's Day Feb 14), product is push-up bra (women's lingerie) - major seasonal driver for V-day gifting, expect 30-50% demand spike to ~75-85 units this period and possibly next, far exceeding OR's historical mean. OR recommendation: 76 units = cap (\u03bc\u0304 + 1.645\u03c3\u0304 \u224856+19=75), conservative due to small sample/no seasonality adjustment; uses (1+L)=5 period base-stock capped, ignores calendar events. Strategy: Override OR upward to 90 units to accelerate inventory build for post-V-day coverage (order arrives Period 5 if LT=4), balancing spike anticipation against holding costs (q=4/5=0.8 critical fractile supports moderate safety).
