(b) Demand regime: Historical (5 wks Jan-Feb): avg~58 (high 83, declining to 36 on Feb4); P1=32 confirms sustained decline (~45% drop from Jan avg~69 to recent 34 avg over last 3wks+P1), winter/post-holiday lull probable. Forecast P2: ~35 (conservative, post-Valentine dip). (c) Lead time: Promised=4; P1 order arrived=0 in P1 conclude (normal, expect arrival P5 arrival phase, confirm in P6). No evidence of drift/loss yet; in-transit=350 tracked to P1 order. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0 (P2 stockout imminent, sold=0 in P1 despite demand=32); pipeline=350 expected P5 (~8-10wks coverage at 35-40/wk forecast, safety buffer good post-arrival). No overdue orders. (e) Order logic: Pipeline covers well from P5+; order modestly to replenish safety stock for variance/lead time risk (high=83 possible outlier) and cover pre-P5 stockouts indirectly via future flow.
