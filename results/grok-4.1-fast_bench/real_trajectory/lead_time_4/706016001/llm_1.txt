Post-holiday sales/returns likely drive moderate demand (~500-600); winter season supports steady jeans sales (historical Jan-Feb ~650-700). No major spike expected like Black Friday (P42=3100).\n(b) Demand regime: Holiday elevated sustained P43-P45 avg670 (+24%); P46=475 drop (-28% from P45), but single period\u2014not sustained 3+ for new low regime. Overall recent P43-P46 avg ~620, tapering from peak; aligns with post-Christmas normalization vs fall highs (P30-33 ~900 avg).\n(c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods (all historical arrivals confirm, e.g., P43 order arrives P47). In-transit 2500 = P43 order, no overdue/missing shipments.\n(d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 4361 + 2500 incoming P47 = ~6861 pre-demand; at ~600 demand/period, covers 11+ periods. Pipeline empty post-P47.\n(e) Order logic: Ample coverage minimizes stockouts, prioritizes reducing holding costs ($1/unit/period) on excess inventory; order 0, replenish later if demand sustains high.",
