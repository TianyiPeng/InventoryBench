  "rationale": "(a) Product is women's fitted denim jacket (stretch, washed denim, buttons, pockets; outdoor upper body garment). Denim jackets are transitional/shoulder-season items, peaking spring/fall but in deep summer/winter trough per history/insights; date 2019/12/30 is post-Christmas (12/25), New Year's Eve\u2014minimal jacket demand boost expected amid ongoing winter holiday lull for light jackets (not heavy coats). Historical pre-Christmas demand collapsed (P43-46: 6/1/9/8 avg 6). (b) Demand regime: Deepest trough persists (carry-over P46 confirms -70% vs prior; P43-46 avg 6 units, consistent low variance, no rebound signal despite winter\u2014regime stable at ~5-10 units/period. (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (all recent concludes confirm, e.g., P46 shows no overdue/missing; P43 order=150 due P47 as expected, matches in-transit 150). No lost orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 675 (post-P46), +150 in-transit arriving P47 (total ~825 pre-demand); covers 80+ periods at ~10 demand/period; no pipeline beyond that (P44-46 orders=0). Massive buffer vs low demand. (e) Order 0: Minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) on excess inventory; trough forecast needs no replenishment for 4+ lead time horizon; reassess if demand rebounds post-NY.",
