Rely on provided historicals: stable ~50-60/period, avg 53, std~5. No sustained shift evident; forecast ~53/period short-term, potential spring decline later.\n(c) Lead time/missing: Promised 4 periods.

Target 53 avg + minor safety (upside to 60 hist max) = 60 units for P5 demand. High profit ($4) vs holding ($1) justifies buffer vs lost sales (~$4 opp cost).
