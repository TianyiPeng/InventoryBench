(b) Demand regime: Early winter, volatile but mean ~32; no sustained shift (insufficient periods for new regime). Forecast ~25-35/period short-term, conservative due to season. (c) Lead time: Promised 4 periods, no conclude messages yet (Period 1, no history); no missing orders observable.

(e) Order logic: Cover (lead time 4 +1 current) =5 periods demand at ~32 avg =160 units; balances stockout risk (profit $4 high) vs holding $1; start conservative for volatile winter demand.",

Mid-February 2019 (Period 2: 2019/2/18), winter season in northern hemisphere; T-shirts may see indoor/layering demand. Presidents' Day (Feb 18, 2019) coincides with Period 2, potentially driving casual apparel sales. Recent historical: demand spiked to 79 in Period 1 (2/11), after 23 on 2/4; prior Jan varied 13-55 (avg ~32). Possible holiday/event boost post-Valentine's (2/14) or Presidents' Day.

Pipeline: 160 in-transit (covers ~2-3 periods at 50-80 forecast). No overdue orders. P2 sales=0 expected (post-decision demand from on-hand=0).

Conservative at 160 to match prior order, build buffer for spikes/lead-time risk, balance holding $1 vs profit $4 (break-even ~20%).",

Date 2019-12-23 (Mon pre-Christmas Tue24/Thu25) in winter; T-shirts typically low-demand in cold holiday season vs summer peaks. No holiday-specific boost expected (not gift/novelty item); aligns with historical winter lows. (b) Demand regime: Winter decline sustained P39-P45 avg~80, recent P43-P45 avg45 (53,35,47 std~9) vs P39-P42 avg108 (-58%) or P42-P44 avg71 (-37%), very low/stable pre-Christmas; volatility minimal (std~9 vs prior ~45). Carry-overs confirm progression. Forecast P46: ~40-60 (conservative low). (c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods across all arrivals (latest P45: P41 order); no drifts/losses. In-transit 100 = P42 order, arrives P46. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 738 (+100 P46 arrival \u2192 ~838 start P46), post-P46 pipeline empty (P43-P45 orders=0). At ~50 demand/period, covers 15+ periods; holding risk high ($1/unit/period). (e) Order logic: Zero order; ample cover for low winter demand, avoids pipeline bloat/excess holding amid decline.
