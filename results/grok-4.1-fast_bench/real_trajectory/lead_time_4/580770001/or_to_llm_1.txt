Demand analysis: Recent P37-P41 demands (26,42,17,14,12) avg ~22, aligning with carry-over 'low knitwear demand extended into early November: P37-P40 avg 25 (-32% vs prior)'; P41=12 sustains this pattern. Seasonal context: 2019-11-25 (Black Friday week, pre-Christmas), knitwear (women's cotton-blend jumper) could see holiday uptick for gifting/winter wear, but no sustained evidence yet (recent 5 periods low, vs fall surge P30-P33 avg~113); initial historical Feb demands high (avg~140) but irrelevant to current regime. OR recommendation: 0 units, based on full history mean pulled low by summer lows and recent declines, using promised L=4; appropriate given high stock and no pipeline needs. Strategy: Follow OR at 0; high on-hand minimizes holding costs while covering low-demand outlook and any moderate holiday lift (projected \u03bc\u0302~(1+4)*22=110 over review+lead, well below 523); avoid overordering as profit=holding=1 creates no gain from excess safety stock.",
