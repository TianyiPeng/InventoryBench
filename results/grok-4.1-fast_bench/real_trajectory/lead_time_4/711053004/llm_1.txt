Date 2019-02-11 (Monday, week of Valentine's Day Feb 14; post-Chinese New Year Feb 5 which likely spiked prior demand to 62 on Feb 4). T-shirts are year-round staples but show ramp-up possibly due to early spring transition or post-holiday refresh in northern hemisphere winter.(b) Demand regime: Historical weekly demand strongly trending up (6,13,32,49,62); linear regression (t=1 to 5): slope=14.8, intercept=-12, R^2 implied strong fit. Forecasts: Period 1 (t=6):77, P2(t=7):92, P3:106, P4:121, P5:136. No regime shift yet, continuation of growth.(c) Lead-time vs. missing orders: Period 1, no 'conclude' messages or arrivals observed; promised LT=4, no evidence of deviation or losses.(d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0 (post-P0), in-transit=0; no coverage for P1 demand (~77 expected lost sales/profit).(e) Final order logic: Inventory position (on-hand 0 + in-transit 0 + order) must cover expected demand over LT+1=5 periods per mechanism (~77+92+106+121+136=532). No safety stock (insufficient variance data, conservative start). Order exactly 532 to target base-stock level balancing service vs. holding.",
