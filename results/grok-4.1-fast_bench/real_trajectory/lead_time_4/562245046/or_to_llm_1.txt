{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 4 periods confirmed in all recent concludes (e.g., P46 arrived from P42 lt=4; P45 from P41 lt=4; P44 from P40 lt=4; P43 from P39 lt=4), no deviations or lost shipments observed. Pipeline: In-transit 1000 units matches P43 order=1000 (arrives during P47 after decision, visible P48). On-hand=721 (P46 ending). Total position=1721 before any P47 demand. Demand analysis: Holiday peak passed (Thanksgiving P42=999, early-Dec P43=922); recent P44-46 avg=210 (210/245/174, -78% vs P42-43 avg~960), post-Christmas (P46=12/23) into New Year's Eve (P47=12/30) confirms sustained drop for women's jeans (not NYE-specific). Historical initial avg~119, but recent low aligns with post-holiday normalization. No seasonality spike expected now. OR rec=0 uses promised L=4 and full history; aligns perfectly with high position vs low ~200/period outlook over L+1=5 periods (~1000 demand). Strategy: Follow OR 0; ample coverage, minimize ending inventory holding cost in potential endgame (P47/47).",
