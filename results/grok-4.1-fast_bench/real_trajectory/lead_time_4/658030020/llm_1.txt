Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "(a) Product: Ladies push-up denim jeggings (skinny, stretch denim trousers). Casual fashion lower bodywear. Date 2019/12/30: Post-Christmas (Dec25), pre-NYE (Dec31). Post-holiday returns/gift shopping + NYE casual outfits could sustain mild demand elevation, but denim less formal than dresses; expect drop from peak toward winter baseline ~60 after pre-Xmas surge (P44-45:99-106). (b) Demand regimes per carry-over: Winter low ~58.5 (P39-42), pre-Xmas surge P44-45 avg102.5 (+75%), P46:85 (-20% from P45) suggests peak waning but volatile holiday tail (avg P44-46~97 > winter). No new sustained shift (needs 3+ periods); forecast P47 ~75-90 tapering to ~60 winter floor. Historical early-year spikes (Jan-Feb:35-166) hint potential Jan rebound, but prioritize recent. (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (all recent arrivals confirm, e.g., P46 from P42); no missing/lost orders (all track perfectly). (d) On-hand:340 (ample, covers 4-5 periods at 70-80 avg). Pipeline/in-transit:120 (P46 order, arrives P50). Expected arrivals: P47:0 (P43=0), P48:0(P44), P49:0(P45), P50:120. Post-P50 gap covered by current stock. High inv risks holding costs ($1/unit/period). (e) Order 0: Pipeline + on-hand covers 5+ periods (L+1=5) at forecast 70-90 near-term tapering to 60; avoids excess buildup amid post-holiday decline risk; monitor for Jan uptick.",
