======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "(a) Product: Ladies push-up denim jeggings (skinny, stretch, low-waist). Fall/winter denim relevant, peaked in Sep-Oct (back-to-school/fall fashion P30-36: avg 138-152), post-Thanksgiving drop confirmed P43-45 avg 59.7 (-67%). Current 2019/12/30: post-Christmas slump expected (holiday fatigue, returns over new purchases); New Year's Eve minor but denim not primary partywear. No major uplift anticipated. (b) Demand regimes: High fall peak P30-42 avg ~130-180, sharp drop post-Thanksgiving P43-46: 35/69/75/31 (avg 52.5, -60% from prior highs), sustained low volatile regime 4 periods matching seasonal winter denim slowdown. Pre-game early-year data (38-73) irrelevant now. (c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods across all arrivals (latest P46:220 from P42); no drifts or losses (all orders conclude on time). In-transit=0, no missing shipments. (d) Inventory: On-hand=1301 (from P46 end), covers ~25 periods at 50 demand avg; pipeline empty (no orders P43+). High holding exposure but no stockouts risk. (e) Order 0: Massive buffer vs. low forecast (40-60); prioritize depleting inventory to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while service level 100% safe. Reassess if demand spikes unexpectedly.",
