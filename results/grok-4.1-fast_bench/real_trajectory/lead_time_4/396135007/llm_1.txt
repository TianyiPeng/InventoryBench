Date 2019-02-11 (winter, post-Chinese New Year Feb 5, pre-Valentine's Feb 14). Shorts typically peak summer, but sweatshirt fabric suggests year-round comfort; no strong event tie-in for spikes/drops. Historical demand Jan7-Feb4 steady ~49/wk despite winter, implying stable non-seasonal baseline. (b) Demand regime: Historical samples (45,52,45,54,47) mean=48.6, std~4.1 (low variance, CV=8%); no evidence of shifts or seasonality in data. Period 1 forecast: 49 units. (c) Lead time: Promised 4 periods; no 'conclude' messages yet (Period 1 start), cannot infer actual LT or losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; position=0 (< expected demand). Period 1 stockout inevitable (~49 lost sales). No pipeline fill. (e) Final order logic: Multi-period base-stock policy optimal given P=H=$1 (50% service fractile, mean suffices). S = E[D]*(LT+1) = 48.6*5=243. Order 243 to target S, initiate pipeline for Periods 5+; adjust future based on actual arrivals/demand.",

Oct 14, 2019 is mid-fall; northern hemisphere autumn reduces shorts demand significantly post-summer peak (historical surges Apr-Jun up to 163, sharp Sep decline to 11-26). No major events boosting shorts (e.g., no Indian Summer spike evident). (b) Demand regime: Sustained deep post-summer trough per carry-over (P30-32 avg22; recent P32-35:14,24,26,26 avg22.5, stable low ~25 with minor stabilization P33-35 avg25, no upward shift vs prior lows). Forecast P36: 20-30. (c) Lead time: Confirmed consistent 4 periods (e.g., P26 order arrived P30; no recent orders, no in-transit, no overdue/missing). (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 766 (post P35:792-26=766), in-transit 0. Covers 25+ periods of forecast demand (766/25~30 periods); excess due to prior overordering in peaks. (e) Order logic: Order 0; high on-hand incurs holding costs ($1/unit/period), low demand risks no stockouts for remaining ~12 periods (47 total); deplete inventory to maximize R_t.",
