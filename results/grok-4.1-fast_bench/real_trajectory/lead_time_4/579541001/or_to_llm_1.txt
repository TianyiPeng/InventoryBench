{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 4 periods as per multiple confirmations (e.g., latest arrivals in P46 conclude trace back correctly; no lost shipments evident, all recent orders accounted for in pipeline). Inventory analysis: On-hand=568 (high, post-P46 ending after low demand=109), in-transit=500 (includes P43 order=200 arriving P47? Wait, P46 conclude shows arrived=0 for P46 order=300; in-transit reflects undelivered like P42=0,P44=0,P45=0,P46=300 plus earlier if any, but total 500 suggests pipeline building but all on schedule). Demand analysis: Recent P43-P46: 69,105,136,109 (avg 105), confirming no holiday surge despite pre-Christmas ramp signals; aligns with extended post-Thanksgiving lull into late Dec for knitwear (post-Xmas 12/30 likely continued low winter sales pre-NY). Calendar: 2019/12/30 post-Christmas lull expected for apparel, no immediate surge drivers. OR rec=0 uses promised L=4 and full history (diluted by low summer periods), but reality matches: high inventory covers 10+ periods even at fall peak ~260 (1068 total /260 ~4 periods, but low recent demand extends further). Strategy: Follow OR 0 to avoid excess holding costs ($1/unit/period on already 568+ incoming); replenish only if demand spikes next periods.",
