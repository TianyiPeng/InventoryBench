Demand analysis: Historical samples (2019-01-07:102, 01-14:89, 01-21:87, 01-28:148, 02-04:148) yield mean \u03bc\u0304=114.8, std dev \u03c3\u0304\u224830.8; recent 2 periods avg 148 (+29% vs prior mean), possible uptick but not yet sustained (only 2/5 periods); product is women's long-sleeved jersey basic top, suitable for Feb 11 winter demand, no major calendar events imminent (Valentine's minor impact).
