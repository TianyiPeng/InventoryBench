(c) Lead time: Consistently 4 periods across all arrivals (e.g., P46 none as expected; no losses/missing). (d) Inventory/pipeline: OH=0; IT=220 [P43 ord100->P47 arr100; P46 ord120->P50 arr120]; gaps P48/P49 arr=0 (P44/P45 ord=0) \u2192 stockouts expected ~140 each; P47: start100 post-arr, exp sell100/dmd140 \u2192 end0; cumulative pipeline covers ~220 next 4p but gaps lose ~280 sales. (e) Order logic: Order 140 for P51 arr (matches recent peak avg, builds buffer post-gaps for Jan winter ~80-100 + safety 40 for volatility/stockout risk; balances profit=1 vs holding=1, avoids overstock as post-holiday drop likely).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday winter demand surge confirmed: P44-P46 avg112 (+50% vs P37-P43 avg68), sustained 3 periods with peaks 118/153 causing stockouts.",
