Forecast P47 ~70 (conservative slump). Expect gradual winter recovery P48+ to ~110, but no evidence of immediate rebound.\n(c) Lead time: Confirmed 4 periods consistently (e.g., P46 arr from P42:4; P45 from P41:4; no deviations/losses; all orders conclude on time).\n(d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=383 (covers ~5 periods at 70dem or 3 at 120). In-transit=1200: 800 arr P47 (P43 order), 400 arr P50 (P46 order). No arr P48(P44 ord=0)/P49(P45=0). Projected (at 80dem): P47 end~1103; P48~1023; P49~943; P50~1363-80=1283 (safe, but monitors P49 low if dem=120). Total pipeline covers 15+ periods at 100dem.\n(e) Order logic: Ample coverage post-P47 arrival; taper post-holiday. Order 300 for P51 arrival to replenish pipeline ahead of potential winter rise (~110), balancing stockout risk (P49 vulnerable if dem>100) vs holding ($1/unit); matches prior winter prep orders (200-400).",
