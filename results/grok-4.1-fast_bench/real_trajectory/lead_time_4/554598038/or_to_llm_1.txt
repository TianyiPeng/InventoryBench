OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised L=4 and full history (diluted by early low demands like P1-P4 avg<50); their base-stock likely sees high pipeline exceeding forecast mu_hat.

Lead time consistently 4 periods confirmed across history (e.g., P46 arrive from P42, P44 from P40, etc.); no lost shipments recently, in-transit=0.

OR recommends 33 based on historical/predicted L=4, but order placed now arrives P51 (non-existent), so useless. Demand outlook: post-Christmas winter low, no calendar rebound expected (New Year's minor for T-shirts). Strategy: order 0 to avoid phantom order; let on-hand cover P47 demand, minimizing end holding via sales.",
