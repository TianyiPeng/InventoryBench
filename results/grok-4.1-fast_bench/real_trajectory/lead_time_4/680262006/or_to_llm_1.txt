No evidence of lost shipments; in-transit 150 is P43 order, expected to arrive in P47 (43+4). Inventory position: On-hand 486 + in-transit 150 = 636 total pipeline, extremely high vs recent low demand (P25-43 avg ~7, even with P42 spike to 30). Demand analysis: Prolonged low demand confirmed into fall (carry-over P30), with isolated P42 holiday spike (Thanksgiving 2019-11-25) to 30 (+400% vs prior avg), but P43 dipped back to 3 \u2013 not yet sustained. Seasonality: Product is winter sports tights/leggings; current date 2019-12-09 enters Christmas peak (P44-47: Dec 9-30), cold weather/holiday shopping likely to drive surge similar to early-year highs (P1-8 avg ~140).
