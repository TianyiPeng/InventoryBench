Sports tights demand typically low in summer/fall but rebounds in winter for layering/cold weather; historical winter highs ~130 avg (Feb-Mar 2019), summer lows ~5-10. No major event spike expected yet (Halloween unlikely for sports tights), but cooling temps may start gradual uptick. (b) Demand in sustained low regime per carry-over (early Oct avg~6); recent P32-37: 3,8,8,3,8,10 (avg~7, volatile but stable low ~8); slight uptick P36-37 (8,10) but not sustained shift (needs 3+ periods). Forecast P38 ~8-12. (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (e.g., P32 order arrived P36; prior P1-4 arrived P5-8). No in-transit, no overdue/missing orders. (d) On-hand 1515 (post-P37:1515), covers ~150+ periods at ~10/wk; pipeline empty. High inv vs low demand risks holding costs but buffers potential winter rebound. (e) Order 0: excessive inv (1515 >> forecast), no pipeline need, confirmed L=4 means future orders arrive late (P38 order at P42); prioritize reducing holding drag over low-prob near-term demand.",
