Historical pre-2019 ramps late Jan/early Feb. Forecast: 45-50/period near-term, potential 60+ P14. (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (carry-over: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7); P9 order=200 in-transit, due P13 (9+4=13, no concludes yet but on track, no missing orders). (d) On-hand=72 (covers ~1.5 periods); in-transit=200 arrives P13 (post-decision, yields ~72+200-demand=~225 end-P13); post-P13 pipeline empty. Projected: End-P13~225, P14~180, P15~135, P16~90, P17~45 (at 45/period) risking stockout P18. (e) Order 200 to arrive P17, replenishing ~4 periods ahead (covers P17-P21 at 45/period with safety for Mother's Day volatility/seasonal rise); balances stockout risk (high profit) vs holding (pipeline then ~400 covers 9 periods); conservative vs prior excess but matches P9 logic under similar drawdown.",
