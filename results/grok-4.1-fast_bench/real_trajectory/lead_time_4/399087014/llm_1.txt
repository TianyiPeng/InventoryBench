Date 2019/12/30 (post-Christmas, New Year's Eve week): holiday shopping peaks over (P45:204 pre-Xmas, P46:140 Xmas week), expect post-holiday drop like P43-44 (43,31 after P42:133 Thanksgiving?), despite NYE sales/resolutions boosting modestly. Winter jeans demand steady but not peak. (b) Demand regime: Holiday spikes event-driven (P42/45/46 high), base fall ~69 (SD~15 P27-32), recent non-spike Nov ~40-50; forecast P47 ~50-80 reverting post-peak. (c) Lead time: Confirmed 4 periods consistently (e.g., P46 arr from P42, P41 from P37, etc.); no losses/missing orders observed. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 59 (low). In-transit 450 = P43:100 (arr P47), P44:100 (P48), P46:250 (P50); gap at P49. Projected at 70 demand: P47 start 159 end~89; P48 end~119; P49 end~49 (risk if >100); P50 refills to ~279. (e) Order 100 for P51: Covers P49 pinch/risk of sustained holiday tail (~80-100), replenishes pipeline conservatively vs holding cost; avoids excess atop P50:250 while ensuring service level.",
