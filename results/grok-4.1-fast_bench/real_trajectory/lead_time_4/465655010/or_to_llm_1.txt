Inventory position: on-hand=278, in-transit=0 (no pipeline), so total available=278 units entering P43. Demand analysis: History shows volatile regimes per carry-over (recent lows P35-P41 avg ~15-30, but P42 spike to 379 amid late Nov/early Dec holiday onset - Thanksgiving Nov28, Cyber Monday Dec2 on P43 date); product is women's thong lingerie, prone to holiday gift/party demand surges around Christmas (Dec25, ~3 weeks away). Carry-over confirms repeated boom-bust cycles, with P42 signaling new high regime start (+2000% from P39-41 avg~25). OR recommendation=150 uses full history (diluted by long lows) and promised L=4, yielding conservative base-stock ignoring recency/holidays. Strategy: Override upwards - forecast ~200/period x (1+4)=1000 total need over review+lead; 278 covers ~1.4 periods, so order 300 to replenish moderately (balance stockout risk vs holding cost=profit=1; avoids overcap given few periods left /47).
