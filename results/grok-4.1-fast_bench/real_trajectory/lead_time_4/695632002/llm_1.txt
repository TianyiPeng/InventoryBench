Matches historical Jan avg ~130. (b) Demand regime: post-holiday drop P44-P46 avg 124 (131,157,83) vs. fall/winter P35-P41 avg ~168 (-26%); low post-peak aligns with carry-over holiday buildup ending, no rebound signal. Forecast P47 ~120-150 conservative. (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods across all arrivals (latest P46: P42 order); no overdue/missing orders. In-transit 750 = P43:500 (arr P47) + P46:250 (arr P50). (d) Inventory: on-hand 349 + P47 arr 500 = 849 start (covers >>150); projected ends ample even at 200/wk (P47: ~650, P48: ~450 w/0 arr, P49: ~250 w/0 arr, P50: ~400 post+250); total supply 1099 covers 7+ wks at 150/wk, excess buildup risks holding costs. (e) Order 0: high coverage through P50+ minimizes further accumulation given low recent demand/post-holiday drop; profit=holding=1 implies avoid excess to limit multi-period holds (net loss if held >1 pd post-arrival).",
