(e) Order 200 to replenish P50 arrival amid holiday volatility, match BF-scale spike forecast (385/2~200 conservative), cover post-P49 recovery while balancing hold cost (profit=hold=1, prioritize service); avoids overstock given incoming pipeline.",

  "rationale": "(a) World/product: Women's cotton jersey/lace hipster briefs (underwear bottom, lingerie). Everyday essential with modest holiday gifting uplift. P47 (2019/12/30): post-Christmas/New Year's Eve; expect normalization to recent post-BF avg ~118 (P43-46:111,105,117,140), forecast 120. BF P42=385 outlier; Christmas P46=140 modest, no sustained spike. (b) Demand regime: P43-46 avg118 aligns with post-BF normalization (carry-over P46); prior moderate-high ~126 (P38-41). No new sustained shift (requires 3+ periods; P46 single elevation insufficient). (c) Lead time vs missing: Consistent 4 periods (all recent arrives confirm, e.g., P46 arr from P42). No losses. Pipeline verified: 200 (P43\u2192P47),140(P44\u2192P48),0(P45\u2192P49),200(P46\u2192P50); totals 540. (d) Inventory/pipeline: Pre-arr P47 on-hand67 \u2192 post-arr267 (covers >>120 dem, exp end147). Projections (dem=120): P48 end167, P49 start167 end47, P50 end127, P51 start127. High scenario (dem=140): P49 start127 end-13? Wait 127-140<0 but sold127 end0; P51 start (P50 end=200[P50 arr]-140=60) =60. Ample buffer overall, P49 risk only extreme (>140-160 unlikely post-holiday). (e) Final order: Order 100 for P51 arr to buffer P51 start (exp127 avg/60 high dem) + variance/sustained regime risk, targeting ~end20 safety without excess holding (profit=holding=1 balances low stockout risk vs cost).",
