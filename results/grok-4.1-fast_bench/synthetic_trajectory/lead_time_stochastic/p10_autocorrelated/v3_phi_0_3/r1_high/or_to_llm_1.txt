{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LT=3 periods (P41 order arrived P44: 44-41=3; P42->P45:3), consistent with carry-over Period 47 stabilization at 3 (vs promised 2); no new arrivals in P46-P48 concludes (arrived=0), so P46 order (150u, placed P46) expected in P49 if LT=3, but unconfirmed yet; variability historical but recent stable 3. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 entering P49, high stockout risk; in-transit=1865 massively inflated by sustained lost shipments (carry-over totals >1515u confirmed e.g. P2=172, P6=293, P17/P19/P33/P37/P41=150 each, etc.), lost orders remain in-transit indefinitely - treat effective pipeline as near 0 despite nominal high. Demand analysis: Recent P44-48 demands=154,81,150,112,87 (avg 116.8, std~30.4, volatile); longer P40-48 avg~108; early P1-5 avg~118, low regime P6-9 ~73 overcome; no calendar/dates for seasonality, chips(Regular) steady retail demand ~110-120 baseline. OR recommendation: 0 units - follows base-stock minus bloated pipeline (ignores losses/LT shifts), overly conservative. Final strategy: Override OR to 150 units - covers ~1.3x recent avg demand (116*1.3~150) for LT+1=4 periods coverage (~464u needed but phased orders, near-end game P49/50 limits holding exposure); consistent with recent successful orders (150u batches arrive eventually); prioritizes avoiding stockouts (profit $19>>holding $1), assumes P46 150u may arrive P49 helping immediately; low risk as post-P50 arrivals irrelevant.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmations (P41\u2192P44 LT=3, P42\u2192P45 LT=3 per carry-over P47) suggest LT stabilized at ~3, but no arrivals in P46-P49 despite expectations for P43-P46 orders (e.g., P46 order=150 expected P48-P49, arrived=0), reinforcing sustained loss pattern (total lost >1515u + recent). In-transit 2015u largely unreliable due to indefinite lost shipments. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0, multiple recent stockouts (P47-49 sold=0 despite demands 112/87/67), recent 10-period avg demand=105 (P40-49: volatile std~35, sum=1051), early avg~118, low regime ended. No calendar/product seasonality signals. OR rec=0 assumes reliable pipeline using promised LT=2 & historical data, ignores losses/variability. Strategy: Override to 150 units - covers ~1.5 periods expected demand (105*1.5~158) accounting for LT~3 +1 obs delay, matches recent ordering pattern during stockouts, builds buffer vs. losses; avoids overordering given holding cost.",
