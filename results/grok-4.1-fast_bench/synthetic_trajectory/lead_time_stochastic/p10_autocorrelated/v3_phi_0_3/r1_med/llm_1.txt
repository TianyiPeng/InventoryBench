Forecast P14 ~110. (c) Lead_time vs. missing orders: Actual LT varies (1 or 3 observed, promised 2); LT=3 sustained for reliable shipments (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8); LT=1 sporadic (P3\u2192P4, P7\u2192P8, P8\u2192P9).

P12(150) no arrival P13 (rules out LT=1, expect P15 LT=3); P13(150) pending (possible LT=1 arrive during P14 unseen until P15, but pattern suggests LT=3\u2192P16); no new lost confirmed.

Pipeline covers ~2 periods post-LT but gap now. (e) Final order logic: Order 150 to match recent orders/forecast (~110 demand + safety for volatility/LT=3 unreliability); replenishes pipeline for P17+ (arrive P17 LT=3); prioritizes service level (lost sales cost $4 profit) over holding ($1); avoids overorder given ghosts bloating in-transit.",
