Promised LT=2, but actual varies 1-3. No arrivals in P45-48 (4 consecutive periods) despite expected deliveries (e.g., P45 order 140 expected P48 if LT=3), extending lost shipment drought pattern (prior 5-6 period droughts noted).

Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (imminent stockout for P49 demand ~90-100), but pipeline=1494 covers 15+ periods at avg demand ~100, even assuming 50% loss rate still ample (~7 periods). Demand analysis: Recent P44-48: 88,125,87,69,82 (avg~90, mixed after P30-33 high avg131 +25% shift; no sustained softening confirmed as only 3-4 low periods). OR rec=0 based on promised LT=2 and full history (empirical mean likely ~100, base-stock minus huge pipeline=0). Strategy: Follow OR at 0 - massive IT buffers against LT variability/losses; avoid adding to bloated non-arriving pipeline which incurs opportunity cost (lost sales elsewhere?) and potential holding if sporadic arrivals resume. Prioritize not overordering until drought breaks with confirmed arrivals.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: From history and carry-over, actual LT varies (1-3 periods confirmed, e.g., recent P40\u2192P43 LT=3, P41\u2192P44 LT=3); promised LT=2 unused by us. Current 5-period drought (P45-49 no arrivals) despite expected deliveries (e.g., P45/P46 orders overdue if LT=3), signaling persistent lost shipments; in-transit 1494 likely bloated with non-arriving units (prior patterns show 300-1000+ lost). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (stockouts P45-49, lost sales ~88 avg demand/period \xd75=440 units \xd7$19 profit=$8360 opportunity cost); pipeline 1494 covers >> (L+1)=4 periods demand (~400 units even at 100 avg).

OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock exceeded by massive pipeline under promised LT=2/historical demand; ignores losses/LT variability). Final strategy: Follow OR 0 - pipeline vastly exceeds needs even with 50-70% loss rate (consistent with history); ordering adds to lost/holding risk without near-term benefit (imminent arrivals unlikely in drought); prioritize avoiding excess on-hand holding ($1/unit/period) post-drought resumption.",
