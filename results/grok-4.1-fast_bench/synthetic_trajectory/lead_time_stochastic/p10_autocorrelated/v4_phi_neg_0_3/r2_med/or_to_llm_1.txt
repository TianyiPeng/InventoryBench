{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: LT remains variable 1-3 periods per recent confirms (e.g., P45: P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2; P43: P40 LT=3) and carry-over (P44 notes variability persists); no new LT data in P49 conclude (arrived=0). Use LT=2-3 for planning, covering 3-4 periods ahead. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 after P49 stockout (demand=137 >46 on-hand, sold=46); in-transit=2473 grossly inflated by confirmed losses totaling ~2733u (carry-over P49: +300 for P44/45 lost, prior ~2433u), effective pipeline minimal ~200u (e.g., P48 order 200 pending exp P50-51). Demand analysis: Recent volatile (P46=48 low, P47=119, P48=82, P49=137 high), historical avg ~100/period (initial P1-5 ~100, full history ~95); no sustained regime shift (single high P49 not 3+ periods). OR recommendation=0 ignores losses & effective low pipeline, assumes i.i.d. & promised LT=2 covers via high in-transit. Strategy: Override OR to order 250 (covers ~2.5 periods avg demand 100 + safety for volatility/LT=3), building buffer against stockouts & losses; target base-stock ~400 (4*100) minus effective pipeline ~200; conservative vs uncapped higher to avoid excess holding given loss risk.",
