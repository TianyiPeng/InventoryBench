Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (stockout in P48), in-transit=1321 bloated with persistent ghosts (~1161u+ from carry-over P48, plus recent P46/47/48 orders 120+130+130=380 potentially real but at risk); no arrivals P46-P48 despite overdues (e.g., P46 ord120 at LT3=P49 window, P47 ord130 LT2=P49, P48 ord130 LT1=P49), expect possible partial arrivals in P49 but high loss risk per pattern.

Losses pattern persists, inflating in-transit. Pipeline reconciliation: Total in-transit 1441u, but ghosts ~1161u (P48 insight) + P46 120u lost = ~1281u ghosts; effective pipeline ~160u (P47+P48+P49 orders 130+130+120), expected to arrive LT1-3 but high loss risk, near-term arrivals low.
