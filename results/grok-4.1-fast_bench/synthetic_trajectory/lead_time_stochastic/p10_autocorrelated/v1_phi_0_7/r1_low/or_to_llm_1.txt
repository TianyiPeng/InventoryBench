{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised L=2, but history shows variability (1-3 periods observed in arrives, e.g., P49 conclude arrived=0 confirms no recent arrivals; carry-over notes frequent losses with total confirmed lost 1694 units, in-transit 1994 bloated by non-arriving orders staying indefinitely). Inventory: On-hand=0 (risk of stockout in P50), pipeline unreliable due to losses (effective pipeline <<1994). Demand analysis: Recent sustained high regime confirmed P46-P49 avg 150.5 (145,151,165,141), up ~29% from prior; P49=141 continues pattern. OR recommends 0 (base-stock exceeded by bloated pipeline using promised L=2 and full history mean ~100ish, ignoring losses/regime). Strategy: Override OR's 0 with 150 units to target recent demand mean, cover (L+1)=3 periods ~450 but cap considering losses/uncertainty; prevents further stockouts (recent lost sales P47-P49: ~457 units missed) while avoiding excess hold since arrivals spotty. Ties to high demand outlook, unreliable LT/losses vs OR baseline.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 150 units - recent demand sustained high avg 150.5 (P46-49:145,151,165,141), on-hand=0 risks stockout, in-transit 1994 unreliable (1694 confirmed lost inflating pipeline).",
