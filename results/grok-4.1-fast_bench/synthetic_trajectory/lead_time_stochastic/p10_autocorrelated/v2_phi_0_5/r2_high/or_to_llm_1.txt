{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent arrivals show variability L=1-3 (e.g., P44 conclude: P41 order L=3; prior P40: P39 L=1, P39: P38 L=1, P37: P35 L=2/P36 L=1); no arrivals in P45-47 concludes (arrived=0 each), consistent with promised L=2+ variability and no new losses since P25 (supplier reliability improved per carry-over). Outstanding orders include at least P46's 130 (expected P48 if L=2, P49 if L=3), plus others accumulating to total in-transit 1043 units - no evidence of new losses (prolonged overdue would be noted). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (stockouts in P46-47: demands 80/78 unsold), but massive pipeline 1043 units (~10-13 periods at recent ~80-100 demand) ensures coverage for remaining 3 periods (48-50); expected arrivals soon (e.g., recent orders arriving L=1-3). Demand analysis: Recent P45-47: 127/80/78 avg=95 (rebound from P41-44 low avg~28), aligns with historical \u03bc~98-100; volatile but stabilizing ~90-100, no sustained new regime (3 periods borderline per conservative threshold); no calendar/dates for seasonality. OR recommendation: 0 units - appropriate given high pipeline and OR's base-stock capping (uses promised L=2, full history \u03bc/\u03c3); no override needed as additional order in P48 risks arrival post-P50 or high ending holding cost ($1/unit) with already ample supply. Strategy: Order 0 to avoid overstock/holding penalties near game end, rely on pipeline for demands ~100/period x3=300 max needed vs 1043 incoming.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent arrivals show variability L=1-3 (e.g., P41 order arrived P44 L=3; prior P36-39 L=1-2). P46 order (130 units) expected P49 if L=3 (P46+3=49), consistent with recent patterns; no arrival in P48 aligns with L=3 not L=2. No new confirmed losses since P25 (reliability improved per carry-over), but historical losses (~913+ units) remain in in-transit, inflating total 1043 unrealistically. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 risks stockout in P49 (demand after decision, reliant on P49 arrivals ~130 expected); effective pipeline unreliable due to ghost lost units. Demand analysis: P45-48 demands 127/80/78/118 avg 101, sustained rebound (+260% vs P41-44 low avg 28), matching historical \u03bc~98-100; 4 consecutive elevated periods post-lows confirm uptick (per carry-over extension). OR recommendation: 0 units, as pipeline (1043) >> base_stock (~3*\u03bc + safety for L=2 promised), but OR ignores losses inflating pipeline and recent demand rebound/stockouts (P46-48 sold=0). Final strategy: Override OR upwards to 120 units (recent demand avg), hedging delayed arrivals/lost ghosts, covering ~1-2 periods demand post-expected P49 arrival (130), prioritizing profit (19/unit) over holding (1/unit); avoids overorder given cap logic and high nominal pipeline.",
