History confirms high loss rate (in-transit 1223 entirely permanent losses per carry-over, no realizable pipeline). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering P50; no reliable arrivals expected soon due to loss pattern, risking P50 stockout (recent demands P45-49 avg 109: 127,80,78,118,141). Demand analysis: Upward rebound sustained P45-49 avg109 vs prior P41-44 avg28 (+290%), but volatile. OR recommendation: 0 units, based on promised LT=2 and full history (diluted by lows), but correctly ignores fake pipeline for ordering. Strategy: This is final period (50/50); order placed in P50 arrives post-game (LT>=1), cannot contribute to sales (only on-hand matters) and adds no holding cost (in-transit not charged). Follow OR exactly - no override needed as decision inert for objective.",
