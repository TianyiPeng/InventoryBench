Historical regimes alternate low/mid/high ~40-140. Forecast P50 ~110-130. (c) Lead time: Variable 1-3 periods confirmed (recent ex: P40 LT=3 to P43, P41 LT=3 to P44, P42 LT=3 to P45, P43 LT=2 to P45); no-arrivals gap P46-49 (4 straight periods) extends recurring delay/loss pattern (prior gaps 3-5 periods), many in-transit likely lost per history (e.g. P37 lost); promised LT=2 unreliable, expect arrivals sporadic/mixed. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout risk immediate), in-transit=1460 (~11 periods at avg100 demand) heavily accumulated from unresolved orders (recent P47/P48/P49 each 100 pending LT=2-3 \u2192 possible P50-P52 arrivals but gap pattern suggests delay/loss); high pipeline buffers future but on-hand holding risk if floods. (e) Final order logic: Order 130 to cover ~1-2 periods forecast demand (~120 avg recent) + safety for LT uncertainty/stockout loss ($4 profit > $1 holding); conservative vs peaks (141) due to massive pipeline/loss risk, prioritizes service level while minimizing added on-hand exposure.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand mid-high upturn sustained P44-49 avg98 (+133% from P40-44 avg42), 6 periods with recent highs 118-141 confirming shift; No-arrivals gap extended P46-49: 4 periods straight, recurring delay/loss pattern.",
