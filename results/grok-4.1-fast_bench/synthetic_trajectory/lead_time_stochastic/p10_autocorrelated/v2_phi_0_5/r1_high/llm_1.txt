(b) Demand upshift sustained from P37-P48 avg~129 (volatile range 76-166, P47=76 outlier, P48=128 rebound confirms high regime per P44 carry-over extension). (c) LT variable 1-3; recent LT=2-3 (P43 LT3, P44 LT3, P45 LT3/2); no-arrival streak P46-P48 (3 periods) aligns with LT=3 for P46 order (expected P49); historical losses (5+ noted) but no new confirmed (>3pd past LT3); promised LT=2 unreliable. (d) On-hand=0 risks P49 stockout (~130 demand, like P48=128 lost); in-transit=1840 bloated (pending + potential losses) >> remaining P49+P50 ~260, bursts expected post-streak (e.g. past P23=510 arrival). (e) Order 150 to cover potential P50 stockout (LT=1 arrives P50) given recent volatility/stockouts and LT=1 frequency; minimal holding risk near end ($1 low vs $19 profit), relies on pipeline for P49.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates provided; chips(Regular) is standard snack food with steady but volatile demand, no strong seasonal drivers identifiable. (b) Demand regime: Recent upshift P37-P46 sustained high avg~134 (volatile 109-166), softening P47-P49 (76,128,98 avg101, -25% vs prior) but only 3 periods volatile, not confirmed sustained downshift; last 10 periods P40-P49 avg123 (SD~24), forecast ~120-130 with safety for volatility. (c) Lead time: Historical LT=1-3 periods confirmed (recent e.g. P40\u2192P43 LT3, P41\u2192P44 LT3, P42\u2192P45 LT3, P43\u2192P45 LT2); no-arrival streak P46-P49 (4 periods), overdue for P46(150 LT3\u2192P49), P47(150 LT3\u2192P50), signaling potential new losses but pattern consistent with history (5+ prior losses); promised LT2 unreliable. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout risk for P50 demand post-arrival), in-transit=1990 massively bloated (cumulative ~13x recent order size, inflated by historical losses P2/P6/P17/P18/P19/P29/P30+ recent overdue); recent arrivals sparse (last in P45), but pipeline unreliable due to losses. (e) Final order logic: Order 150 to cover expected ~130 demand + safety stock for LT uncertainty/stockouts (recent P47-P49 lost ~300 sales @19profit/unit), despite bloated pipeline; low hold cost ($1) favors overstock vs stockout loss ($19); covers 1+ periods demand hedging LT1-3 + losses.",
  "carry_over_insight": "No-arrival streak extended P46-P49 (4 consecutive periods, matching prior max streaks); potential losses P46(150),P47(150) orders (overdue past LT3); in-transit record high 1990 signaling extreme pipeline bloat.",
