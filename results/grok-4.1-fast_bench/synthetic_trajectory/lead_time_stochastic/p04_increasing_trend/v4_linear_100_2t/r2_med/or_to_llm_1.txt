{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed sustained at 3 periods from recent arrivals (P41 order arr P44 LT3, P40 arr P43 LT3, P42 arr P45 LT3), with minor LT2 variation but overall 3; use L=3 for planning (cover 4 periods). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=557 (covers ~3 periods at recent avg 143), in-transit=2136 bloated with confirmed lost shipments (cumulative ~2536 per carry-over, recent P44:350 lost, effective real pipeline ~0 as no imminent arrivals expected - recent P45-P49 orders all 0, prior lost). Demand analysis: Recent 10 periods (P40-49) avg=143 (sum=1434), volatile (range 0-298, spikes ~300), historical spikes higher (e.g., P31:509); no calendar/seasonal cues. OR recommendation: 0 units, valid under its assumption of full pipeline delivery but ignores lost shipments - actual inventory position ~557 vs target ~600-800 (4*143=572 + safety ~200 for high vol z*~0.84, sigma_hat~sqrt(4)*~120=240). Strategy: Override to 300 units to rebuild effective position targeting ~850 (557+300 covers spikes over LT+1=4 periods), conservative vs larger past orders but avoids overholding given losses; monitor for arrivals.",
