(c) LT=3 predominant recent (sustained 4+ instances P40-45); loss pattern extreme (13+ confirmed, bloated in-transit); P46 order(300) lost (absent P49 lt=3), P47(300) pending P50 lt=3\u2014expect low arrival prob. (d) On-hand 1133 ample for 4-7 periods (~150-250); in-transit 4230 nominal but thin real pipeline per loss history (effective ~20-30% arrive); no P49 arrivals confirm thin near-term. (e) High OH minimizes stockout risk short-term; order conservatively 300 to hedge LT=3 pipeline (arrive ~P53) + losses, target cycle stock for ~2 periods demand (~400) minus excess OH, balance holding vs lost sales.",
