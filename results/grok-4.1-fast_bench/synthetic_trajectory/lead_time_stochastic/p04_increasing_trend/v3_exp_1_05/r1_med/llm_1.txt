(c) Lead time: varying 1-3 confirmed historically; recent delays extended (P46/P47 arrived=0, missing expected LT1-3 for P44/45/46 orders); no-arrival streak 2 periods reinforces unreliability/loss risk, but in-transit 9924 signals potential backlog arrivals soon per past resumption patterns (e.g., post-P18-22 streak). No confirmed new losses yet (P47 too recent). (d) Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0 (stockout risk P48); in-transit=9924 (~10 periods@1000/d demand, but delayed/unreliable); recent pipeline pileup from P44+:1300(P44),1400(P45),1500(P46),1600(P47)=5400+earlier, covering multi-periods if/when arrives; P48 arrivals unknown but probable given backlog. (e) Order logic: endgame (3 periods left), prioritize service level over holding (profit$4>holding$1); order 1700 to match ramp (P47:1600) and cover ~1.7x forecast demand for LT uncertainty + losses, ensuring pipeline for P49-50 even if LT=3 (arrives post-end but hedges delays); total pipeline post-order ~11600 covers 11+ periods.",

(c) LT unreliability persists: no arrivals P46-49 (4-period streak), e.g., P47 LT3/P48 LT2/P49 LT1 expected P50 but pattern suggests delays/losses possible; prior LT1-3 reconfirmed sporadically (e.g., P43 LT3/P44 LT3), promised LT2 irrelevant; in-transit 13424 bloated/unreliable with history of losses/delays. No new concludes yet for inference. (d) On-hand=0 risks P50 stockout if no arrivals; in-transit 13424 covers many periods theoretically (13424 / ~1100 = ~12 periods) but delays erode trust; recent stockouts P47-49 (sold=0 except partials), P48-49 full misses.
