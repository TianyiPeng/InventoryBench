{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variability 1-3 periods sustained (e.g., P40\u219243 LT=3, P41\u219244 LT=3, P42\u219245 LT=3, P43\u219245 LT=2, recent absences in P46-P49 concludes confirm delays/losses alongside LT=1-3). Promised LT=2 not reliable. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 entering P50 (stockout risk immediate); in-transit=9899 bloated by sustained lost shipments pattern (~7150+ units historically, recent 0 arrivals P46-P49 despite expected for P44=1400, P45=1500, P46=0, P47=0, P48=1400 due LT2-3). Effective pipeline unreliable/low despite nominal 9899. Demand analysis: Super-peak accelerating - P43-P49: 774,845,919,930,986,1036,1104 avg ~965 (+5% vs P43-P48 ~920 per carry-over), 7 periods very high with full stockouts P48-P49/near prior; upward trend sustained 23+ periods from P24 sub-surge, no reversal, recent +6% P49=1104 vs P48=1036. Historical early low demand (P1-P5 avg~96) irrelevant. OR recommendation: 0 units - ignores demand regime shift, losses, LT variability; uses full history mean ~250? pulled low + huge pipeline \u2192 order_raw negative. Strategy: Override OR aggressively - project P50+ demand ~1150+ (6% trend), cover LT+1=4 periods variability ~4600 but unreliable pipeline requires immediate high order to rebuild; ramp from P49's 1600 to 2000 balancing profit/holding (q=0.8 favors stocking) vs chronic stockouts costing 4*sold lost.",
