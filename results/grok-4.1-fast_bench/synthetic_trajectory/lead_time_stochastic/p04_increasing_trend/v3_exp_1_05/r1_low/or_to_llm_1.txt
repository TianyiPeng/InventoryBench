LT remains varying 1-3 periods with recent disruption and no-shows, promised LT=2 not reliable. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 entering P49, in-transit=6251 (bloated by ~2051 confirmed lost + recent overdue like P44 1000, P47 2000 pending LT>=2 potentially arriving P49/P50).

OR recommendation: 0 units - underestimates surge (uses full history equal-weight, low mean \u03bc\u0304, ignores LT/losses/pipeline reality, high pipeline caps order_raw<=0). Adjustment strategy: Override OR 0 to 1200 units (match P48 order, align recent demand avg 984 P46-P48) to bolster unreliable pipeline for potential P50 coverage if LT=1 (recent instances exist); endgame (49/50) prioritizes sales vs holding (profit=holding=1, but post-P50 no holding); hedges if P47 2000 arrives P49 (LT=2) leaving room, avoids further stockout losses (~1000+/period).

Recent orders P47(2000), P48(1200), P49(1200) still in-transit, expected LT=2-3 would arrive P49-P52 but pattern suggests risk of further losses/delays. In-transit 7451 includes confirmed lost shipments (prior total 2051 + new like P44 1000), so effective pipeline unreliable and lower than stated. Demand analysis: Sustained surge intensified, P46-P49 avg 1014 (930+986+1036+1104), up from P44-P47 avg 920 (+10%), P45-P49 avg 995; clear uptrend with new highs (P49=1104). Early history low (P1-P6 avg ~101), but regime shift long confirmed. No calendar/product seasonality signals beyond generic chips demand escalation. Inventory: On-hand=0, expect stockout P50 unless pending arrive (unlikely given recent zeros). OR recommends 0 (pipeline exceeds base_stock using historical mean ~ promised LT=2), but ignores losses, LT variability, and demand surge (OR uses full history diluting recent high demand). Strategy: Override OR aggressively; high in-transit illusory due to losses (effective coverage ~3-4 periods at 1000+ demand), need to order for (LT+1)=3-4 periods ahead covering ~1200 expected demand per period amid uptrend/losses.
