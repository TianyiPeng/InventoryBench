{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed variability 1-3 periods with frequent losses (e.g., P40 LT=3 arr P43, P41 LT=3 P44, P42 LT=3 P45; recent P46 order 1300 absent P49 conclude for LT=3, confirming loss). Promised LT=2 not reliable; use LT=3 expectation but discount for ~50% loss rate from history. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0; in-transit=11842 inflated by ghosts (prior 6042 + P46 1300 =7342 lost total); reliable pipeline ~4500 from recent P47(1400 exp P50 LT3), P48(1500 exp P51), P49(1600 exp P52), but pattern suggests high loss risk (no arrivals P46-P49 concludes). Demand analysis: Sustained upward trend P25-P49 avg ~620, but recent acceleration P43-P49 avg 948 (7 periods +37% vs earlier), P47-P49 avg 1032 (3 periods +8% vs P43-P46 909); forecast P50 ~1100 with continued rise. OR recommends 0 (naive high pipeline view ignores ghosts/losses); override aggressively. Strategy: Order 1700 to target base-stock for (L+1)=4 periods demand ~4400, minus reliable pipeline ~4500 (discounted 50% to ~2250 net need ~2150), rounded up for safety/ramp/uncertainty; aligns with prior ramp (P49=1600) to cover stockouts.",
