Inventory analysis: on-hand=0 guarantees P49 stockout or partial unless rare overdues arrive post-decision; pipeline unreliable due to ~high loss rate (multiple confirmed lost recently, e.g., prior P37/P30 etc.). Demand analysis: recent P45-P48 demands=4605/4638/4955/4820 avg=4755 (+2% vs P44-P47 avg=4667), confirming sustained uptrend from earlier ~4000s; forecast ~4800-5000 for P49/P50. OR recommendation: 0 units - overly conservative, ignores demand explosion (OR uses full history mean low, promised LT=2), high ghosts, recent stockouts (P47/P48 sold=0 costing ~$19k profit each), cannot detect losses/droughts. Strategy: override to 5100 units targeting recent demand avg + uptrend buffer for P50 coverage (assumes possible LT=1 arrival during P50); critical fractile q=4/5=0.8 favors avoiding stockouts ($4 profit loss >> $1 holding); near game-end (P50 last), minimal holding risk outweighs stockout; ensures replenishment amid supplier crisis.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variability persists with short streaks (e.g., P31-32 LT=1, P35 LT=2, P36 LT=1) interrupted by delays/losses; no new arrivals in P49 conclude confirms ongoing 4-period no-arrival streak (P46-P49 after P45 burst of 9000u), consistent with historical droughts followed by intermittent bursts; many prior orders confirmed lost after 3+ periods past LT=3 expectation (e.g., P30, P37), bloating in-transit with ghosts. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0 risks immediate stockout in P50 if no arrival (likely given streak), but in-transit=57064 vastly exceeds coverage for expected LT+1=4 periods at recent demand avg ~4774/period (19k needed); even at 50% historical loss rate, effective pipeline ~28k covers 6+ periods. Demand uptrend stabilized high: P46-P49 avg=4774 (4638,4955,4820,4681), +0.4% vs P45-P48=4755, +6% vs P43-P45~4500, but flat recent 3 periods post-peak P47. OR recommendation: 0 units (base stock exceeded by pipeline despite using promised L=2 and full history mean; sensible cap avoids overorder). Final strategy: Follow OR 0 - no override needed as bloated pipeline (from past aggressive orders amid losses) provides ample buffer against demand ~4800 and LT variability/losses; additional orders risk further ghosts/holding costs without imminent shortage post-arrival; monitor for P50 conclude arrivals to confirm drought end.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - massive 57k in-transit pipeline covers 12+ periods of ~4800 demand even with high historical losses, exceeding OR base stock; avoids adding to ghost accumulation during ongoing 4-period supplier drought.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Supplier no-arrival streak extended to 4 consecutive periods (P46-P49 concludes post-P45 9000u); Demand uptrend stabilized high: P46-P49 avg=4774 (+6% vs P43-P45 avg=4500 approx, flat recent 3 periods post-P47 peak)",
