  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: No 'Period X conclude' messages in history, so no actual lead time observations. Assume promised L=2 periods; order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 3 arrival resolution (visible in Period 3 conclude, read in Period 4). In-transit=0 confirms no prior orders outstanding. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so inventory position (IP)=0. Periods 1 and 2 demands fully stockout (unavoidable with L=2 at start). Order quantity sets IP=order, which must protect against demand over L+1=3 periods (Periods 1-3 statistically, though early lost).

No new LT variability or losses on recent orders. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0; in-transit=11100 with ~40-50% bloat from cumulative lost shipments (~5700+ older units per carry-over), effective pipeline ~6000-6600 units. Expected arrivals: P30 likely includes P28 order (2600, LT=2), P31 P29 order (2800, LT=2); recent deliveries reliable and full-sized.
