{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed variability 1-3 periods from prior concludes (e.g., P40 LT=3 in P43, P41 LT=3 P44, P42 LT=3 P45); recent drought P46-P49 (4 periods, arrived=0 each) with pending large orders P44(4600 LT>=6 now), P45(4700>=5), P46(4800>=4), P47(4800>=3), P48(4800>=2), P49(5000>=1) all overdue past max observed LT=3, strengthening large order (>4500) loss/delay pattern per carry-over. In-transit 50652 inflated by ~20k+ ghost losses (historical like P24/25/29/30/33 etc.), effective arriving pipeline near 0 given drought. Inventory: On-hand=0 post P49 stockout (demand=5048>0). Demand analysis: High stabilization ~4400-4500 per prior carry-over broken by uptrend resumption P46-P49 avg 4701 (4466\u21924468\u21924822\u21925048 sequential +10% vs P43-P45 avg 4280), confirming acceleration after prior flat. No calendar/product specifics, but chips demand exploding long-term. OR rec=0 assumes promised L=2 and full historical mean (diluted by early low demands), ignores recent surge/losses/drought, overestimates pipeline coverage. Strategy: Override to aggressive 5100 matching P49 demand +5% trend buffer; targets ~1 period coverage post-decision (L+1=3-4 periods total need ~15k but loss risk caps single order; avoids >5100 loss pattern while preventing stockouts (4 recent incl. P47-49 full). Builds pipeline despite risks as profit=19>>holding=1.",
