(c) LT variable 1-3 (recent ex: P31-32 LT1); high loss rate confirmed (multiple 100-200 unit orders lost, pattern continues); no arrivals P47-49 confirms prior losses (P44/45); P47(200 LT3?), P48(200 LT2?), P49(200 LT1?) likely lost soon but not yet 3+ past max LT; in-transit 2500 bloated w/ ghost lost units indefinitely. (d) On-hand=0 (stockouts P48-49); expected P50 arrivals uncertain (~200 from P47 if LT3/not lost, but pattern suggests low probability); effective pipeline low due to losses. (e) Forecast P50+ demand ~180; order 200 consistent w/ recent (covers 1 period demand + loss buffer); avoids stockout loss ($4/unit) vs holding ($1); maintains pipeline despite ghosts.",
