{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: From history and carry-over, LT remains variable (1-3 periods sustained, with recent LT=1 instances like P38-40, P31-33; also LT=2/3 and ongoing losses e.g., up to P29). No new conclusive arrivals in recent concludes (P45 last arrivals from P42/43; P46's 200 expected possibly LT=3 in P49). Promised LT=2, but actual variable/losses mean pipeline ETAs uncertain. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (risking P49 stockout if no arrivals), but in-transit=1973 units is massively oversized (covers 10+ periods at ~150 avg demand). Recent arrives sparse, but total undelivered reflects accumulated orders (e.g., P46:200, plus earlier unarrived like losses/missing). Demand analysis: Volatile recent (P48:185 high, P47:103, P46:38 low, P45:8, P44:115 stockout, P43:150 stockout); long-term avg ~100-110 from initial samples/history, no calendar/seasonality (generic periods). Downward/upward shifts noted in carry-over but not sustained recently. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock exceeded by pipeline 1973 >> mu_hat over L+1=3 periods ~300-450; capped policy avoids overorder). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - no order needed with excess pipeline for remaining 2 periods (P49-50 expected demand ~200-400 total); adding order risks LT=1 arrival in P50 (extra holding at end) or loss/post-game irrelevance.
