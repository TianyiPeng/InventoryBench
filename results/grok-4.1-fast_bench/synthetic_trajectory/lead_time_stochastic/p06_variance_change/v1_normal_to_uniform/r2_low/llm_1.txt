(b) Demand volatile high regime extended P43-P48: avg 120 (192/1/149/159/162/59; sustained 6p with 4 spikes >=149 amid lows 1/59, +250% vs P40-P42 lows ~34); P48=59 fits low-end volatility, forecast ~120 mean with high variance/upside risk. (c) LT variable 1-3 sustained; recent delays worsened P46-P48 arrived=0 (3p no arrivals), e.g., P44/P45 orders overdue past expected LT=2-3 (P44\u2192P47, P45\u2192P48); unreliable pipeline confirmed, no new LT observations; promised LT=2 irrelevant. (d) On-hand=0 (P48 stockout, lost 59 sales); in-transit=1790 massively inflated by historical losses/backlogs (e.g., pre-P40 misses persist indefinitely per carry-over), unreliable for coverage; no expected P49 arrivals given recent pattern. (e) Order 150: targets volatile high mean ~120 + safety buffer for spikes/stockout penalty (profit=holding=1, prioritize sales); covers P49+ LT=3 horizon conservatively despite inflated pipeline, avoids overordering given holding costs.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) chips(Regular): everyday snack food, no calendar dates provided so no seasonal anchors; demand driven by volatile patterns without strong external events. (b) Demand volatile high regime sustained P43-P49: avg 124 (192,1,149,159,162,59,144 over 7p, 4 highs >=144 amid lows); fits prior carry-over extension, no regime shift. (c) LT variable 1-3 historically; recent delays worsened P46-P49 arrived=0 (4p sustained no arrivals); multiple recent orders (P47/48/49 at 150 each) overdue past LT=2 (exp P49+), LT=1 broken; reinforces unreliable/lost pipeline pattern. (d) On-hand=0 (stockouts P48-P49 lost 59+144=203 sales); in-transit=1940 massively inflated by historical backlogs/losses (>> recent orders sum ~450 P46-P49), unreliable deliveries mean effective pipeline coverage low despite quantity. (e) Order 150: matches recent high demand avg ~120-130, covers expected P50+ demand spikes despite risks; conservative vs holding cost (profit=holding=$1) but prioritizes sales recovery from stockouts; avoids overordering given inflated pipeline.",
