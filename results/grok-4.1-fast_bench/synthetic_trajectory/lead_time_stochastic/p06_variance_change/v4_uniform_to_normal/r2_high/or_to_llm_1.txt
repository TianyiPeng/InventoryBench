Inventory analysis: On-hand=369 covers expected ~100/period demand for remaining 3 periods (48-50, total ~300) with buffer (~69 ending est.), minimizing holding costs ($1/unit/period) at game end. Demand analysis: Recent P38-47 avg=95.7 aligns with baseline ~92-100 (carry-over confirms uptick moderated P39-45 avg=90); no regime shift. OR recommendation=0 aligns with high inventory and base-stock policy (using promised LT=2, historical demand); no override needed as pipeline phantoms don't add real supply, and ordering more risks excess holding without stockout risk.
