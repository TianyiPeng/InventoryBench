{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Actual LT remains variable with recent confirmation of LT=3 (P40 order arrived P43); persistent lost pattern (e.g., P44 absent P47 as expected LT=3, P45 likely lost absent P48). No new LT arrivals in P44-P48 concludes, consistent with losses/delays. In-transit 1819 units includes many lost shipments (historical losses like P25/P29/P33/P37/P44 totaling 700+ units still listed), so effective pipeline lower but still substantial (~10-15 periods at 100 demand avg). Demand analysis: Recent P44-P48 demands (60,68,113,97,95) avg 86.6, similar to prior regimes (~90); no sustained shift (mixed high/low, not 3+ periods consistent). Historical full avg ~95. Inventory: On-hand 0 after prolonged stockouts (P44-P48 all ending 0, sales only from sporadic arrivals). OR recommendation: 0 units based on promised LT=2 and full history, correctly capping due to high pipeline (base_stock exceeded by in-transit). Strategy: Follow OR's 0 - adding more exacerbates holding risk on phantom/lost inventory; await natural depletion via non-arrivals or rare deliveries to rebuild accurately. Covers (L+1)~3-4 periods easily with remaining pipeline.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history confirms variable LT=1-3 (e.g., P40->P43 LT=3; prior P35->P37 LT=2, P38->P39 LT=1); P49 conclude shows arrived=0, consistent with recent lost pattern (no arrivals since P43). No new LT confirmation, but overdue pattern for P46 (expected P49 LT=3), P45 (expected P48 LT=3). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout risk for P50); in-transit=1819 hugely inflated by persistent lost shipments (e.g., P44/P37/P33/etc., accumulating 100s of units that never arrive). Effective pipeline near-zero for near-term, as lost orders don't deliver. Demand analysis: Recent P40-49 demands avg 96.4 (sum=964/10), stable ~100/period (fluctuations 60-120, \u03c3~20); no sustained regime shift (brief P44-45 dip 64 avg recovered to 106 avg P46-49); historical aligns ~90-110. OR recommendation: 0 units - uses promised L=2, full historical \u03bc\u0304~95 (inferred), base_stock~ \u03bc\u0302(3p)+z\u03c3\u0302~285+0 (q=0.5 fractile), but subtracts full 1819 pipeline \u2192 order_raw<<0, capped 0. Limitation: OR treats all in-transit as arriving, ignoring lost pattern. Strategy: Override OR upwards to 140 units (recent successful replenishment size, e.g., P40=140 covered P43-44). Covers ~1.5x expected demand post-LT=2-3 (140/(100*1.5)=safe buffer); compensates lost risk (effective pipeline low); prevents further stockouts (P45-49 lost ~493 sales); avoids overorder as some distant pipeline might arrive eventually. Ties to (L+1)=3p cover ~300 but scaled down for lost uncertainty and prior sizing.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 140 units - high in-transit (1819) inflated by persistent lost shipments (effective pipeline low); recent demand stable ~100/period with ongoing stockouts costing ~500 lost sales.",
