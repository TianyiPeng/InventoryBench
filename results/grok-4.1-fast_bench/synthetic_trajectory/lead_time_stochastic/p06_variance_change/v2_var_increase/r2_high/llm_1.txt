{
  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates or product description provided beyond generic 'chips(Regular)'; no seasonal or event drivers identifiable; rely on historical demand patterns for snack food with steady but volatile demand. (b) Demand regime stable long-term mean ~110 (initial 106 avg P1-5; recent P40-49 avg ~85 skewed by lows like P38:6/P42:13/P44:0, but P45-49 avg 111 with highs 163/148/125; volatile variance persists, no sustained shift (fluctuations 0-192 consistent). Forecast P50 ~110-150 based on recent highs/stockout trigger. (c) Lead time stabilized at 2 periods per carry-over (multiple confirms P23-29); but ongoing lost orders pattern (carry-over lists P44 etc.; new evidence: no arrivals P46-49 despite expected from P44-P47 orders LT2, extending loss streak; in-transit persists indefinitely for lost. (d) On-hand=0 post P49 stockout (demand 148 > starting 16); in-transit=1980 massive (~18 periods@110 demand) but bloated by chronic losses (historical + recent 4-period no-arrival streak); effective pipeline unreliable/short. (e) Order 150 to cover ~1.5 periods expected demand (110-150) + safety for LT2 + loss risk; avoids immediate stockout loss ($19/unit) while minimizing addition to bloated/unreliable pipeline; balances profit vs holding ($1/unit/period).",
  "carry_over_insight": "No arrivals in P46-P49 (4 periods) despite expected from P44-P47 orders (LT2), confirming sustained high lost shipment rate with in-transit now 1980 (bloated by losses).",
