(d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockouts P46-P48 lost ~181 sales @ $4p profit); in-transit=1540 (~15-20 periods @80-100 demand) but high loss rate erodes reliability - effective pipeline uncertain, recent streak suggests minimal near-term arrivals. (e) Final order logic: Stockout risk high for P49 (likely 0 arrival + ~80-100 demand = $320-400 lost profit); order 140 to replenish unreliable pipeline, cover 1-2 periods demand + safety vs LT1-3 variability/losses; holding cost low ($1 vs $4 profit), prioritizes sales over excess given unreliability.",
  "carry_over_insight": "No arrivals P45-P48 (4 straight periods), P46(140u) overdue 2+ past LT2 (no P48 arr); loss/delay pattern persists with extended recent streak.",

  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates provided; 'chips(Regular)' is a standard snack with typically steady demand around historical avg ~106 (initial samples), subject to volatility. (b) Demand regimes: prior high ~143 (P30-P35, 6p), low ~48 (P38-P42, 5p); recent P40-P49 avg ~85 (volatile: lows 0/6/13, highs 163/148); last 5p (P46-P49) avg ~111 (64,125,56,148), rebounding toward historical ~100, no new sustained regime (volatile, <3p consistent). Forecast P50+ ~110 accounting volatility/safety. (c) LT variable (hist 1-3p); recent predominant LT1 (P31/32/38/39) but P41\u2192P44 LT3; no arrivals P45-P49 (5 straight p), extending pattern; overdues: P46(140u) 4p past LT1/3p LT2/2p LT3 (no P47-49), P47(140u) 3p LT1/2p LT2/1p LT3 (no P48-49), P48(140u) 2p LT1/1p LT2 (no P49); persistent losses (in-transit 1680 bloated w/ghosts, e.g. prior lost P37/P41/etc.); promised LT2 irrelevant. No imminent P50 arrival likely. (d) On-hand 0 (stockouts P46-P49 lost ~148+56+125+64=393u opp.); in-transit 1680 unreliable (mostly lost/ghosts); pipeline thin on reliable future supply. (e) Order 140 to rebuild pipeline/safety stock vs losses/delays/uncertain LT; covers ~1-2p demand (~110-220) post-LT1-2; matches recent order sizing during recovery/stockouts; balances $4P vs $1H (pref overstock lost sales).",
