  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but carry-over confirms sustained loss pattern for even-period orders (e.g., P46=200 even overdue past LT=2 no P48 arr, likely LT=3+ or lost like prior P2/P6/P48=100; total 1627 in-transit matches sum of confirmed lost 1327 + P46 200 + P48 100). Recent observations: P40@P43 LT=3 (odd order), P38@P39 LT=1 (even but arrived unlike pattern), P21/23@25 LT=2; no reliable near-term arrivals expected in P49/P50 as pending are lost evens. Effective pipeline=0 despite 1627 reported. Inventory: On-hand=0 entering P49, risk immediate stockout (demand after decision); P48 partial stockout (22/56). Demand analysis: Recent P43-P48: 137/0/163/64/125/56 avg~91 (volatile, back to hist ~105 after prior regimes: high P30-37~140, low P38-42~48 both broken). Full hist mean~105 (initial samples 106, consistent long-run). No calendar/dates for seasonality; chips generic steady. OR rec=0 ignores losses, assumes high pipeline covers (base-stock ~3*100=300 <<1627 \u2192 order_raw<0 capped 0). Override: Treat effective inv=0, target base-stock for review+LT=3 periods: mu_hat=3*105=315 + safety (volatile sigma high, recent highs 163/137 \u2192 +30% buffer) \u2192 ~400, but cap-like to recent avg 3*91~275, order 300 conservatively to cover P49-51 demand w/ profit=4>holding=1.

Carry-over confirms sustained loss pattern (8+ shipments lost, e.g., P46@P49 no arr past LT=3, P33/P15/etc. pending 17-25p); in-transit 1927 unreliable (prior 1327 confirmed lost, additional pending likely lost too) - treat effective pipeline as ~0 reliable near-term. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0; recent stockouts (P49:148 lost sales, P48:34 lost); recent demand P40-P49 avg~85 (volatile 0-163), but P43-P49 avg~99 closer to historical ~105; expect ~110/period amid volatility. OR recommends 0 (base-stock minus high pipeline, using promised LT=2 & hist demand) - invalid due to unreliable pipeline/losses. Final strategy: Override to cover (L+1)=3 periods expected demand ~110*3=330, conservatively 300 accounting for volatility/holding costs ($1/unit/p) vs profit ($4/unit); aligns with recent orders (P49=300) to avoid further stockouts while capping excess given uncertainty.",
