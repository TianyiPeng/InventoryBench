{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows variability (LT=1,2,3 observed frequently; recent streak broken but losses persistent). From P48 conclude (arrived=0), confirms no arrivals for P46 order (LT=2 expected P48), P47 (LT=1 expected P48), and overdue prior like P44-P45 (past LT=3). Carry-over notes P44-P46 (360u) overdue past LT=3 at P47; P48=0 confirms lost. Recent 3 consecutive 0-arrival periods (P46-48 concludes), first such drought since early game. Losses ~34-36% rate, inflating in-transit (1738 includes ~500-600 ghost lost). True near-term pipeline low despite high nominal. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering P49; P48 full stockout (demand=135, sold=0); P47 partial (demand=91, ending=0). Expected P49 arrivals low (likely 0 from P47/P48 orders given pattern). Demand analysis: Sustained upward regime P12-48 avg ~102 (prior carry-over ~101 to P38), +~104% vs P7-11 low 49 avg; recent P46-48 avg 111 (107/91/135), P48 spike=135 fits variance but highlights stockout risk. No calendar/product seasonality shift evident. OR recommendation: 0 units - reasonable under its assumptions (promised LT=2, full historical demand/iid, treats all in-transit as reliable), but ignores LT variability/losses/true pipeline depletion. Strategy: Override OR upwards to 150 units. Covers ~1.5x recent avg demand (100-135 range) for current P49 + LT=2 coverage into P51, rebuilding after 3-period arrival drought & stockouts. Conservative vs spikes but prioritizes sales (profit=4 vs hold=1); cap-like to avoid excess holding if arrivals surprise.",
