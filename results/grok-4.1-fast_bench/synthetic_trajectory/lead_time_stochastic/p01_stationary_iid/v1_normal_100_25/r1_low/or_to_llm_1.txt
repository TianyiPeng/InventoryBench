  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent concluded arrivals confirm ongoing variability - P43 order arrived P45 (L=2), P42/P41/P40 arrived P45/P44/P43 (all L=3); no arrivals in P46-P47 suggests potential overdues (e.g., P44 order=100 exp P46 L=2, now 2+ periods overdue). Promised L=2 remains baseline, but effective L~2.5 avg recent; no new sustained pattern beyond prior variability/losses. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=36 critically low (covers <0.5 period at ~100 demand); in-transit=1451 massively inflated by confirmed cumulative losses ~1651u+ (carry-over thru P45, plus likely more e.g. P44); effective pipeline limited to recent/reliable like P47=100 (exp P49 L=2) and possibles in P48 (overdues). Demand analysis: Recent P41-47 avg=83 (std~24, volatile: lows 62-68 then spikes 116-127); prior stable ~106 P27-40; downward shift P41-44 (65 avg) not sustained (P45-47=108 avg +62%); forecast ~90-110/period x remaining 3 periods=270-330 total. OR recommendation: 0 units valid under nominal IP=1487 >> base_stock~(1+2)*~95=285 (q=0.5 z*=0), but ignores massive lost shipments reducing effective IP to ~200-300 (recent orders only). Final strategy: Override OR 0 to 150 units - targets coverage for P50 arrival (L=2), ~1.5x recent mean hedging stockout risk in P48-49 (low on-hand + sparse arrivals) while limiting end-game excess (cap-like); balances profit/sales vs holding given unreliability.",
