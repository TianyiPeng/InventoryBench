Demand: Stable ~90-110 long-term (early P1-5 avg~90, recent consistent), no regime shift or seasonality (no dates/product cues).

Possible arrival in P49: P47 order 200u if LT=2, but unreliable given 50%+ recent loss rate - treat effective pipeline as ~0. Inventory analysis: On-hand 59 low vs recent demand avg P44-48=102.8 (78+99+128+102+107)/5; will likely stockout ~40+ units in P49 unless improbable P47 LT=2 arrival. Demand stable ~100/period long-term (initial samples ~90, recent ~103 over 10 periods P39-48), no regime shift or seasonality (no calendar events). OR recommendation 0 due to high in-transit 1285u in base-stock calc (pipeline subtracts from base_stock ~ (1+2)*\u03bc + safety, yielding negative uncapped), but ignores lost shipments/variable LT - invalid assumption. Strategy: Override to order 150 units (recent successful order size, targets ~100* (1+2.5 avg LT) coverage post-P49, conservative cap below prior highs to minimize holding risk in final periods 49/50; balances stockout loss (profit $1/u) vs holding $1/u/period).",

No calendar/product seasonality (generic periods, chips regular).
