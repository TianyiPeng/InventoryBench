Promised LT=2 not reliable. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0; in-transit=1307 mostly ineffective (cumulative stuck losses, e.g., prior ~487+ by P23, more since incl. P29/30/33/37/41/44/45; effective pipeline minimal - only fresh P48 order 120 possibly arriving P50 if LT=1, expect stockout P49 similar to P48 (107 lost sales). Demand analysis: Recent 7 periods (P42-48) avg ~102 (107,102,128,99,78,77,113; range 77-128), stable ~100 matching long-term P1-5 avg~90, no sustained shift (prior P5-7 low not repeated). No calendar/product seasonality signals. OR recommendation: 0 units - overly conservative, ignores recurrent losses inflating fake pipeline; uses promised LT=2 and full history mean/variance without recency or loss adjustment. Strategy: Override to 120 units (standard recent order size covering ~1-2 periods demand). Placed P49 order risks LT>1 (lost/after-end), but low downside (no holding if lost), high upside profit=4>holding=1 if LT=1 arrives P50 for ~100 demand; avoids 100+ lost sales risk given low effective pipeline.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Period 50 is the final period (50/50). On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit shows 1427 units, but carry-over insights confirm recurrent shipment losses dominate the pipeline (e.g., recent P44/P45 lost, cumulative losses >> pending; effective pipeline near-zero despite inflated in-transit). Recent concludes (P46-P49) show arrived=0 each period, reinforcing no expected arrivals in Period 50. Demand in P49=144 (high, consistent with ~100-140 recent avg), but with on-hand=0 and no arrivals, expected sales=0. Order placed in Period 50 will arrive in Period 51+ (lead time 1-3 variability confirmed LT=1-3 recent e.g., P40 LT=3 P41 LT=3 P42 LT=3 P43 LT=2), post-game end, so cannot cover P50 demand or affect ending on-hand (holding cost only on ending on-hand, not in-transit). OR recommends 0 (likely due to high historical pipeline despite losses it can't see). Follow OR exactly: order 0 to avoid pointless future in-transit addition. No demand/calendar info for seasonality adjustment. Demand stable at ~100 avg over 50 periods (initial samples ~90, recent highs ~110 no sustained shift).",
