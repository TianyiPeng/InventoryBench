Promised LT=2, but actual variability confirmed. No new LT shifts; P44 order (150u placed P44) overdue past LT=3 (expected P47, no arrival P47), now testing LT=4 in P48; P45 order (150u) due LT=3 in P48. Losses historical (~1705u total confirmed lost inflating in-transit to 1635u), but recent deliveries reliable - actual pipeline low excluding ghosts, expect ~150-300u arrivals P48-P50 from P44/P45 + prior minors. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=86 low vs recent demand avg ~95 (P38-P47: 49,84,108,101,113,77,78,99,128,102; overall hist ~92, std~25). P47 sold=102>86 would have stocked out without prior buffer. No arrivals P46/P47 depleted from 316 (P45 end) to 86. Remaining 3 periods (48-50) expected demand ~285u. Expected actual pipeline ~300u but risk delay/loss (prob LT>2 ~20-30%, loss ~10% recent). Total expected supply ~86+250=336u covers ~285u demand + safety. OR recommendation: 0u - valid under bloated pipeline illusion (ignores ~1705u ghosts), uses promised LT=2/all-hist demand, base-stock low vs perceived high inventory. Override strategy: Near endgame (3 periods left), high profit($19):holding($1) ratio (fractile=0.95) prioritizes avoiding stockouts over excess (low hold cost). Order 100u: covers 1 period demand + buffer for P49/P50 if LT=1-2 (high prob), LT=3 arrives P51 post-game (low risk). Avoids overordering adding to P50 ending inv. Ties to demand outlook (stable ~95u/period, no seasonality/dates), LT belief (1-3), discounted pipeline.",
