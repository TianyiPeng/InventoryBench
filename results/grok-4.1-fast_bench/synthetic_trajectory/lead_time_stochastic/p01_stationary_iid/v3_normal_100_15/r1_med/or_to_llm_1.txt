{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows variation (1-3 periods); recent arrivals sparse - P46/P47 arrived=0 despite expectations from P44 LT=2 (P46), P45 LT=1 (P46), P42 LT=3/P43 LT=2 (P45 partial); carry-over confirms ongoing losses (e.g., P37 lost, recent no-shows add to phantom). Actual LT unreliable with high loss risk, no new pattern beyond sustained losses. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering P48, in-transit=1754 largely phantom (~1554+ prior, sustained from 10+ lost shipments per carry-over; recent +200 likely P47 order already suspect). Effectively ~0 reliable pipeline - imminent stockout risk for P48 demand (post-arrival, but no expected arrivals). Demand analysis: Historical mean ~100 (initial 106 avg P1-5), recent 10p (P38-47) avg=93.9 (stable, no regime shift; outlier P41=61 not repeated). No calendar/dates for seasonality. OR recommendation: 0 units - follows base-stock minus bloated pipeline (ignores phantoms/losses); uncapped raw likely negative due to 1754 in-transit. Strategy: Override OR treating real pipeline~0; endgame (P48-50, 3 periods) requires coverage for ~300 demand (3x100), but adjust down to 200 for loss risk (past even-period mixed, ~50% loss obs) and holding cost ($1 vs $4 profit); ensures buffer if LT=2 (arrives P50) or LT=1 (P49), prioritizing sales over excess hold at end.",

Demand outlook: No calendar/seasonal signals, i.i.d. ~100 mean. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock - high pipeline <0, but ignores phantom losses/recent no-arrivals).
