  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows high variability (1-3 periods) with frequent losses (e.g., P33:140 lost, P40 arrived LT=3 P43, P43 LT=2 P45 last arrival; no arrivals P46-P49 despite expected from P46(40 LT=3->P49), P47(140 LT=2->P49), confirming continued loss pattern per carry-over (in-transit 1361 matches cumulative known lost ~651+recent unarrived). No new concluded LT shifts. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1361 effectively 0 (lost, no future arrivals expected). Demand analysis: full history avg ~85-95, recent 10 periods (P40-49) avg 87.1 (51-131 range, sigma~25); stable no seasonality (no dates/product specifics beyond regular chips). OR rec=0 uses promised LT=2 + all history, overestimates pipeline (ignores losses), raw base_stock exceeded by in-transit. Strategy: override OR treating effective inv=0, assume LT=3 worst-case, target base_stock ~ (3+1)*90=360 (q=0.5 z~0, mu_hat=360 sigma_hat~50), but cap conservatively near historical successful orders (~140-280) and OR cap logic (~130) to avoid overstock risk; order 250 to cover ~3 periods demand + buffer, rebuilding after P48-P49 stockouts (lost sales 107+91=198).",
