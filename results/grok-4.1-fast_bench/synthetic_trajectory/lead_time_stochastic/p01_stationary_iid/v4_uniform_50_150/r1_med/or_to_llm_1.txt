Promised LT=2 unused; actual LT inferred 2-3 but unreliable with relapse. Inventory analysis: On-hand=87 low (depleting from P45:333 \u2192 P46:224 \u2192 P47:171 \u2192 P48:87), risks stockout in P49 (recent demands P46:109, P47:53, P48:84 avg~82 but historical ~100). Massive in-transit 1958 discounted heavily as lost/stagnant (no growth post recent 0 orders, prior losses undelivered past LT=3). Demand analysis: Stable regime ~90-110 recent (P43-48 avg=92), no calendar/seasonal shifts evident (no dates/product specifics beyond regular chips). OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock policy sees inflated pipeline 87+1958 >> mu_hat~(1+2)*~94=282 + safety; capped low), ignores losses/LT variability. Strategy: Override OR upward to standard 150-unit replenishment (covers ~1.5 periods demand at mu=100, aligns with prior successful orders during dry spells like P33/36/40; builds buffer for LT=3+1=4 periods coverage assuming partial pipeline arrival; avoids overorder given holding cost but prioritizes stockout avoidance as profit=4x > holding=1).",
