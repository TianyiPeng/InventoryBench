{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variability 2-3 periods confirmed (e.g., P41->P44 LT3, P42->P45 LT3, P43->P45 LT2); no new arrivals in P46-P48 concludes despite expectations for P44 order (exp P46 LT2/P47 LT3, arrived=0 P46-P48) and P45 order (exp P47 LT2/P48 LT3, arrived=0 P47-P48), matching historical lost patterns (overdue 1-2+ periods past LT3). Entire in-transit 1998 units aligns with persistent lost shipment pattern (prior totals ~2348 adjusted by recent partial arrivals, but no recent inflows). Inventory analysis: On-hand 497 covers ~4.5 periods at sustained high demand avg ~110 (P44-P48: 97,76,113,143,124 avg 110.6; P35-P48 sustained ~118 per carry-over). Pipeline 1998 ineffective due to losses, but current on-hand ample to avoid stockouts near-term. Demand analysis: High regime sustained (no shift, P44-P48 aligns with ~110 avg, +1100% vs initial P1-P2 avg10); no calendar/product seasonality cues to anticipate spikes. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock capped, promised L=2, full history mean lower due to early lows, high pipeline/on-hand exceeds target). Strategy: Follow OR's 0 - no override needed as inventory buffers multiple periods, losses erode pipeline reliability, holding cost balances profit at q=0.5; avoid adding to potential lost orders.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT stabilized at 2-3 periods (e.g., P41->P44 LT3, P42->P45 LT3, P43->P45 LT2); variability 1-3 persists, but promised L=2 used by OR. No new LT data from P49 conclude (no arrivals expected as recent orders P46-P49=0). Pipeline: In-transit 1998 units confirmed entirely lost per carry-over (P44/45 confirmed lost, total matches ~1998, no arrivals P46-P49 despite prior patterns); treat effective pipeline=0. Inventory: On-hand=459 (from P49 end). Demand analysis: Sustained high regime ~110 (P44-P48 avg 110.6, P44-P49 incl. low P49=38 avg 98.5); no new shift (P49 single low not sustained 3+ periods). Expected demand over L+1~3 periods: 3*100=300 (conservative), sigma_hat~sqrt(3)*~40=70, critical q=0.5 z~0, base_stock~300. On-hand 459 covers 4+ periods (459/110~4.2), exceeds base even with 0 pipeline.
