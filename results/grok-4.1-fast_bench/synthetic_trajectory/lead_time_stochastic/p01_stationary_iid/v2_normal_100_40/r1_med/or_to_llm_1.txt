Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: LT remains variable/sporadic per history and carry-over (recent confirmed LT=2 e.g. P43->P45, LT=1 prior); long no-arrival streaks (now 4 consecutive P46-P49) and persistent high stuck pipeline (overdues >25p, e.g. P15) indicate unreliable deliveries despite occasional arrivals. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (stockout risk immediate, but P50 demand resolved post-decision from potential P50 arrivals, which are unlikely given streak); in-transit=1630u (record high, ~16x recent avg demand of ~100u/period from last 10: avg 100.7u), far exceeds base stock needs even under promised LT=2 (expected ~300-400u over 3 periods incl safety). Demand analysis: No calendar/seasonal signals (generic periods, regular chips); recent demand stable ~60-140u (avg 100u), no regime shift. OR recommendation: 0u aligns with massive pipeline overwhelming base-stock level (OR ignores stuck/losses but correctly caps at 0 to avoid overordering). Strategy: Follow OR at 0u - do not add to already bloated/stuck pipeline risking future holding costs ($1/u/period) if sporadic arrivals resume; prioritize awaiting trickle from existing 1630u despite losses; stockouts lose $4/sale but LT=2+ delays new order impact to P52+, where pipeline still ample if any arrives.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - record in-transit 1630u (~16 periods demand) massively exceeds needs despite persistent stuck shipments and 4-period no-arrival streak; avoid adding to high-risk pipeline.",
  "carry_over_insight": "No-arrival streak extended to 4 consecutive periods (P46-P49); in-transit record 1630u at P49 conclude sustaining persistent high stuck pipeline pattern with overdues >25p (e.g., P15 200u)",
