Demand analysis: Low regime P16-47 avg~32 (-65% vs P1-15 ~92), P47=31 fits, prior upticks (P41-44 avg43) not sustained per carry-over. OR recommendation 0 based on full pipeline vs low mu_hat over L=2+1=3 periods, but overstates due to ignoring losses; effective pipeline 120 > expected 90 remaining demand, adequate coverage without adding to potential end-game holding (risk low at $1/unit).

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent arrivals show variable LT (e.g., P43 order arrived P45 LT=2; P39 LT=1; historical patterns LT=1-3 with losses, e.g., P37 lost). No new conclusive shifts beyond carry-over (LT=3 streak broken earlier). Current in-transit 748 units accumulated from past orders, some likely arriving soon (e.g., recent unconfirmed orders like P46=60, P45=60, P43 arrived but others pending); no specific overdues triggering new alerts. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, but pipeline=748 vastly exceeds expected demand for remaining 2 periods (low regime ~32-37 avg *2 = ~70, even with spikes to 50-60). Risk of stockout low due to pipeline; adding orders risks further losses or post-game holding. Demand analysis: Sustained low regime P16+ avg~32 (carry-over confirmed 23+ periods), recent P41-48 avg~37.5 (51,32,35,53,19,23,31,56) shows volatility but no sustained uptick (P41-44 ~43 not continued; P48=56 isolated). No calendar/product info for seasonality. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and full history (underestimates losses but correctly sees high pipeline vs low mu_hat). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - no need to order with 748 pipeline covering 20x remaining demand; near end-game (P49/50), new orders (LT>=1) arrive P50+ risking non-delivery within game or excess ending inventory holding cost ($1/unit).

Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout risk this period), but in-transit=748 units (huge, ~21 periods at recent avg demand 37); covers (L+1)=4 periods easily (148+ needed) despite losses. Demand analysis: Sustained low regime P16+ avg~32 (carry-over), recent P41-49 avg~(51+32+35+53+19+23+31+56+30)/9=36.7 (mild uptick/spikes like P48=56 not sustained per P47 insight); chips regular no seasonal drivers evident.
