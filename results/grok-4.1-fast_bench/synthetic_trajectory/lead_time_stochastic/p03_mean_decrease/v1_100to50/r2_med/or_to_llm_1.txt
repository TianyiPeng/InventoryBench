Demand analysis: Recent P40-49 avg=51 (63,36,59,48,42,57,15,74,72,44), volatile std~20+ (highs 70-74, low 15); carry-over notes uptick faded to ~47-50 with volatility sustained. No calendar/product seasonality cues. OR recommends 0 (uses promised L=2, full history mean, ignores lost/real LT; sees high pipeline covering base-stock). Strategy: Override OR 0 as effective coverage low risking P50 stockout on volatile demand; order 60 matching recent avg/volatility for immediate coverage (L+1 periods partial) while minimizing holding risk if arrivals materialize. Ensures profit capture vs lost sales.",
