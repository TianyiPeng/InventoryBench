Resuming historical loss pattern (odd/even risks), total lost/stuck now ~844 units (prior ~734 +110); effective pipeline near 0, despite nominal 794 (consistent with carry-over exclusions).

No calendar/product seasonality (generic periods/chips). OR recommendation: 0 units - trusts nominal pipeline and historical mean, ignores recent losses/decline/actual LT variability. Strategy: Override to 60 units (recent safe order size, ~1.25x recent mean for endgame P49-P50 coverage assuming LT=2 arrives P50; q=0.8 fractile favors stocking vs holding risk over 3 periods; avoids OR understock given effective pipeline=0).",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT varies 1-3 periods with intermittent losses (e.g., P44/45 lost per carry-over; P38-43 reliable streak ended); no new arrivals in P48 conclude, consistent with pending P46=0/P47=0/P48=60 just placed - expect potential P49 arrivals from earlier but pattern suggests high loss risk, effective pipeline near 0 despite reported 854 (lost ~844+). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 post-P48 (demand=64 > starting 42, stockout effect); in-transit inflated by losses, no reliable coverage for P49+ demands. Demand analysis: Sustained low regime P30+ avg~47 (carry-over), recent P43-48 avg~45 (26-64 volatile, P47=60/P48=64 uptick but not sustained 3+ periods); early P1-16 ~90 confirms -48% drop. No calendar/product seasonality cues. OR recommendation: 0 units, valid under promised LT=2/historical but ignores losses/effective pipeline depletion - uncapped likely low due to low \u03bc\u0304~50. Strategy: Override OR's 0 with 70 units to cover ~1.4x recent avg demand (50), building modest pipeline for LT=2-3 (total coverage 140-210 equiv. periods) while avoiding overstock/holding; conservative given volatility/loss risk, aligns with recent orders (60).",

{

No new arrivals in P49 conclude; P48 order (60, placed P48) now at LT=2 during P50 (arrives after decision, visible P51), P49=70 at LT=1 (P51); high loss risk per pattern, effective pipeline low (~130 max if both arrive, likely less).
