  "rationale": "(a) chips(Regular): standard snack food with steady but volatile demand; no calendar dates provided, so no seasonal/event drivers identifiable; rely on historical patterns. (b) Demand regime: P45-P49 (130,97,122,80,119) avg 110 (+22% vs P35-P44 avg90), extending prior P45-P47 upshift (116 avg) over 5 periods with volatility (dip P48=80 recovered P49=119); prior regimes fluctuated (P27-P34 118 high, P35-P44 90 low); forecast ~110/period near-term. (c) Lead time: variability LT=1-3 persists (recent LT=3: P40->P43, P42->P45); no arrivals P46-P49 despite expectations (e.g., P46 order exp P48 LT2); recent losses confirmed (e.g., P44 thru P47); P45(180),P46(140),P47(140) overdue 3+/past LT2, likely additional losses; in-transit bloated by lost shipments. (d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0 (stockouts P46-P49, lost sales ~418 units); in-transit=2120 unreliable (cumulative lost/delayed); covers theoretical ~19 periods@110 but arrivals sporadic. (e) Order logic: target service despite unreliability (19 profit >>1 holding); order 120 matches recent demand avg/prior orders (P49=120), covers ~1-2 periods post-LT(2-3) accounting for pipeline risk; conservative to avoid excess if arrivals resume.",
