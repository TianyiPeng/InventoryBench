Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (stockout risk this period), in-transit=1742 unreliable (treat effective pipeline ~0 due to non-delivery pattern spanning multiple streaks). Demand analysis: Recent P45-P49 demands (130,97,122,80,119) avg 109.6, variance ~424 (\u03c3~20.6), sustaining high regime (~110+) vs earlier dips; no calendar/product seasonality cues to contradict. OR recommendation: 0 units - logical under their model (high pipeline > base_stock using full history/promised L=2), but flawed as it assumes reliable pipeline and i.i.d. demand without loss adjustment or recency. Strategy: Override OR by discounting unreliable pipeline to 0; forecast single-period \u03bc=110, \u03c3=21; for effective L+1=3 coverage, target base_stock ~330 + safety ~60 =390, but cap conservatively at ~150 (matching recent order scale and single-period cap ~110+1.645*21~145) to avoid over-ordering into potential future flood while covering expected demand and buffering LT uncertainty/loss risk. Ordering 150 balances lost sales (19/unit) vs minimal holding risk (1/unit).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 150 units - 1742 in-transit is phantom due to 6+ consecutive no-arrivals (P44-P49) and persistent losses; recent demand sustained high at 110 avg requires ordering to prevent further stockouts.",
  "carry_over_insight": "No arrivals P44-P49 (6 consecutive periods) despite in-transit >1700; loss/delay pattern strengthened further; demand high regime P45-P49 avg 110 sustained (5 periods consistent ~110+)",
