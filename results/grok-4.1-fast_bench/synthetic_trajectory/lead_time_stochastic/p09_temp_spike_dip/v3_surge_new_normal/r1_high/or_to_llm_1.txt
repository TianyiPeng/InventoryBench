No new LT conclusions in P48. Inventory: On-hand=0 (stockout risk immediate), but massive in-transit=2208 (extreme backlog, enough for ~18 years at low demand avg121), likely many lost but some sparse arrivals possible.

OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock capped, using promised LT=2 and full history mean/var, conservatively low given pipeline).
