Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history and carry-over confirm high variability (LT=1 or 3 observed), with sustained losses/delays (no arrivals P46-P49, extending pattern; recent orders like P46:150, P47:150, P49:150 overdue or lost if LT=3). In-transit 2482 bloated with confirmed lost shipments (cumulative >1700+ units per carry-over), so effective pipeline near 0 despite high reported total. Demand analysis: Sustained low regime P26-P49 avg ~121 (P46:142, P47:117, P48:113, P49:133 all fit; vs prior surge 250), no surge reversal, no calendar/seasonal drivers (generic chips, no dates). Inventory: On-hand 0, stockouts P46-P49, will likely stockout P50 absent surprise arrival. OR recommendation: 0 units, logical under promised LT=2 + full history mean (recent low pulls down mu_hat~120-130, pipeline 2482 >> base_stock ~360 + safety, so order_raw negative). Adjustment: Override to 150 - matches recent demand avg + buffer for LT uncertainty/losses (covers ~1-2 periods); rebuilds supply ignoring ghost pipeline, balances profit=1 vs holding=1 (q=0.5, minimal safety). Strategy: Conservative order amid losses/low demand; monitor P50 conclude for further LT/loss confirmation.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 150 units - bloated in-transit 2482 ineffective due to persistent losses (no arrivals P46-P49), on-hand 0 risks stockout, but low demand sustained ~121/period (P26-P49 avg) warrants targeted coverage without overordering.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand regime shift down extended P26-P49: avg 121 vs P16-P25 avg 250 (-52%), sustained 24 periods; loss/delay pattern extended: no arrivals P46-P49 (4 periods), P46:150/P47:150/P49:150 overdue past LT=3",
