{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed LT variability (1,2,3 periods) from recent concludes (e.g., no new LT in P49; prior P45 had LT=3/2, P44 LT=3); no arrivals in P46-49 (4 consecutive periods) despite expected from P43-46 orders (e.g., P46 order expected ~P48-49), confirming sustained lost shipments pattern inflating in-transit. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (stockout risk high for P50 demand ~110); in-transit=1755 massively inflated by chronic lost orders (historical stuck: P24=240, P25=200, P33=100, P41/42=100, recent P46-48 orders likely lost too), effective pipeline near-zero recently. Demand analysis: Recent P46-49 demands 71/74/106/121 (avg 93, volatile); fits broader P33+ stabilization ~100-110 avg (carry-over P39); P48-49 stockouts lost ~227 sales; no calendar/product seasonality cues. OR recommendation (0 units): Follows capped base-stock using promised L=2 + full-history mu (~110?) yielding base_stock << 1755 pipeline, but invalidates due to unaccounted lost shipments (OR treats all in-transit as reliable).
