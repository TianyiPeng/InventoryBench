{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: LT remains variable 1-3 periods with frequent losses (e.g., P46 order 110 units confirmed lost - no arrival by P49 conclude, overdue past LT=3; prior carry-overs confirm P44 lost, pattern persists for even small recent orders). No new arrivals P46-P49 despite pending P43-P46 orders. Promised LT=2, but actual max=3, losses ongoing. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering P50 (stockout risk for P50 demand ~100); in-transit=2742 dominated by historical lost shipments (per P40 insight pattern, sum of lost + recent ~330 from P47-49, but unreliable - expect 0-200 actual arrivals P50-P52). Demand analysis: Low regime sustained P26-49 (~24 periods, avg ~102-105 matching baseline 105); recent P46-49: 126/82/67/110 avg=96, no shift. No calendar/product seasonality signals. OR recommendation: 0 units - follows base-stock with promised LT=2 and full-history demand (pulled up by past spike), overestimates pipeline ignoring losses, risks continued stockouts (P48-49 lost 67+110 sales). Strategy: Override OR with conservative 120 units - targets 1-1.2 periods demand (~105-120) over effective LT+1=~3 (to cover P51-P53 post-decision), balancing stockout loss (19/unit) vs holding (1/period); aligns with recent safe order sizes that occasionally arrive (e.g., P42/43), replenishes after stockouts while minimizing exposure to loss/holding.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 120 units - shipment losses persist (e.g., P46 110 lost), making 2742 in-transit unreliable (effective ~0); recent stockouts on ~100 demand demand immediate replenishment for 1-2 periods coverage.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand low sustained P26-49 avg 102 matching baseline 105 (24 periods); P46 order (110 units) confirmed lost - overdue past LT=3, no arrival by P49 conclude",
