  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variability sustained at 1-3 periods (e.g., P40->P43 LT=3, P42->45 LT=3, mixed recent LT=1-2); no new arrivals in P48 conclude, consistent with variability/losses; promised LT=2 but actual unreliable, plan for LT+1=3 periods coverage. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 after P48 partial stockout (demand=89, sold=28); in-transit=2144 but carry-over indicates known losses ~1694u near-matching prior in-transit levels, effective pipeline ~0-500u max (history of frequent losses like P44 200u confirmed lost); treat as effectively 0 for safety. Demand analysis: High regime sustained P24-48 (25 periods avg~76, +85% vs P16-23 low avg41), recent P44-48:137/94/39(dip)/82/89 avg88 confirms strength despite single dip; chips(Regular) steady snack demand, no calendar dates but long high regime overrides early history. OR recommendation: 0 units - likely overestimates pipeline (ignores losses/variability) and underweights recent high demand shift; base-stock met per its i.i.d. assumption. Strategy: Override to 200 units to cover ~80 demand x (LT+1=3) periods (~240) conservatively, matching recent order sizes (P44-48:200u each) that have buffered spikes; near-endgame (P49/50) favors stocking given profit=19>>holding=1, even if LT delays arrivals to P50 or beyond.",
