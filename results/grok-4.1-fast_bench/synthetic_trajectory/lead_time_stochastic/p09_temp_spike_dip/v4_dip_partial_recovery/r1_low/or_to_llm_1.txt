  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but carry-over confirms sustained LT variability (1-3 periods recently, e.g., P40->P43 LT=3, P41->P44 LT=3, P42->P45 LT=3, P43->P45 LT=2) interrupted by prolonged delays/no arrivals in P46-48 for expected P44-46 orders (LT=1-3 would arrive P47 max), extending lost shipment pattern (total ~1165u lost inflating in-transit). No new LT confirms in P48 conclude (arrived=0). Effective: high loss risk, unreliable pipeline. Inventory position: On-hand=0; in-transit=1165u, but ~1165u lost per carry-over (stagnant, matching no recent arrivals), so effective pipeline ~0 - imminent stockouts likely. Demand analysis: Recent P43-48 (6 periods): demands 76,137,94,39,82,89; avg=86, std~32 (volatile, range 39-137); P46-48 avg=70 partially offsets P43-45 uptick (102 avg), but overall stable volatile moderate post-declines. Earlier history higher (P1-8 avg~106), but regime shifted down sustained per carry-over. No calendar dates/product details for seasonality. OR recommendation: 0 units - uses promised LT=2, full historical demand (diluted by lows), high displayed pipeline exceeds base stock; ignores losses/LT shifts. Adjustment strategy: Override to 100 units (recent order size pattern 80-120u, ~1x recent mean to cover P49/P50 demands if LT=1 arrives P50; minimal since game ends P50, low holding risk ($1/unit/period), profit $1/unit prioritizes avoiding certain stockouts (P48 sold=0); conservative vs larger due to loss risk.",
