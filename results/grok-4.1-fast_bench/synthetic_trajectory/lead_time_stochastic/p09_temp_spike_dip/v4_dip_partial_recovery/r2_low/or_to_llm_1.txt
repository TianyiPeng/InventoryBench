No calendar/product seasonality signals. OR rec=0 ignores ghosts/actual LT/shifts, underestimates need (uses promised LT=2, full history avg diluted by lows). Strategy: Override to 120 units - targets ~80/period forecast x (LT=3 +1 review)=320 coverage, minus low effective pipeline (~150 assuming 15% delivery), consistent with prior successful 120 orders amid ghosts/stockouts; avoids overorder holding risk (q=0.5 fractile).",
