Lost shipments continue (cumulative ~720u by P37; P38 order 100 now in-transit, early to call lost); in-transit bloated at 960u signals unreliable pipeline (many lost persist indefinitely without arriving). No new lost confirmations yet (e.g., P37 100 exp P39 LT2 or P40 LT3). (d) On-hand 89 covers P39 (~80 demand) with buffer; in-transit 960u unreliable (likely ~70% lost based on history, but recent orders P34+ mostly arrive LT1-2); pipeline covers multiple periods if arrivals materialize, but stockouts recent (P35:92 demand/0 sold; P34:88/11). Total 12 periods left (~960 demand); current position avoids immediate shortage but risks future if losses persist. (e) Order 0: on-hand sufficient for P39; bloated/unreliable pipeline (960u) likely yields arrivals soon from recent orders (P37/P38); adding more risks further losses/bloat without need; prioritize avoiding excess on-hand near endgame (holding=profit, minimize ending inv P50); monitor arrivals in P40.",
