{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows variable LT=1-3 with chronic losses (e.g., P44/P45 orders lost per prior insights; no arrivals P46-49 despite expected from P44-47 orders within LT<=3, extending streak to 4 periods; recent successes LT=3 for P41/P42 in P44/P45, but pattern unreliable). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (stockouts P47-49, lost sales 143+68+ prior); in-transit=1687 huge but ineffective due to sustained losses (insights confirm many never arrive, e.g., P29/P30/P33/P37/P41+ lost/delayed indefinitely; no recent arrivals reinforce). Demand analysis: Sustained high regime since P26 (insights up to P38 avg~75, recent P46-49:60+78+143+68=349/4=87 avg, P40-49 ~80 avg matching early P1-15 ~100); spikes like P48=143 indicate volatility, expected ~80-100/period. OR recommendation: 0 units (likely base_stock < pipeline assuming full delivery, but ignores losses/delays using promised LT=2 and full history mean~80). Strategy: Override OR's 0 with 150 units - treat effective pipeline as ~0 given chronic losses/no recent arrivals; order to cover ~2-3 periods demand (150-240) post-decision (covers LT+1), balancing stockout risk (19 profit/unit) vs low holding (1/unit/period); consistent with prior successful orders ~120-200 during high demand.",

  "carry_over_insight": "No arrivals P46-49 (4 periods) despite expected LT<=3 from P44-47 orders (120-200u each), loss streak extended reinforcing chronic pattern; demand high sustained P40-49 avg ~80 matching early regime (+115% vs P16-25 low ~37).",
