(b) Demand regime: stable low ~62/period P43-49 (63,61,60,61,64,75,54 avg 62.4), volatile with occasional spikes (e.g., P48:75, prior P41-42:110/101); sustained low vs early ~190, consistent with carry-over P46 insight. (c) Lead time: variable 1-3 recently (e.g., P45 arr: P42 L3, P43 L2; P44: P41 L3); no arrivals P46-49 despite prior orders; P45 order (100u placed P45) overdue past L=2 (exp P47) & L=3 (P48) - absent P47-49 (3+ periods for L=2), likely lost joining pattern; in-transit 1785 mostly overdue/lost accumulating. (d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand 102 covers ~1.5-2 periods (~62/demand); expect P50 arr~0 (recent pattern); effective pipeline low/unreliable despite 1785 total; risk stockout P51+ if no arr. (e) Order 120: covers 2 periods demand (124u) + volatility/safety buffer (~40u for spikes to 100+); high service priority (lost profit $19 >> holding $1); arrives P51-52 assuming L=1-2; avoids excess given unreliable supplier.",
  "carry_over_insight": "P45 order (100 units) confirmed lost: absent P47-P49 (overdue 3+ periods past L=2 exp P47); in-transit accumulation continues with recent non-arrivals.",
