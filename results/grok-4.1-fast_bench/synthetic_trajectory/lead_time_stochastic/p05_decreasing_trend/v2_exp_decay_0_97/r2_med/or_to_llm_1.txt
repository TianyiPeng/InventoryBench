{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows variable LT=1-3 for small orders (60-80 units) previously reliable (e.g., P40-43 orders arrived LT=3 P43-45), but recent small orders P44-P48 (60-70 units) delayed LT>=5-2 (no arrivals P46-P49 dry streak 4 periods, P44 overdue LT=6 into P50); emerging unreliability even for small orders, no confirmed arrivals since P45. Inventory: On-hand=0 (stockout risk immediate), in-transit=2042 entirely accumulated lost shipments per carry-over (e.g., prior losses P2/6/15/17/19/24/30 + recent delays), unreliable pipeline - treat as 0 effective. Demand analysis: Volatile low sustained P37-49 avg~52 (P40-49:72/50/26/50/67/34/29/76/37/70 avg51, spikes to 76/70 but lows 26/29); no calendar/dates for seasonality, chips(Regular) stable low regime. OR recommendation: 0 units - follows base-stock capped using promised LT=2 and all-history demand (ignores recent low shift, losses, delays), subtracts fake high pipeline leading to no order. Strategy: Override OR's 0 to 70 units (match recent demand avg/high like P47=76/P49=70), small size to maximize delivery chance per prior pattern despite recent delays; covers ~1-2 periods demand post-decision (L+1=3 but unreliable); avoids large order loss risk, minimizes holding if delivers. Expected: If LT=1-3 arrives P51-53 visible P52-54, else potential lost but low exposure.",
