{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Sustained delays/losses pattern confirmed in carry-over (e.g., P37, P44, P49 notes no arrivals P46-49 despite multiple pipeline orders like P44=40 overdue 6+ periods, P46-48=60 each overdue 3-1 periods); in-transit 702 largely ineffective/lost as per prior tracking (confirmed lost base escalated). No new concluded arrivals in P49, reinforcing unreliability\u2014treat effective pipeline as ~0. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0, multiple recent stockouts (P46-49: demands 43/25/33/49 all unsold), lost sales costing ~150 units * $19 profit. Demand analysis: Volatility high sustained P32+ per carry-over, recent P46-49 avg=37.5 (std~11), P45-49 avg=42.6 (std~13); no regime shift but consistent ~40/period need with spikes (e.g., P45=63, P49=49). No calendar/product seasonality anchors. OR recommendation: 0 units\u2014valid under promised LT=2 + historical mean but ignores sustained losses/delays, over-relying on phantom pipeline. Strategy: Override to order 60 units (recent successful order size, covers ~1.5x recent avg demand for LT+1=3 periods assuming no arrivals; balances stockout risk vs low holding $1; aligns with past overrides during stockouts).",
