(b) Demand regime analysis: Confirmed low-demand regime persists (carry-over: P36-P39 avg 24; recent P38-P42: 44,20,38,41,12 avg 31); last 10 periods (P33-P42) avg ~34 with downward trend (e.g., P42=12), no rebound evidence; forecast ~25-35/period. (c) Lead-time vs. missing orders: Recent LT mostly 1 period (e.g., P39->P40, P36->P37, P32->P33); occasional 2-3 or lost (carry-over notes multiple lost totaling 440+); P42 order (120) and earlier like P37 (120) likely contribute to in-transit 680, some may be overdue/lost but pipeline still massive. (d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand 208 covers ~6-8 periods at ~30 demand; in-transit 680 covers 20+ periods; total ~888 units vs. remaining 8 periods (~240 demand) = massive excess; post-P42 ending 208 after low demand=12 confirms overstock. (e) Final order logic: Order 0 to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) on excess inventory with ample coverage through period 50; no stockout risk.",
