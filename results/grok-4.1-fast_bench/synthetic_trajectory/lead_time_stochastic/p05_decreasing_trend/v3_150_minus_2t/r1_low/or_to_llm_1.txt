{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: From history and carry-over, LT variable 1-3 periods recently (e.g., P42 LT3/P45, P43 LT2/P45, P35 LT2/P37, P36 LT1/P37); recent reliability mixed with losses resuming P44(100u)/P45(80u) confirmed absent past LT3 in P48, no arrivals P46-P49; P49 order(60u) pending (placed P49, possible LT1 arrival P50 or LT2 P51). Promised LT=2, but losses mean effective pipeline unreliable. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (P49 end=0); in-transit=1156u includes ~1096u confirmed lost (P2/6/15/17/19/44/45 etc. per carry-over) + P49 60u \u2192 effective arriving pipeline ~60u soon. Demand analysis: Sustained low sub-regime P37-49 avg~63 (recent 8p P42-49:63/61/79/55/48/79/29/91 sum505/8=63.1, volatile but stable low vs early ~140); no calendar/seasonal drivers (generic Period_50, chips regular). OR recommendation: 0u, uses promised LT=2 + all-history demand (ignores recent downshift/losses), sees high pipeline > base_stock so caps at 0. Adjustment strategy: Override to target base_stock~(1+LT=2)*63=189 (q=0.5, z=0 no safety given p=h=1), minus effective pipeline 60u \u2192 order 129u rounded to 130u; covers 3p demand ~190 risk-free given on-hand=0 and stockout risk (P49 sold49/91 demand).",
