No other recent orders (P45-49 ordered=0), so in-transit 971 likely includes P44 180 + prior undelivered/possibly lost backlog (past 791 lost cleared per P39 insight, but total now higher suggests accumulation or unresolved). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout P49 demand=59 sold=0); inventory position=971 covers ~18 periods at recent avg demand 54 (P45-49: 31,43,63,72,59). Demand analysis: Sustained downward regime P21+ avg~82 (-34% vs P1-20 ~125), further decline P45-49 avg 53.6 (-38% vs P21-44 ~86), confirmed over 5 periods; no calendar/product seasonality signals (generic periods, regular chips). OR rec=0: Uses all-history mean (diluted by early high demand but recent low pulls down), promised LT=2, high pipeline \u2192 low/zero order; aligns well despite OR missing delays/losses. Strategy: Follow OR at 0 - high pipeline buffers LT variability/delays; profit=holding=1 \u2192 fractile=0.5 balances stockout/hold risk; ordering risks excess hold with low demand outlook. Monitor P44/Pipeline arrivals in future concludes.",
