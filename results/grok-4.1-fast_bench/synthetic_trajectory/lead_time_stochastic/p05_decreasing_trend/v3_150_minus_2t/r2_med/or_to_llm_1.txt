  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LTs stabilized at 1-2 periods (per carry-over P26), but persistent loss pattern continues\u2014no arrivals in P46-P49 concludes despite prior orders (e.g., P44 lost per P48 insight); in-transit 1494 units bloated with cumulative lost shipments (~1004+ units per prior insights), no real pipeline expected soon. Inventory analysis: On-hand 172 sufficient for ~3 periods at recent demand avg ~60 (P43-49: 76,84,31,43,63,72,59; avg 61, std~19); ending inventory consistently high post-P45 arrivals (409\u2192366\u2192303\u2192231\u2192172), incurring holding costs but avoiding stockouts. Demand analysis: Stable low regime confirmed (P43-49 avg 61, sustained 7 periods post-P46 decline insight); no calendar dates or product seasonality signals to suggest reversal; historical early high (P1-10 avg~138) irrelevant now. OR recommendation: 0 units, using promised LT=2 and full history (ignores losses, recent low demand); aligns perfectly with high inventory and no need to order amid unreliable supply. Final strategy: Order 0 to minimize holding costs on existing stock and avoid bloating in-transit further with potential losses; covers (L+1)=3 periods demand (~180) via on-hand alone.",
