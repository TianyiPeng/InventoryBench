Demand analysis: Confirmed low regime since P23 (avg92), further decline P28-32 avg74 (-24%), P43-47 avg59, P43-49 avg61 (76,84,31,43,63,72,59); stable low ~60/period, no spikes or shifts. OR rec: 0 units (appropriate given low historical mean now incorporated, promised L=2). Strategy: Follow OR 0 - no need to order with on-hand covering current demand, variable/long lead times + losses make adding to pipeline risky/ineffective; prioritize avoiding excess on-hand holding costs ($1/unit/period) amid low profit opportunity.",
