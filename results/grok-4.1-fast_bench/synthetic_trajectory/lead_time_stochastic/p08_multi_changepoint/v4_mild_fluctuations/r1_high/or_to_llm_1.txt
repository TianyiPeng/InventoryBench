OR recommends 0 (uses promised L=2, all history mean, ignores losses/high apparent pipeline). Strategy: Override OR upwards to 120 - matches recent safe order size, replenishes effective low pipeline for LT=1+(1-period buffer), targets IP ~227+120=347 covering ~3 periods (~300 demand) with safety for variance/spikes; holding cost low ($1 vs $19 profit), prioritizes avoiding stockouts over 10 remaining periods (expected ~1000 demand).

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT variable 1-3 (e.g., P40 LT3 arr P43, P41 LT3 P44, P42 LT3 P45, P43 LT2 P45, but P44 lost no arr past P47, P45 order 100 likely lost no arr by P48 despite LT<=3 expectation); no arrivals in P46-48 concludes despite pending orders, extending loss pattern (carry-over total lost ~1007+). Promised LT=2 not reliable. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering P49; in-transit=1107 largely lost (prior ~1007+ lost, recent P45 100 + P48 120 + remnants ~ live pipeline <300 effective); 3-period no-arrival streak (P46-48) signals low imminent supply despite nominal pipeline. Demand analysis: Recent P43-48 demands (89,115,73,114,84,110) avg 97.5, consistent with sustained lower regime ~90-100 (P36-42 avg93, P28-34 avg103); spikes to 110-115 indicate variance. No calendar/product seasonality signals. OR recommendation: 0 units - driven by high nominal pipeline under promised LT=2 and full-history mean ~95, but ignores losses/no recent arrivals, overestimating supply. Strategy: Override OR's 0 with 200 units to cover 2 periods demand (~200) given effective low pipeline, LT~2 avg with loss risk, and stockout penalty (19*100=1900 profit loss >>1 holding); aligns with past overrides in low-stock/high-loss (e.g., P19/21/22 ordered 200). Ensures coverage for P49-51 demand post-decision.",

  "carry_over_insight": "No arrivals P46-48 (3 periods) despite expected LT1-3 from P45/P48 orders; P45 order (100 units) lost confirmed (no arr by P48 past LT3), total lost now ~1107 units; extends occasional loss pattern.",

No arrivals in P46-P49 (4 consecutive periods) despite expectations: confirms prior losses P44(120), P45(100); P48 order(120) now overdue (LT>=2 as no arr P49); aligns with occasional loss pattern but extends streak. In-transit 1307 largely lost (~1107 prior + P44/45 = ~1327, but 1307 suggests minor adjustment); effective live pipeline critically low, likely only P48(120)+P49(200)=320 at risk, but P48 probable loss. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 entering P50 (stockouts P48 sold=5/110, P49 sold=0/95); imminent P50 stockout likely unless rare arrival. Demand analysis: Recent P43-49 avg 97 (89,115,73,114,84,110,95), sustained lower regime P36-49 avg ~96 vs P16-27 high ~120 (-20%), stable no regime shift. No calendar/product seasonality signals. OR recommendation: 0 units, driven by bloated pipeline (ignores losses) exceeding base-stock ~380 (mu~97*3 +1.645*sqrt(3)*~30); uncapped order_raw negative, but invalid given effective pipeline ~200-300 max. Strategy: Override OR 0 \u2192 200 to target base-stock 380 assuming effective pipeline ~180 (conservative post-losses), covering ~4 periods LT+1 *97 + safety; matches recent order sizes (P49=200) during stockouts; cap consideration ~150 but increased for loss risk/service (q=0.95).",
