======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: From carry-over and history, avg LT ~1.75 (LT1 x7, LT2 x1, LT3 x4 over 12 obs); recent arrivals show LT3 pattern (P40->P43, P41->P44, P42->P45), but high loss rate (P45 160 lost, total known lost ~736+; no arrivals P46-49 despite 886 in-transit, confirming unreliable pipeline - effective pipeline near 0). Inventory: On-hand=0 (stockout risk immediate); in-transit 886 illusory due to losses. Demand analysis: Upward regime P36-49 sustained 14 periods, avg ~135 (P47-49:140/152/140 all >140 recent; even with P45=80/P46=97 dips, 12/14 >=100 vs prior low regime P13-35 avg61 +118%); historical early ~100, confirms high regime. OR rec=0 assumes promised LT=2, full historical demand (ignores regime shift/losses), overestimates pipeline. Strategy: Override OR to 150 matching recent demand mean (P47-49 avg144), covers ~1-2 periods high demand post-decision; conservative given LT variability/losses but avoids overordering amid holding costs.",
