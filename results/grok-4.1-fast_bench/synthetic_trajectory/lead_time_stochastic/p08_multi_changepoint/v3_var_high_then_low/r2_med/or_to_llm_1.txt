Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised L=2, but carry-over confirms sustained variability LT=1-3 (recent ex: P40->43 LT3, P42->45 LT3, P43->45 LT2); recent dry spell P46-P49 (4 periods) no arrivals despite due orders (e.g., P47 order LT>=3 overdue past P49, P48/P49 just ordered); losses dominant with sporadic arrivals only. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockout P49: 116 demand lost); in-transit=1642 nominal but carry-over shows ~1642u unaccounted/lost matching total (prior 1522u + recent orders), effective expected arrivals near 0 despite number. Demand analysis: Recent 10 periods (P40-49) avg=92.6 (range 64-124), overall historical ~100; no calendar/product seasonality cues; stockouts frequent when no arrivals (P49 sold=0). OR rec=0: Valid under nominal pipeline (1642 >> base_stock ~300 for mu~100,L=2), but ignores losses/dry spells reducing effective pipeline to low. Strategy: Override to 120 - maintain historical ordering cadence (successful sporadic arrivals e.g. P45 240u) to cover ~3 periods demand (~300) accounting for L~3+losses; avoids overordering but ensures supply attempts amid unreliable pipeline; aligns with q=0.8 fractile favoring availability.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 120 units - shipment losses make effective pipeline near 0 despite 1642 in-transit; 4-period dry spell (P46-P49) and P49 stockout (116 lost) require continued ordering for sporadic arrivals.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Dry spell extended to 4 consecutive periods no arrivals P46-P49 despite due orders (e.g., P47 LT>=3 overdue by P49); total unaccounted now 1642u exactly matching in-transit, strengthening dominant loss pattern.",
