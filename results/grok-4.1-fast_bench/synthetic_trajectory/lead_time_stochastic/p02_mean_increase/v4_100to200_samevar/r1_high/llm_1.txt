(d) Inventory: on-hand=0 (stockout P49 demand169); in-transit=4340u mostly ghosts (~4340u accumulated per pattern), real pipeline thin (P47(300u) pending lt3 P50 arrival?, P48/P49 pending but high loss risk); recent no arrivals P46-49 confirms losses. (e) Order 300u to cover ~220 demand over lead time + safety for losses/volatility; matches recent strategy balancing stockouts (high lost profit) vs holding (low cost); sustains pipeline despite ghosts.",
