======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "(a) chips(Regular): standard snack chips, no calendar dates provided (generic Period_50), no identifiable major events/seasonality; rely on historical demand patterns showing long-term elevated regime ~300 units/period since ~P23 with volatility. (b) Demand regime: sustained elevated mean ~297 (P46:245, P47:313, P48:311, P49:316; avg 296.75 over 4 periods), consistent with prior elevated levels (P23-P45 avgs 270-320), high volatility (245-316) but no new shift confirmed (stable over 4+ periods vs prior). (c) Lead time: historical 1-3 periods, but persistent lost shipments; no arrivals P46-P49 despite expected from P44(400u, due ~P47 LT3, 6+ past), P45(400u ~P48, 5+ past), P46(400u ~P49, 4 past); reinforces lost pattern extending to recent orders (not just pre-P38). (d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0 (stockout P49), in-transit=5070 (bloated with suspected lost >5500u+recent 1200u); expected P50 arrivals=0 (4-period no-arrival streak). Pipeline unreliable, current stockout risks lost sales (~$19*300=$5700/period). (e) Final order logic: prioritize sales over holding ($1 cheap vs $19 lost); order 400 to match recent demand avg/volatility/upside, maintain aggressive pipeline despite losses (prior 0-orders P47-P48 caused back-to-back stockouts); covers ~1 period demand assuming LT=2-3 for future periods.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Lost shipment pattern extends to most recent orders: P44(400u 6past LT=3), P45(400u 5past), P46(400u 4past) by P49 conclude (no arrivals P46-P49 streak of 4 periods); additional ~1200u suspected lost, total >6700u; Demand sustained elevated P46-P49 avg 297 (+volatility 245-316), confirmed over 4 periods.",
