No prolonged overdue beyond patterns. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (risking P48 stockout unless unconfirmed arrival); in-transit=3992 massively inflated by systemic losses (history est. 1000+ lost like P24/25 confirmed lost, P17-19 presumed; gaps like P40-42,46-47 confirm unreliability). Demand analysis: High regime sustained P16-47 avg~290 (recent P41-47: 328/280/304/286/271/285/311 avg~295, +170% vs P1-15~110); no softening (P44 disproven), recent uptick stable.

Wait no, P45 had arr, but P46-48=0), consistent with carry-over systemic sporadic/loss pattern; no new l= confirmations in P48, in-transit 4342 likely includes heavy losses (historical total ~1000+ prior, ballooned further). Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0 entering P49, vulnerable to stockout if no P49 arrival (likely given recent 3-zero streak); demand high regime sustained P16-48 avg ~290 (recent P46-48: 285/311/228 avg 275, within variance, no confirmed softening after prior disproof); cumulative stockouts continue costing profit. OR recommendation: 0 units - overly conservative as it ignores observed losses/sporadic deliveries eroding effective pipeline (4342 in-transit inert); historical demand now reflects high regime but OR caps low due to bloated pipeline assumption. Final strategy: Override OR with 350 units to maintain aggressive replenishment cadence (matching recent orders P47=400/P48=350), targeting coverage for 1+ periods of ~290 demand against expected l=2-3 or loss; buffers (L+1)~3 periods coverage goal, but losses necessitate overordering to sustain sales vs. holding risk (q=0.5 balanced).",
