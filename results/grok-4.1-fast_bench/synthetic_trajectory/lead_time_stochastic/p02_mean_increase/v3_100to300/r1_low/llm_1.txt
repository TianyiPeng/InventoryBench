  "rationale": "(a) chips(Regular): Regular snack chips, steady demand driver without strong seasonality; no calendar dates provided, so no event-based spikes; historical shift to high demand regime since P16 confirmed by carry-over (avg ~280). (b) Demand regime: High sustained P16+ avg~280; recent P46-P49: 285/311/228/281 (avg 276, consistent, no softening reversion). (c) Lead time vs missing orders: Recent LT=2-3 (e.g., P42->P45 LT3, P43->P45 LT2); no arrivals P46-P49 (4 consec periods); multiple overdue (P44 exp P47 LT3 overdue 3pd by P49, P45 exp P48 ov2pd, P46 exp P49 ov1pd); reinforces sporadic losses (in-transit 4550 bloated ~losses, effective pipeline low despite volume). (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockouts P47-P49, sold=4/0/0); in-transit=4550 (~16x demand but historically junk due to losses/disruptions); no expected arrivals imminent for P50 (post-decision). (e) Final order logic: Forecast ~280/period; order 300 to cover LT~3 + safety for loss risk/disruption (covers ~P50-P53 demand post-arrival); matches recent orders/service level while minimizing hold risk given unreliable pipeline.",
