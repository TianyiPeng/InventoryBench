(c) Lead time: Variable 1-3 periods sustained (recent ex: P42 LT3 arr P45, P43 LT2 arr P45, P41 LT3 arr P44); no arrivals P46-P47 despite pendings (P44 order 180 overdue past LT3 no P47 arr, potential lost pending P48 confirm); lost shipment pattern sustained (prior + potential P44). Recent LT=2-3 but delays/losses common. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (post P47 partial stockout), in-transit=2140 (massive backlog, sum of pending orders like P44 180/P45 170/P47 170 + others delayed/unlost); ample coverage for remaining P48-P50 (~450 demand) even with 50% losses (1070 remaining >>450), expected arrivals P48+ from LT1-3 pendings. (e) Final order logic: Endgame (P48/50), prioritize sales without excess holding/ending inv; massive pipeline minimizes stockout risk despite losses, but recent partial stockout warrants safety order matching recent avg demand (~160) for P50 coverage (LT~2); avoids overordering into post-P50 inv.",

(b) Demand regime analysis: High demand sustained P17-P48 avg ~147 (+70% vs P14-P16 avg 85), confirmed 32 periods; recent P44-P48 demands (124,170,172,159,142) avg 153 with volatility but persistence above 140, 1 full/1 partial stockout (P47-P48); forecast ~150 for P49. (c) Lead time vs missing orders: Recent LT 1-3 variable, no arrivals P46-P48 (latest P45: P42 LT3/P43 LT2); P44 order 180u confirmed lost (no P48 arr, 4+ periods past max LT3); P45 170u overdue past LT3 (no P48 arr), fits sustained lost pattern; no new LT shift. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0 (risk full P49 stockout unless pipeline arrives); in-transit=2300u (theoretical ~15 periods coverage at 150/d but high loss risk erodes reliability, backlog from unreliables). (e) Final order logic: Order 170u to target service on ~150 demand, matching recent high regime/recent orders (P47=170/P48=160) while buffering losses; covers LT=2-3 arrival (P51-P52) amid pipeline uncertainty, balances lost profit vs holding.",

(d) On-hand 0 (stockout risk immediate); in-transit 2470u (~15+ periods demand) but eroded by losses/no recent arr, recent periods reliant on depleting prior stock leading to stockouts. (e) Forecast ~160/period; order 170 balances coverage for P50+ (post-decision demand) + LT~2 pipeline + safety for ~high loss rate/stockouts (marginal profit $4 > holding $1/period); avoids exacerbating backlog while ensuring service vs sustained high demand.",
