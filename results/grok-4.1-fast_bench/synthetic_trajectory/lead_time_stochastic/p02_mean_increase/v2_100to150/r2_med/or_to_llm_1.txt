No new LT shift. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=306 covers ~2 periods at 150 demand/period (P46 end ~156 assuming demand=150); in-transit=1545 bloated with lost shipments (never conclude, remain indefinitely) - historical losses ~2400u (P17-P19 390u, P24 200u, P30 250u, P33 250u, P37 300u etc.) mean effective pipeline near-zero/reliability low despite reported total; recent orders P43-P45=0 so no imminent arrivals expected.

No new arrivals expected P47 (P44/P45 orders=0 for LT=2/1/3).
