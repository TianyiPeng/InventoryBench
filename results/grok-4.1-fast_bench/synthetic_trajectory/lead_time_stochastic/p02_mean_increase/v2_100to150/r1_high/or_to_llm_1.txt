Inventory: On-hand 260 covers ~1.5-2 periods at recent demand avg 154 (P44-48: 133/185/135/181/137), but post-demand ending low (~90-110) risks stockout without reliable arrivals. Demand analysis: High regime sustained ~150-170 (P38-48 avg ~158, fluctuating 133-197 but avg stable vs P33-37 low 126); no calendar/product seasonality signals. OR rec=0 assumes pipeline covers base-stock (\u03bc\u0302=(1+2)*~130? + safety), but ignores losses/delays\u2014override needed. Strategy: Order 300 to target coverage for 3 periods (LT belief 2-3 +1), matching recent demand avg*2 (~300) for safety vs losses/stockouts (19p vs 1h); conservative vs uncapped to avoid excess hold if rare arrivals occur.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows variability (recent: LT=3 for P40/P41/P42, LT=2 for P43 in P45); no arrivals in P46-P49 (4 periods) despite expected deliveries (e.g., P44 order 350u placed P44 overdue past LT=3 by P49 conclude), confirming carry-over persistent high loss rate - treat in-transit 3423 as effective 0 (ghost inventory from losses). Inventory position: on-hand 71 critically low vs recent demand avg 167.5 (P40-49: 173,176,197,169,133,185,135,181,137,189), will likely stockout P50 (demand after decision, arrivals unlikely). Demand analysis: High regime sustained P38-49 avg ~165 (upward trend P46-49 avg 161:135/181/137/189), overriding early low history; no calendar/dates for seasonality, chips(Regular) steady but regime shift confirmed. OR recommendation: 0 units - underestimates due to equal-weight all-history (diluted by early ~100 avg) and promised LT/ignores losses/unreliable pipeline; uncapped base-stock likely low ~300 but capped at 0 after high nominal pipeline. Strategy: Override to aggressive order covering (1+avg LT=3) periods high demand ~167*3=501 minus on-hand 71 = ~430; choose 400 conservative vs cap-like smoothing, prioritizes avoiding stockouts (profit $19 >> holding $1); builds buffer given supply unreliability.",
