{
  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates or specific product details beyond 'chips(Regular)'; steady snack demand, no seasonal drivers evident. (b) Demand regime sustained at avg ~151 last 10 periods (P40-49: 154,119,190,116,124,170,172,159,142,166), consistent with P18+ shift to ~160 (carry-over); forecast P50 ~160. (c) LT variable (1-3 periods observed recently, e.g., P42 LT3\u2192P45, P43 LT2\u2192P45); sustained lost shipment pattern (carry-over), no arrivals P46-49 despite expectations (e.g., P44 LT3\u2192P47 overdue 3+ periods, P45 LT3\u2192P48 overdue 2+, P48 LT1\u2192P49 overdue 1); actual LT inference only from concludes, losses bloat pipeline. (d) On-hand=0 (stockout risk P50, arrivals post-decision); in-transit=2510 heavily inflated by losses (historical pattern), recent pipeline ineffective (no arrivals 4 periods, stockouts P47-49). (e) Order 170 matching recent demand/prior actions (P48/P49) to buffer unreliability/losses while minimizing hold risk; pipeline covers distant future if any arrive, but order ensures coverage for LT~2-3 (arr P52-53).",
  "carry_over_insight": "No arrivals P46-P49 (4 periods); P44 (170u) & P45 (160u) overdue 3+/2+ past LT3 exp, reinforces sustained lost shipment pattern (not new regime).",
