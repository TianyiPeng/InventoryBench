{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference (from concluded periods only): Recent LTs variable 1-3 (e.g., P42 LT=3 arr P45, P43 LT=2 arr P45, P40 LT=3 arr P43, P41 LT=3 arr P44); no arrivals P46-P49 confirms ongoing delays - P44 order(200) LT=5+ (P44 to P49 no arr), P45(200) LT=4+ likely lost per sustained pattern of selective losses/delays. Expected P50 arrivals: possibly partial from P48(200 LT=2 P50) and P49(200 LT=1 P50), but unreliable (effective recent pipeline ~400 vs nominal 2851 inflated by ~2000+ historical losses per carry-over). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0 (stockouts P48 demand=137 sold=0, P49=189 sold=0); effective arriving pipeline low/critical despite high nominal due to confirmed losses (total lost ~1771+400 recent=~2171).

Strategy: Override OR's 0 with 200 units to replenish for 1-2 periods coverage (~170*1-2=340) given LT=1-3, matching recent order sizes that arrived (e.g., P43/45), balances stockout risk (lost profit $189 P49) vs holding (q=0.5 indifferent); builds buffer against further losses while capping below prior 280 highs to avoid overstock if LT short.",
