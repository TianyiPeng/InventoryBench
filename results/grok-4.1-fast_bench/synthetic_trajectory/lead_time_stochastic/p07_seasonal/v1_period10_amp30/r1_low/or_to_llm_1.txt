  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent LT pattern sustained at 2-3 periods with emphasis on LT=3 over multiple orders (e.g., P40/41/42 arrived P43/44/45 LT=3 per carry-over); sparse arrivals continue (none in P46/P47), losses sustained inflating in-transit to 1731 (ghosts >> real pipeline, total ghosts ~1351u+recent additions like P47 pending). No new LT arrivals in P47 conclude to update. Demand analysis: Recent P38-47 demands (40,90,67,94,129,118,70,63,88,63) avg 82, std~28, volatility high sustained as noted; no new regime shift (recent P44-47 avg 71 but within volatility, not sustained 3+ periods lower). Inventory position: OH=88 sufficient for ~1 period demand (~80-100) but critically low for remaining 3 periods (48-50) given LT~3 (need cover 4 periods post-decision); real pipeline near-zero due to ghosts/losses despite 1731 reported (arrivals sparse P43-45 then none). OR recommendation: 0 units, conservatively driven by inflated (ghost) pipeline + promised L=2 + full-history mean; ignores losses/LT=3/volatility. Strategy: Override OR to 120 units (consistent with recent order sizes that eventually arrived, e.g., P40-43 120-130u), targeting base-stock ~4*90=360 over L+1=4 (adjusted mu=90 recent, z~0 for q=0.5), assuming minimal P48 arrivals; replenishes real supply for P49-51 coverage while minimizing excess holding in endgame (post-P50 ending inv penalized).",

No calendar/product seasonality (generic chips, no dates). OR=0 ignores ghosts/losses/high variability, assumes promised LT=2 and full pipeline coverage.
