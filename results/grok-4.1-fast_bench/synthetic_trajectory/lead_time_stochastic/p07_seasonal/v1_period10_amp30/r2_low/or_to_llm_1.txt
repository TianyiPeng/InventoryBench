{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed LT variability (1-3 periods) from recent concludes (e.g., P45: P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2; P44: P41 LT=3); no new LT confirmation in P48 (arrived=0, consistent with no expected arrivals or losses); many historical losses (e.g., P44 order 130 overdue since P47, likely lost; total in-transit 1080 includes ~1200+ lost per prior insights, unreliable pipeline). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (depleted post-P48, partial stockout: sold=40<demand=51); in-transit=1080 but effective pipeline low due to persistent losses (e.g., P29=100, P30=150, P44=130 lost). Demand analysis: Recent downward shift sustained P44-P48 avg=72 (90,84,73,63,51; -35% from P40-P43 avg119), over 5 periods; long-term P25-P48 low ~85 avg with volatility; chips(Regular) no strong seasonality without dates; historical mean ~95 but current regime low ~70 expected per period. OR recommendation: 0 units (likely due to promised LT=2, full history mean/variance, high nominal pipeline; ignores losses/LT shifts). Strategy: Override OR upwards conservatively to 70 units (\u2248 recent demand avg 72 for P44-P48; covers ~1 period demand + buffer for LT=3 outlook (expected 210 over 3 periods) minus unreliable pipeline; balances profit=1 vs holding=1 (q=0.5 fractile favors modest stocking vs stockout); avoids overordering given downward regime and high nominal in-transit.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 70 units - on-hand=0 with stockout risk (P48 lost 11 units), recent P44-P48 demand avg 72 confirms low regime; unreliable 1080 in-transit due to losses requires proactive small order.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LTs mixed 1-3 periods (e.g., P45: P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2; P44: P41 LT=3; P43: P40 LT=3), averaging ~2-3, consistent with prior LT=3 pattern and carry-over notes; no new LT data from P49 conclude (arrived=0, too early for recent orders). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (risking P50 stockout unless rare arrival); in-transit=1150 units bloated with confirmed lost shipments (~860 prior + recent P48=80/P49=70 orders pending, but pattern suggests high loss risk like P25/P29/P30); effective reliable pipeline low despite nominal high. Demand analysis: Recent P44-P49 demands (90,84,73,63,51,85) avg 74, sustained low regime per carry-over (P44-P48 avg72 over 5 periods, extended); volatility but consistent <100, no calendar/product seasonality evident. OR recommendation: 0 units, logical under promised L=2 + full-history mean + high pipeline, but ignores losses/stockouts/unreliable LT. Strategy: Override upwards conservatively to ~recent mean (74-80), covering 1+ periods expected demand (L~3 needs ~300 total but ghosts inflate pipeline; prioritize avoiding stockouts like P48-P49 while minimizing new lost/hold risk); order 80 balances lost-sale cost vs holding given q=0.5 fractile.",
