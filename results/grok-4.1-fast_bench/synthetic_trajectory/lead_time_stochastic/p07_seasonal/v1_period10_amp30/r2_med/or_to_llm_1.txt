  "rationale": "Step-by-step: 1. Lead-time inference: Recent LT stabilized at 2-3 periods up to P45 arrivals (P40-43 orders arrived reliably P43-45), but no arrivals in P46-47 despite pending P44 (placed P44, expected P46-47) and P45 (placed P45, expected P47) orders - P44 overdue past LT=3, signaling renewed lost risk; in-transit 1532 heavily inflated by historical lost shipments (~1000u+ accumulated per carry-over). Effective reliable pipeline low/uncertain. 2. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand 246 high; recent demand P43-47: 114,90,84,73,63 (avg 84.8, declining -30% from P40-42 avg121); expected remaining demand P48-50 ~240-300 total (3p x ~80-100), covered by on-hand alone even if no pipeline arrives; holding cost risk high near end (P50 ending inv penalized). Historical chips demand steady but volatile, no calendar/dates for seasonality. 3. OR recommendation: 0 units (base-stock met by high pipeline/on-hand under promised LT=2/iid demand assumption). 4.
