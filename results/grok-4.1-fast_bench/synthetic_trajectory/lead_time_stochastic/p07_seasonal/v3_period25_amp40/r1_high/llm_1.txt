(b) Demand regime: Sustained low P41-49 avg~77 (9 periods, -25% vs P36-40 avg97); P49=114 uptick (+58% vs prior avg72) but single period, not sustained (>=3 req) - forecast ~80/period near-term. (c) LT: Sustained drought P44-49 arrived=0 (6 consec periods) amid 1-2-3 mix + frequent losses (e.g., P44/45 confirmed lost); no arrivals despite orders P44=200(P50 LT=6 overdue), P45=200(P50 LT=5 overdue), P49=200(LT>=1); lost pattern dominant, in-transit=2100 likely includes many lost/severely delayed. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0 (stockouts P48-49: lost sales 76+114=190); massive in-transit 2100 but unreliable due to losses/drought - expect continued low arrivals, risk prolonged stockouts. (e) Order logic: Order 200 to cover ~2-3 periods demand (~80-100/period) over LT+1=4 horizon, hedging loss/delay risk while minimizing holding on unreliable pipeline; matches recent safe orders during stockouts.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Arrival drought extended P44-49 arrived=0 (6 consecutive periods, reinforces lost/delayed pattern); Demand low regime extended P41-49 avg77 (-25% vs P36-40 avg97, 9 periods evidence despite P49=114 uptick).",
