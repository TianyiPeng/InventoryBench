Promised LT=2, but use 3 for planning.

Confirmed losses pattern continues (total >1026u inflating in-transit to 1436u), making pipeline unreliable - treat as effectively lower.

Demand analysis: Deepening low regime P40-48 avg64.3 sustained per carry-over, but P49=105 (+63% vs prior avg) signals potential uptick/return toward prior highs (P24-36 avg127), though single period not sustained; recent P45-49 avg69 volatile but ending high. No calendar/dates for seasonality. OR recommendation=0 likely due to low historical mean from low regime + apparent high pipeline (ignores losses/LT variability), underestimates stockout risk. Strategy: Override OR upwards to cover ~3-4 periods (LT+1) expected demand ~80-100/period (blending recent low with uptick signal), target ~110-120 low-end to minimize holding given unreliable supply; conservative cap avoids overorder amid loss risk.
