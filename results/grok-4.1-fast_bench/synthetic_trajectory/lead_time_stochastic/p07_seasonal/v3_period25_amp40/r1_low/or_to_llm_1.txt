{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent lead times avg ~2.3 periods (e.g., P42 order LT=3 arrived P45, P43 LT=2 P45, P40 LT=3 P43), consistent with carry-over variability (LT=2-3 frequent); no new arrivals in P47 conclude (arrived=0), but no specific overdues noted for immediate future. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=85 covers expected P48 demand ~65-75 (recent P43-47 avg 65); massive in-transit=1619 bloated by confirmed lost orders (cumulative >1000 units from insights, e.g., P33/40/42 etc.), effective pipeline limited to recent undelivered orders (e.g., post-P43 orders like P44/45/46/47 if any, but many historically lost after 2 periods overdue). Demand analysis: Downward regime sustained P43-47 avg 65 (49/58/79/66/74) vs P36-42 ~96 (-32%), extended 5 periods; prior upward shift reversed, no seasonality/dates to contradict low outlook. OR rec=0 based on promised L=2 + full history mean, but ignores losses/demand drop/LT variability - aligns well with reality (base stock exceeded by on-hand + effective pipeline). Strategy: Follow OR 0 to avoid adding to bloated/lost-prone pipeline; with 3 periods left (48-50), expected total demand ~200, on-hand 85 + any near-term arrivals sufficient, prioritizes minimizing holding costs ($1/unit/period) on excess.
