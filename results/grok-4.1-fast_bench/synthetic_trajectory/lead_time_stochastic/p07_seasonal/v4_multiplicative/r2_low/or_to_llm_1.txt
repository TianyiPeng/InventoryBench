  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed from history variable LT 1-3 periods (e.g., recent P40 LT3 arrive P43, P41 LT3 P44, P42 LT3 P45); many orders lost after 3 periods (carry-over totals ~1586 prior, pattern persists). No new concludes for recent orders yet. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 (stockout risk immediate); in-transit=2066 \u2248 prior lost ~1586 + recent P47(120)+P48(120)+P49(120)=360 pending (total ~1946, close match); effective pipeline low (~200-400 expected to arrive eventually, high loss risk ~50%+ from pattern). Demand analysis: Recent P47-49: 31,62,69 avg=54 (downward shift vs P43-46 avg110 ~107,126,105,102); longer P40-49 avg~93 but recent low sustained 3 periods; no calendar/seasonal cues (generic periods, regular chips). OR recommendation=0 ignores lost shipments (treats full 2066 as reliable pipeline), underestimates stockout risk given recent partial/full stockouts (P49 sold=0/69, P48 sold=9/62). Strategy: Override OR to order 120 units (recent order size, covers ~2 periods recent demand avg54*2=108 + safety; aligns with cap smoothing, builds buffer for LT 2-3 + loss risk while minimizing holding given q=0.5 fractile).
