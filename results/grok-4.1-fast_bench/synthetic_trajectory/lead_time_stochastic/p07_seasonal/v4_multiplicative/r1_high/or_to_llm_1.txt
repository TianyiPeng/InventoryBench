{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: LT variability sustained (dominant LT=3, occasional 1-2; recent P43 LT=2 confirmed in P45, no new arrivals P46-48); no new overdues visible yet (e.g., P46-48 orders if placed would arrive ~P49-51). Pipeline: In-transit=2204 units (covers ~17 periods at recent high demand avg~120 or 30+ at avg~70), plus OH=27; expected arrivals soon from recent orders replenish post-P48. Demand analysis: Recent P45-48: 107/55/0/111 (avg~68, volatile with P47=0 outlier); prior carry-over upward P39-44 avg~129, but mixed recent suggests no sustained shift down yet (highs 107/111 match prior regime); historical avg~100, chips steady snack no calendar events. OR rec=0 aligns with high pipeline exceeding base-stock needs over promised L=2 (OR ignores actual LT=3 variability/losses but conservatively caps). Strategy: Follow OR=0 to avoid excess holding into final P50 (low OH=27 risks minor P49 stockout but pipeline covers P50+); total reward prioritizes sales from pipeline over new orders near endgame.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Recent confirmed LTs variable (LT=2 for P43->P45, LT=1 for P36->P37/P32->P33, LT=3 dominant historically per carry-over), losses pattern sustained (e.g., P24/25/29/33/37 confirmed lost); no new arrivals P46-P49 despite expected from prior orders (e.g., P44 order 300 overdue past LT=3 expected P47 arrival, by 2+ periods in P49 conclude). Pipeline: On-hand=0, but massive in-transit=2204 units (accumulated from multiple unarrived orders like P44 and others, despite losses elsewhere). Demand analysis: Recent P45-49 avg ~71 (107,55,0,111,83), volatile with P47=0 outlier and stockouts P48-49 partial/P50 implied; lower than prior highs ~120-130 (P39-44), but not sustained shift (mixed up/down). OR rec=0 uses promised LT=2/historical demand, correctly sees high pipeline vs base-stock. Strategy: No order needed - 2204 in-transit covers 20-30+ periods even at 100 demand/period (2204/(71*3.5 avg LT)~25 periods); adding risks more holding/losses. Follow OR exactly, monitor for arrivals/losses.",
