{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but observed LT=1,2,3 frequently; many orders lost if no arrival >3 periods past placement (e.g., P44/P45 confirmed lost at P48/P49 insights). No new concluded arrivals in P49; P48 order (150 units, placed P48) has LT>=2 (no P49 arrival), possibly LT=2 arriving during P50 (visible P51). Inventory analysis: On-hand=31; in-transit=1706 bloated by confirmed lost shipments totaling ~1556 (1156 prior + P44=200 + P45=200), leaving effective pipeline ~150 (P48 only). Demand analysis: Recent P46-49 demands=102,31,62,69 (avg=66, high variance); sustained downward vs P38-45 avg109 (-40%); overall history fluctuates ~100 but recent low regime. OR recommendation: 0 units, as base-stock < bloated pipeline+on-hand (OR ignores losses). Strategy: Override OR upward - treat effective inventory low (31 + possible 150 arrival); order to cover ~2 periods demand (66*2=132) accounting for LT~2 + loss risk, targeting ~100 net order after current coverage.
