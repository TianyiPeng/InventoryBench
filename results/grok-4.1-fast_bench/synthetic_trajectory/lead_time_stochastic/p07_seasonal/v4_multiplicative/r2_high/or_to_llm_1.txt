Thus, P46 order (140u) arrives during Period 49 (before demand), P47 order (140u) arrives during Period 50.

Effective pipeline ~280u (P46+P47 140u each), sufficient for remaining periods. Demand analysis: Historical volatile regimes (high ~109 P38-P46, low ~50-70 dips); recent P46-P48: 102/31/62 avg=65 (down from 109 but volatile, not sustained shift <3 periods).
