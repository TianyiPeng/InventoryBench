Promised LT=2, but recent evidence supports LT=3 with variability and lost risks. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=1304 (massively inflated by confirmed ghosts e.g. ~754+ prior losses like P37(100), P46 likely adding; actual reliable pipeline low, mainly P47(150) expected soon). Demand analysis: Recent P46-49 demands=55,0,111,83 (avg~62, down -46% from P40-45 avg117); P47=0 outlier but sustained lower over 4 periods after prior high shift; earlier P31-39 avg96, P21-30 avg96 stable; no calendar/dates for seasonality, chips regular snack demand volatile but recent low trend with stockouts (P48 partial, P49 full). OR rec=0 uses promised LT=2, full history (diluted mean), ignores ghosts/LT shifts/highlights pipeline excess. Strategy: Follow OR=0 conservatively - even discounting ghosts 50% leaves ~650 units pipeline (covers 4-6 periods at 100+ or 10+ at recent 62); profit=holding=1 balances risk of adding to ghosts vs stockouts; P47 likely arrives P50 covering immediate; monitor P51 for confirmation before increasing.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - in-transit 1304 units (despite ~750+ ghosts) vastly exceeds expected 4-period demand (~250-400 at 60-100 avg), covering recent stockouts and low demand trend (P46-49 avg 62); P47 order (150) expected soon at LT=3.",
