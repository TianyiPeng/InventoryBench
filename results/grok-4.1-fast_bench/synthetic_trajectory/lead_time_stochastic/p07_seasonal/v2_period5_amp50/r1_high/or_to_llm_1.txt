{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: From history and carry-over, LT remains variable (1-3 periods) with high loss rate (8+ confirmed lost shipments: P2,6,17,18,30,37,42,44); recent examples include P42 LT=3 (arr P45), P43 LT=2 (arr P45), P44 lost (no arr by P47); P49 conclude shows arrived=0, consistent with losses but no new sustained LT shift (variability <3 periods evidence). Treat all 2764 in-transit as unreliable junk (per carry-over). Inventory analysis: On-hand=0 after P49 stockout (demand=86, sold=0); multiple recent stockouts (P44, P48-49 partial, full in P49). Demand analysis: Full history (49 periods) mean ~95-100 (early ~102, recent P40-49: 62+184+113+44+63+114+148+137+67+86=1018/10=101.8); volatile (lows ~20-60, highs 180+) but stable mean, no regime shift or seasonality (no calendar/product cues). OR rec=0 likely due to ignoring losses and high nominal pipeline vs base-stock; uses promised L=2, historical mean/std for base-stock ~300-400 minus pipeline= negative, capped 0. Strategy: Override OR entirely - ignore junk pipeline/on-hand=0 requires order-up to cover (L_max+1)=4 periods demand: 4x102=408; target 400 conservative (matches recent orders, below uncapped base ~442 with q=19/20=0.95, z=1.645, \u03c3~50, \u03c3\u0302~86). Avoid overordering to limit holding if arrivals surprise.",
