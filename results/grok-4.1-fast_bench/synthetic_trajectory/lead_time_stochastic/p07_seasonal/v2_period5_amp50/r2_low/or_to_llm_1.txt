No arrivals in P38-P42 concludes (5 periods straight), meaning orders from P36+ (post-P36 arrivals) have not materialized, confirming ongoing losses for recent pipeline despite 1578 in-transit reported. Effective pipeline near 0; treat in-transit as unreliable ghosts (cumulative lost ~1200+ units historically).

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows LT=1-3 with frequent losses (e.g., P44-P45 lost per insights, no arrivals P46-P49 concludes extending streak to 4 periods); effective pipeline ~0 despite 1778 reported (cumulative lost ~1500+ units). Recent successes (P41 LT=3 arr P44, P42 LT=3 arr P45, P43 LT=2 arr P45) but selective losses persist. Inventory analysis: On-hand=100 covers ~1 period at recent avg demand ~94 (P40-49: 118,147,87,87,94,51,104,95,90,66; mean=93.9, std~35). No reliable in-transit arrivals expected soon. Demand outlook: Stable ~90-110/period, no seasonality (no dates/product context beyond chips regular), no sustained regime shift vs historical ~100 avg. OR recommendation: 0 units - valid under its assumptions (promised LT=2, full history mean/std, bloated pipeline reduces order_raw to <=0), but ignores losses and actual LT variability. Adjustment: Override to 200 units to build base stock ~300 (3x recent mean ~282 + light safety), covering LT+1=3-4 periods minus on-hand 100; matches prior successful order sizes during uncertainty.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 200 units - effective in-transit ~0 due to persistent losses (no arrivals P46-P49), on-hand 100 covers only ~1 period of demand ~95; order replenishes for LT=3 outlook.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Period 50: No arrival in P49 conclude extends no-arrival streak to P46-P49 (4 consecutive periods), confirming ongoing selective loss pattern post P41-43 successes.",
  "action": {

}
Carry-over insight: Period 50: No arrival in P49 conclude extends no-arrival streak to P46-P49 (4 consecutive periods), confirming ongoing selective loss pattern post P41-43 successes.
