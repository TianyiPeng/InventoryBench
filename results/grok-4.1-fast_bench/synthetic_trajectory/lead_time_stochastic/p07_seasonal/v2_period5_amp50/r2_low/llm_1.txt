(c) Lead time: recent mix 1-2 periods (P31 LT1, P32 LT1, P34 LT2, P35 LT2, P36 LT1); P37 order 150 (placed P37) not arr P38 (rules out LT1), likely LT2 arr P39; P38 order 150 likely LT1 arr P39 or LT2 P40; older in-transit includes lost (e.g. P29:150 lost per insight); no new LT shift sustained. (d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand 69 (low, risks stockout if demand>69 & low arrivals); in-transit 1180 mostly accumulated lost shipments (unreliable, ghosts); effective pipeline ~300 (P37 150 exp P39 LT2, P38 150 exp P39/40 LT1/2) likely arrives soon per recent pattern.
