Inventory analysis: On-hand 260 sufficient for P49 (~95-100 expected from recent P46-48 avg 96, P45 51 outlier) and P50 (~100), projecting ~160 post-P49, ~60 ending (holding cost $60 low vs profit risk). Demand stable ~90-100 recently (P45-48: 51,104,95,90 avg~85-96, no sustained shift from historical ~102; volatility normalized post P35-37 spike). OR recommendation: 0 units aligns with high on-hand relative to (1+L=3) period forecast under base-stock (likely sees ample pipeline/OH). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - no override needed as inventory covers remaining periods without stockout risk or excessive ordering into unreliable supply; avoids adding to lost pipeline.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 0 units - on-hand 260 covers expected remaining demand (~100/period for P49-P50) with buffer, amid ongoing supply losses and breakdowns; minimizes risk of further lost orders.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=2, but history shows variable LT (recent P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2 in P45 arrival); no arrivals P46-P49 (4 consecutive zero-arrival periods post P45), confirming ongoing supply breakdown with many prior losses (e.g., P44:300, P45:300 overdue past LT=3-4, likely lost); in-transit 2615 inflated ~2000+ lost historical units (per carry-over), true pipeline near-zero beyond on-hand 194. Inventory analysis: On-hand 194 sufficient for ~2 periods at recent demand avg ~89 (P46-49:104,95,90,66), but stockouts risk high with unreliable supply (frequent zeros post sporadic arrivals). Demand analysis: Stable recent avg ~90-96 (P38-49 excl spikes), no sustained shift vs historical ~102; no calendar/product seasonality cues. OR recommendation: 0 units, valid under its assumption of reliable pipeline using promised LT=2 and full history, but ignores confirmed losses/breakdowns inflating pipeline view. Strategy: Override OR's 0 with 300 units to target base-stock ~400 (4 periods demand at 100 mean, LT~3 inference), covering current P50 + LT periods minus on-hand; conservative vs losses by matching recent successful order sizes (300), minimizing holding risk if arrives sporadically.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 0 to 300 units - inflated in-transit hides ~2000+ lost units (true pipeline depleted), on-hand 194 covers only ~2 periods at 90 avg demand; order replenishes for LT~3 amid supply breakdown.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Supply breakdown extended: no arrivals P46-P49 (4 consecutive zero-arrival periods post P45); recent demand P46-49 avg 89 stable (no shift vs prior ~96).",
