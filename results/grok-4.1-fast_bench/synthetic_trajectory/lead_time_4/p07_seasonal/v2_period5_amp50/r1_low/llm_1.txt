(c) Lead time: Confirmed consistently 4 periods across all arrivals (latest P39: P35 order); no losses/missing; P40 arrived=0 as expected (no order due P36). Pipeline exact: 120 each from P37/P38/P39/P40 orders arriving P41/P42/P43/P44. (d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand 172 + in-transit 480 (120x4) =652 units (~6.5 periods at 100/period); post-P44 projection (assum. 100/period demand): ending inv builds to ~290+ by P44, ample buffer vs. volatility/stockouts (e.g., P32). 10 periods left (P41-50), future orders cover P45-50. (e) Order logic: Replenish conservatively at ~forecast (100) to maintain pipeline amid building inv/holding risk, matching recent orders/service during spikes; avoids excess end-game holding while covering LT+1 (~500 demand).",
