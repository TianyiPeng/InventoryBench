{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed consistently as 4 periods across all concluded arrivals (e.g., P45\u2192P49, P46\u2192P50 all show 'lead_time was 4 periods'); no lost shipments observed, matches promised. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=96, in-transit=400 (P46 order=200 arriving P50, P47=0 arriving P51, P48=0 arriving P52, P49=200 arriving P53). This creates coverage gaps in P51-P52 (low arrivals post-P50's 200), risking stockouts despite high total pipeline; post-P53 position strengthens. Demand analysis: Ultra-high regime sustained per carry-over (P41-45 avg179; recent P46-49:172,222,157,157 avg177, stable ~175-180/period vs early avg51). No calendar/dates for seasonality, but chips demand fits high consistent pattern. Expected 5-period demand (1+4 lead): ~875-900. Current IP=496 covers ~2.8 periods at 175/period, but timing gaps warrant caution; post-gaps, need replenishment for P54+. OR recommendation: 199 units (base-stock using full history mean/std, promised L=4, capped). OR underweights recency slightly (equal history weighting), but close to recent needs. Strategy: Follow OR's 199 as strong baseline aligned with high service (q=19/20=0.95 fractile); minor rounding not needed, avoids overordering amid current IP and holding costs while covering P54 after gaps.",
