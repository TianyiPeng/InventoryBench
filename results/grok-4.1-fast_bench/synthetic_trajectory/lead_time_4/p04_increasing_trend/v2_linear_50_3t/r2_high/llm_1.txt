Volatile but stable around 50; no sustained regime shift (e.g., no 3+ periods of clear trend). (c) Promised lead time=4 periods. No 'conclude' messages yet (Period 1), so cannot infer actual lead time or losses; assume promised. (d) On-hand=0, in-transit=0.

Initial order covers arrival in P5 + buffer for lead time uncertainty/variance: 6 periods * 50 = 300 units. Builds ~1 period safety post-arrival (low holding cost favors service level).
