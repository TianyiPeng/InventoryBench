{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 4 periods across all recent concluded periods (e.g., P49: arrived 1000 from P45, 49-45=4; P48:950 from P44; P47:900 from P43; no deviations or lost shipments observed). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0; in-transit=1050 (P46 order, arrives during P50); next arrivals P51=0 (P47 order), P52=0 (P48), P53=0 (P49)\u2014major dry spell post-P50, risking stockouts in P51-P53 despite P50 coverage of ~1050 vs. expected demand ~1160. Demand analysis: Sustained upward trend confirmed in carry-over; recent P46-49: 930,986,1036,1104 (avg 1014, +7% over prior P44-48 avg 943); linear increase ~58/period (P47+56, P48+50, P49+68), projecting P50~1160, P51~1220, P52~1280, P53~1340, P54~1400. OR recommendation: 858 units (lagging due to full-history averaging, ignoring recent regime shift and pipeline gaps). Strategy: Override OR upward to 1150\u2014targets projected P54 demand ~1400 conservatively (high service q=4/5=0.8 favors avoiding stockouts > holding cost); replenishes pipeline for post-P50 gaps; aligns with trend-adjusted base-stock ~5*1100=5500 total coverage minus current pipeline ~1050.",
