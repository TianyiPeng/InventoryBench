Pipeline covers only P50 (1100 units arriving this period after decision); P47-49 orders=0, so P51-P53 have no scheduled arrivals. Demand analysis: Strong upward trend confirmed by carry-over (P47-49 demands:957,1043,1097; recent 4-period avg~1016, up ~11% from prior P44-46 avg916). OR recommendation=867 based on full historical mean (lagging due to equal-weighting early low demands ~100 vs recent ~1000+), assumes infinite horizon with promised LT=4. However, this is final Period 50/50; order placed now arrives P54 (post-game), remains in-transit indefinitely (no sales, no holding cost). Recent P47-49 orders=0 reflect same logic (post-end arrivals useless). Expected P50 demand ~1100+ covered by incoming 1100. Strategy: Override OR to 0 - no benefit from ordering, avoids bloating irrelevant in-transit.",
