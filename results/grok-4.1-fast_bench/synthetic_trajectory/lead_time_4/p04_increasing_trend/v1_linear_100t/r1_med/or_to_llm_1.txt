Demand analysis: Historical samples: P1=107, P2=252, P3=298, P4=376, P5=544. Strong upward trend evident (increasing each period). Overall mean \u03bc\u0304=315, \u03c3\u0304\u2248159. Recent P3-P5 mean=406 (+29% vs overall), P5=544 signals higher regime. No calendar dates or product seasonality cues provided; chips(Regular) demand appears ramping (possible launch/promotion). 4.

OR assumes i.i.d. demand with promised LT=4, full-history mean (ignores trend), yielding uncapped base-stock ~1876 but capped low. 5.
