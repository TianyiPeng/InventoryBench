{
  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates provided, so no major retail events or seasonal drivers identifiable; chips(Regular) is standard snack with no inherent seasonality without dates. Demand has evolved from low hundreds to high plateau ~4400+ over periods, likely due to unspecified growth factors. (b) Demand regime stable high plateau per Period 48 insight (P44-P47 avg 4437, low variance); P48=4822 (+8% vs avg) is single-period uptick, not sustained shift (needs 3+ periods). Forecast ~4500-4800 for P49 based on recent stability. (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods across all historical arrivals (latest P41 order arrived P45, etc.); no in-transit or overdue/missing orders (in-transit=0). (d) On-hand=30944 covers ~6-7 periods at forecast 4500-4800/period; pipeline empty. High inventory from prior over-ordering/0-order cycles, but no immediate stockout risk. (e) Order 0: Prioritize depleting excess inventory to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period = profit margin); covers P49-P55+ demand; re-assess in future if demand breaks higher.",

(c) Lead time consistently 4 periods across all recent arrivals (e.g., P45 arrive from P41, P44 from P40, etc.); no in-transit or overdue/lost orders.
