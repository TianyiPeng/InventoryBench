OR recommendation: 207 (implied base=555, mu_bar~111 from full history including surge; capped near their single-period 95% upper=~207). Adjustment: Scale OR for recent mu (101/111~0.91 ratio) to 207*0.91=188\u2248190; conservative vs raw 264 given cap logic and sustained low regime to avoid overstock while ensuring coverage. Final strategy: Order 190 to target ~538 position (covers 5*101 + safety), balancing high service vs low holding.",
