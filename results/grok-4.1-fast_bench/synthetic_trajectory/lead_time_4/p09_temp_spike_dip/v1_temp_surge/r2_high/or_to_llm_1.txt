  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed as 4 periods consistently (latest: P49 arrive=135 from P45; P48=140 from P44; no lost shipments).

Projected depletion: P50 end~176, P51~76, P52~-24 (stockout risk ~24 units). Total pipeline 470 vs 5-period demand ~500-515. OR recommendation 193 aligns with base-stock to replenish low near-term pipeline and cover safety/variability, preventing future gaps post-P53. No calendar/product seasonality shifts.
