Stable regime around 100-110 with fluctuations but no sustained shift (variance consistent, no regime change confirmed over 3+ periods).\n(c) Lead-time vs. missing orders: Confirmed actual lead time=4 periods consistently across all arrivals (e.g., P11\u2192P15, P10\u2192P14, etc.; latest P11 order arrived P15). No lost orders; all past orders concluded as expected.

Order 110 to rebuild buffer against recent higher demands (117,119,104), prevent stockouts in P20+, match pipeline steady-state while addressing downward ending inventory trend; balances lost profit vs. holding cost.",
