No in-transit (0 units), no overdue/missing orders (all past orders concluded). (d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand 692 (high), covers ~8 periods at 90/period forecast (692/90\u22487.7). Pipeline empty. Projected: after 4 periods ~692-360=332 (> safety ~200), 8 periods ~692-720=-28 (risky if spikes). (e) Final order logic: Ample cover exceeds lead time +1 (5 periods ~450) + safety (200), total ~650 threshold. Holding cost $1/unit low vs. $19 profit, but deplete toward safety before heavy replenishment to minimize cumulative holding over 36 remaining periods (P15/50). Order 0; monitor depletion and reorder ~P20 when projected cover < lead time + safety.",
