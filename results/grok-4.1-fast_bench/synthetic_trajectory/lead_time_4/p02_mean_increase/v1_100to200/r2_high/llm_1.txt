Volatile but no sustained shifts (early high ~130 avg P1-2, later ~83 avg P3-5; insufficient evidence for regime change). Forecast next periods: ~102/period. (c) Lead time: Promised 4 periods; no 'conclude' messages yet, so actual LT unknown, no overdue/missing orders. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0; IP=0. Period 1 demand will stock out. (e) Final order logic: High profit ($19/unit) vs low holding ($1/unit/period) favors high service level. Use base-stock policy: S \u2248 \u03bc(L+1) + safety = 102*5 + ~100 (for volatility) \u2248 610. First order fills empty pipeline to ~S; place 500 (conservative round to start ramp-up, adjust future based on observations).",
