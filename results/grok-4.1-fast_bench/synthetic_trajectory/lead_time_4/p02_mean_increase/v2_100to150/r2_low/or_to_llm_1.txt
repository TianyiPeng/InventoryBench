Demand analysis: Carry-over confirms sustained high-demand regime P16-48 avg=144 (+40% vs P1-15 avg=103), high volatility \u03c3\u224850; P49 demand=166 fits pattern; recent P46-49 avg=(172+159+142+166)/4=159.75 (11% above regime avg, within 1\u03c3); full historical avg diluted lower ~130, but regime shift dominates forecasting\u2014expect ~150-160/period. OR recommendation: 188 units (capped base-stock policy using promised L=4 and full-history \u03bc\u0304\u2248130, \u03c3\u0304; low IP triggers higher order-up-to but capped near single-period \u03bc\u0302 + safety ~144+1.645*\u03c3/\u221a5\u2248181). Adjustment strategy: Slight override to 200 (+6%) to reflect recent demand strength (160 avg), rebuild depleted pipeline (post-P50 IP drops to near-zero for 3 periods), target coverage for 5 periods (L+1=5) at ~750 total IP (current 163 +200=363 progress); balances stockout risk (profit=1) vs holding=1 with high vol, conservative vs uncapped ~557.",
