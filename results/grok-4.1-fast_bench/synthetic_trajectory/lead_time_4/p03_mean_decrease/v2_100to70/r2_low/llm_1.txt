(b) Demand regime: Confirmed downward shift to ~73 avg P21-P35 per carry-over; recent P36-P42 (74,88,53,79,72,81,31) avg 68 (sum 478/7p, -7% vs prior regime), but P42=31 appears anomalous low; maintain forecast ~70/period conservatively blending regimes, high variance (30-90). No new sustained shift (small sample post-P35). (c) Lead time consistently 4 periods (latest P42 arrival from P38; P41 from P37, etc.); no missing/lost orders (all past orders concluded); in-transit 225 = P40(75)+P41(75)+P42(75), P39(0).

Projection at 70d/order=70: ends build to ~167 (P46), then stable ~167 w/ continued 70 orders; risk stockout if no orders post-P42. (e) Order 70 to match recent avg demand, replenish pipeline for P47 arrival avoiding late stockouts (critical w/ 8 periods left), balance service vs holding (symmetric costs); conservative vs high inv.",
