Demand analysis: Recent P44-P49 demands (115,73,114,84,110,95) avg 98.5 (+12% vs overall hist ~88), stabilizing higher than early periods with low-med volatility (range 73-115, std~15 vs prior spikes 160+); aligns with carry-over P44-P48 avg99 (+13%), post prior upward/downward shifts. OR recommendation: 145 units (capped base-stock using full hist mean~88, L=4 promised; cap~mean + single-period safety). Strategy: Override upward slightly to 160 (+10% vs OR) to account for sustained recent demand ~99 (+12-13%), empty pipeline, low on-hand, and reduced volatility (less safety buffer needed than OR's full-hist); covers base-stock ~99*5=495 + modest safety ~100 =595, order=595-57=538 capped conservatively to avoid overhold; 160 arrives P54 for future coverage while respecting OR cap logic.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 145 to 160 units - recent P44-P49 demand avg 98.5 (+12% vs hist 88), stable higher regime with low volatility; lead time confirmed 4 periods, empty pipeline requires proactive replenishment.",
