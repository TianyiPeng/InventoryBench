(b) Demand regime analysis: Historical samples show avg 86 units/period (84,55,79,85,126 across Periods 1-5); moderate variance, recent uptick to 126 suggests possible growth but not yet sustained; forecast ~90 units/period initially. (c) Lead time: Promised 4 periods; no concluded periods yet, so no inference on actual LT or losses possible. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; fully exposed to stockout in Period 1 (demand after decision). No pipeline fill. (e) Final order logic: Order to initiate pipeline covering ~5 periods (L+1) of forecast demand (5*90=450), but conservatively start at 100 to test supplier while minimizing initial hold risk given low history; adjust next periods based on realizations. High profit ($19) vs low hold ($1) favors building coverage early.",
