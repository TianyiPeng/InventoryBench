{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed consistently as 4 periods across all concluded periods, including latest P49 arrival=140 from P45 order (lead_time=4), P48 from P44, P47 from P43, etc.; no evidence of losses or drifts, all orders conclude on schedule. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=74, in-transit=140 (solely P46 order=140 arriving during P50); post-P50 arrival expected ~214 pre-demand, then 0 arrivals P51-P53 (P47-49 orders=0), risking stockouts if demand ~120/period. Demand analysis: Recent P40-49 demands avg=123 (109,132,120,166,132,129,140,76,128,98), aligning with sustained high regime P37-44 avg133.5 (carry-over); P47-49 avg~101 volatile (\u03c3~21) not a sustained low shift (lacks low \u03c3~5-10 of prior lows, only 3 periods). Historical regimes cycle high~130-140/low~90, no calendar/seasonality cues. OR recommendation: 160 units, based on promised LT=4 and full history (likely \u03bc\u0304~110-120); computes base_stock ~ \u03bc\u0302(5 periods)+safety ~600+100=700, current position=214 implies order-up ~486 uncapped but capped at ~160 (single-period cap \u03bc/5 +1.645\u03c3/\u221a5). Strategy: Follow OR exactly - replenishes pipeline post-thin period, covers ~5 periods demand at 120-130 mean with safety; no override needed as regimes stable high-ish, LT reliable, no anomalies.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 160 units - recent 10-period demand avg 123 aligns with high regime, lead time confirmed 4 periods consistently, and thin pipeline after P50 arrival requires replenishment to avoid stockouts.",
