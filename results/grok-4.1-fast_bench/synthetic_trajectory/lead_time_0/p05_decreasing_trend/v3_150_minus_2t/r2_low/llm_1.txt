No new regime shift confirmed. (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 48 periods (every order arrives same period, no missing shipments). (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=6 (low), in-transit=0; no overdue orders. Starting inv for P49=6 + order (LT=0 arrival before demand). (e) Final order logic: Forecast P49 demand ~73 (last 10 avg, recent trend); order = forecast - on-hand =73-6=67; round up to 70 for safety/volatility (std high) balancing stockout risk (lost profit $1) vs holdover to P50 ($1/period); conservative for final periods to cover ~P49+P50 without excess ending inv post-P50.",
