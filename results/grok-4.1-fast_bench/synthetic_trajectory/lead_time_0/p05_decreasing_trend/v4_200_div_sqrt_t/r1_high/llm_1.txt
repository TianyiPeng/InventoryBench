  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates or specific product description beyond 'chips(Regular)'; regular vending chips with no evident seasonal drivers from world knowledge. (b) Demand regime stable around 25-30 units post-P44 rebound (P41-48 avg=26.6; recent P44-48: 32,37,11,18,28 avg=25.2), high variance (std~10) with lows ~11 and highs ~42, no new sustained shift (recent 5 periods mixed, not 3+ consistent). Historical regimes per carry-over align with low/declining but recent rebound. Forecast P49 ~27. (c) Lead time confirmed 0 periods consistently (all concludes show 'lead_time was 0 periods', latest P48 order arrived same period); no in-transit or overdue/missing orders. (d) On-hand=21 covers low demand (~11-21) but risks stockout on average (~27); pipeline empty. (e) Order 25 to cover expected ~27 + safety buffer for variance/high (total avail=46, expect sold~27 ending~19 to carry to P50); balances lost profit risk ($19/unit) vs low holding ($1/unit); conservative near end-game (/50) but prioritizes sales.",
