(b) Demand regimes per carry-over: long-term declines to low ~30-60s with rebounds/spikes (e.g., P39-P41 avg67 high, but P43-P46:50,67,34,29 avg45 mixed volatile ~40-50 recent mean, no new sustained shift). Last 5 avg41, last 10 avg48; forecast P47 ~45 with high variance (~20 std). (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 46 periods (every conclude confirms 'lead_time was 0 periods'); no in-transit, no lost orders. (d) On-hand=39 (P46 ending), in-transit=0; covers ~1 low-demand period but risks stockout on mean/upside. (e) Order 50 for P47: total available=89 (covers forecast 45 + 2x variance buffer to ~85); prioritizes sales (profit$4>>hold$1), low end-of-game holding risk with 4 periods left and reactive lead=0.",
