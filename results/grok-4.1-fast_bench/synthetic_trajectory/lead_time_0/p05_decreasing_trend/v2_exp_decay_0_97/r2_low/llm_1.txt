(c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 47 concluded periods (every order arrives same period, no missing/lost shipments). (d) On-hand: 0; in-transit: 0; no pipeline, starting P48 from 0 before order arrival. (e) With lead time 0, order covers P48 demand directly; forecast ~47-50 based on recent regime, add safety ~10 for volatility/upside risk (e.g., P47=76 stockout lost 29 units); order 60 balances lost sales (profit $1/unit) vs. holding risk ($1/unit/period, 3 periods left); avoids repeat of P47 underorder.",
