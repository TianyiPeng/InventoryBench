Forecast P16 ~150 (recent mean + buffer for variance). (c) Lead_time vs. missing orders: Consistently 0 periods across all 15 periods (every 'arrived=ordered on same Period, lead_time was 0'); no drifts or losses observed. (d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no pipeline coverage. P15 ended at 0 after demand=163 met exactly starting inventory. (e) Final order logic: L=0 so order arrives same period before demand. Order expected demand + safety (recent avg145 +15 buffer for stockout risk; profit$4 > holding$1). Avoid P15-like near-stockout; 160 balances service vs. low holding cost.",
