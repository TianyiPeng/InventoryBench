{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed as 0 periods across all 49 concluded periods (every arrival message states 'lead_time was 0 periods'), no lost shipments, in-transit=0. Inventory position: on-hand=79 + in-transit=0 =79, which is high relative to recent demand. Demand analysis: Carry-overs confirm sustained downward shifts to P42-P47 avg 30.7 (high volatility sd~29); P48=40, P49=25 maintains low volatile regime (P42-P49 avg=31.1, sd~24.4; P47-P49 avg=24). Full history mean higher (~90-100 implied by OR), but recent 8 periods clearly lower/volatile. No calendar/dates for seasonality; chips regular demand follows observed downward trend. OR recommendation: 77 units, likely targeting base-stock ~79(OH)+77=156 using full-history mean (ignores recent regime shift). Strategy: Override to 0 units - current OH=79 covers expected demand ~25-35 + ample safety buffer (recent max=77<79, prior spike P41=107 outlier); ordering more risks excess holding ($1/unit) on post-demand ending inventory with profit ($4) only if demand exceeds 79 (low prob); draw down high inventory given sustained low demand.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 77 to 0 units - recent P42-P49 demand avg 31.1 (sd~24, sustained low volatile per carry-overs), on-hand 79 already covers expected ~25-35 + safety (recent max 77<79), avoids excess holding costs.",
