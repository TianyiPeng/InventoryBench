(c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all history (every order arrives same period with explicit confirmation); no in-transit or lost orders. (d) On-hand 37 (covers ~1.5 periods at forecast), in-transit 0; pipeline empty, no overdue arrivals. (e) With lead time 0, order arrives before P48 demand; 37 covers base forecast ~25-30 but vulnerable to spikes (e.g., past 51-53); order 30 to replenish for expected demand + safety buffer (~10 for vol), minimizing stockout risk (lost $4 profit) vs. holding ($1/period), suitable for endgame (3 periods left) to cover P48 and carry modest inventory.",
