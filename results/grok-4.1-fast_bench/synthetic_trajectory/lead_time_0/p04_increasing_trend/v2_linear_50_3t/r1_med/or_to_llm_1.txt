{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed consistently 0 periods across all 49 concluded periods (every order arrives same period with 'lead_time was 0 periods'), no lost shipments, in-transit=0. Inventory analysis: On-hand=170, pipeline=0, total position=170 entering Period 50 (before order arrival). Demand analysis: Sustained high demand regime per carry-over (P42-48 avg 185, P49=157 still +211% vs P1-10 avg 50.6); recent P42-49 avg ~181 with high volatility (range 157-223, sd~25), repeated stockouts/near-stockouts when under-buffered. No calendar/product seasonality cues. OR recommendation: 0 units, as base-stock (using full-history mean ~80-90 pulled down by early low demands) <=170 position, ignores recent regime shift. Strategy: Override OR upwards to 200 (consistent with recent overrides P43-49), targeting position=370 to cover mu~180 + safety~40 (z~0.84*sd~25 scaled for risk) + buffer for upward trend/volatility; expects ending ~190 (holding cost $190 vs potential stockout loss 4*30units=$120+), optimal given q=4/5=0.8 fractile favoring overstock.",
