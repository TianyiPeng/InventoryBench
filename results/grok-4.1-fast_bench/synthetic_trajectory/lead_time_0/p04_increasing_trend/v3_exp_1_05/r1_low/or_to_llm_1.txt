Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Consistently 0 periods across all 49 concluded periods (every order arrives same period, e.g., P49: arrived=1100 ordered on P49). No lost shipments or drifts. Current inventory: on-hand=10, in-transit=0, so no pipeline to cover future. Demand analysis: Extreme sustained acceleration per carry-over insights, with P49=1104 (new extreme), P48=1036, P47=986, P46=930; last 4 avg=1014 (+7% vs P44-P48 avg 943), increases of +50/+68/+56 confirm continued surge (fits P47-P49 avg 1042 vs P44-P46 avg 898 +16%). Full history early lows (P1-P5 avg~99) irrelevant; OR's 383 reflects outdated full-history mean/std, ignoring regime shift. No calendar/product info for seasonality. Strategy: With L=0, order covers exact P50 demand + safety buffer (critical fractile=0.5, but trend/volatility warrants +5-10% buffer vs point forecast to avoid stockouts like recent near-misses P48/P49). Point forecast: 1104 + ~60 (avg recent delta) =1164; target starting inv=1210 (order=1200) for ~4% buffer given holding=profit.",

  "carry_over_insight": "Demand surge further intensified P47-P49: avg 1042 vs P44-P46 avg 898 (+16%), three consecutive periods >=986 with increases +50/+68 confirming acceleration; near-stockouts P48/P49 (end inv 14/10)",
