Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods consistently across all 49 concluded periods (every order arrived same period as placed, e.g., P49 order arrived in P49 conclude). No lost shipments or delays observed; in-transit=0. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no incoming supply for P50 except today's order (which arrives before demand due to L=0). Demand analysis: Sustained high-demand regime with upward acceleration per carry-over insights; recent history shows P43=4046, P44=4388, P45=4407, P46=4466, P47=4468, P48=4822, P49=5048 (last 7-period avg\u22484521, last 3-period avg=4779 (+4% vs P46-P48 avg=4585), P49 +5% vs P48). Trend continues upward with high variance and frequent stockouts (e.g., P49 stockout of 48 units). No calendar/product seasonality provided, but numerical trend dominates. OR recommendation: 2270 units severely underestimates due to equal-weighting of full 49-period history (early demands P1=134, P2=225 etc. dilute recent mean>>4500); OR's \u03bc\u0302 low as it ignores recency/regime shift. Strategy: Override OR upwards to target expected demand ~5100 (extrapolating +5-7% trend from P49) + safety stock ~100 for variance/upside risk (critical fractile=0.5 implies modest safety, but stockout costs lost profit=holding, prioritize coverage given trend). Final order=5200 ensures coverage for P50 demand while minimizing ending inventory risk (holding=profit).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR's 2270 to 5200 units - OR underestimates recent high-demand regime (P47-P49 avg=4779, P49=5048) due to early low demands diluting historical mean; order targets ~5100 expected + safety to prevent stockout continuation.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand upward trend sustained into P49: P47-P49 avg=4779 (+4% vs P46-P48 avg=4585); high regime persists with stockout in P49",
