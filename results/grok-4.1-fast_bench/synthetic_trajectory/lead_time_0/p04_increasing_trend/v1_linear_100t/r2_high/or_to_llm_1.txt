Demand analysis: Sustained upward regime shift from P3-P23 (21 periods), with recent P21-P23 avg=2194 (P21=2126, P22=2270, P23=2186; +2.4% from P20-P22 avg=2143); P23 slight dip (-3.8% from P22) but within volatility, no regime reversal; 4-period avg P20-P23=2154 supports continued high demand ~2200-2300 expected for P24. OR recommendation: 2010 units (uses full historical mean including low early periods P1-P2 ~156 avg, underestimating current regime by ~10-15%); with L=0 assumed correctly but ignores recency/upward acceleration.
