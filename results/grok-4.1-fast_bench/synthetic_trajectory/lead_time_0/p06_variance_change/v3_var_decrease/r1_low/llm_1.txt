Forecast ~95-100 for P47. (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all concluded periods (latest P46: ordered P46 arrived P46); no in-transit or overdue orders. (d) On-hand=37 (covers ~0.4 periods at 95 exp), in-transit=0; low stock risks stockout this period. (e) With LT=0, order arrives P47 pre-demand.
