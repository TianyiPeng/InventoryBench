Demand analysis: Full history mean implied by OR ~92 (since L=0, base stock \u2248 \u03bc + z*\u03c3 with q=0.5). Recent P42-P46 demands: 93,93,60,68,113 (avg=85.4, std~20); carry-over notes drop to ~78 avg P42-P45 (-27% from prior), but P46 spike to 113 indicates volatility/rebound, with stockout loss of 24 units in P46. No calendar/product seasonality cues (generic chips, no dates). OR recommendation: 97 units (reasonable baseline using all 46 samples, promised L=0). Strategy: Slight override up to 100 to buffer volatility and recent high (113), avoiding stockout while minimizing endgame holding (3 periods left, profit=holding=1).
