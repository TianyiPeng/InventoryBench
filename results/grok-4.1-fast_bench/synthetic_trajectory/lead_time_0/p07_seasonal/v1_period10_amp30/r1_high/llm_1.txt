(e) Target availability ~160 (89 on-hand +71 order) to cover forecast 90 + safety buffer for volatility/upside (historical max ~140 recent); balances high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1), minimizes stockout risk over remaining 5 periods.",

Longer P41-47 avg~89 suggests ~75 expected with volatility (SD~25). (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 47 concluded periods (every order arrives same period); no in-transit or lost orders. (d) On-hand=69 covers ~1 period expected demand; no pipeline, so decision fully controls P48 availability; ending inv from P48 carries to P49/P50 (2 periods holding exposure).
