{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: All concluded periods (P1-P49) confirm actual lead time = 0 periods, matching promised; no lost shipments as every order arrives same period. Inventory status: On-hand=30, in-transit=0; low stock risks stockout this period if demand exceeds 30. Demand analysis: Full history shows regime shifts per carry-overs, latest P43-47 mean=84.8 \u03c3=19.3 (decreased vol); extending to P40-49 (10 periods): demands [115,115,133,114,90,84,73,63,51,85], mean=92.3, \u03c3\u224827.5 (volatile with spikes); P48-49 [51,85] shows rebound but not sustained shift (only 2 periods). No calendar/product info for seasonality. OR rec=115 uses promised L=0 and full history (likely higher long-term \u03bc), yielding base-stock ~145 (\u03bc\u0302=92-100? + z\u03c3~25-40), capped order=115 after subtracting pipeline~30. Strategy: Follow OR as it balances recent \u03bc~92 + safety for \u03c3~27 (z*1.645\u03c3~45, total ~137) against holding cost; post-arrival inventory=145 covers expected demand 92 + buffer for spikes (hist max 157), minimizing stockout risk (19 profit loss >>1 holding). No override needed.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 115 units - matches recent 10-period mean ~92 plus safety stock for volatility \u03c3~27; low on-hand 30 necessitates coverage for potential spikes like historical 130+.",
