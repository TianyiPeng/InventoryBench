(c) Lead_time vs. missing orders: Consistently 0 periods across all 46 concluded periods (every arrival: 'lead_time was 0 periods'); no in-transit or overdue orders; reliable same-period delivery. (d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand 45, in-transit 0; post-order available =45 + order quantity; covers current period demand before P47 conclude visible next. (e) Final order logic: Myopic newsvendor optimal (cu=1, co=1) targets median demand ~100-110; volatile regime suggests order up to ~125 available (mean 103 + safety for sd~30); 80 ensures 125 coverage vs. recent highs (154 max) while limiting end-game excess (4 periods left, low stockout risk prioritized as sales = profit).",
