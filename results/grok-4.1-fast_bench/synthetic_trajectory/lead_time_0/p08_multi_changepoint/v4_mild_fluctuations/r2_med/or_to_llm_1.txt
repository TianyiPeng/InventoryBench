  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods consistently across all 49 concluded periods (e.g., P49 conclude: arrived=130 from P49 order, lead_time=0; no lost shipments or delays observed). Inventory status: On-hand=50, in-transit=0; no pipeline, low starting position after P49 ending=50 (demand=80 low). Demand analysis: Full history shows early P1-10 avg~79, elevated P11-37 avg~110 (+37%), softening P38-44 avg86 (-22%), reversal P45-49 avg103 (+20% vs softening) with highs 116/124/102, stockouts P45/48, and isolated low P49=80 (consistent with prior isolated lows like P22=59/P26=91). Carry-overs confirm sustained elevated regime post-softening. OR recommendation=70 uses promised L=0 and full historical mean (likely ~95), targeting base_stock~120 (50+70), but underestimates recent elevated mean/volatility (std high, highs>140 historically). Strategy: Override OR upwards to 100 (total starting inv=150) for (L+1)=1 period coverage: expected demand~105 + safety z*\u03c3~45 (for q=0.8 fractile, recent \u03c3~20) = ~150, reducing stockout risk on highs while limiting holding (ending expected ~45 if demand=105).",
