Inventory analysis: On-hand=16, in-transit=0, so inventory position=16; low stock risks stockout this period. Demand analysis: Long-term historical avg ~94 (per OR), recent P40-47 demands (119,101,112,72,105,80,80,99) avg=96, median~100 (sorted:72,80,80,99,101,101,105,112,119); stable around 95-100 post-P39 recovery (carry-over P36-38 avg107), no new regime shift; no calendar dates for seasonality. OR recommendation: 78 units sets IP=16+78=94 (~historical mean, newsvendor optimal at median since q=0.5, z*=0); aligns well, but slight bump to 84 targets recent median 100 for better coverage near endgame (period 48/50), minimizing expected underage/overage (profit=holding=1).
