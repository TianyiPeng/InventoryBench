Demand shows sustained high regime since P16 (avg ~280, varying 228-388). (b) Demand regime stable high: last 10 periods (P40-49) avg 280, consistent with carry-over shift (+167% from early ~106); no new sustained shift (P48's 228 is outlier, not 3+ periods). (c) Lead time confirmed 0 periods consistently across all 49 periods (every conclude shows arrival same period as order); no in-transit or overdue orders. (d) On-hand 94 (low vs. ~280 demand), in-transit 0; total available post-order must cover P50 demand. (e) Forecast P50 demand ~280 (recent avg); target starting inv ~374 (94 + 280 order) for ~94 ending if demand=280 (matches recent endings, balances low holding risk vs. stockout loss; safety implicit in target as profit $19 >> holding $1).",
