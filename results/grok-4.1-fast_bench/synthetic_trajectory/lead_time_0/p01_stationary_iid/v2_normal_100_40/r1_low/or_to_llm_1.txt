No in-transit or lost shipments; all orders arrive same period. Inventory analysis: On-hand=0, in-transit=0 entering P47, so order will arrive during P47 to cover P47 demand directly; ending inventory incurs holding cost but with only 4 periods left (47-50), prioritize avoiding stockouts (profit=1 matches holding=1). Demand analysis: Full history volatile (early avg ~90, but carry-over notes regime shift post-P11 to ~115 avg); recent 10 periods (P37-46) avg=107 (sum=1068), last 5 (P42-46)=122 (611/5); frequent high demands (125,141,144) exceed 100+. No calendar/seasonality (generic Period_N dates, chips neutral). OR recommendation: 94 units (likely using full-history mean ~94, promised L=0, but underweights recent high regime). Strategy: Override OR upward to target recent demand mean + safety for volatility/endgame stockout risk; order 120 covers ~122 expected with buffer (z~0.5-1 for fractile 0.5, high var).
