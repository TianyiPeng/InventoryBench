(c) Lead time: Confirmed 0 periods consistently across all 49 periods (every order arrives same period, e.g., P49: ordered P49 arrived P49); no in-transit or losses. (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 42 (from P49 end), in-transit 0; P50 order arrives during P50 before demand, so total available =42 + order.
