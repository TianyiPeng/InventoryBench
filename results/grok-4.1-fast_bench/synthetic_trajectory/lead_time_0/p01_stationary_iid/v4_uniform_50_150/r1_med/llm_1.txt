{
  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates provided beyond period numbers, so no major events or seasonality identifiable; chips(Regular) is a standard snack with historically variable demand (50-150 units, no product-specific drivers). (b) Demand stable with no sustained regime shifts (recent 10 periods avg 106, full history fluctuates around 100-110; isolated lows like P47=53, P44=56 not sustained over 3+ periods). (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 47 concluded periods (every order arrives same period, no in-transit or lost orders). (d) On-hand=81 (from P47 end), in-transit=0; order for P48 arrives immediately, boosting start inv before demand. With 3 periods left (48-50), current stock covers ~0.7 periods at avg demand. (e) Forecast P48 demand ~110 (recent avg, conservative); target ~140 start inv (81 + order 60) for high service level (minimize stockouts worth 4 profit loss) vs low holding (1/unit/period, max ~3 periods left); overstock risk low as 4>3*1.",
