{

(b) Demand regime: Stable long-term mean ~100 units/period across 49 periods (early sample avg ~94, full history 50-147 range, recent 10 periods avg 97, last 5 avg 87); high variance persists with no sustained shift (fluctuations not regime change). (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 49 periods (every order arrives same period as placed, no delays or losses). (d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 40 (low), in-transit 0 (no pipeline); Period 49 ending 40 after demand=93 confirms no issues.
