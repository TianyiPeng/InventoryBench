{
  "rationale": "(a) No calendar dates provided beyond generic Period_X; chips(Regular) is a standard snack with steady but volatile demand, no strong seasonal drivers evident. (b) Demand highly variable (50-140 range), long-term mean ~95 (last 10 periods avg 93.9, last 5 avg 96.8); early dip P5-7 (~55) not sustained (P8+ reverts to ~90-100), no new regime shift confirmed over 3+ periods. (c) Lead time consistently 0 periods across all 47 concluded periods (every arrival matches 'ordered on Period X, lead_time was 0'); no in-transit or overdue orders. (d) On-hand=18, in-transit=0; post-order arrival (LT=0) will set starting inventory=18+order before P48 demand. (e) Forecast P48 demand ~95-100 (recent avg + volatility); order 100 covers expected + buffer for spikes (e.g., recent 128), prioritizes avoiding stockout loss ($4 profit) over holding ($1/period, <3 periods left).",

(b) Demand volatile but long-term mean ~95-100 (e.g., full history avg ~95; recent 10 periods P39-48 avg 99.7; brief P5-7 dip to 55 not sustained as P8+ rebounded to norm). (c) Lead time confirmed 0 periods consistently across all 48 concluded periods (every arrival same-period); no in-transit or overdue orders. (d) On-hand=11 (low), in-transit=0; post-order arrival in P49 will boost to 111 if order 100, sufficient for demand before P49 demand hits. (e) Forecast P49 demand ~100; order 100 to target high service (cover demand + ~11 buffer carry to P50 start), balancing profit vs. low holding ($1); avoids stockout loss ($4 opp.); conservative for penultimate period.",
