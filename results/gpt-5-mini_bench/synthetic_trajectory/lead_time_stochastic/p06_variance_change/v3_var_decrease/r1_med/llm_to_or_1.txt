Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples available (58,163,41,0,12). No concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand stats to let OR backend compute base-stock with high service target (profit/total=0.8). Methods: L default (promised=2), mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This provides a balanced forecast and lets the OR engine cap orders appropriately given uncertainty.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Use promised lead time and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history. This balances service level (pipeline covers upcoming periods) versus holding cost given current in-transit stock.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Promised lead time=2; concluded history contains no explicit arrived-on-period statements to confirm a lead-time change, and current in-transit=250 may include P1/P2 orders that have not yet concluded. Use default methods to let OR backend apply promised L=2 and demand stats from all samples: mean demand=54.8 so (1+L)*mean=164.4; use default volatility scaling. This balances service (covering 3 periods of demand) vs holding cost given moderate demand variability and unconfirmed delays.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=269 (orders: P1=162, P2=88, P3=19). Three consecutive concluded periods (P1,P2,P3) show those orders did not arrive when promised (arrived=0), suggesting actual lead time > promised 2 or systemic delays. To be conservative I set lead time L explicitly to 3 periods so the OR backend plans for a longer pipeline. Demand history (Periods 1-5: 58,163,41,0,12) shows no sustained recent regime shift; use default demand sizing so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed from all samples with the chosen L. This increases cover for the extra lead time while keeping demand forecast anchored to full-sample statistics, balancing service level vs holding cost given the high in-transit uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time likely >2: orders placed P1(162), P2(88), P3(19) all showed arrived=0 in their conclude messages (3 consecutive missing arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $724.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=161. History shows mixed actual lead times (P1\u2192arrived at P4: 3 periods; P3\u2192arrived at P4: 1 period) and one outstanding order (P2) still unarrived. To balance service vs holding cost given variable/uncertain lead time, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (lets backend average observed values). I use default demand/volatility methods so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine's capped policy size orders while accounting for the inferred lead time and the current pipeline (in-transit=161). This keeps orders responsive to observed lead-time variability without overcommitting inventory given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=349. History shows mixed lead times (observed arrivals: P1->P4 lead_time=3, P3->P4 lead_time=1) and P2/P5 remain unarrived => shipments overdue/variable. I choose L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (captures variable lead time from concludes). Demand uses default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to smooth across limited data; sigma_hat=default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (raising target stock when lead time appears > promised) while keeping holding cost considered by the OR engine.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent demand samples = [58,163,41,0,12]; on-hand=0, in-transit=402 (several outstanding orders placed earlier; some arrivals delayed). Concluded history shows an order placed P1 arrived in P4 with lead_time=3, and P3 arrival had lead_time=1; several later orders (P5,P6) remain unarrived. I set L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the confirmed 3-period lag while accounting for the 1-period event). For demand I chose 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) (robust to limited data and reflects full review+lead demand). For volatility I chose 'default' so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). These choices balance raising target inventory to cover longer observed lead time while using all samples to avoid overreacting to recent low spikes.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: order placed Period 1 arrived in Period 4 \u2192 lead_time = 3; earlier missing arrivals across P1\u2013P3 indicated delays).

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent realized demands (P3\u2013P7 = 71,198,26,35,93) show elevated and variable demand with a spike at P4 but no sustained new low; on-hand=0, in-transit=329. Lead time has been confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: P1 order arrived in P4). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the most recent demand regime (P3\u2013P7) so the OR engine sizes base-stock for (1+L)=4 review+lead periods and captures recent volatility. Given in-transit=329 vs. 4-period recent mean demand (~4*84.6=338), this choice balances service level (accounting for the P4 spike) against holding cost while letting the OR cap limit order size if needed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-53.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=161, in-transit=267. Historic conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 (order P1 arrived in P4; consistent delays P1\u2013P3). Use explicit L=3 to reflect confirmed lead time so pipeline coverage and ordering cadence match true arrival delays. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures overall demand uncertainty while the larger L raises required pipeline to preserve service level vs. holding cost trade-off). This addresses earlier missing arrivals by aligning lead-time assumption with observed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-112.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 10. On-hand=252, in-transit=141. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead time observations (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) with occasional 1-period anomalies; inventory and arrivals are consistent with actual lead time = 3. Demand history (Periods 1\u20139) mean \u224871.9 units/period. I therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed slower deliveries and avoid under-ordering. mu_hat using default lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (conservative, uses full history) yielding about 4\xd771.9\u2248287.6 forecast over review+lead. sigma_hat default uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L) to capture observed demand variability (~2\xd7std). These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts given confirmed L=3) while allowing the OR engine to cap orders via its cap rule; they also account for current healthy on-hand + in-transit positions to limit immediate ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-37.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 3 (Period1 order arrived Period4; multiple 3-period arrivals observed). Current inventory: on-hand=209, in-transit=141 (total pipeline=350) which provides ~4-period coverage. To account for confirmed longer lead time and use full-sample demand signal, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine plans for the longer pipeline. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full historical samples; this balances service level against holding cost given ample current pipeline.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concludes confirm actual lead time > promised with multiple 3-period arrivals; I set L explicitly to 3. Demand has been volatile with a large recent spike (Period 11 = 238) so I base forecasts on the most recent regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current demand level and volatility (last 5 periods) so the OR engine orders for a 4-period coverage (1+L) while reflecting recent higher demand and variance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed recent concluded arrivals show a dominant lead time of 3 periods (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8 observations). On-hand is 0 with 375 in-transit (some arrivals pending). To protect service given confirmed longer lead times, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimators (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this balances service level against holding cost without overfitting to short noisy swings.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=439. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 (e.g., P1 order arrived in P4) and multiple earlier multi-period delays; use explicit L=3 to reflect observed reality. Demand recent window shows a higher recent mean (periods 9\u201313 include large demands at P11\u2013P13), so use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest regime. This increases target base-stock to cover (1+L)=4 periods of recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. With Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, this balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) versus holding cost. Note pipeline(439) is sizable\u2014OR engine will cap orders accordingly.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=621. Historical conclues show confirmed lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders with W=3). Demand rose starting Period_11 (238,161,121,117) \u2014 I detect a regime shift at Period_11. To service higher recent demand while limiting holding cost, I set L explicitly to 3 (use confirmed lead time) and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts over the review+lead horizon using the four most recent post-changepoint demands. This prioritizes service during the sustained higher-demand regime while letting sigma reflect recent volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=137, in-transit=499. Historical concludes show multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15) with occasional 1-period anomalies, indicating actual lead time > promised. I set L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed ~3-period reality). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the inferred lead time and observed demand variability. This also accounts for large in-transit volume (499) when computing order quantity.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. History shows sustained 3-period lead time (multiple orders placed in P1\u2013P3/P4\u2013P7/P12\u2013P16 concluded with lead_time=3); on-hand=102, in-transit=435 so pipeline is large. Use explicit L=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level with holding cost given high pipeline and confirmed longer lead time.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=173, in-transit=252. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed arrivals with lead_time=3 (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) and occasional 1-period arrivals; average observed lead time \u22482.56. To capture realized delays I request the backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). For demand forecast and volatility I use all available samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine leverages full history while the calculated L lets it size pipeline to cover the longer realized lead time and balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_19. Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 3 (multiple concluded arrivals: orders P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P11\u2192P14). On-hand=88, in-transit=252. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the sustained lead-time regime. Demand has stabilized in recent periods (Periods 14\u201318 mean \u2248101.8); to focus the forecast on the current regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the most relevant samples. This raises target base-stock to cover 4 periods of demand under the longer lead time and reduces stockout risk given delayed arrivals, while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability for safety stock calibration.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 3 (orders repeatedly arrived after 3 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=341 (covers some upcoming demand but arrivals are delayed by 3). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time and avoid under-ordering. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 15\u201319 demands: 96,99,112,85,100) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; this balances service level (captures recent higher variability) against holding cost given long lead time and current pipeline.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=0, in-transit=410. Historical concluded arrivals show confirmed lead_time=3 (orders placed P1 arrived P4; multiple 3-period arrivals thereafter). Several earlier promised-2 shipments were delayed/lost, so set L explicitly to 3. Recent demand (Periods 16-20 = 99,112,85,100,138) shows a higher mean than earlier periods; to capture the current regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect the latest demand level and variability. This balances service (higher base stock for observed higher demand with L=3) against holding cost by limiting history to recent samples rather than all-time high-variance data.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) \u2014 actual lead time confirmed as 3. Several earlier promised arrivals were delayed/lost but pattern since Period_4 is sustained. To ensure pipeline covers the longer real lead time and avoid stockouts given high demand volatility, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap using full sample history while accounting for the longer lead time.

Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show high variability; pipeline is currently large so avoid aggressive replenishment. I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

With L=3 I use default demand aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps forecasting grounded in full-sample demand while the explicit L=3 accounts for observed longer lead time and prevents underordering given the large in-transit volume and service-cost tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=3 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P12\u2192P15, etc.). Several early periods had delayed/no arrivals but lead_time=3 is now confirmed and recurring. To ensure pipeline covers review+lead demand, I set L explicit=3. For demand forecast and uncertainty I use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit/holding. No new demand regime detected requiring recent_N or EWMA adjustments.

Given confirmed LT=3, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend sizes orders to cover the longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this leverages all historical demand while accounting for the longer review+lead period. This balances service (avoid stockouts with large in-transit and confirmed LT=3) against holding cost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:

Several early promised arrivals were delayed or missed but later concluded with 3-period lag, so treat lead time as 3. I set L explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to provision for the longer realized pipeline delay. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the larger review+lead window reflect the confirmed longer lead time and balance service level vs holding costs given profit/holding ratio.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: recent demand (Periods 25\u201329) averaged ~79.2 units/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=445 units (covers multiple future periods). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time ~3 periods; therefore set L explicit=3. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (mean demand ~79.2 \u2192 (1+L)*mean covers 4 periods of demand). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time and substantial pipeline inventory to avoid over-ordering.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple orders with lead_time=3) with occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals; several earlier long delays produced large in-transit pipeline. To reflect observed variability in actual lead time I request the backend compute the average observed lead time from conclude history (method=calculate). For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this leverages full sample history given no sustained recent demand regime change and balances service level vs holding cost while the backend applies the capped ordering cap.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historical conclude messages show lead time consistently \u22483 (many orders placed arrived 3 periods later). Reconcile: large in-transit balance likely arriving under the longer lead time. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend uses empirical average (captures confirmed 3-period reality). Demand has risen recently (last 5 periods: 76,90,84,102,134 \u2192 mean \u224897); to respond to this regime shift I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecast and volatility reflect the latest demand pattern and balance service level vs holding cost given the longer empirical lead time.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed lead_time=3 observations (orders placed P1->arrived P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P11->P14, P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23) with occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals. I set L using 'calculate' so the backend averages observed lead times (captures the sustained shift toward 3). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses all demand samples times (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) scaling; this smooths demand estimates across the full history while the calculated L accounts for prolonged transit delays. This balances service (raising coverage for longer lead time) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: recent demand has been consistently ~100 units (last 5 periods: 84,102,134,80,100 -> mean \u2248100). On-hand=0, in-transit=445 (large pipeline). Historical conclues show actual lead time = 3 (confirmed: P1\u2192P4, multiple 3-period arrivals), so set L=3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime and recent volatility; with (1+L)=4 this targets stock for the next 4 periods around recent mean while sigma based on recent variability. This balances service (covering expected short-term demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

History shows persistent delayed arrivals with confirmed lead time = 3 periods (orders placed in P1 arrived in P4). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=445 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals are delayed. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time so the OR engine orders for the correct coverage window. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples given no recent sustained demand regime change; this balances service level (using confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost while leveraging the full historical demand sample set.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Recent demand has been consistently elevated over the last several periods (Periods 29\u201335: 84,102,134,80,100,69,108), and on-hand is 0 with 445 units in-transit. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 3 (orders placed in P1 arrived in P4 and multiple arrivals consistently show 3). I therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the last 7 demand observations to capture the current higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std respectively). This keeps the base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while the explicit longer lead time prevents under-ordering given the large in-transit volume and past delayed arrivals.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37: recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period_19 (many periods with ~80\u2013138 units) and multiple concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 3 repeatedly. On-hand=0, in-transit=445 (large pipeline). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let backend confirm the empiric average (evidence points to 3). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 (Periods 19\u201336 constitute a sustained higher-demand regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current regime rather than early low-volume samples. This balances service (capture higher mean and variability) while the backend cap will limit over-ordering given the large in-transit pipeline and holding cost.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality so the backend forecasts demand across the correct review+lead horizon. With large pipeline but zero on-hand, use default demand aggregation (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR engine applies its calibrated base-stock and cap using full history. This balances service (using observed L=3) against holding cost given current in-transit volume.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 (e.g., order P1 arrived P4). Many recent periods (P9\u2013P38) show stable nonzero demand ~70\u2013140. To ensure pipeline covers review+lead demand and account for confirmed longer lead time, set L explicit=3. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (last 10 periods) so forecasts respond to current mean/volatility while keeping safety stock calibrated to observed variability. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by sizing base stock from recent demand over (1+L) periods and matching sigma to recent volatility; using explicit L prevents under-ordering due to previously promised lower lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: order placed Period 1 arrived in Period 4; multiple subsequent arrivals consistent with L=3).

Period 40. History shows actual lead time confirmed at 3 periods (orders: P1\u2192P4, P?\u2192P? patterns). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=445 (large pipeline). To reflect confirmed L=3 I set L explicitly=3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this balances service level (using confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost while leveraging full historical demand estimates.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historical conclues show actual lead time = 3 (confirmed P1\u2192P4, P?\u2192P? pattern consistent). Several earlier periods with arrivals delayed/lost resolved; current pipeline large (445) but not yet visible on-hand. I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed lead time so the OR backend computes (1+L)-period demand correctly. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which balances service-level (using confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=445; historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=3 observed). Pipeline (445) implies substantial upcoming arrivals but they are not yet visible on-hand due to 1-period observation lag. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=3 (method: calculate). For demand forecast and volatility I use the defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples \u2014 this leverages full history given no recent sustained demand regime change and balances service level vs holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: recent history (Periods 23\u201342) shows sustained nonzero demand averaging ~mid-high double digits; on-hand=0 but large in-transit=445 suggesting multiple outstanding 3-period lead-time shipments. Concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 3 \u2192 use calculated lead time. To reflect current demand regime and reduce sensitivity to early low samples, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 20 periods (captures most recent demand behavior). These parameters ensure the OR backend targets a base stock sized for (1+L) periods of recent demand while accounting for observed volatility; using recent samples helps avoid under-ordering given long lead times and many in-transit units.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. On-hand=0, in-transit=445 \u2014 multiple concluded arrivals historically confirm actual lead time = 3 periods. Pipeline (445) is sizable but arrivals will occur with L=3 delay; we must tell OR backend the corrected lead time so it sizes review+lead demand properly. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available demand history, letting it balance service vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (orders from P1 arrived in P4 and repeated evidence). To capture the observed longer lead time and avoid stockouts, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting OR engine produce a base-stock that balances profit vs holding given updated L.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 46. On-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historical concludes show consistent arrivals with lead_time=3 (many P\u2192P+3 arrivals); demand since Period_9 has been steadily higher than initial samples. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let the backend use confirmed actual lead time data. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to base mu_hat on the most recent higher-demand regime (captures latest ~20 demand observations) and set sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (using recent higher mean and variance) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and confirmed longer lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: order placed P1 arrived P4; multiple subsequent arrivals consistent with L=3).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=445. History shows multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16, etc.), so treat actual lead time as 3. Pipeline (445) covers several periods of demand but we still must forecast demand over review+lead. Recent periods (P27\u2013P46) show a sustained regime of moderate-to-high demand (~70\u2013134); to capture current demand level I use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility to focus the base-stock on the most relevant recent regime. Explicit L=3 ensures the OR engine plans for the observed delayed arrivals; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances service level vs holding cost by basing safety stock on recent demand behavior rather than old zero-demand periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:

To account for confirmed longer lead time and overdue/lost shipment patterns, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend computes pipeline over the correct review+lead horizon.
