Pipeline (556) comfortably covers the 4-period coverage target (556 > 400) so placing additional order would only raise holding cost without increasing short-term sales. OR recommended 0 units (it uses promised lead time and historical samples); given confirmed L=3 and large in-transit pipeline, I concur with ordering 0 to avoid excess holding cost. Final strategy: place no order this period and monitor for any missing arrivals in subsequent conclude messages (if arrivals fail to materialize over promised + observed lead time windows, reassess and order).",
