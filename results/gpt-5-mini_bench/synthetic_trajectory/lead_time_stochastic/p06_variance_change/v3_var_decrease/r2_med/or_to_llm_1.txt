{
  "rationale": "Observed actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed repeatedly in concluded messages: e.g., orders P1\u2192arrived P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12). On-hand=0 and in-transit=448 units. Recent demand history (Periods 23\u201349) averages ~100 units/period, so (L+1)=4 periods of demand \u2248400 units; current pipeline (448) already covers ~4.5 periods. Ordering now would increase ending inventory and incur $1 holding cost per unit while marginal profit is $4 only when sold.
