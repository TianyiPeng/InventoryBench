Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time. Historical samples (5): mean=106.4 units/period, std\u224823.8. Promised lead time=2. Given no evidence of lead-time or demand regime shifts and symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1) use default methods so OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing service vs holding costs without overreacting to limited early data.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=296 (matches orders from P1+P2), no concluded arrivals yet so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised L=2. Historical demand samples mean=106.4 (n=5) and moderate variability. I use default lead time (promised) and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service level vs holding cost given no confirmed regime or lead-time change.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: three consecutive conclude messages (P1\u2013P3) show zero arrivals for orders placed earlier while in-transit=298, indicating shipments are delayed beyond the promised 2 periods. To protect service I explicitly lengthen lead time to 3. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples (uses full-sample mean 106.4 and std \u224823.75) which yields a larger review+lead forecast and safety given the longer L and missing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears >2: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not arrived by Period_4 conclude (3 periods overdue); possible sustained delay/lost shipments.

Daily Profit: $83.00, Daily Holding Cost: $70.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5: recent concludes show arrivals from Period 1 (arrived in P4, lead_time=3) and P3 (lead_time=1), indicating variable lead times; on-hand=70 and in-transit=227 (large pipeline). I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (uses concluded evidence) because actual lead time has deviated from promised at least once. For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (periods 1\u20135) \u2014 this balances service level from elevated pipeline uncertainty while avoiding overreacting to a single shifted arrival. This approach addresses missing/delayed shipments by letting calculated L reflect realized delays; keeping default demand estimates avoids overfitting to short-run noise.

Daily Profit: $65.00, Daily Holding Cost: $5.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start. On-hand=5, in-transit=305. History shows some delayed arrivals (P1 arrived with lead_time=3; P3 arrived with lead_time=1) and several outstanding orders (P2,P4,P5) still in-transit. Observed lead times average 2.0; given this and the promised lead time=2, set L to calculate so the backend uses observed lead-time info. Demand history is limited; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine compute a baseline base-stock while accounting for the inferred lead time. This balances service (capture delayed arrivals) versus holding cost given holding=profit, avoiding aggressive explicit uplifts.

Daily Profit: $5.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $5.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=359. Historical concluded arrivals show at least one order with lead_time=3 (Period1\u2192arrived in Period4) and several orders delayed/missing by their promised windows. To be conservative against further delayed/lost shipments I set lead time explicitly to 3. I use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine computes mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) with the chosen L; this raises protection stock for the longer effective pipeline while keeping demand estimation anchored to full history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=285. Historical concluded lead times: P1->P4=3, P3->P4=1, P4->P7=3 (avg \u22482.33). Multiple concluded 3-period arrivals indicate lead time longer than promised and some variability. I choose L by "calculate" so backend will average observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand scaling uses all samples across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead times) against holding cost while letting OR engine apply its capped policy.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period4; Period4 order arrived Period7)

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=285. Historical concluded lead times: observed = {3,1,3,3,1} \u2192 average \u22482.2, indicating actual lead time > promised 2 in many periods and occasional 3-period delays. Demand samples mean = (132+74+101+90+135)/5 = 106.4. To account for the demonstrated longer-than-promised lead times while letting the OR backend compute appropriate base-stock and caps using its priors, I choose to have the backend calculate the effective lead time from observed concludes (calculate) and use default demand aggregation methods so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances maintaining service given delayed arrivals while avoiding overcommitting explicit manual forecasts now that observed lead-time data are provided to the backend.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=0, in-transit=308. Historical concludes show multiple arrivals with W=3 (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) indicating actual lead time is now 3 periods despite promised=2; several short W=1 arrivals exist but the dominant sustained pattern is 3. To protect service given observed 3-period arrivals and possible lost/delayed earlier shipments, I set L explicitly to 3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all demand samples\u2014this is conservative (uses full history) because recent high demands (Periods 8\u20139) are not yet a sustained 3+ period regime. These settings increase pipeline cover for the longer observed lead time while letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=404. Historical demand samples (periods1-5) mean=106.4; recent conclude messages show multiple 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) confirming sustained lead-time stretches. Several orders remain delayed/absent (Period10 ordered=96 arrived=0). To protect service given observed 3-period realizations, set L explicitly to 3. Use mu_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean across all samples (captures baseline demand with the longer lead+review window). Use sigma_hat=default so backend scales historical variability by sqrt(1+L). This combination raises target pipeline to cover additional exposure from confirmed longer lead time while relying on historical demand stats to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=407; historical demand samples (Periods1-5) mean=106.4. Lead time history shows mixed but average observed lead time = 2 periods; many late arrivals earlier but recent arrivals include shorter leads. Pipeline (407) is large relative to expected (1+L)*mean, so no emergency top-up needed. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time (captures recent variability but not overreact to short-term noise). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'default' so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and the current large in-transit inventory.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_13. On-hand=71, in-transit=202. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12) with occasional 1\u20132 period outliers; this suggests actual lead time is longer than promised 2 and cluster mode=3. I choose L method 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand forecasting use default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to keep estimate robust given limited samples and mixed short spikes. Use default sigma to reflect overall observed variability. These choices bias the base-stock up to cover the longer inferred lead time while keeping variance estimation broad to avoid overfitting to short spikes. No new action on suspected lost shipments beyond using calculated L and defaults.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. On-hand=0, in-transit=309. Historical concluded lead times: [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2] \u2192 avg=2.125, indicating realized lead time > promised 2 with repeated 3-period arrivals. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time to account for delayed shipments. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine computes demand over (1+L) using all samples; this balances service level against holding cost given uncertain/longer lead times.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: recent demand (Periods 10\u201314 = 114,93,134,119,111; mean=114.2) and confirmed lead-time=3 (observed arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=379 \u2014 significant pipeline exists but actual lead time=3 requires planning over 1+L=4 periods. Set L explicitly=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime (mean demand ~114.2 \u2192 (1+L)*mean \u2248456.8) and recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices align base-stock with current demand and extended lead time, preventing under-ordering given delayed arrivals while the OR backend handles service/holding tradeoff.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=457. History shows repeated 3-period arrivals (multiple concluded lead_time=3) with occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals; overall observed average lead time > promised. Demand sample pool available (periods 1\u20135). I choose L method 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average from concludes (captures the prevailing ~3-period pattern). I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost using the inferred lead time while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise given limited demand samples. This addresses delayed/lost shipment signals by increasing the planning lead-time input to the OR engine.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: recent history shows repeated 3-period actual lead times (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=350 (large pipeline). Demand history mean ~100 (samples: 132,74,101,90,135). Given sustained actual LT=3, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses empirical average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost using full-sample demand stats while acknowledging longer lead time. This also avoids overreacting to recent spikes; large in-transit reduces urgency to inflate orders now.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=0, in-transit=306. Historical conclude messages show a sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple arrivals with lead_time=3). Many recent periods show high demand (Periods 13\u201317 demands = 119,111,66,115,118; recent mean \u2248105.8). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering from promised=2. I set mu_hat recent_N N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean over last 5 samples). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent demand variability. These choices ensure pipeline covers the longer confirmed lead time and the OR backend will compute base-stock and caps using recent demand statistics to balance service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_19. On-hand=0, in-transit=424 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages) show many 3-period arrivals with some 1\u20132; average observed lead time \u22482.55. Demand samples (132,74,101,90,135) mean=106.4. I choose L by calculating the average observed lead time to capture the persistent delay pattern. For demand and volatility I use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples \u2014 this balances service (covers longer effective lead time) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent multi-period delay pattern with many observed lead_times = 3 and some 1\u20132; average observed lead time is ~2.45. I select L by "calculate" so the backend uses the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (captures sustained longer lead time vs promised 2). With L set by calculation, I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all historical demand samples (uses all data to stabilize forecast given moderate sample size). This balances service (accounting for longer realized lead time) against holding cost while acknowledging substantial pipeline (424) already en route.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concludes show sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, etc.). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid under-ordering. Demand has varied recently; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (last 5 demand observations) so the base-stock and safety stock react to recent higher volatility and the large demand in P20 (150). This balances service (profit per unit = holding cost) by sizing order quantities to recent mean demand over review+lead and to recent variability, while the explicit L accounts for delayed arrivals and prevents stockouts from an underestimated lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. On-hand=0, in-transit=424. Concluded history shows frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple orders with lead_time=3) and occasional shorter arrivals; average observed lead time > promised 2. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period behavior). Demand forecast uses default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default sigma (all-sample std scaled) to let OR engine compute base-stock while accounting for the longer inferred lead time; this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_23. On-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concluded arrivals show predominant lead_time=3 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17), so I treat actual lead time as 3 to ensure pipeline covers delayed arrivals. Demand historical samples (provided) mean=106.4; with L=3 the default forecast across review+lead is (1+L)\xd7mean. I choose default methods so the OR backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service level given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) while accounting for the longer observed lead time. Flag: large in-transit (424) likely contains outstanding 3-period shipments; monitor for missing arrivals but no new sustained changepoint since prior confirmation of L=3.

Context: On-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders with 3-period arrivals). To account for confirmed longer lead time and to let the OR engine compute demand across the review+lead window, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all five demand samples (captures full-sample mean/volatility and scales safety stock for 4-period coverage). This addresses missing/late shipments by explicitly reflecting the observed lead time in ordering calculations.

Period 25: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical conclude messages (Period4 & Period8) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (orders from P1\u2192P4 and P4\u2192P7). Several multi-period gaps and delayed arrivals earlier justify treating lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. I use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand history (keeping forecasting simple given no clear recent demand regime change). This choice ensures orders account for the longer confirmed lead time while relying on backend demand estimates; with in-transit=424, the pipeline will be compared against the computed base-stock to avoid excess ordering despite past lost/delayed shipments.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: recent realized demands (Periods 22-26 = 41,56,150,83,167) show elevated and volatile demand with on-hand=0 and in-transit=424. Many past orders experienced 3-period arrivals, so I use L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime I set mu_hat recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples across review+lead). For volatility I set sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices align pipeline coverage to (1+L) periods of current demand, increase forecast responsiveness to the recent spike, and raise safety stock via sigma_hat to balance service vs holding cost given the long lead time and large in-transit position.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concludes show multiple observed lead times (1\u20133) with many 3-period arrivals; average observed lead time > promised. There have been 10 consecutive periods (P18\u2013P27) with zero arrivals despite in-transit=424, suggesting missing/lost shipments. I choose L.method=calculate so backend uses observed lead-time average; mu_hat.method=default and sigma_hat.method=default to let the backend scale demand mean/variance by the inferred (calculated) lead time. This balances higher lead-time risk (higher pipeline) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Missing/lost shipments suspected: Periods 18\u201327 had 10 consecutive periods with zero arrivals while in-transit remained (424 units) \u2014 sustained gap suggesting lost or extremely delayed shipments.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=29. On-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period actual lead time for multiple orders (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17) and long gaps of missing arrivals later (Periods 18\u201327). Given the confirmed shift to a 3-period actual lead time and the large in-transit backlog, set lead time L=3 explicitly so the OR backend sizes the review+lead demand window correctly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (this leverages full historical demand given no reliable recent regime change of demand mean/variance), letting the capped policy limit orders to avoid over-ordering while honoring longer lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=424 with many periods of zero arrivals since Period 18 \u2192 strong evidence of delayed/lost shipments but historical conclude messages show typical actual lead times around 3 (some 1\u20133). I set L using calculate so backend averages observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period pattern). Demand forecast and safety stock use default methods so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain/shifted lead times and avoids overfitting to the recent no-arrival anomaly. No explicit upward adjustment to mu_hat because demand history will be weighted by the chosen L by the backend.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=424. Recent demand (Periods 26\u201330) = [167, 52, 113, 188, 66] indicating high mean and volatility after prolonged stockout. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed at Periods 4 and 8) and multiple later missing arrivals suggesting some in-transit risk; therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time. Forecast (mu_hat) uses recent_N over last 5 demand periods to capture the post-stockout demand regime (N=5). Volatility (sigma_hat) uses recent_N N=5 to reflect observed high variance. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma_hat increases safety stock to reduce stockouts despite possible lost shipments; using recent data avoids diluting the forecast with older pre-change samples.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=469. History shows frequent actual lead times around 3 periods with some 1\u20132 period arrivals and many prolonged gaps (possible lost shipments). I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period tendency while reflecting variability). I select mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the OR engine set base-stock while using the inferred average lead time to account for delayed arrivals. This balances service vs holding cost given current large in-transit volume and lead-time uncertainty.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (many 3-period arrivals and some 1\u20132), plus long gaps of missing arrivals noted in carry-over. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20133 variability and confirmed 3-period episodes). For demand forecasting I use 'default' mu_hat and 'default' sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this is conservative given irregular arrivals and prevents overreacting to transient demand spikes while leveraging full sample history.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times = {3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,3,1} \u2192 avg \u22482.25. I choose L using 'calculate' to let backend estimate average observed lead time from concluded messages. Demand parameters use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this is conservative given noisy/mixed lead-time signals and missing shipments, letting OR engine balance service vs holding cost without overfitting recent noisy arrivals.

History shows multiple confirmed lead_time=3 observations (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7) and prolonged missing arrivals suggesting delays/losses; therefore set L by averaging observed lead times so OR uses realized delays. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost and large in-transit inventory. Flags: large in-transit (424) may represent overdue or lost shipments \u2014 parameters rely on observed lead-time average rather than promised 2.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 36: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed 1,2,3) and multiple prolonged gaps suggesting lost/delayed shipments; recent arrival at Period32 (lead_time=1) indicates variability persists. To let the OR engine infer a robust lead-time estimate from observed concludes, I select 'calculate' for L (average of observed lead times). For demand forecast use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because there is no sustained demand regime change\u2014historical samples (Periods 1\u20135) remain the best unbiased seed and recent demand has been noisy but not persistently shifted. These settings let the backend adjust base-stock while retaining conservative safety from observed lead-time variability and avoid overreacting to suspected lost shipments.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 37: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concludes show actual lead time frequently = 3 (multiple orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, etc.) and long gaps/missing arrivals earlier; therefore I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality rather than the promised 2. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history so forecasts scale with the inferred longer lead time. This balances service (longer coverage for 3-period pipeline) vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5) and large in-transit volume; if many in-transit units fail to conclude later, revise L down or mark shipments lost.

Period 38: on-hand=0, in-transit=424 (long-standing undelivered pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=3 in multiple episodes (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7). Many periods of zero arrivals after P18 suggest lost/delayed shipments but not a sustained new demand regime. To account for observed actual lead time I set L explicit=3 so the OR engine plans for the longer realized delivery lag. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses all demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this avoids overreacting to recent noisy zero-arrival periods while letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost given L=3.

I choose L by 'calculate' so the backend averages observed lead times (captures the ~2.25 signal rather than the promised 2). Demand mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding. This approach is conservative: it adapts lead time based on evidence while leaving demand estimation to the backend's full-sample default to avoid overfitting to recent noisy zeros.

Period_40: recent demand history (Periods 1\u201339) shows volatile weekly-like demand with many zero-arrival periods and on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Concluded arrivals historically indicate frequent 3-period lead times (multiple concluded messages showing lead_time=3) with occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals; recent long gap of non-conclusions suggests lost/delayed shipments but concluded history supports longer-than-promised lead time. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages all observed concluded lead times (captures dominant 3-period signal). For demand forecast I select mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this uses full historical demand data to balance service level vs holding cost given lead-time uncertainty and possible lost shipments. This conservative approach avoids overreacting to recent missing arrivals while letting OR engine inflate safety stock via calculated L.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=424 with many long gaps in arrivals (Periods18\u201340 mostly zero arrivals). Historical concluded lead-times include repeated 3-period arrivals (Periods1\u21924,4\u21927,9\u219212,13\u219216,14\u219217) supporting a 3-period actual lead time; some single-period arrivals occurred (e.g., Period31\u219232) but the dominant confirmed pattern is L=3. To be conservative vs. lost/delayed shipments, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend plans for a longer pipeline. Use default demand/volatility calculations so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples; this balances service level (higher pipeline) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. On-hand=0, in-transit=424; long history shows repeated 3-period lead times and multiple overdue/missing shipments (sustained gaps). I cannot rely on promised L=2 only. I choose L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures the frequent 3-period observations). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all historical samples (1+L scaling) to balance service vs holding given profit=holding cost. No aggressive explicit increases because missing arrivals suggest delivery risk rather than higher underlying demand.

Period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=424. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20133 periods with many 3s and some lost/delayed shipments; average observed lead time \u22482.25. To account for observed variability and intermittent long delays, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so OR uses empirical average. Demand history (samples provided) will be used by OR default formulas for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so forecasting leverages full sample set while the calculated L captures the longer effective lead time. No new sustained regime change beyond previously recorded lost/delay signals.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 44. On-hand=0, in-transit=424 with many prior delayed/lost arrivals. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period arrivals (Periods 1\u21924, 4\u21927, 9\u219212, 13\u219216, 14\u219217) so I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality. Demand has shifted higher recently; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime (Periods 39\u201343 demands: 184,156,186,90,124). This raises the (1+L)-period forecast and short-term volatility so the OR backend will raise base stock to protect service while capping orders per its cap rule, balancing profit vs holding cost given costly stockouts and existing large in-transit volume.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=592. Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times (many 3-period observations plus some 1\u20132), average observed lead time \u22482.18. Several long gaps and prior notes indicate possible lost/delayed shipments, but signal is not a new sustained change vs. recorded insights. I select L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed 3-period tendency). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this is conservative given noisy demand and shipment uncertainty and lets OR backend balance service level vs. holding cost without overcommitting inventory that may be lost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=592. Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) and other variability; actual lead time appears > promised 2. Use L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average (incorporates confirmed 3-period pattern). Demand statistics are noisy but no clear sustained recent demand regime change; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples \u2014 this raises target base-stock with the larger inferred L and balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost. This approach hedges against delayed/lost arrivals while avoiding overfitting short-term noise.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=592. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed samples: twelve concluded shipments with average lead time \u22482.25 periods) and several sustained missing-arrival episodes earlier; therefore I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (calculate). Demand currently has no clear recent regime shift vs. long-run history, so use default demand estimate and default volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies its capped base-stock policy while accounting for inferred lead time. This balances service level (by using calculated L) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and past lost-shipment risk.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. Recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 shown historically) are volatile; on-hand=0, in-transit=592 (large pipeline but many past delays/losses observed). Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) average ~2.25 periods, so use calculated average lead time to reflect realized delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine scale safety stock to the inferred lead time and balance profit vs holding cost given profit=holding. This approach accounts for confirmed variable lead times while letting historical demand statistics set forecast and volatility.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=592. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period lead times (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16) and long gaps of missing arrivals; treat actual lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering. Use L=explicit(3) so mu_hat/sigma_hat calculations cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) because no clear recent demand regime shift of 3+ periods is newly detected. This raises pipeline coverage to match observed arrivals and balances service vs holding given profit=holding (q=0.5).

Historical concluded arrivals show frequent actual lead_time=3 (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P13->P16, etc.), so average observed lead time will better reflect reality than the promised value. I choose L=calculate to let backend infer observed lead time from concluded history. Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 provided) and long history will be used by default formulas to produce mu_hat and sigma_hat scaled by (1+L) to cover review+lead period. This balances service (capturing longer observed lead time) vs holding cost given large in-transit inventory; defaults let the OR engine compute base_stock and apply its cap.
